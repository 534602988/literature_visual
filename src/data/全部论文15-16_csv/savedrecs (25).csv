Therefore, the paper presents the main characteristics of the sustainable mobility system and development conditions in Romania. From this perspective, an important part of the study will analyse the possibilities and requests of the development and modernization of multimodal transportation. Using analytical, comparative and descriptive methods, the working paper investigate the efficiency elements respecting the promotion of multimodal transportation compared to the road, rail or naval. Based on these researches, it is obvious that for supporting the sustainable mobility in Romania it is necessarily to develop the multimodal transportation. In this context, the study also presents the current situation and perspective of multimodal transportation in Romania. As a major conclusion, the Romania's economic policies, aiming to reduce the energetic consumptions, to rise the efficiency of goods and persons transportation within a better quality of transportation offer and to reduce the environmental negative effects due to transportation, will be positively and major influenced by achieving a sustainable mobility system.

Its multiplier effects show wide range of sectors that benefit from tourism. Whilst touting economic benefits of tourism, one has to be cautious because tourism activities involve economic costs as well. Additional costs can occur if planning, development and operations in tourism are not properly managed. Sustainable tourism lies at the core of destination stewardship. Destination managers need to be able to forecast economic, environmental and social trends affecting tourism. Thus, destination planning is crucial in balancing developments of tourism and controlling its growth. In this paper authors test various possible tourism scenarios on the total revenue generated from tourism for a 7-year projection period. Every scenario is based on destination planning. The case study destination used for scenario modelling was Labin-Rabac. The forecasts are based on three broad types of drivers: season extension outside the traditional July and August months, growth of accommodation capacity (number of bed places) and growth in the average tourists' expenditure. The methodology used for scenario analysis is: historical method, deductive method, analysis (particularly horizontal analysis of the income statement which provided information about tendencies and change dynamics on its positions), synthesis, and mathematical methods.","[Galant, Adriana; Golja, Tea] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Golja, T (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Pula, Croatia.",agalant@unipu.hr; tgolja@unipu.hr,"Galant, Adriana/R-9592-2019; Golja, Tea/AAT-6035-2021; Milic, Marko Kimi/J-6759-2016","Galant, Adriana/0000-0002-0129-8369; Golja, Tea/0000-0003-3665-8181; Milic, Marko Kimi/0000-0002-9449-0113",,,,,31,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-15880-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,157,170,,10.1007/978-3-319-15880-8_13,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3WD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360224400013,0

Using a computational approach that fully accounts for borrowers' heterogeneity, we show how the variety of bank customers changes and how this change affects the bank's cash influx, making it more volatile. The paper also sheds light on how the composition of the loan portfolio is affected by an increase in the policy interest rate when it is kept at low levels. Safer borrowers exit the loan portfolio first, causing a gradual increase in the loan portfolio risk. The interest payment influx shrinks because riskier borrowers repay less often. Furthermore, we find that a shortening of the lending time horizon increases the volatility clustering of the bank interest payment influx. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We estimate the extent to which interconnections increase expected losses and defaults under a wide range of shock distributions. In contrast to most work on financial networks, we assume only minimal information about network structure and rely instead on information about the individual institutions that are the nodes of the network. The key node-level quantities are asset size, leverage, and a financial connectivity measure given by the fraction of a financial institution's liabilities held by other financial institutions. We combine these measures to derive explicit bounds on the potential magnitude of network effects on contagion and loss amplification. Spillover effects are most significant when node sizes are heterogeneous and the originating node is highly leveraged and has high financial connectivity. Our results also highlight the importance of mechanisms that go beyond simple spillover effects to magnify shocks; these include bankruptcy costs, and mark-to-market losses resulting from credit quality deterioration or a loss of confidence. We illustrate the results with data on the European banking system. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Glasserman, Paul] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Young, B.

Matching REIT IPOs to comparable non-REIT IPOs, we also find evidence consistent with demand uncertainty. Specifically, after controlling for issue and firm characteristics, REITs post significantly lower secondary market returns despite similar primary market returns. This indicates that demand uncertainty resolves more quickly for REITs, possibly due to higher relative transparency.","[Gokkaya, Sinan] Ohio Univ, Athens, OH 45701 USA; [Highfield, Michael J.; Roskelley, Kenneth] Mississippi State Univ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Steele, Dennis F., Jr.] Southern Adventist Univ, Collegedale, TN 37315 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio University; Mississippi State University,"Gokkaya, S (通讯作者)，Ohio Univ, Athens, OH 45701 USA.",gokkaya@ohio.edu; m.highfield@msstate.edu; kdr149@msstate.edu; steele@southern.edu,,,,,,,50,10,12,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0896-5803,2691-1175,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

PuHI redistributes with respect to risk and income, and the market is affected by adverse selection. We argue that making PuHI voluntary does not lead to its collapse since individuals always participate in it. Additionally, in some cases, a voluntary PuHI scheme increases market efficiency because participation in it sends a signal to private insurers of an individual's health-risk type. The welfare consequences depend on the status quo. If in the status quo no political support exists for a compulsory PuHI, making it voluntary constitutes a Pareto improvement, and in some cases all individuals are strictly better off. If, instead, the status quo implements compulsory PuHI, making it voluntary then results in less redistribution.","INRA, GREMAQ, Toulouse Sch Econ, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; INRAE,"Goulao, C (通讯作者)，INRA, GREMAQ, Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France.",catarina.goulao@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2015,162.0,1-2,,,,,135,157,,10.1007/s11127-014-0207-x,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AW6ZK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346414000008,0

Development has a positive value, so that most people would agree with, and that is associated with a better world. A change can have good parts and bad parts, and because it is difficult to reach an agreement, this may be interpreted differently from various perspectives. Sustainable development can be called fair and balanced which means to grow indefinitely, it should keep a balance between different groups of people, and from one generation to another. The main objective of applying the concept of sustainable development is to improve the quality of life and to please people. This keeps the three major interrelated areas, economic, social and environmental. Therefore, sustainable development is defined as an opportunity for a chance to prosperity, within the scope of good governance. nd to reasonable to signify sustainable development as development that can last forever or at least for a long time, for several generations. The positive side is that sustainable development is increasing and lasts for a long time. Moreover, sustainable development is increasing in consumption according to the economic interpretations.

The dynamic and revitalized presence of non-European producers (e.g. Australia, Chile, South Africa, USA), who have seen their market shares rising rapidly and the subsequent reduction in the market shares of traditional European producers (e.g. France, Italy, Greece) alongside a slight decrease of wine consumption worldwide, have shaped new trends for wine markets internationally and contemporary challenges for the traditional European wine exporters. The aim of the present study is to investigate the determinants of the Greek wine exports and to assess its competitiveness in the European market. Primary data regarding wine trade has been collected for the period of 2004-2011, referring to four main European producer countries, namely Greece, France, Germany and Bulgaria. A gravity equation model has been estimated in order to examine the factors that determine wine exports and wine exports competitiveness among those countries. The results offer a clear picture of the wine trade dynamics in the EU market, indicating as key determinants for its competitiveness the size of each country's economy, the geographical distance from other EU countries, the presence of common borders or common language among trading nations as well as the size of per capita wine consumption to the European wine markets.

Consumption of dairy products by Slovak consumers is very low compared to other countries in European Union and the world what results in a negative impact on businesses in this sector. One of the main reasons is low demand of consumers. Therefore, it is important to study factors stimulating and influencing consumers when purchasing milk products in order to support their consumption as well as to study factors that prevent consumers in their purchasing and consumption in order to deal with them and eliminate them if possible. The aim of this paper is to analyze influence of selected psychological and personal factors on milk consumption and purchase.

Within systemic corruption there emerge parallel informal structures that interfere with the preparation of public contracts even before the public tender is officially announced. They prepare plans of large-scale public investments and still ahead of the official tender announcement decide upon who shall implement the given public contract, which firms will participate with subcontracts and how to split the prey. Following the official announcement of the tender, rigged formal phases of public procurement (pre-bidding, bidding, post-bidding) only secure the already agreed upon outcome of the public tender.","[Langr, Ivan; Ochrana, Frantisek] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Ctr Social & Econ Strategies, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague 11001 1, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Langr, I (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Ctr Social & Econ Strategies, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague 11001 1, Czech Republic.",ivan.langr@volny.cz; ochrana@fsv.cuni.cz,"Langr, Ivan/G-7449-2017; Ochrana, Frantisek/E-9765-2018","Langr, Ivan/0000-0003-0792-5666;",,,,,24,1,1,1,2,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA & PRAZE,PRAHA 3,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAHA 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2094-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,131,136,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5NF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389582500022,0

This changes have made the University system to be over and over reshaped and diversified. In one form or another, all educational systems of higher education have been influenced by the European educational system and perceived as a model. University system requires particular attention from the authorities, both in terms of finds and comprehensive strategy on medium and long term. For these reasons, in this paper, starting from the premises that they have similar origins, we present a study involving a comparative analysis between the average of a series of indicators at EU level, and the results reported by Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and not least Romania. From one country to another university system can suffer substantial changes. If a number of European countries provide a free university system, others are leading a policy of decentralization and encourage these institutions to rely more on off-budget funds. The Bologna process was designed to create a uniform European University system, based on the same principles and characteristics and to provide the same global perspective to graduates indifferent of their country of origin. This is still far from being realized and this due to the fact that it is very hard to reorganize a university system in just a few years. We intend to analyze the countries of Eastern and South-Eastern Europe because since the Second World War, they were under a strong Soviet influence, which made the University system to develop on the same principles, mainly in coordination with the needs arising from the labor market. The main feature of the Communist regimes in all this countries is that the whole system was centralized. In accordance with the needs of the State, a series of adjacent areas were developed. For this reason, universities could not implement long-term reforms and were to produce specialists in areas where the Communist Party estimated that there is a need in the future. Given the fact that these University systems relied on similar principles we intend to consider how they have developed after 1989, the reforms that have been implemented and what are the future prospects of this reforms.

Our paper explores under what conditions HGF matter for translating R&D investments into economic growth and how this depends on firm-specific and industry-specific factors. We use quantile regression techniques to study the R&D-growth relationship in HGF compared to low-growth firms. Unlike previous studies, we pay particular attention to whether this relationship depends on the particular period in the industry's life cycle. We focus on the US pharmaceutical industry from 1963 to 2002 and find that the R&D-growth relationship is sensitive to the changing competitive environment over the industry's history, which suggests that innovation policy must focus not only on firm attributes but also competitive structures.","[Mazzucato, Mariana] Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Parris, Stuart] Open Univ, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",University of Sussex; Open University - UK,"Mazzucato, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",m.mazzucato@sussex.ac.uk,"Mazzucato, Mariana/H-4456-2011","Mazzucato, Mariana/0000-0001-9183-5000",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F028180/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/F028180/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,81,47,56,2,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Having a full operating cycle is defined as a situation in which the small or medium enterprise has a stock of materials or raw materials, which then as a result of the technological process converts the finished products, offers them for sale through both cash sales and sales on the basis of the use of trade credit receivables. Used in this definition, full operating cycle consists of the conversion of inventories (including the time required to collect the materials and / or raw materials, processing them, and the time required storage of finished products before transfer) and the full period of collection of receivables. Research hypothesis is the belief that the currently observed in many companies operating in industries using full operating cycle, assessed by investigators as excessive cash reserves, are dependent on factors that give to describe the relationship between risk and uncertainty and the expected and realized under conditions of risk and uncertainty in the value added generated by enterprises with a full operating cycle. External factors resulting from the economic situation surrounding the company, interact with the operating cycle of the overall enterprise operational risk which is reflected in the level of cash held.

It includes the need for listed firms to practice sound governance and transparent reporting of financial information. These market disciplining apparatus are essentially economic centric public policies, developed and subsequently imposed on public listed firms premising on the maintained assumption that strong and sound governance structures would result in enhanced market discipline. This research paper reports empirical findings which form part of a larger research project on regulatory sanctions in Malaysia. Examining specific and conventional governance, ownership and firm specific elements comparatively between sanctioned and matched non-sanctioned firms between 2001 and 2008, we document prelude evidence questioning the validity of governance rules' maintained assumptions that strong and sound governance structures would at least, insulate firms from being sanctioned. The results further signify the entrenched culture of box-ticking among listed firms in Malaysia, whereby the problem practically forms large improvement void which are potentially detrimental to the Country's capital market stability if left unattended.

One of this particular aspects is the case of assurance provision in the case of integrated reporting. This paper intends to provide an insight in this topic, in the form of a literature review and point out the main actions which need to be taken to provide a clear perspective for auditing integrated reports. The main findings show that a high (or reasonable) level of assurance is difficult to obtain in the case of integrated reports because of the lack of audit regulations, the company specific trait of integrated reports and key performance indicators for non-financial information. Other issues that should be taken into consideration are the costs of such an audit (in monetary units and time), but also the issue of providing assurance for prospective information (future oriented). As a solution, collaboration between the IIRC and other standard setters (especially from the field of audit) is seen as the best way of overcoming the hindrances and providing coherent and effective audit methodologies that can that can be used in the case of integrated reports.

When analysing effect of the IFRS on country-by-country level, the researchers have to control somehow for the fact that IFRS are spread almost over all around the world. Except for some cases, all important world economies have already adopted the IFRS. However, the extent of adoption differs across countries. Some countries mandate the usage of IFRS only for consolidated financial statements of listed companies. Other countries extend the application also for individual financial statements or even for private companies. To make valid comparison among countries, a sophisticated model evaluating different level of the IFRS adoption has to be developed.

In Poland, the concept of responsible leadership began to appear only in times of political and economic transformation (after 1989), with the influx of foreign investment. In contrast to countries with about 100 years of experience in the implementation of the concept of responsible leadership, its Polish history is quite short. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how RL exists in a transitional country and region, and how RL contributes to Human Resource Management (HRM). A qualitative and quantitative methodology was used to summarize the research among entrepreneurs and businesses. Exploring the construct of social responsibility orientation among entrepreneurs, we show that executives in these businesses hold different beliefs about their responsibilities toward different stakeholders, with concomitant implications for their understanding and enactment of responsible leadership.

Poultry was found to be a statistically significant substitute for pork and other meat (sheep, goat, and offal), but insignificant with respect to beef. Pork tends to be complementary to beef, though statistically insignificant. The article investigates which of three crucial factors are most affecting South Africa meat imports: (1) changes in consumer tastes and/or meat processing technology, (2) prices, or (3) scales indicating the total size of the imported meat market. Major findings showed that changes in taste-technology had a greater impact on increasing poultry and pork imports than changes in prices, even though poultry prices tended to increase less than the prices of beef, pork, and other meats, making it a better bargain.","[Taha, Fawzi A.] USDA, Food Secur & Dev Branch, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20024 USA; [Hahn, William F.] USDA, Anim Prod & Cost Prod, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Taha, FA (通讯作者)，USDA, Food Secur & Dev Branch, Econ Res Serv, 355 E St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",faha@ers.usda.gov; whahn@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,29,2,2,0,6,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Risk management function in banks has evolved significantly in current times: from an independent unit assessing risk to a credit culture that needs to be taking into consideration by all. The notion of risk has moved beyond the traditional measures like credit, market, and operational to corporate governance risk, fraud risk, reputation risk, etc. New banking products developed on the Internet platforms provides benefits to the consumer in terms of convenience, and to the banking in terms of cost reduction.

It is the so called financial trilemma. Since decisions, processes and financing are given over to a centralised European level the new pillars could break the trilemma. The Single Resolution Fund which is part of the resolution mechanism will be a mutual fund that ensures the effectiveness of bank resolution within the euro zone. In other words, the fund is common. If any of the banks in the euro zone is close to the bankruptcy, this fund can be used for resolution. The fund must be uploaded by the banks operating in a euro zone member state based on the level of the covered deposits. In its publication the European Commission stated that the target level of the Single Resolution Fund is EUR 55 billion which must be reached by end of 2024.

Furthermore, it has touched producers from practically all existent industries. Consequently, uncertainty and huge risk in the financial sector (volatile of currency, risk investments) probably could cause stagnation in markets at least in short time perspective. The main purpose of this scientific paper is to examine the impact of Russian and Ukraine geopolitical crisis and the following Russian economic embargo on the CEE business environments and to attempt to foresee the future market trends. The methods include literature analysis and synthesis, data analysis and extrapolation. The research carried out, has revealed the following core results: in the CEE the most suffered production sectors of the prolonged geopolitical crisis between the Russian Federation and Ukraine and the following Russian economic embargo is the dairy sector, followed by the meat sector.

The resultants were characterized by scanning electron microscope, nitrogen physisorption experiment, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectra and so on. The novel hybrid material loaded with Pd can be used as a catalyst. The experimental results indicate that the catalyst has a prominent effect on the degradation of methyl orange in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The reasonable explanation is that the metal component of the catalyst stimulated the dissociation of hydrogen peroxide to release abundant highly active free radicals which can rapidly ruin the structure of methyl orange molecules in water.

Thus, this paper adopts the peaks over threshold method within the extreme value theory to optimize the fitting of critical illness loss distribution in China. Moreover, it picks barrier option pricing method as an upgrading of classical actuarial method to pursue reasonable premium of critical illness insurance. Finally, the estimations with survey data for household disastrous healthcare expenditure in China, denoted by cumulative expenses of inpatient service in 2012 from China Family Panel Studies, demonstrate a better result using the generalized Pareto distribution to fit the tail of the loss. In addition, in this paper we employ the achievement of EVT, the POT method, to optimize the loss fitting of critical illness in China. On the other hand, the critical illness insurance illustrated by the barrier option model provides relatively more compromise pricing suggestions to the governors.","[Zhang Ying] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu Jin] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Southeast University - China; University of Warwick,"Liu, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",yingzhang@seu.edu.cn; euginia_jl@hotmail.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,8,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-614-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,495,518,,,,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376410500034,0

Firms compete in prices and decide where to open or close stores depending on demand and cost conditions, the number of competitors at different locations, and on location-specific private-information shocks. The model distinguishes multiple forces in the spatial configuration of store networks, such as cannibalization of revenue between stores of the same retail chain, economies of density, competition, consumer transportation costs, or positive demand spillovers from other stores. We develop an algorithm to approximate a Markov Perfect Equilibrium in our model, and propose a procedure for the estimation of the parameters of the model using panel data on number of stores, prices, and quantities at multiple geographic locations within a city.

This data problem has been partially circumvented by the dissemination of the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS). Based on this unique data set, we put forward a stress testing method of household balance sheets in a consistent manner across euro area countries. To this end, we put forward a metric of distress which takes into account both the solvency and liquidity position of the household and demonstrate that this metric outperforms the most common metrics used in the literature, which do not take into account the households' asset holdings. We calibrate this metric using the country level data on non-performing loan ratios and estimate stress-test elasticities in response to an interest rate shock, an income shock and a house price shock. We find that, albeit euro-area households are relatively resilient as a whole, there are large discrepancies in the impact of macroeconomic shocks across countries. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework could be used to assess some measures mitigating losses to the banks, such as engaging in the restructurings of loans that are at risk of defaulting.

We propose an extension of the Heterogeneous Autoregressive model to incorporate jumps into the dynamics of the ex post volatility measures. Using the realized range measures of 36 NYSE stocks, we show that there is a positive probability of jumps in volatility. A common factor in the volatility jumps is shown to be related to a set of financial covariates (such as variance risk premium (VRP), S&P500 volume, credit default swap (CDS), and federal fund rates). The CDS on U.S. banks and VRP have predictive power on expected jump moves, thus confirming the common interpretation that sudden and large increases in equity volatility can be anticipated by credit deterioration of the U.S. bank sector as well as changes in the market expectations of future risks.

We investigate this conjecture and identify the variables that are significant for both returns, for one but not for the other, and for the difference. The initial return is driven more by short-term and market factors that cause overreaction while the 21st day return is affected more by an issuer's fundamentals.

In particular, as the nation's largest source of funding for the construction of affordable rental housing, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) could play a critical role in shaping the distribution of poverty. This paper examines whether the LIHTC affects the concentration of poverty by examining who lives in tax credit developments in different neighborhoods, and how neighborhoods and metropolitan areas change after LIHTC developments are built. Through assessing both the effects of siting and tenant composition, we find little evidence that the LIHTC is increasing the concentration of poverty - and we find some evidence that it is reducing poverty rates in high-poverty neighborhoods.

While genetic diversity has a robust, concave and significant effect on economic institutions, reduced-form regressions and numerous falsification tests ostensibly suggest that genetic diversity affects development only via indices of multidimensional measures of economic institutions. Second-stage results indicate that allowing for cognitive skills, latitude and ethno-diversity, economic institutions exert a positive and strongly statistically significant effect on development. These findings are robust to the inclusion of deep and proximate growth determinants, different measures of geography, institutions, and horse races between cognitive skills and economic freedom, as well as to the use of different estimators. Human capital, gauged by cognitive skills, in most specifications is not significant in the second stage; however, it is positive and a strong significant predictor of economic institutions in the first stage. The empirical evidence unveiled in this study lends credence to the primacy of economic institutions hypothesis to ignite long-term growth and highlights the crucial role of human capital in enhancing economic institutional quality.

Is this impact different across firm size classes and across sectors and in what way is it different? We explore these issues for Morocco. We use firm level data, taken from two surveys of the World Bank Enterprise Surveys (WES) for Morocco (2004, 2007), to investigate the relationship between two proxies of a firm's financial constraint (perceived financial constraint as the most serious obstacle and credit constraint) and its productivity growth. The analytical framework assumes a Cobb-Douglas production function for firms where technical progress is not exogenous but depends on financial constraint. Two different econometric estimates are adopted: within estimators and GMM system estimates to address endogeneity and to correct for potential selection, simultaneity and omitted-variable bias (OVB). The estimations using the GMM give results that are consistent with the expectations: they show that each of the two financial constraint proxies has a significant and negative impact on small-and medium-sized firms (i.e. firms with less than 100 workers) but not on large firms (i.e. firms with more than 100 workers). To see whether the main results of the analysis persist (i.e. credit constraints harm small-sized firms more than large-sized firms) several robustness checks are performed. We change the threshold of the separation between small-and large-sized firms from 100 to 50 workers. We keep the threshold at 100 but exclude alternatively small-sized firms that are too small (less than 20 workers) and the large-sized firms that are too large (more than 500 workers). We keep the threshold to 100 and the whole sample but add a control variable which gives the legal status of the firm. Finally, we examine the sensitivity of the results to the sectoral composition of the sample.

Fiscal decentralization generally serves as a deterrent to piracy, while political decentralization may encourage or inhibit piracy. Political decentralization may deter piracy by providing policy ownership to local officials. Alternatively, decentralization may foster piracy by inhibiting interjurisdictional competition or by separating local governance from the national seat of power.

Our findings suggest that losers face punishment from particularly dominant winners and to a lesser degree from particularly frustrated losers. Winners face undifferentiated punishment from all sides. Our results have implications for the prevention of destructive behavior within organizations which use competitions in order to induce effort. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, a good could be offered as a quasi-public or quasi-private good. This paper demonstrates how consumption from two alternative electricity allocation options can be valued using two types of stated preference questions. Since surveyed households were asked two types of questions, the authors develop a joint model of a contingent valuation question and a contingent quantity behavior response that allows for correlation in error terms across models. In their application to two villages in Rwanda, the authors find higher WTP for electricity consumed as a quasi-private good rather than a quasi-public good, with four hours of electricity per day, only in the evening. They also find correlation in the error terms across the two models, suggesting that their joint estimator is more efficient than estimating each model individually.","[Manning, Dale T.; Loomis, John B.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Clark Bldg B304,1172 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"Manning, DT (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Clark Bldg B304,1172 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",dale.manning@colostate.edu; john.loomis@colostate.edu,,,Colorado State University (CSU) Smart Village Micro Grid Research Team; CSU Energy Institute; CSU,Colorado State University (CSU) Smart Village Micro Grid Research Team; CSU Energy Institute; CSU,"The authors would like to thank the Colorado State University (CSU) Smart Village Micro Grid Research Team and the CSU Energy Institute for supporting this research.

The higher level of underpricing and cost of going public for the VC-backed firms are consistent with the monitoring role of the VC. Finally, the fact that VC reputation is associated with lower underpricing is consistent with the reputational capital theory, which asserts that reputable VCs use their expertise and experience to minimize underpricing in order to preserve their reputational capital.

An Empirical Analysis of the Impact of the Bore Pool Sharing Program on Farm Incomes and Crop Choices,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,borewell pooling; groundwater depletion; collective action; water-intensive crops,PROPENSITY SCORE; GROUNDWATER; INDIA; IMPLEMENTATION; MANAGEMENT; CAUSAL,"Repeated droughts in agriculture have promoted intensive reliance upon groundwater resources, thereby exacerbating the already stressed groundwater reservoir situations all across the globe. This has also resulted in increased inequality among farmers by allowing those with better physical assets, such as borewells, to extract water at the cost of less affluent farmers. As a response, bore pool sharing collective arrangements were introduced in some parts of India, with the intention of slowing down the rate of groundwater depletion and helping improve the livelihoods of the worst affected farmers. Such arrangements work through promoting collective management of groundwater resources by providing critical and timely irrigation to rain-fed crops and through dis-incentivizing the cultivation of high water consuming crops. We investigate the impact of bore pool sharing programs on crop incomes and cropping patterns of the participating households in South India. A Probit-2SLS model and Propensity score matching method are used to evaluate the impact of such programs while controlling for self-selection biases. Results indicate that farmers' participation in bore pool sharing collectives is positively associated with their crop incomes. However, contrary to expectation, the share of high water-intensive-crops also increases with participation. In addition, share of water-intensive crops is higher for a collective group with a higher ratio of bore wells to number of participating households. Finally, farmers within the pool with multiple past failed bore well sinking attempts tend to extract more water, thereby threatening the sustainability of the groundwater as well as the livelihoods of the farming community.

The use of the metafrontier approach allows us to: a) identify the drivers of TFP growth for each group of banks, b) compare the TFP growth of each group to the TFP growth experienced by the whole industry, and c) assess the extent to which the former catches up with the latter measured along the metafrontier. Our results suggest that TFP has been increasing among trademarking banks up to the onset of the financial crisis but this process has since reversed. The catch-up indexes suggest that both groups of banks were catching up with the metafrontier up to the financial crisis although the drivers of this process differed between the two groups. After the financial crisis, improvements in technology have been driven by a small number of commercial banks i.e. the non-trademarking banks. These results suggest that a large section of the commercial banking sector has not been able to overcome the effects of the financial crisis.

We model the dynamics of the US economy jointly with global macroeconomic and financial variables using a threshold vector autoregression. This model captures regime-specific dynamics conditional on the severity of credit constraints in the US economy. We identify three main episodes of tight credit in US financial history over the past thirty years. These occur in the late-1980s, in the early 2000s, and during the 2007-09 financial crisis. We find that US financial shocks are associated with a significant contraction in global economic activity in times of tight credit. By contrast, there is little impact of US financial shocks on the global economy in normal times. This asymmetry highlights an international dimension of the US financial accelerator mechanism.

To test this idea and its implications, I consider the effect of a reform restricting the trade credit supply of French trucking firms. In a difference-in-differences setting, I find that trucking firms' corporate default probability decreases by 25% following the restriction. The effect is persistent, concentrated among liquidity-constrained firms, and not offset by a decrease in profits. The restriction also triggers an increase in the entry of small trucking firms.","[Barrot, Jean-Noel] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Barrot, Jean-Noel] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Barrot, JN (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Barrot, JN (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC USA.",,,,AXA Research Fund; HEC Paris Foundation,AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); HEC Paris Foundation,I acknowledge support from the AXA Research Fund and the HEC Paris Foundation.,,72,132,148,17,128,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Conflicts between the two can arise when government bonds provide liquidity. Smoothing taxes causes greater variability in fiscal balances, and therefore in the supply of government liabilities. When prices are flexible, and can jump to absorb fiscal shocks, the tradeoff between liquidity provision and tax smoothing is eased; when they conflict, optimal policy subordinates tax smoothing to satiating liquidity demand. When price fluctuations impose real costs, conflicts necessarily arise and optimal policy gives primacy to neither goal. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Extreme growth events, i.e., turbulence at the level of firms, are conceptualized as an indicator of competitive regional environments which enable processes like structural adaptation or technological re-orientation. This provides a micro-funded empirical framework to operationalize the evolutionary dimension of regional resilience. Therefore, the flexible Asymmetric Exponential Power density is fitted to firm data for each German region during the years of economic downturn (2008-2010). Results show that firm-level turbulence is more pronounced in regions with higher aggregate growth performance, with a highly qualified workforce and with more unrelated variety in the industrial portfolio.","[Duschl, Matthias] Altenhainer Str 7, D-60326 Frankfurt, Germany",,"Duschl, M (通讯作者)，Altenhainer Str 7, D-60326 Frankfurt, Germany.",mat.duschl@gmail.com,,,,,,,67,19,19,6,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We focus on brokerage and closure as two dimensions of social structure where tension arises between individual networking strategies and team performance. Adopting a multilevel perspective, and focusing on closed teams with the presence of a clear leader, we analyze two complementary moderators of this social dilemma that are fundamental to the existence of teams: the task complexity facing the team under consideration, and the individualist versus collectivist shared value orientation of its members. We find that an increase in either of these makes the social dilemma more likely to occur. Counterintuitive conclusions pertaining to these moderators are discussed.","[Godart, Frederic C.] INSEAD, Blvd Constance, F-77300 Fontainebleau, France; [Cavarretta, Fabrice] ESSEC Business Sch, Ave Bernard Hirsch,BP 50105, F-95021 Cergy, France; [Thiemann, Matthias] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Campus Westend PEG Gebaude,Theodor W Adorno Pl 6, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany",INSEAD Business School; ESSEC Business School; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Godart, FC (通讯作者)，INSEAD, Blvd Constance, F-77300 Fontainebleau, France.",thiemann@soz.uni-frankfurt.de; cavarretta@essec.edu; thiemann@soz.uni-frankfurt.de,"Cavarretta, Fabrice/G-8080-2011; Godart, Frederic/A-1927-2017","Cavarretta, Fabrice/0000-0002-1230-199X; Godart, Frederic/0000-0001-7530-8577",,,,,101,3,5,0,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

In a CVG, a voting body containing all members delegates decision-making to a (time-varying) subset of its members, as describes, e.g., the relationship between the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing democratic equitability in CVGs at both the country and region levels, and for different assumptions regarding preference correlation. We apply the framework to evaluate the equitability of the UNSC, and the claims of those who seek to reform it. We find that the individual permanent members are overrepresented by between 21.3 times (United Kingdom) and 3.8 times (China) from a country-level perspective, while from a region perspective Eastern Europe is the most heavily overrepresented region with more than twice its equitable representation, and Africa the most heavily underrepresented.

With a booming economy, China's freight transport sector has experienced dramatic growth in recent decades and has become a key driving force of China's CO2 emissions. Therefore, effective and efficient mitigation policies in the freight transport sector are critical for China to promote CO2 emission mitigation strategies. In contrast to other countries, China's challenge stems not only from technical issues but also from regional socioeconomic disparities, which in turn require the implementation of locally oriented policies. For this reason, an analysis based on regional disparity is of vital importance for future policy making. However, to date, there have been few pertinent studies on the freight transportation sector. To fill this gap, this paper aims to conduct an in-depth comparative study of CO2 emission characteristics and the driving forces in the freight transport sector in China's three regions (covering 31 provinces) from 1990 to 2007. The log mean Divisia index method (LMDI) is employed to analyse the driving forces, and the Gini coefficient is used to investigate regional inequity. Additionally, regional disparity is explored in-depth based on the analytical results and practical concerns. The results highlight that economic structure is a key driving force for emissions change and reveal significant regional disparity and inequity in freight transport emissions. The results are critical for future policy-making to address regional concerns. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

District-level cancer screening coverage data (in proportions) and UK census data have been collected and linked. Their effects on cancer screening coverage were modelled by using both non-spatial and spatial models to control for spatial correlation. Significant spatial correlation has been observed and thus spatial model is preferred. It is found that increased car ownership is significantly associated with improved breast and cervical cancer screening coverage. Public transport usage is inversely associated with breast cancer screening coverage; but positively associated with cervical cancer screening. An area with higher median age is associated with higher screening coverage. The effects of other socio-economic factors such as deprivation and economic activity have also been explored with expected results. Some regional differences have been observed, possibly due to unobserved factors. Relevant transport and public health policies are thus required for improved coverage. While restricting access to cars may lead to various benefits in public health, it may also result in worse cancer screening uptake. It is thus recommended that careful consideration should be taken before implementing policy interventions. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It uses the Lagrangian multiplier, LM, which accommodates up to two endogenous structural breaks in addition to conventional unit root tests. The paper also uses the threshold cointegration tests to explore nonlinearity and asymmetric adjustments of the series. Results from the LM unit root tests indicate that the exchange rates of Botswana, Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria relative to their major trading partners are stationary. The results from the threshold cointegration suggest that there is a long-run relationship between the series and that the adjustments are asymmetric. Appreciation is faster than depreciation in most of the countries. This is consistent with suggestions that countries are intolerant of depredation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The parameters of the frequency and severity distributions of the losses may depend on covariates. The loss frequency over time is modeled with a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with rate function depending on the covariates. This corresponds to a generalized additive model, which can be estimated with spline smoothing via penalized maximum likelihood estimation. The loss severity over time is modeled with a nonstationary generalized Pareto distribution (alternatively, a generalized extreme value distribution) depending on the covariates. Since spline smoothing cannot directly be applied in this case, an efficient algorithm based on orthogonal parameters is suggested. The methodology is applied both to simulated loss data and a database of operational risk losses collected from public media. Estimates, including confidence intervals, for risk measures such as Value-at-Risk as required by the Basel II/III framework are computed. Furthermore, an implementation of the statistical methodology in R is provided.","[Chavez-Demoulin, Valerie] Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Embrechts, Paul] ETH, Dept Math, RiskLab, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Embrechts, Paul] ETH, Swiss Finance Inst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hofert, Marius] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Lausanne; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); University of Waterloo,"Chavez-Demoulin, V (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",valerie.chavez@unil.ch; embrechts@math.ethz.ch; marius.hofert@math.ethz.ch,,,Willis Re,Willis Re,The author (Willis Research Fellow) thanks Willis Re for financial support while this work was being completed.

While the focus on the literature has been on the proximate causes of informal production, such as taxation, we investigate the political environment that causes governments to choose policies that allow the informal economy to develop. We argue that the political environment affects the government's incentive to invest in the efficiency of tax collection, and therefore the ability of the government to detect informal production. We show that political instability, social polarization along ethnic and religious lines, and an autocratic authority pattern are associated with a larger informal economy. The results suggest that efforts to reduce informal production should shift from an emphasis on the proximate causes to political reforms. Since polarization along ethnic and religious lines is structural, reforms should focus on reducing political instability and autocracy. However, the results imply that democratic reforms that change the authority pattern from autocracy to democracy can increase informal economic activity if it increases political instability.

The ability to share risk in international financial markets is captured as time varying correlations between stock markets in the US and 11 Asian countries. We find that trade in the 11 Asia and their ability to share risk in US equity market are mostly substitutes over the full sample (1993:01 to 2014:01) and in extreme market conditions (such as a financial crisis). However, once we account for the decoupling-recoupling hypothesis during the GFC period, we only find strong evidence of complementarity between Asian trade and risk sharing in the US stock markets. We find further support for this complementary link between the real and financial markets in our analyses of when we examined the relationship between US stock market spillovers and Asian trade during the full sample, the GFC period, and under bearish market conditions. We explain our approach and results making connections with several related areas of research and evaluate the results against cases where international risk sharing is with equity markets in China and Japan.

This requires RE investors to carry market risks, in particular the power price risk. But under the current financial structure higher risks would negatively impact the bankability of new projects, which could endanger the achievement of Germany's RE targets. The need to maintain a non-disruptive investment environment suggests a gradual risk transfer towards market integration in the spirit of what Ball (2012) calls giving RE tough love. In this paper we will spell out how this could be done: in the first step we discuss the general case for market risks and find that past policy reforms have only marginally imposed risks on RE. Hence more ambitious steps are needed, for which we outline two elements in the second step: (a) a support framework that creates incentives for RE projects to increasingly take risks based on a cascading risk auction, and (b) design options for power purchase agreements (PPAs) aimed to incentivize new products for risk management. This approach can inform the upcoming 2017 reform in Germany-and also other countries pursuing similar reforms.","[Pahle, M.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Schweizerhof, H.] Allianz Climate Solut GmbH, Treptowers 1, D-12435 Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Pahle, M (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",michael.pahle@pik-potsdam.de,,,Mercator Foundation; Agora Energiewende under the research project A Renewable Energy Dominated Power Market: Challenges & Solutions for Market Design and Policy Instruments,Mercator Foundation; Agora Energiewende under the research project A Renewable Energy Dominated Power Market: Challenges & Solutions for Market Design and Policy Instruments,M.

AfT, comprised almost entirely of aid for trade-related infrastructure and building productive capacity, would promote growth by easing supply-side constraints and improving transportation, energy, and communication infrastructure. By lowering costs of operating in recipient countries, AfT may increase both trade and investment. Most research on the effects of AfT on international transactions focuses on trade. The sparse research on investment investigates aid and net foreign direct investment flows based on the international balance of payments. We contribute to the literature by assessing AfT effects on new greenfield investment. Using bilateral data for 25 donor and 120 recipient countries for the period 2003-13, we find that bilateral AfT promotes greenfield investment. Our preferred specification includes bilateral and country-time fixed effects and employs the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator. Robust effects emerge between the top five donors and more developed recipient countries, cases where aid flows are large. Thus, we see evidence that a critical level of aid is required to encourage greenfield investment. Both aid for infrastructure (particularly, transportation and energy) and building productive capacity are found to exert strong effects. To the extent that greenfield investment creates jobs and generates technology transfer, it appears that AfT is accomplishing its development objectives, at least with regard to the more advanced recipient countries.

Impairment-adjusted capital ratios provide evidence of regulatory forbearance for up to 18 months prior to seizure.

It argues that the colonial formation of tribal' land relations may be understood in relation to the subjugation of African labour to colonial capital, which in turn unintentionally created a potential barrier against investment on tribal land, and hence the conditions for the chiefly appropriation of ground rent. However, the extent to which chiefs could exercise an effective land monopoly in relation to capital was at the same time conditional upon the extent of their proprietorial control in relation to both the subject population and the central state. The politically conditional nature of this chiefly monopoly is captured in the formulation tribal-landed property', which is illustrated and developed through a case study of the changing economic relationship between the Bafokeng chieftaincy and mining capital on the South African platinum belt. It is concluded that this may have wider application in the context of accelerating investment over communal' land and intensifying struggles for its exclusive control, since these are potentially also struggles over the distribution of the surplus value produced by land-based capitals.","[Capps, Gavin] Univ Witwatersrand, Soc Work & Dev Inst SWOP, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Capps, G (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Soc Work & Dev Inst SWOP, Private Bag 3, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",gavin.capps@talk21.com,,"Capps, Gavin/0000-0001-5683-4264",ESRC doctoral scholarship at the London School of Economics and Political Science [R00429934071]; Ford Foundation [0120-6086],ESRC doctoral scholarship at the London School of Economics and Political Science; Ford Foundation,"The argument presented in this paper was originally developed at greater length in my PhD thesis (Capps 2012) under the supervision of Henry Bernstein.

This is where public expenditure is targeted at particular regions based on the logic of collective action: political entrepreneurs maximize their chances of re-election by searching for and implementing programs or projects characterized by 'concentrated benefits' for key constituents and broadly dispersed costs. Using data on capital grants to Irish sports teams for 1998-2015, this paper analyzes the extent to which an informal rule can correct this bias. The case of allocating sports capital grants is particularly interesting since academic research, media commentary, and ministerial statements all seem to confirm the existence of political bias with such allocations in Ireland. Specifically, the geographical distribution of the grants are clearly linked to the Minister for Sport: that minister's constituent county receives significantly higher per capita grant allocation than any other county. The grants were suspended in 2009 because of a fiscal crisis arising from the recession. When the grants were restored in 2012, a new informal rule for allocations was introduced. That informal rule was introduced to reduce the extent of pork barrel politics by ensuring that no county received less than 75 % or more than 150 % of the national average of the per capita grant allocations. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of that informal rule in reducing pork barrel politics in Irish sports capital grant allocations.","[Considine, John; Doran, Justin] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Econ, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork,"Considine, J (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Cork, Sch Econ, Cork, Ireland.",j.considine@ucc.ie,"Considine, John/AAE-2916-2019","Considine, John/0000-0001-6123-399X; Considine, John/0000-0003-1883-1948; Doran, Justin/0000-0002-9875-901X",,,,,15,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2016,168.0,1-2,,,,,43,54,,10.1007/s11127-016-0348-1,0.0,,,12,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DR5EY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379927300003,0

The panel Granger causality tests further reveal that there is a bidirectional causality between life insurance activity and banking credit in the high-income group, and a unidirectional causality running from banking credit to life insurance activity in the lowincome group, while there is a unidirectional causality running from non-life insurance activity to banking credit in the high -income group.

Following this reasoning, stationary models have been proposed to measure the refining margin. In this paper, we investigate the main empirical properties of several time series that measure the refining margin (or crack spread) using an extensive database of WTI, heating oil and unleaded gasoline futures prices traded on the NYMEX. The results show that there are serious doubts about the stationarity of the refining margin.

It outperforms a host of popular return predictors both in and out of sample, with annual R-2 statistics of 12.89% and 13.24%, respectively. In addition, short interest can generate utility gains of over 300 basis points per annum for a mean-variance investor. A vector autoregression decomposition shows that the economic source of short interest's predictive power stems predominantly from a cash flow channel.

Banks can mitigate this information asymmetry.

Using data from the confidential version of National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1997 Cohort), which contains information on the exact birth date of the respondents, we find that the impact of the MLTPA on several indicators of smoking among youth is moderate but often statistically insignificant. However, for those who reported to have smoked before, we show that granting legal access to cigarettes and tobacco products at the MLTPA leads to an increase in several indicators of smoking participation, including up to a 5 percentage point increase in the probability of smoking. These results imply that policies that are designed to restrict youth access to tobacco may only be effective in reducing smoking behavior among certain groups of young adults.","[Yoruk, Ceren Ertan] Sage Coll, Sch Management, Albany, NY 12208 USA; [Yoruk, Bars K.] SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, Albany, NY 12222 USA",Russell Sage College; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Yörük, CE (通讯作者)，Sage Coll, Sch Management, Albany, NY 12208 USA.",yorukc@sage.edu; byoruk@albany.edu,,,,,,,40,7,7,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

Although hyperbolic discounting remains the dominant quantitative characterization of this phenomenon, a variety of models have been proposed and consensus around the one that most accurately describes behavior has been elusive. To help bring some clarity to this issue, we propose an Adaptive Design Optimization (ADO) method for fitting and comparing models of temporal discounting. We then conduct an ADO experiment aimed at discriminating among six popular models of temporal discounting. Rather than supporting a single underlying model, our results show that each model is inadequate in some way to describe the full range of behavior exhibited across subjects. The precision of results provided by ADO further identify specific properties of models, such as accommodating both increasing and decreasing impatience, that are mandatory to describe temporal discounting broadly.","[Cavagnaro, Daniel R.] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA; [Aranovich, Gabriel J.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Neurol, San Francisco, CA USA; [McClure, Samuel M.] Arizona State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Pitt, Mark A.; Myung, Jay I.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Psychol, Columbus, OH USA",California State University System; California State University Fullerton; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Cavagnaro, DR (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA.",dcavagnaro@fullerton.edu,,"Cavagnaro, Daniel/0000-0001-5945-1269","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1613264] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,85,28,31,1,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

In particular, it proposes an empirical measure of volatility persistence using the FIEGARCH (Fractionally Integrated Exponential Generalized Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) model. This specification is useful for reproducing further asymmetry in volatility dynamics and provides a direct measure of long-term volatility dependence. our findings point to three interesting findings. First, volatility exhibits asymmetry as bad news has a significantly higher impact on volatility than positive news. Second, bad news affects the volatility of conventional banks more strongly than that of Islamic banks. Third, it seems that following a shock, volatility is more persistent in conventional banks than in Islamic Banks. Accordingly, Islamic banks are more resilient than conventional banks, but the degree of resilience is somewhat heterogeneous and sample dependent Thus, while this may appear to suggest that we could regulate the conventional bank system using the industry rides of Islamic banks, it is worth noting that Islamic banks in Saudi Arabia tend to provide the most resilient Islamic Bank benchmark model.

To do this, we develop and estimate a dynamic general equilibrium model in which financial intermediation and equity assets play a central role. Over the three recession periods, we find that bank market power (sticky rate adjustments and loan rate markups) played a significant role in the credit spread variability that disrupted the U.S. business cycle. Equity prices exacerbate movements in credit spreads through the financial accelerator channel, but cannot be regarded as one of the main driving forces of credit spread variability. Across the three periods, we observe a remarkable decline in the influence of technology and monetary policy shocks. The influence of loan-to-value ratio shocks declined after the 1990-91 recession, while the bank capital requirement shock exacerbated and prolonged credit spread variability over the 2007-09 recession.

Typically, zonal safety level is evaluated by relating aggregated crash statistics at a certain spatial scale to various macroscopic factors. Another potential solution is from the micro level perspective, in which zonal crash frequency is estimated by summing up the expected crashes of all the road entities located within the zones of interest. This study intended to compare these two types of zonal crash prediction models. The macro-level Bayesian spatial model with conditional autoregressive prior and the micro-level Bayesian spatial joint model were developed and empirically evaluated, respectively. An integrated hot zone identification approach was then proposed to exploit the merits of separate macro and micro screening results. The research was based on a three-year dataset of an urban road network in Hillsborough County, Florida, U.S. Results revealed that the micro-level model has better overall fit and predictive performance, provides better insights about the micro factors that closely contribute to crash occurrence, and leads to more direct countermeasures. Whereas the macro-level crash analysis has the advantage of requirement of less detailed data, providing additional instructions for non-traffic engineering issues, as well as serving as an indispensable tool in incorporating safety considerations into long term transportation planning. Based on the proposed integrated screening approach, specific treatment strategies could be proposed to different screening categories. The present study is expected to provide an explicit template towards the application of either technique appropriately.

However, these notional benefits can be undercut by the tendency of relatively wealthy farmers already meeting eco-certification standards to disproportionately participate. Using original farm-level survey data along with matching and matched difference-in-differences models, we analyze the producer-level effects of organic coffee certification in southeastern Colombia. We find that certification is associated with changes in farm practices linked to improved environmental outcomes. It significantly reduces sewage disposal in the fields and increases the adoption of organic fertilizer. However, we are not able to discern economic benefits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that domestic fundamentals explain more of CDS spread variance than global factors, largely due to their ability to explain differences in sovereign risk across countries. The effects on CDS spreads are found to be time-varying. In terms of economic significance, the factor of institutional-political strength stands out.

To meet the FSB's stated goals, TLAC requirements must impose minimum TLAC at all subsidiaries and restrict how TLAC funds can be invested.

This effect is more pronounced when family firms have a larger control ownership wedge, family representation in management, and are led by a descendant chairman/CEO. We further document that having multiple large shareholders, paying higher dividends, having completed the split-share structure reform and being located in provinces with more competitive credit markets can mitigate the incentive of controlling families to engage in expropriation and reduce the level of collateral required. Overall, we contend that in China, the risk of expropriation associated with family control leads to an increased credit risk and, in turn, higher collateral being required by banks.

This study found significant reductions of single mothers' wage rate/annual earnings if their children have EBP. Conversely, children's EBP increased their married mothers' hourly wage.

Challenging Lazear's view on entrepreneurship,SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Jack-of-all-trades theory; Lazear; Entrepreneurship; Self-employment; Women graduates; Entrepreneurship-based self-efficacy; Lifetime income; Motives,FEMALE SELF-EMPLOYMENT; NASCENT ENTREPRENEURS; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; RISK PROPENSITY; BUSINESS; PERFORMANCE; EDUCATION; INSIGHTS; GROWTH,"This study challenges the basic reasoning behind Lazear's theory on entrepreneurship (2005). Based on the key motive of maximizing one's lifetime income, Lazear posits that individuals with a balanced set of skills should have a higher probability of being self-employed. His Jack-of-all-trades hypothesis presumes that entrepreneurs need sufficient knowledge in a variety of areas to succeed, while paid employees benefit from being specialists in a certain area demanded by the labor market. Because most women-led businesses are neither based on the motive of making money nor are they growth oriented, we argue that maximizing their lifetime income is not the main motivation of many women to start a business. However, we argue that Lazear's theory can be extended to motivations that are mostly stated for women entrepreneurs as well. We apply it to a specific representative sample of 1384 women graduates in Germany and test our hypothesis with logit regression. A dichotomized measure indicating whether a women graduate was self-employed (n = 706) or not (n = 678) served as the dependent variable. Our results widely confirm Lazear's assumption for women graduates who run relatively small businesses in terms of sales and employment: professional training, balanced industry experience, and balanced entrepreneurship-based self-efficacy increase the probability of being self-employed. Solo self-employed tend to have balanced industry experience more often than those being in a team or having employees. Lazear's theory has male as the norm, and as such, does not readily apply to the case of women-but could and should be extended to women's specifics.","[Tegtmeier, Silke] Univ Southern Denmark, Mads Clausen Inst, SDU Innovat & Design Engn, Als 2, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark; [Kurczewska, Agnieszka] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland; [Halberstadt, Jantje] Univ Luneburg, Fac Sustainabil, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany",University of Southern Denmark; University of Lodz; Leuphana University Luneburg,"Tegtmeier, S (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Mads Clausen Inst, SDU Innovat & Design Engn, Als 2, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark.",tegtmeier@mci.sdu.dk; agnieszka.kurczewska@uni.lodz.pl; halberstadt@uni.leuphana.de,"Kurczewska, Agnieszka/HLV-8359-2023; Tegtmeier, Silke/P-9514-2018","Tegtmeier, Silke/0000-0003-2807-5779; Kurczewska, Agnieszka/0000-0002-3088-5044","Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany; Ministry of Science and Higher Education in Poland, Mobility Plus Grant [1100/MOB/2013/0]","Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Ministry of Science and Higher Education in Poland, Mobility Plus Grant(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)","Silke Tegtmeier's contribution to the paper is part of the project Herself-Self-employment in the Professional Career of Women Graduates'', granted by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany (2012/2013).

The SEEA has the same authority and weight as the System of National Accounts in the pantheon of official statistics. The SEEA defines the unit value of depletion of an exhaustible resource to equal the average unit value of the asset (the total asset value divided by the physical stock of resource). By applying this definition to a non-optimal Dasgupta-Heal-Solow model of an extractive economy, we show that 'depletion-adjusted net saving' as defined in the SEEA supports a generalized version of the Hartwick Rule. This measure of saving can guide policies for sustainable development in extractive economies, in particular fiscal policies concerning consumption and investment expenditures funded by resource rents. The conditions required to support this finding are (i) that extraction declines over time at a constant rate, and (ii) that the marginal cost of resource extraction is constant. A less general result holds in the case of increasing marginal extraction costs.","[Hamilton, Kirk] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Hamilton, K (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England.",k.e.hamilton@verizon.net,,,,,,,23,19,20,1,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Through work carried out in China, Ethiopia, Ghana, and Zimbabwe, involving attending courses, interviewing participants and lecturers, examining curricula and reviewing policy documents, we assess Chinese agricultural development courses, supported by China's Ministry of Commerce. Contrary to the argument that a singular Beijing Consensus is being pushed, we find a wide range of course offerings from a range of institutions across China, and extensive debate about agricultural development. This reflects the internal Chinese debate, and an approach to development emphasizing demonstration, experiment, and learning. Course participation involves officials from across Africa, and does not correlate with Chinese commercial interests in Africa. Commercial opportunities may be linked to training, and some courses are run by companies, although instances of take-up are few. The overall direct and immediate impact on agricultural development in Africa appears limited; instead the training program must be seen in relation to building relationships among a large group of African officials, and so the exertion of soft power in foreign policy, as part of development cooperation.

More precisely, DSBM is used first in a two-stage approach to assess the relative efficiency of Malaysian Islamic and conventional banks by emulating the CAMEL rating systems. Then, in the second stage, Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods applied to generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) are combined with DSBM results as part of an attempt to produce a model for banking performance assessment with effective predictive ability. Results indicate higher inefficiency levels and slacks in Islamic banks when compared to conventional ones. Furthermore, when the scope of analysis is the group of Malaysian Islamic banks, the efficiency levels of foreign banks are lower compared to their national counterparts, suggesting regulatory and cultural barriers. Policy implications are derived. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Ambiguity is modeled by a second-order probability distribution that captures the multinational firm's uncertainty about which of the subjective beliefs govern the exchange rate risk. Ambiguity preferences are modeled by the (second-order) expectation of a concave transformation of the (first-order) expected utility of home currency profit conditional on each plausible subjective distribution of the exchange rate risk. Within this framework, we show that the separation and full-hedging theorems are robust to the incorporation of ambiguity and ambiguity preferences. The presence of the currency hedging opportunity induces the multinational firm to produce more and sell less at home, and export more abroad. When the forward exchange rate is biased, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which the multinational firm optimally opts for a forward position that is closer to a full-hedge in response to either the introduction of ambiguity or greater ambiguity aversion.

Based on a sample of Chinese banking micro-data over the period from 2003 to 2014, we find that increased competition in China's banking sector reduces the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission through the bank lending channel, and this impact is strongest for city-commercial banks, highly-liquid and well-capitalized banks. These results shed light on the need for the central bank to monitor the development of competition and market structure to improve the effectiveness of monetary transmission. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We confirm this argument and show that aggressively earnings managing firms with financial constraints and high distress risk perform well and poorly after SEOs, respectively. These results imply that financially constrained firms fairly signal their post-issue profitability due to the release of operational inflexibility, while those with high distress risk inflate earnings to benefit from greater proceeds. We contribute to the literature by showing that firms with different characteristics convey distinct information in reported earnings around SEOs.

Many observers, however, have suggested that this international organization is subject to politicization as the selection process of sites on the World Heritage List is increasingly driven by countries' political influence and national strategic interests. This article explores this possibility quantitatively by analyzing a unique dataset containing information from the summary records of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee's sessions over the 2003-2012 period. Focusing on the difference between technical experts' recommendations and Committee final decisions on new additions to the List, our empirical analysis addresses four main theoretical questions: (i) Does the World Heritage Committee follow the advisory bodies' recommendations for the evaluation of heritage sites? (ii) Does Committee membership or size of national delegations influence the addition of sites to the List or an upgrade of the initial technical evaluations? (iii) Is the Committee's decision regarding the selection of World Heritage sites driven by a country's political and economic power? (iv) Do close political and economic relationships between countries influence Committee members' behavior? The paper contributes to Public Choice literature on international organizations by providing new evidence on the role of political and economic interests in decision making concerning global merit goods.","[Bertacchini, Enrico; Saccone, Donatella] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, Lungodora Siena 100, Turin, Italy; [Liuzza, Claudia; Meskell, Lynn] Stanford Univ, Stanford Archaeol Ctr, Bldg 50, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Turin; Stanford University,"Bertacchini, E (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, Lungodora Siena 100, Turin, Italy.",enrico.bertacchini@unito.it,,"Saccone, Donatella/0000-0003-4536-8522; BERTACCHINI, Enrico Eraldo/0000-0003-4832-5798; Meskell, Lynn/0000-0001-9087-3611; Liuzza, Claudia/0000-0001-8026-1187",Australian Research Council [DP140102991]; France-Stanford Center for Interdisciplinary Studies; Europe Center; Center for Philanthropy and Civic Society; Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University; Stanford Archaeology Center,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); France-Stanford Center for Interdisciplinary Studies; Europe Center; Center for Philanthropy and Civic Society; Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University; Stanford Archaeology Center,"We thank four anonymous referees and the participants to the European Workshop of Applied Cultural Economics and to the annual meeting of the European Public Choice Society for their insightful comments and suggestions.

These firms exhibit characteristics consistent with the need to shield proprietary information from potential rivals. They experience greater underpricing, but pre-IPO insiders reduce underpricing-related wealth transfers by selling proportionately less of the firm's shares at the IPO, raising more equity financing in later seasoned equity offerings, and selling their own holdings at a relatively slow pace. The information environment of redacting firms reflects proportionately more private information than that of non-redacting firms post-IPO, but this difference abates by the fourth year. Consistent with the view that redacted proprietary information provides competitive advantages, redacting firms exhibit superior financial performance post-IPO. The results illustrate tradeoffs in balancing a firm's needs to protect proprietary information with its capital needs, investor needs for information to price securities, and pre-IPO owner liquidity needs.

More specifically, a high benchmark-implied currency risk induces funds to invest in markets with less volatile currencies, leading to a higher degree of currency concentration in portfolio holdings. This currency concentration, however, departs from the optimal equity allocation strategy across countries and reduces fund performance. We document that funds resorting to high currency concentrations underperform funds with low currency concentrations by as much as 1%-2% per year.","[Massa, Massimo] INSEAD, F-77305 Fontainebleau, France; [Wang, Yanbo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Grad Sch Business, Seoul 110745, South Korea; [Zhang, Hong] Tsinghua Univ, PBC Sch Finance, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",INSEAD Business School; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Tsinghua University,"Massa, M (通讯作者)，INSEAD, F-77305 Fontainebleau, France.",massimo.massa@insead.edu; yanbo.wang@skku.edu; zhangh@pbcsf.tsinghua.edu.cn,"wang, yan/GSE-6489-2022; Wang, Yanbo/HFZ-8018-2022; wang, yan/JBJ-7462-2023; Wang, Yuan/HHC-1520-2022",,,,,,34,2,4,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

This relationship incorporates a context effect reflecting both the illness or 'morbidity' associated with cancer fatality and the 'dread' or horror associated with the prospect of eventual death from cancer, as well as a latency effect that captures the discounting likely to arise because the onset of the symptoms of cancer typically occurs after some delay. We use a Risk-Risk trade-off study to validate this model by directly estimating the influence of context and latency effects upon the relative size of the VSL for cancer and for road accidents, confirming that both effects are significant and estimating their size using regression analysis. We show that morbidity accounts for the majority of the context premium. We use the elicited coefficients to reconstruct VSL estimates for a range of cancers characterised by their latency and morbidity periods.","[McDonald, Rebecca L.] Univ Warwick, WBS Scarman Rd, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Chilton, Susan M.; Jones-Lee, Michael W.; Metcalf, Hugh R.

Because pledge ability and liquidity are low for long-term firm-specific capital, a negative temporary aggregate productivity shock that tightens credit constraints creates a bias towards liquid short-term investments. This dampens the short-run negative output reaction to the shock, at the expense of strong medium-run propagation effects.

We find that high dependence on central government transfers- as reflected in a low share of locally raised revenues in the municipality's budget- exacerbates political budget cycles,While tight monitoring - exercised through central government appointment of external accountants to debt accumulating municipalities - eliminates them. We also find that this pattern is predominantly accounted for by development expenditures. These results suggest that political budget cycles can result from fiscal institutions that create soft budget constraints: that is, where incumbents and rational voters can expect that the costs of pre-election expansions will be partly covered later by the central government.

We propose a two-step approach where returns are first pre-whitened with a high-frequency based volatility model, and then an EVT based model is fitted to the tails of the standardized residuals. This realized EVT approach is compared to the conditional EVT of McNeil & Frey (2000). We assess both approaches' ability to filter the dependence in the extremes and to produce stable out-of-sample VaR and ES estimates for one-day and ten-day time horizons. The main finding is that GARCH-type models perform well in filtering the dependence, while the realized EVT approach seems preferable in forecasting, especially at longer time horizons.

Five variants are analyzed: restrictive fiscal policy in the south, fiscal expansion in the south, fiscal expansion in the north, fiscal expansion in the whole area without and with intra-zone financing. Several findings emerge and illustrate the mechanisms at work in the crisis countries of Southern Europe. The establishment of a restrictive fiscal policy in South reduces public debt and the level of interest rates but at the cost of slower growth. The effect of a policy of increasing demand in the south is effective on growth but interest rates greatly increase. To avoid the explosion rates in southern countries without jeopardizing growth, only a political stimulus north can both boost production and reduce imbalances within the euro area. Finally, a recovery policy in the whole area is effective growth while limiting the increase in interest rates as long as financing intra-zone is important.","[Duwicquet, Vincent] Univ Lille 1, Clerse UMR 8019, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Mazier, Jacques] Univ Paris 13, Cepn UMR 7234, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France",Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite Paris 13,"Duwicquet, V (通讯作者)，Univ Lille 1, Clerse UMR 8019, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France.;Mazier, J (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, Cepn UMR 7234, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France.",vincent.duwicquet@univ-lille1.fr; mazier@univ-paris13.fr,,,,,,,28,2,2,0,9,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

This extends the previously narrow range of econometric literature on early settlement. Consistent with the theory of early settlement, our results confirm the importance of delay costs and of uncertainty, measured by the complexity of the economic analysis required for each merger. We also find a non-monotonic effect of agency resourcing, which raises questions about the Commission's efficiency in times of high case load. Econometrically, we select a sample of merger decisions in which the European Commission intervened due to concerns of anticompetitive effects, and our selection model provides estimates of the factors determining intervention by the Commission.

Models that do incorporate home production typically predict a negative relationship with the wage rate, a relationship emphasized by most analyses of time devoted to home production during recessions. However, empirical studies of the behavior of home production over the business cycle find that home production is relatively acyclical. The prominence of the fall in house values during the Great Recession suggests an alternative driver of hours dedicated to home production: non-labor endowments and assets, specifically housing equity. This paper explores the role that changing house values play in determining time dedicated to home production using the American Time Use Survey. It concludes that on the margin, time allocation responds to changes in house values in the anticipated way only under certain conditions. Specifically, when non-owners are excluded from the analysis the anticipated results do not hold. Some suggestions to explain this result are provided, as well as a discussion of future clarifying research.","[Kuehn, Daniel] Urban Inst, Income & Benefits Policy Ctr, 2100 M St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Kuehn, Daniel] American Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Urban Institute; American University,"Kuehn, D (通讯作者)，Urban Inst, Income & Benefits Policy Ctr, 2100 M St NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",dan.p.kuehn@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

The water scarcity in the country is not an absolute, but rather a politically mediated reality. The cubic meter numbers for Jordan may very well point toward absolute scarcity, but those numbers hide as much as they reveal. They hide the worlds of meaning, emotion, and social interactions centered around water. It is no surprise then that despite donor-driven push for greater economic rationality in water resources management, political stability continues to be the prime objective of water management in Jordan. Through a case study of Water User Associations (WUAs) in the Jordan Valley we try to demonstrate the political imperatives of water management in Jordan. The WUAs are an example of donor-instigated institutions for water management at the local scale. The WUAs have had variable success in the Jordan valley and some fear that they will not outlast the donors' and the government's financial support to them. The WUAs have been appropriated by the elites where their tribal dominance allows for it, while in other places larger farmers operate outside of them. Farmers nevertheless prefer WUAs because they are helpful in gaining access to patronage and water. The future of WUAs in the Jordan Valley is going to be constricted by the Jordanian state's (in)tolerance of them also becoming politicized spaces for claim-making on the state.

A dynamic, forward-looking optimization framework applied over the course of the coming century shows that although some deforestation is optimal in the near term, in the absence of climate change regulation, the desirability of further deforestation is eliminated by mid-century. Although adverse productivity shocks from climate change have a modest effect on global land use, such shocks combined with rapid growth in energy prices lead to significant deforestation and higher greenhouse gas emissions than in the baseline. Imposition of a global greenhouse gas emissions constraint further heightens the competition for land, as fertilizer use declines and land-based mitigation strategies expand. However, anticipation of the constraint largely dilutes its environmental effectiveness, as deforestation accelerates prior to imposition of the target.","[Steinbuks, Jevgenijs] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Hertel, Thomas W.] Purdue Univ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",The World Bank; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Steinbuks, J (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",jsteinbuks@worldbank.org,,"Stenbuks, Jevgenijs/0000-0003-3548-2196","National Science Foundation [0951576]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0951576] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We would like to thank Yongyang Cai, Ujjayant Chakravorty, Alla Golub, Kenneth Judd, Todd Munson, Paul Preckel, Brent Sohngen, Farzad Taheripour, Wally Tyner, two anonymous reviewers, and the participants of the 4th International Workshop on Empirical Methods in Energy Economics, the American Geophysical Union Annual Meetings, the American Economic Association Annual Meetings, Cowles Summer Conference Macroeconomics and Climate Change, and research seminars at Purdue University and the World Bank for their helpful suggestions and comments.

While methods exist to measure event weighting and the utility for gains and losses separately, there was no method to measure loss aversion under ambiguity. Our method allows this and thereby it can measure prospect theory's entire utility function. Consequently, we can properly identify properties of utility and perform new tests of prospect theory. We implemented our method in an experiment and obtained support for prospect theory. Utility was concave for gains and convex for losses and there was substantial loss aversion.

From a static perspective, we find that firms trading services are fewer and export and import smaller values than those trading goods. This is because they trade fewer products, with less countries, making fewer transactions and these gaps are only partially counterbalanced by larger transaction values. Instead, firms trading both services and goods are even rarer, but they account for a substantial share of total trade. In the time dimension, services traders experience higher entry and exit rates and a lower survival probability. However, the surviving firms grow more rapidly than those trading goods thanks to an increase in the number of transactions per product-market. Finally, we observe that firms that trade only services add also goods in their export and import basket and vice versa. This is a further important growth channel for firms in international markets.","[Ariu, Andrea] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland; [Ariu, Andrea] Georgetown Univ, McDonough Business Sch, Washington, DC USA; [Ariu, Andrea] CRENOS, Cagliari, Italy",University of Geneva; Georgetown University,"Ariu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.;Ariu, A (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, McDonough Business Sch, Washington, DC USA.;Ariu, A (通讯作者)，CRENOS, Cagliari, Italy.",andrea.ariu@unige.ch,,,National Bank of Belgium,National Bank of Belgium,"This work was carried out while I was a Ph.D. at IRES, Univeriste catholique de Louvain and an intern at the National Bank of Belgium, I thank for the hospitality and the support provided.

Previous research utilized a gravity equation that has no theoretical foundation for FDI flows. This study applies a theory-based Knowledge-Capital Model modified to incorporate preferential market-openings by FTAs and BITs that directly affect investment and trade costs. Using country-pair data for China and ASEAN with 34 OECD home countries during 1985-2010, panel analyses are performed. The results suggest that China's rise does not threaten ASEAN countries but induces a strong synergetic effect on FDIs into them. In attracting FDI inflows, China and ASEAN countries are friends, not foes.","[Chan-Hyun Sohn] Kangwon Natl Univ, Chunchon, South Korea",Kangwon National University,"Sohn, CH (通讯作者)，Kangwon Natl Univ, Chunchon, South Korea.",,,,Kangwon National University,Kangwon National University,"Chan-Hyun Sohn, Professor, Department of International Trade and Business, Kangwon National University, South Korea, and Guest Professor, Department of Economics, Yokohama National University, Japan.

We find that margin increases decrease the rate at which prices change, yet they impair the risk sharing function and they decrease market liquidity in certain markets. The regulator should set margins by taking the heterogeneity of commodity futures markets into account. Certain effects of margin changes diffuse across related markets though. Our results are robust to endogenously set margins by the exchanges and to alternative ways of measuring market liquidity. Interestingly, the effect of margin changes is more pronounced in commodity futures markets than in major equity and interest rate futures markets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In most cases, while such activities are deemed essential from an industry perspective, they also carry negative connotations connected to narrow rent-seeking and the pursuit of elites' interests which run counter to the public good and discourage competition and subsequent innovation. As such, industry associations have long been excluded from discussions regarding the relational dynamics and evolution of innovation systems. In contrast, this paper builds upon more recent work that places industry associations as key intermediary actors that facilitate knowledge exchange and institutional capacity building, particularly in the context of developing countries where limited institutional capacities and substantial knowledge gaps can limit both innovation and development. Employing a qualitative cross-national comparison, this paper examines the changing roles and activities of biopharmaceutical industry associations in the development of the South African and Indian pharmaceutical industries, with a particular focus on government industry relations. For doing so, the paper captures developments during three main periods through which both the South African and Indian biopharmaceutical industries have similarly evolved, although within different national contexts: (1) pre-liberalization, (2) expanding pluralism, and (3) increasing partnership. We argue that in South Africa and India, particular historical trajectories and lack of institutional capacities are shifting industry associations away from ineffective lobbying to a new political approach that emphasizes partnering with government in the pursuit of not only narrow industry objectives, but also broader development aims.

The New Urban Agenda, currently under debate, is located in its historical context to reveal who the major actors and institutions were that defined global urban policy; what the shifting normative positions on cities are; and why the increasingly complex process of the global policy environment makes defining a universal agreement on urban development so hard. At stake in UN negotiations are fundamental issues about the centrality of urban pathways to sustainable development. A historical view of the Habitat process reveals that even at the global scale it is possible for those with strong convictions to change the normative base and mode of working on urban issues, but that the compromise politics of the international system also masks important compromises and contradictions. Looking back over the decades of international debate on development priorities shows not only that there is now greater acceptance of the importance of defining and agreeing to an urban agenda but that global policy on urban and regional issues has indeed evolved. There is no longer a question of whether cities are important for sustainable development, but rather why and how the urban condition affects our common future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

At some point, we have all confronted ourselves during our teaching activity with learning paradoxes and several learning barriers. We shall further discuss through this paper what these concepts refer to and we shall explain why they must be overcome. Nowadays, the quality standards for the education system are very high and they are set by the business actors. The preparation of a good professional in a specific business area depends not only on the prestige of the education institution, the experience of the professor, the information technology available in the laboratory but mainly on developing the right way of thinking and thus the most efficient and effective way of developing new projects, of finding innovative solutions and finally of achieving success. We believe that the academic education, in any domain, should enable students to think and to act as specialists. The purpose of this paper is to bring arguments that learning how to think strategically in the business environment is critically important and it should be the core of business academic education. In this context, we shall present the principles of a learning organization and what benefits they generate when they are accordingly applied. As a bottom line, we dare to say that top education is no more about the studied content but more about the thought/provided thinking patterns. The mission of a skilled professor, supported by the adequate environment, is to teach students the right way of thinking in that specific domain. Thus, the business education should prepare its students to think strategically as the business environment is more complex and dynamic than ever. Throughout the sections of this paper, we present several insights on how a university should apply the principles of a learning organization which we believe are very useful for the students and practitioners in the business field.

The purpose of this paper is to explain many fascinating and vital opportunities for research in these areas. Design/methodology/approach - As a framework the author uses the five categories of professional organization research developed by Brock et al. (2014); and as such discusses: organizational models and structures, micro-organizational issues, diversity, new professions, and societal issues. For each category the author begins with a recent news item concerning emerging market professionals, outlines underlying scholarly issues, and presents some examples of significant indicative research. Finally, the importance and opportunities for research in emerging economies is presented along with some examples and directions for future work. Findings - This short essay has endeavoured to show the importance of research in professionals and professional organization, to explain its relevance to contemporary society in general, and to present a concomitant research agenda. Originality/value - First, it is crucial to understand that professional work is vital to the development of all developing markets. Further, research into professional work and organizations in emerging markets is severely lacking. Finally, this essay explains five areas with special research potential, each with examples from the emerging market context, and presents directions for future work.","[Brock, David M.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Guilford Glazer Fac Management, Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Brock, DM (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Guilford Glazer Fac Management, Beer Sheva, Israel.",dmb@bgu.ac.il,"Brock, David M./D-4020-2009","Brock, David M./0000-0003-4006-5610",,,,,96,3,3,0,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

That kind of scientific problem was put, because it is important from a cognitive point of view (Kucinski, 2010). Moreover, the undertaken issue is empirically verifiable, real and justified on the basis of modern European economies (see Kucinski, 2015). Methodology / methods Due to the prevailing empirical nature of the work, it was decided to carry out the research based on two key research methods. The leading is the econometric analysis, (and therefore including the formulation of the econometric model and its estimation), but statistical analysis has also proved necessary (collection and interpretation of data describing the studied phenomenon). Scientific aim General goals of the study was to answer the following research questions: Is it justified to classify EU countries into systems of higher, medium and a lower economic level bearing in mind the unemployment rate occuring in these countries? Which unemployment factor should be placed the main emphasis on, in scientific research and economic policies of countries? Does the type of factors that most affect unemployment depend on the economic level of the EU countries? Findings The factors, which are determinants of unemployment level in the surveyed EU countries, should include both GDP and exports. Increased level of these variables adversely affects the change in the level of unemployment. Conclusions The problem of unemployment both from a scientific and practical point of view, is a very important subject of macroeconomics. Therefore, it is worth examining the factors of unemployment in order to improve national policies that make the socio-economic situation of EU countries better.","[Brozek, Katarzyna; Kogut, Justyna] Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Human Radom, Malczewskiego 29, PL-26600 Radom, Poland",Kazimierz Pulaski University of Technology & Humanities in Radom,"Brozek, K (通讯作者)，Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Human Radom, Malczewskiego 29, PL-26600 Radom, Poland.",kania6669@wp.pl; justynakogut5@wp.pl,"Kruk, Justyna/G-1806-2015",,,,,,15,0,0,0,4,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,714,722,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200088,0

In Wallonia, nearly half of the farmers are obliged to have ecological focus areas on at least 5% of their arable land in order to get the green payment, and also, the direct payments. At the same time, thanks to public support through financial measures in favour of the farmers and through more general strategic plans, organic farming registered a significant increase during the last ten years and represents more than 10% of Walloon farmers in 2014, with 8.6% of the agricultural area. Consumption of organic food is continuously increasing and reaches 2.3% of the total food expenses in 2014. The main expenses for organic products concern dairy products, vegetables and fruits. Together, ecological focus areas and organic farming areas represent in 2014 the significant share of 12% of the Walloon agricultural area.

In a previous study covering the regulatory developments during the financial crisis up until 2009, issues such as the implementation of Basel 3 rules in Europe and the (mostly ad hoc and unilateral) resolution mechanisms set in most European countries to fight the crisis were covered. This study focuses on developments that since 2010 and, in particular, the concerns and actions that emerged with the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area. In particular, the transition from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is assessed. Following these institutional developments, the focus after 2012 has progressively turned to the agreements and remaining challenges of the European banking union. These issues are jointly covered, along with some updates on the views of the ESFRC on recent advances in other areas, such as solvency regulation. All in all, we find that of the weaknesses of the global financial system remain to be addressed, and we believe that the banking union is one of the main tools and opportunities for an improved and efficient crisis management in Europe.","[Carbo-Valverde, S.] Bangor Univ, Bangor Business Sch, Econ & Finance, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Carbo-Valverde, S.] Spanish Econ & Social Res Fdn FUNCAS, Financial Studies, Barcelona, Spain; [Benink, H.

Design/methodology/approach - Panel data estimation techniques are carried out on a set of 412 firms from 12 countries within Sub-Saharan Africa. Findings - The results show that firm-and country-specific factors play an important role in the choice of debt for firms in Sub-Saharan Africa. First, firm profitability is the most common significant predictor of capital structure for firms in Sub-Saharan Africa. The significance and magnitude of profitability coefficients is more pronounced in countries with the least developed banking and stock markets and the weakest legal systems. Second, the rule of law in Nigeria and Zimbabwe provides avenues for firms in these countries to increase their debt maturity structures. The choice of debt for firms in Ghana is significantly influenced by the strength of the legal rights, the time to enforce a contract and the cost of contract enforcement. Third, capital structure adjustment speeds in all the sampled countries are relatively slow, possibly due to the market imperfections associated with the underdeveloped financial markets of Sub-Saharan Africa. Lastly, firms in the most developed stock markets of Sub-Saharan Africa tend to have lower mean debt ratios and faster capital structure adjustment speeds. Similarly, firms in countries with strong legal mechanisms tend to have higher mean long-term debt ratios and faster capital structure adjustment speeds. Originality/value - This paper explores the influence of firm-level and country-specific factors on the dynamics of capital structure for a new data set that was previously ignored in the literature.","[Chipeta, Chimwemwe] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Deressa, Chera] Mulungushi Univ, Sch Business Studies, Kabwe, Zambia",University of Witwatersrand,"Chipeta, C (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa.",chimwemwe.chipeta@wits.ac.za,"DERESSA, CHERA/ADX-2741-2022","Deressa, CMA, Chera/0000-0002-0609-0356; chipeta, Chimwemwe/0000-0002-4341-9114",,,,,72,21,25,0,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

They form the basis of liberalisation of aviation between the EU and the rest of the world, opening up markets and promoting fair competition. The progress made since the original road map in 2005 depended both on the priorities of the European side and the individual strategy of each external partner. This paper discusses the status of the EU's aviation relations with four important partners: USA, Russia, Morocco and Turkey. Aviation liberalisation is at a different stage of maturity in the four examples. The evolution of traffic over time can give an insight into the impact that gradual liberalisation had in each case: total traffic grows faster when restrictions are lifted, but new demand is not spread equally across airports on either side. The impact on concentration, measured with the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) at airport level, varies significantly between the various markets. Political, geographic, demographic and economic factors influence the airline network dynamics and lead to distinct patterns of expansion. Special emphasis is given to the analysis of the role of airline alliances, ownership limitations and specific obstacles such as the visa limitations and the Siberian overflight royalties.

In particular, it focusses on the role of institutional distance (represented by corruption perception distance, political distance and cultural distance) as a moderator of the relationships between traditional investment motives and the number of M&A deals made by Russian companies in a specific country. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is conducted on panel data of Russian cross-border M&As launched in 46 countries during the period 2007-2013. The final data set includes 322 observations. Due to the nature of dependent variable and the results of pre-tests, negative binomial regression is used in the main analysis. Findings - The key finding of the study reveals the importance of institutional distance, in particular, the moderating effect of different dimensions of institutional distance on the relationships between internationalization motives and the number of Russian M&As. Corruption, political and cultural differences show different effects in terms of both direction and strength, but all three were found to be significant. Research limitations/implications - The major concern stems from the type of secondary data used in the paper. This indicates the necessity to improve data collection methods which could allow for better transparency of Russian foreign investments, would facilitate more sophisticated research and probably more accurate business forecasts. Originality/value - By conducting a systematic examination of Russian cross-border M&As the authors contribute to the literature on emerging markets firms by addressing the important yet under-researched domain of Russian foreign direct investments. Building on the macroeconomic and institutional logic proposed in this study, future research on Russian cross-border activities could add to the understanding by providing more generalizable and critical evidence. The study provides a point of departure from prior studies on Russian outward FDI which the authors hope to inspire future research to further analyze the drivers of Russian M&As and foreign investments in general.","[Dikova, Desislava] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Global Business & Trade, Vienna, Austria; [Panibratov, Andrei] St Petersburg State Univ, Grad Sch Management, St Petersburg, Russia; [Veselova, Anna] St Petersburg State Univ, Operat Management Dept, St Petersburg, Russia; [Ermolaeva, Lyubov] St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Management, St Petersburg, Russia",Vienna University of Economics & Business; Saint Petersburg State University; Saint Petersburg State University; Saint Petersburg State University,"Dikova, D (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Global Business & Trade, Vienna, Austria.",Desislava.Dikova@wu.ac.at,"Veselova, Anna/ABD-2987-2021; Veselova, Anna/AAD-8600-2019; Ermolaeva, Liubov/AAA-6070-2019; Ermolaeva, Liubov/HOC-4264-2023; Dikova, Desislava/AAF-7942-2020; Panibratov, Andrei/K-4217-2013","Veselova, Anna/0000-0002-8538-4757; Ermolaeva, Liubov/0000-0003-1742-2886; Panibratov, Andrei/0000-0002-3996-3790",,,,,56,25,28,3,38,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The earnings level, educational attainment, family size, the occupational choice, the career stage, the birth cohort, and the macroeconomic fluctuations significantly influence earnings mobility. In the United States, earnings mobility is significantly lower and gender differences are less pronounced than in Germany and Great Britain.The gender gap of earnings mobility is less expressed for younger cohorts of German employees. The increase of the gender gap of earnings dynamics in the course of the work career indicates continuing heterogeneity of labor market behavior and outcome of women and men which contribute to persistent economic and social stratification.","[Eberharter, Veronika V.] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ, Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Eberharter, VV (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ, Innsbruck, Austria.",,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78560-993-0; 978-1-78560-994-7,RES ECON INEQUAL,,,2016,24.0,,,,,,331,360,,10.1108/S1049-258520160000024014,0.0,,,30,Economics; Social Issues,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Issues,BI1QE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406693400013,0

Next, we use Engsted and Nielsen's (2012) co-explosive VAR framework to test for bubbles. We find evidence of explosiveness in many housing markets, thus supporting the bubble hypothesis.

The poverty trap is a self-reinforcing mechanism in the market in which small variances in initial conditions can result in bimodality into differential economic steady-states resulting in multiple equilibria. Reasons for this include the savings trap, creating locally increasing rates return due to indivisible lumpy capital inputs; the technological trap in which the diminishing marginal rates of technological substitution diminishes productivity growth; the demographic trap in which population growth reduces the capital-labour ratio, increasing consumption and pure time costs; the stochastic returns trap in which producers without access to risk smoothing mechanisms assume greater risks; and the liquidity trap in which present and future capital values exceed current agricultural revenues. The study demonstrates that the failure of land reform and small-scale agriculture assistance programmes is thus a product of market failures, not policies. The analysis indicates that locally increased returns, symptomatic of the savings trap exists with initial average expenditures of smaller firms exceeding the average incomes. The technology trap is also evident with average incomes of small firms is also very low relative to the average capital asset values. The mean productivity of workers in terms of revenue per employee supports the argument for productivity declines in small firms due to the demographic trap. Initial declines in income per ton outputs of smaller firms validate the stochastic returns poverty trap.","[Geyer, Herman] Univ Stellenbosch, CRUISE, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Geyer, H (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, CRUISE, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",hsgeyerjr@sun.ac.za,,,,,,,32,3,3,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2016,55.0,4,,,,,356,376,,10.1080/03031853.2016.1243753,0.0,,,21,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EI7SI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392703200003,0

This paper explains the meaning of the term smart specialization in the context of regional management through an approach based on an scientific literature review as well as official documents of international institutions. Theoretical part of article describes a new mechanism for stimulating regional development in EU and empirical study presents analyzing the innovativeness of Polish regions. Methodology The test procedure used taxonomic methods such as Ward's hierarchical analysis and deglomerating k-means analysis. Scientific aim The main goal of the research is to analyze and evaluate of the innovativeness 16 Voivodeships in Poland. Findings The main result is the author's classification of Polish regions in view of their innovativeness. Conclusions This work provides policy makers and city managers with useful guidelines which can be used to define and plan actions directed at the most appropriate domains of implementation of the concept of smart specialization.,"[Hajduk, Slawomira] Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Management, Oj Tarasiuka 2 St, PL-16001 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Hajduk, S (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Management, Oj Tarasiuka 2 St, PL-16001 Bialystok, Poland.",s.hajduk@pb.edu.pl,"Hajduk, Sławomira/F-2451-2016","Hajduk, Sławomira/0000-0003-0314-1661",,,,,22,0,0,0,6,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,542,549,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200067,0

BENTH.; MAIZE; FERTILIZER; VARIETIES; RICE,"This study examined the adoption of Integrated Striga Management (ISMA) technologies among maize farmers in Bauchi and Kano states of northern Nigeria. It employs a double-hurdle approach to analyse the factors influencing adoption and intensity of ISMA technologies among households, using cross-sectional data of 643 farmers from the two states. The results show that the estimated coefficients of exogenous income and proximity to extension office are negatively significant (P < 0.05), while higher total farm income, polygamous households, past participation in on-farm trials, awareness of the technology, contact with extension agents and access to cash remittances are positive and significant (P < 0.01), and are the most significant factors likely to influence ISMA technologies adoption. Marital status, household size, farm size and access to cash remittances are most significant factors influencing adoption intensity. Maize farmers in the study area who adopted ISMA technologies obtained higher output than the non-adopters, which resulted in a positive and significant effect on their total farm income. Hence, policies targeted at increasing maize productivity through Striga management need to include ISMA technologies as a potentially feasible option. The study recommends actions to improve farmers' access to financial services to increase their liquidity. Nevertheless, the most immediate action will be improvement in farmers' access to extension services as they have proved to be a reliable source of information in the rural areas.","[Hassan, M.

This is due to the lack of theoretical framework for the IFRS translation process based on the grounds of general translation theories. The aim of this paper is to propose a theoretical framework for IFRS translation (a translator competence profile, above all) on the grounds of the cognitive-communicative theory of translation, which can be put into practice to ensure the high quality of IFRS translations. Methodology/methods The paper is theoretical one. The basic methodology was studies of Polish literature in the field of translation theory. The author has analysed the so called cognitive communicative theory of translation developed by a Polish linguist, professor Krzysztof Hejwowski as well as corresponding views of other Polish researchers concerned with translation theory and practice. On this basis he developed a prescriptive model of competence of the IFRS translator. Scientific aim The prescriptive model of translator competence presented in the paper can contribute to the development, on the basis of translation theories, of a universal framework for IFRS translation. Findings Applying the translation model proposed by Hejwowski to the IFRS the author has developed a competence profile of the IFRS translator into Polish. Two levels of competence are distinguished in this model: primary (of key importance) and secondary (additional, supporting). Additionally, two competence areas - knowledge and predispositions - have been distinguished.

Methodology/methods The methodology is based on comparison and analysis of literature and views published by various authors about the certification as a means of assessing a person's professional competence. Scientific aim To promote scientific discussion and in- depth research of aspects related to certification of persons as regards assessment of their competence and continuous practice monitoring procedures in general, and specifically in the field of energy construction in order to avoid formal attestation of conformity, which can result in the threat to human health and life. Findings Certification of persons is not only a way of confirming their professional competence, but also one of the most important qualification control mechanisms in the regulated sphere where the person has no rights to pursue their professional activities without an adequate proof of their competence. Certification also plays an important role in ensuring public and work safety in order to prevent circumstances in which untrained personnel's performance because of their professional incompetence or non- compliance to professional requirements may result in harm to the environment and public safety. Conclusions Evaluation and analysis of the theoretical aspects of certification of persons provide a general notion of certification as the conformity assessment procedure which applies to any area to be certified and can serve as a basis for further studies of certification. Bodies operating certification of persons should evaluate not only the knowledge of the persons to be certified and their professional experience in the particular sphere, but also their ability to apply the acquired knowledge and skills in situations related to their professional activities, i. e. their competence. Competence evaluation is the biggest challenge at present. In order to describe the certification process of energy constructors and to identify its role in ensuring that the professional competence complies with the requirements set out in the field of energy, it is necessary to pursue in-depth studies.","[Kavosa, Maija] Riga Tech Univ, Meza Iela 1-1, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia; [Lapina, Inga] Riga Tech Univ, Kalnciema Iela 6, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University; Riga Technical University,"Lapina, I (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Kalnciema Iela 6, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia.",inga.lapina@rtu.lv,"Lapina, Inga/D-3014-2014","Lapina, Inga/0000-0003-3019-2472",National Research Program 5.2.

In a face-to-face consumer survey, we asked about individuals' perceptions of the impact of climate change on their personal lives to measure its effect on consumer preference for carbon labels. The results of ordered logit and conditional logit regressions showed that a significant preference for mandatory carbon labels reflected Koreans' level of concern about climate change. As an increasing number of consumers feel the impact of climate change, the gap of willingness to pay between voluntary and mandatory low carbon labels is significant. Also, consumer perception of the impact of climate change on their personal lives was significantly influenced by the area in which the respondents' lived.","[Kim, Hyeyoung; House, Lisa A.] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Kim, Tae-Kyun] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 80 Daehakro, Daegu 41566, South Korea",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Kyungpook National University,"Kim, TK (通讯作者)，Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 80 Daehakro, Daegu 41566, South Korea.",tkkim@knu.ac.kr,"House, Lisa/V-5724-2017",,,,,,37,8,9,4,32,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The current stage of European integration is based on political constructivism and it is characterized by the dominance of politics over economy, which in some aspects of the system resembles the communist economy system, which was an extreme distortion of the relationship between politics and economy. The unification model of European integration does not help the weaker European Union countries, for it forces them to use various forms of standardization that brings high (often hidden) costs (exceeding profits). The article notes that the main prize in the economy is the exchange rate. The reason for the imbalances within the monetary union is a non-optimal exchange rate for each member country too overvalued rate of Greece, but also too undervalued rate of Germany. The text also discusses limitations (systemic and political) and inability to perform adequate internal devaluation and systematic (not just partial, parametric) reforms in Greece. The congenital structural differences among the EU countries and the impossibility of the exchange rate adaptation lead to a systemic Eurozone defect, which results in a fact, that it is not (and, in the present composition, it even cannot be) an optimal currency area.","[Klaus, Vaclav] Ops, Inst Vaclava Klause, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Klaus, V (通讯作者)，Ops, Inst Vaclava Klause, Prague, Czech Republic.",office_@institutvk.cz,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,21,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Against this background, the search for alternative fermentation substrates has been intensified. Because of this development and the increasing problems of nutrient surpluses in regions characterized by high livestock densities, slurry solids have increasingly been taken into consideration as fermentation substrates. So far there has been very little knowledge about biogas plant operators' willingness to accept solids from slurry separation as fermentation substrates. To close this research gap, this study empirically identifies determinants of plant operators' willingness to use slurry solids. The research framework is a model inspired by the Technology Acceptance Model 2 by VENKATESH and DAVIS (2000). For data analysis, the partial least squares method (PLS) was used. The results show that the operators are generally interested in slurry solids but only a few are actually willing to use this substrate. 53 % of the intention to use manure solids and 68 % of the usage behavior could be explained by the model. Important decision criteria are the costs, the legal environment as well as the biogas plant operators' risk attitudes and openness for innovations.","[Kroeger, Rhena; Konerding, Jan Robert; Theuvsen, Ludwig] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,"Theuvsen, L (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",theuvsen@uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,83,12,12,0,2,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The complexity rises in relation to economics, organization, and technology. To be successful, each enterprise has to know and to manage its opportunities and risks. In this paper, we will focus on cultural risks related to management and leadership, with the notion to stay successful on the free market. According to Henry Ford, success arises when having exactly the capability that is asked for in the moment. Therefore, an enterprise has to be organized agile, called AOE. Agile enterprises have trust-based relationships with their customers and suppliers. Human productiveness is the essential resource for agile enterprises, not the technology, not the work, not the equipment. AOE handle changes and challenges in a dynamic and energetic fashion. In order to be able to cope with these new realities, an AOE makes sure that the employees have a sense of safety and appreciation at work. The management of an AOE establishes possibilities for the staff to do the work without anger in case of mistakes. There is a need to feel safe from workplace bullying or inadequate pressure. Therefore, communication and cooperation are the bases for a comfortable workspace - more so than corporate identity or financial / seasonal / promotional ways of motivation. Educating a specialist or finding proper team member costs money and time if you even find them on the market, so the management of an AOE has to avoid the departure of team members. The favored culture within an AOE has to eliminate bullying, gossiping, and other kinds of illicit behavior - but also to establish teams that are diverse in capabilities and personalities to aid one another and respect everybody. We have to take into account that there won't be enough time to settle all details and changes in writing, nor to be angry if something is going differently than planned. To capture opportunities there is also the need to think about improvement continuously. All these necessities have to be configured for a long-time perspective. The main question is how we can support all these upcoming changes within risk management. In our paper, we will discuss the content of the guidelines, the formation and changing processes to adapt guidelines, methods and techniques, the strategies of communication and the necessity for the management to exemplify these values within their own life. At last, we will show the expected impacts on enterprises, on human beings and on society.","[Kuhn, Elvira] Trier Univ Appl Sci, D-54293 Trier, Germany",,"Kuhn, E (通讯作者)，Trier Univ Appl Sci, D-54293 Trier, Germany.",elvykuhn@aol.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,17,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,703,714,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300058,0

The overwhelming research goals were (1) to evaluate Latvian entrepreneurs' understanding about the concept of intellectual capital investments, and (2) to define factors affecting the level of intellectual capital investments in the Latvian business environment. Methodology/methods The survey among 203 respondents, representing different sectors of Latvian economy, was conducted, using the questionnaire specially designed for research purposes. Latvian entrepreneurs were offered to evaluate the pre-formulated outcomes from IC investments in according to their subjective perceived importance of each, using 4-point scale. The received data was processed, applying such methods, as analysis of means, ranking and principal components analysis (PCA), in SPSS 19.0 environment. Scientific aim Scientific aim of the paper is to fill the gap in literature regarding the concept of intellectual capital investments. Despite the huge number of IC-related papers, the term intellectual capital investments is not so popular among the researchers. In the given paper the authors focused on predicted outcomes from intellectual capital investments and on the importance of these outcomes, perceived by the surveyed Latvian entrepreneurs. Findings Profit growth was evaluated by Latvian entrepreneurs as the most important predicted outcome from IC investments. However, customer satisfaction was also rated among the important ones. The PCA yielded four components, namely intangible outcomes, financials, efficiency and employees value. Conclusions Despite the fact that financial outcome was prioritised, non-financial outcomes were also highly rated by most of respondents. Considering that research sample was limited by the number of respondents and represented sectors, the survey could be iterated in another business environment. Besides, the revealed components could involve more predetermined items to test the reliability of the received results.","[Lentjusenkova, Oksana; Lapina, Inga] Riga Tech Univ, Kalnciema 6, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia; [Titko, Jelena] Univ Coll Econ & Culture, Lomonosova 1-5, LV-1019 Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University; EKA University of Applied Sciences,"Titko, J (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Econ & Culture, Lomonosova 1-5, LV-1019 Riga, Latvia.",jelena.titko@inbox.lv,"Lapina, Inga/D-3014-2014; Lentjušenkova, Oksana/O-4897-2019; Titko, Jelena/W-3824-2019; Lentjušenkova, Oksana/T-9147-2018","Lapina, Inga/0000-0003-3019-2472; Lentjušenkova, Oksana/0000-0002-6494-1534; Titko, Jelena/0000-0003-1333-0941;",National Research Program 5.2.

We show that an increase in the entrusted loans increases the bank's interest margin, equity risk, and the liability of deposit insurer. Entrusted loans can help spur bank equity return, but there is a trade-off in terms of reduced banking stability. We also find that the reduced margin and the increased equity risk by capital regulation are reinforced when the bank additionally conducts entrusted lending activities. Relaxing regulatory capital requirements may produce superior return performance and greater safety for the bank carrying on shadow-banking entrusted loans. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, it is an important role to the analysis of economic growth and inflation. It is a good method to make a precise economic development plan to predict the total GDP in 2016. Therefore, the total GDP of Mongolia prediction research is of great economic and practical significance. The prediction method includes gray model GM (1, 1) method, a geometric growth, exponential smoothing method that have different characteristics. For example, the advantage of exponential smoothing method is that it can use a special weighted average method for data to achieve the purpose of prediction [1]. Using exponential smoothing method do not have to quantitative study of the inner factor and their interconnections of complex systems, but only need to find useful information from the time itself. The basic principle is to give greater weight for older data and give less weight for the earlier data. In this situation, the earlier data can have less affect to prediction results and the recent data can have greater effect to the prediction results. It is full of strong rationality and science and suitable for short-term forecasting.

Intellectual Capital (IC) is a strategic resource. It summarizes the intangible values at universities because it has a function of self-analysis. As such, it is necessary to recognize the different links between various IC types in order to have a useful model to contribute to active knowledge management and create competitive advantages in public universities in Mexico. Objective: To propose an IC model for Mexican universities aiming to support IC measurement and management approaches as part of strategic management. Hypothesis: There are interrelationships between Human Capital (HC), Static Structural Capital (SSC), Dynamic Structural Capital (DSC) and Relational Capital (RC) in a Mexican university. Design/methodology/approach: Data was gathered by means of survey integrated by 18 items comprising a Guthman type scale with alternative answer options ranging from 1 to 10 on a line that represents the opposites of continuum descriptors (adequate-inadequate). The sample was non-probabilistic sample (n= 187), and it contained managers and academic professors from a Mexican university. The reliability of the measurement scales (Cronbach alpha) was greater than 0.85. LISREL 9.2 was employed to conduct confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in all IC constructs and partial least squares (PLS) was employed to assess the measurement model and test the research hypothesis. The model goodness of fit indices were acceptable (RMEA=.0515, NNFI=.973, PNFI=.700, GFI=.932). Conclusions: This model might help to improve the management of IC at Mexican universities because it provides high quality information. To be effective, IC management has to cope with some managerial attitudes (e.g. from a college authorities) and political barriers.","[Mercado-Salgado, Patricia; Arturo Cernas-Ortiz, Daniel] Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico Toluca, Fac Contaduria & Adm, Coordinac Invest & Estudios Posgrad, Toluca, Mexico; [Gil-Monte, Pedro] Univ Valencia, Fac Psicol, Dept Psicol Social, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Mercado-Salgado, P (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Estado Mexico Toluca, Fac Contaduria & Adm, Coordinac Invest & Estudios Posgrad, Toluca, Mexico.",pat_mersal@yahoo.com; danielarturoc@yahoo.com.mx; Pedro.Gil-Monte@uv.es,"Gil-Monte, Pedro R./C-7109-2008; Cernas Ortiz, Daniel A./P-3726-2019","Gil-Monte, Pedro R./0000-0002-2827-2388; Cernas Ortiz, Daniel A./0000-0001-7325-1968",,,,,25,2,2,0,0,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,172,177,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300022,0

The reason for the focus on maize and pigeonpea is because these products are key crops that contribute to household production, consumption and cash income in the study zones. A Multinomial Logit Analysis of a multistage sample of 562 smallholder farmers, who market maize and pigeonpea, showed that transaction costs, household wealth, access to credit and extension services, and social capital affect their choice of marketing channel. This outcome suggests that policies aimed at reducing transaction costs, improving access to productive assets, prudent use of credit, and promoting the use of well-organised farmer groups to access appropriate technology and information could enhance market access and better integrate smallholder farmers into markets in the study areas.","[Mmbando, F.

We found that an increase in farmers' terms-of-trade allowed relatively large crop-producing farmers to increase their investments at both extensive and intensive margins. Food price spikes had a significant income effect among farmers whose production surplus is large for market sales. During the food price crisis, large farmers particularly increased machine investments, which saved some labour inputs, pointing to the importance of complementarities between land and machine investments.","[Nose, Manabu] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Yamauchi, Futoshi] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",International Monetary Fund; The World Bank,"Nose, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, African Dept, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",MNose@imf.org,,,,,,,16,5,6,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Nevertheless, in the case of cross-border employment contracts may occur situations where this protection afforded to employee by national law may be lost. European Union law therefore grants protection to the employee by providing the special conflict rules in the ambit of individual employment contracts and the special rules on jurisdiction over individual contracts of employment. Besides protective mandatory rules, the weaker contractual position of the employee is also compensated by the overriding mandatory rules.

Hargreaves and Fullan (2012) purport that professional capital is comprised of three kinds of capital: human, social and decisional (p.3), and that human capital - having the requisite knowledge and skills (p.89), is dependent on the power of social capital to create and transfer knowledge in communities. In this study, pre-service teacher-candidates participated in weekly Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) facilitated by teacher-mentors. The positive impact of PLCs for teacher professional development has been noted in the literature, therefore this study sought to contribute to this body of knowledge by investigating a potential shift in the pre-service teacher mentoring model in teacher preparation programs from a traditional hierarchical model, to a collaborative and reflective model within a PLC context. The study explored the impact of teacher-candidates' participation in PLCs on their knowledge and implementation of research-based practices in education, their ability to reflect and collaborate with colleagues, and on their development of a professional identity. Using an ethnographic methodology, data was collected through participant-observation and analyzed through the lens of Kosnik and Beck's (2009) seven key elements for teacher preparation, and in consideration of Hargreaves and Fullan's (2012) work on professional capital. Results indicated that teacher-candidates found the PLC model for mentoring highly effective in developing their teacher efficacy, increasing their knowledge of curriculum, instructional and assessment practices, and developing their collaborative and reflective skills. The results of this study suggest that further exploration of PLCs utilizing a non-hierarchical mentoring model to build professional capital, may support the development of intellectual capital and on-going learning for both pre and in-service educators.","[Roland, Karen] Univ Windsor, Fac Educ, Windsor, ON, Canada; [Johnson, Sharon; Jones, Lori; Boyer, Cathy] Greater Essex Cty Dist Sch Board, Windsor, ON, Canada",University of Windsor,"Roland, K (通讯作者)，Univ Windsor, Fac Educ, Windsor, ON, Canada.",roland1@uwindsor.ca; sharon.johnson@publicboard.ca; lori.jones@publicboard.ca; cathy.boyer@publicboard.ca,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,9,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,231,239,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300029,0

There is a little doubt that the criteria of labour mobility was not met. On the other hand, capital mobility almost reached its limit. However, labour immobility was not substituted by effective allocation of capital. Moreover, both factors of production were not homogeneous within the Eurozone. To entirely confirm Mundell's criteria it is crucial to scrutinize not only the mobility of factors of production but also their homogeneity.","[Sima, Ondrej] Vysoka Skola Ekon, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Síma, O (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon, Prague, Czech Republic.",xsimo09@vse.cz,,,,,,,45,1,1,0,2,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

While the territorial structure became even more concentrated, the commodity structure became more diversified. The Czech trade is quite competitive especially in relation to the European countries, while the competitiveness in relation to other territories is limited. The significant weakness of the Czech agrarian trade is its inability to generate added value. The Czech agrarian trade comparative advantages are existing especially in relation to the following set of aggregations: Cereals, Live animals, Oil seeds, Tobacco products, Dairy products, Sugar, Vegetable oils, saps and plaiting materials, Milling products, Beverages and alcohol.

Within the last decades a range of new challenges appeared in Europe, such as security of supply of energy sources, climate change, lack of competition between energy companies, affordable energy prices, and other. The existing legal framework of the European Union (EU) does not already perfectly fit to the requirements of the current situation, and there is a clear need for retailoring the energy policy. The new era in the EU energy policy was launched by the Riga process at the beginning of 2015 and found its first highlights in the communication of the European Commission devoted to the Energy Union. The resilient Energy Union aims to ensure EU consumers secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy, defining the five main action directions (dimensions). The purpose of the paper is to analyze the possible impact of the new Energy Union strategy on the existing energy sector. Methodology/methods The generally accepted quantitative and qualitative methods of economic science, inter alia comparative analysis, parameter estimation, grouping, economically mathematical modelling, synthesis, inductive, deductive, logically constructive and expert evaluation methods have been used for the research. Scientific aim is to provide an outlook on existing EU energy system, describe the approach proposed by the Energy Union and with a help of the GAMES model demonstrate how the five dimensions adjust the current situation to the new priorities. Findings The main findings of the research show that the Energy Union is a strong tool with a high potential to change the situation in the energy sector of the entire European Union and each its member state. The 5th freedom of the EU - free movement of energy, becomes a reality after building up physical infrastructure (hardware) connecting energy islands with capable bridges and adjusting legislation (software) in order to eliminate unjustified roadblocks and develope a proper market design. Cocnlusion The results of the data analysis and the GAMES model demonstrated that the proposed by the Energy Union strategy solutions have a high potential for changing the directions of energy flow within the EU and outside its borders by stimulating the local generation, building new infrastructure and strengthening existing one, as well as integrating isolated markets into the common energy network. The concept of the Energy Union is still young and should be further developed by the EU member states.","[Bogdanova, Olga] Riga Int Sch Econ & Business Adm, 3 Meza St, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia; Riga Tech Univ, Kalnciema St 6, LV-1007 Riga, Latvia",RISEBA University of Applied Sciences; Riga Technical University,"Bogdanova, O (通讯作者)，Riga Int Sch Econ & Business Adm, 3 Meza St, LV-1048 Riga, Latvia.",nameolga@yahoo.co.uk,"Spiridonovs, Jurijs/G-6164-2019","Spiridonovs, Jurijs/0000-0003-2504-8679",,,,,16,1,1,0,3,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,409,415,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200051,0

It is also assumed that optimization is inherent of tourism enterprises, considering that in order to compete successfully, their activity must be optimized, according to the environmental dynamics, while taking into account the limit of the available resources Methodology/methods Optimization can be done through continuous improvement or reengineering. In the article, the general formulation of the optimization problem is based on the assumption that each object/site (in this case, tourism enterprises), is characterized by X input and Y output parameters, defining its status in due time. These parameters associated with system functions, compile the mathematical model. Scientific aim Here, the subject of research is the tour operator agency and the managerial influences exerted on it, i.e. the internally integrated set of contents, organizational forms, actions and managerial methods used and developed with regard to the business. They are mutually determined and ensure the achievement of the goal set - deducing a specific model to be applied for the improvement of the tour operator agency management for the needs of its sustainable and competitive functioning. Findings The optimization process is part of the tour operators' activity and life cycle. Wide spread belief is that optimization extends only to pure technological aspects of the process and ignores the other lesser important issues, such as management and tourism competitiveness. The above stated is a result of the presumption that the primarily effects of the optimization can be obtained only by hi-technical equipment, ignoring the usage of a variety of elements implemented directly or indirectly in the tourism products, businesses and destinations life's cycle. Conclusions The optimization model of a given system - in this case a tour operator's agency - builds up abstractly and in a simplified way its actual parameters. It also sustains the clarification about the interrelations between the work processes, information flows, production times, costs, capacity, influencing decisively tour operators' competitiveness.","[Stankova, Mariya; Kaleichev, Svetoslav] South West Univ Neofit Rilski, Fac Econ, Dept Tourism, 2 Krali Marco Str, Blagoevgrad 2700, Bulgaria",South-West University - Bulgaria,"Kaleichev, S (通讯作者)，South West Univ Neofit Rilski, Fac Econ, Dept Tourism, 2 Krali Marco Str, Blagoevgrad 2700, Bulgaria.",mzlstan@yahoo.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,4,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,729,736,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200090,0

Methodology/methods The main research method used was the comparative analysis of scientific literature. Individual components of the proposed theoretical model were developed on the basis of the meme concept (Dawkins, 1976), the concept of cultural selection (Aunger, 2000), the models of behaviour of social networks users (SN) AIDAT (Charlesworth, 2012) and COBRA (Muntinga et al., 2011). In order to synthesize the obtained results and develop the objectives of the future model the inductive-deductive method was used Scientific aim The scientific aim of the work is to create a theoretical basis for building a model of the memetic management of the tourist social networks content. As a basis for discussion, the occurrence of the memetic nature of the photographs shared within virtual communities was assumed. The analysis of scientific literature has demonstrated the existence of research gaps related to the lack of scientific publications relating to the management of the selected social network content focused on memetic approach. Findings The proposed theoretical model was based was on the theory of memes as replicating units of cultural evolution. The elements of memetic content are observed within the photographs shared in tourist social networks. The essence of the proposed solution was to develop theoretical cause-effect relationships in the management of the content shared within the tourist social networks. On the basis of the study of literature, a number of relationships between the theory of memes, the process of gathering information by the group, and the way of forming the user activity within the community were developed. Conclusions The presented study provides a contribution to the construction of theoretical assumptions for studying the evolution of the subject of photographs appearing in the tourist SN in the context of the theory of memes. At the same time the developed model can serve as a theoretical basis for: a. creation of the image of the destination and its management, targeted for specific attributes; b. creation of desirable tourist behaviour in the context of the choice of the form of tourist activity in a particular place; c. examination of the flow and pace of mutation of the memes within a social network; d. indication of the factors determining the evolutionary success of the memetic content of photographs; e. analysis of the evolutionary processes of the entire virtual community.","[Stepaniuk, Krzysztof] Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A St, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Stepaniuk, K (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A St, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",k.stepaniuk@pb.edu.pl,"Stepaniuk, Krzysztof/Q-2738-2018","Stepaniuk, Krzysztof/0000-0003-4071-1053",,,,,33,0,0,1,1,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,221,228,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200026,0

Main goal of the paper is to reveal implementation, transmission channels and risks associated with the negative interest rates. Implementation was successful within the existing framework of the current monetary policy. Negative effective interest rate has been reflected in sharp drop of governments yield curve and mortgage rates. According current constellation of negative interest rates, monetary effect outperforms potential unintended impacts. On the other side, there are many risks mainly for financial stability and financial market functioning, if negative interest rates will be under effective zero lower bound or will persists for an extended period.","[Titze, Miroslav] Vysoka Skola Ekon, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Titze, M (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic.",xtitm02@vse.cz,,,,,,,25,0,0,2,28,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Focusing on factors related to Intellectual Property (IP) rights, this paper gives a contribution in defining a theoretical framework useful to highlight the main differences between ASOs and CSOs, identifying the impact of these differences on their growth rates. In particular, the paper describes the technology exploitation process used by Academic and Corporate Spin-Offs, extracting phases and IP strategies adopted in both cases. The framework contributes to demonstrate if and how different IP strategies implemented by ASOs and CSOs have an effect on their growth rate, in the attempt to support or not a recent point of view of some scholars that observe higher success rates in independent companies compared to academic ones.","[Toma, Antonio; Secundo, Giustina; Passiante, Giuseppina] Univ Salento, Dept Innovat Engn, Lecce, Italy",University of Salento,"Toma, A (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Innovat Engn, Lecce, Italy.",antonio.toma@unisalento.it; giusy.secundo@unisalento.it; giuseppina.passiante@unisalento.it,"Toma, Antonio/K-4912-2019",,,,,,27,1,1,0,3,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,285,293,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300035,0

PEVs connected to the grid with smart charging strategies can be an effective way to integrate non-dispatchable renewable generation, smoothing the load curve, contributing to the system stability by providing regulation services, and moving unhealthy emissions away from city centers. This paper analyzes the combined penetration of PEVs, and wind and solar generation using a Unit Commitment model for the Spanish power system, providing some insight on how the penetration of these technologies affects relevant variables such as energy and reserve, thermal plants behavior (such as starts-up and shut-downs, technological energy share, generation costs or emissions) and systems costs. Results show that PEV increase total demand, but its optimal charging smooths the net demand (to be supplied by thermal units) and the final electricity prices. In addition, solar generation penetration leads to a larger net demand with more variability but with lower production costs than wind generation penetration, due to their different hourly profiles. Finally neither solar nor wind generation penetrations are totally profitable for the system with the assumptions made, since their investments costs do not compensate the production cost decrement, but grid parity is almost reached for both technologies.

This method is asymptotically more efficient than the Gaussian QML method under conditional nonnormality. This relative efficiency is obtained by exploiting the information of the multivariate conditional third and fourth moments, and is important because conditional nonnormality is a stylized fact of financial returns. We also demonstrate how to implement the OptEF method by updating the two-step variant of the Gaussian QML method under an independence assumption. This assumption requires that the true model be a constant CC model. Without this assumption, the updated statistic is still asymptotically valid, but can only be viewed as an approximation to the OptEF estimator. By focusing on the constant CC models with different dimensions, we also conduct a simulation study to confirm our theoretical results, and provide two empirical examples of dynamic spot-futures hedging and dynamic variance-minimum portfolios.","Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 11529, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chen, YT (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.",ytchen@sinica.edu.tw,,,National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC 98-2410-H-001-028],"National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","I am indebted to the Editor, Eric Ghysels, and two anonymous referees for their extensive comments and valuable suggestions that led to substantial improvements in this article.

Bivariate two state versions of the models are applied to a futures hedge of the S&P500. Regime switches occur between high and low cost of carry states via changes in the error correction term or basis. Regime identification is therefore dominated by switches in the mean, not volatility. Relative to a number of alternatives, the proposed models provide superior out of sample forecasts of the covariance matrix particularly for horizons greater than 10 days ahead. When hedging, Markov switching with long memory improves the tail risk of hedged returns beyond 10 day horizons, however there is mixed support for models with volatility asymmetries. These findings have important implications for the development of multivariate models and other applications including portfolio management, spread option pricing and arbitrage.

Since the shape of the relation between ownership and firm value is a controversial issue in corporate finance, we use semiparametric local-linear kernel-based panel models. These models allow us not to impose a priori functional restrictions on the relation between ownership and performance. Our semiparametric analysis shows that the effect on performance varies depending on the size of ownership stakes and that there are departures from linearity, especially in family firms. Our results suggest that this non-linearity in family firms is related to whether or not the CEO is a family member. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We analyze the effectiveness of three ways of providing e-commerce firms guidance about the legal rules on information disclosure. The initial non-compliance is considerable. In two interventions, firm-specific guidance is given by post mail and by e-mail, respectively; in another intervention, guidance on industry level is given by means of dedicated publications and presentations. In all cases, the guidance was given on behalf of the regulatory authority. The effectiveness of the firm-specific guidance is measured through a randomized field experiment, while for the industry guidance a panel analysis is conducted. We find that sending the firms a letter by post mail slightly improved firm compliance, but overall the various forms of guidance appear to be ineffective. Although information-related interventions are commonly used in practice, such regulatory interventions can fail to influence the behavior of SMEs.","[Huizingh, Eelko; Mulder, Machiel] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands; [Mulder, Machiel] Author Consumers & Markets, NL-2500 BH The Hague, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Mulder, M (通讯作者)，Author Consumers & Markets, POB 16326, NL-2500 BH The Hague, Netherlands.",k.r.e.huizingh@rug.nl; machiel.mulder@acm.nl,,"Huizingh, Eelko/0000-0002-0757-1055; Mulder, Machiel/0000-0003-4175-6915",Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM),Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM),The authors thank Klaas van der Veen and Sigourney Zomer for their research support.

The method is less susceptible to specification error than standard hedonic methods and is not subject to the sample selection bias involved in indexes that rely only on repeat sales. The methodology employs a model design that uses a sale pairing process based on the individual building level, rather than the individual house level as is used in the repeat-sales method. The approach extends ideas from repeat-sales methodology in a way that accommodates much wider datasets. In an empirical analysis of the methodology, we fit the model to the private residential property market in Singapore between Q1 1995 and Q2 2014, covering several periods of major price fluctuation and changes in government macroprudential policy. The index is found to perform much better in out-of-sample prediction exercises than either the S&P/Case-Shiller index or the index based on standard hedonic methods. In a further empirical application, the recursive dating method of Phillips et al. (2015a,b) is used to detect explosive behavior in the Singapore real estate market. Explosive behavior in the new index is found to arise two quarters earlier than in the other indices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Jiang, Liang; Phillips, Peter C.

This assumption implies that legislators are forward-looking and are motivated by a concern over what their re-election constituency will look like during their next electoral cycle. In this research, we show how the forward-looking nature of legislators motivates members of the U.S. House of Representatives to represent both their home district and their neighboring districts in their choices regarding when to support their own party. Using survey responses to the 2006, 2008, and 2010 Cooperative Congressional Elections Study to construct measures of Congressional District ideology, empirical analysis is strongly supportive of our claims. Legislators' choices are strongly influenced both by the ideology of their home district and that of the districts that neighbor their home district. Thus, the electoral connection between citizens and representatives extends beyond a legislator's own constituents to include the constituents in neighboring districts.","[Kirkland, Justin H.; Williams, R.

J,"Matsuoka, H",,,,"Matsuoka, Hideaki",,,Fiscal limits and sovereign default risk in Japan,JOURNAL OF THE JAPANESE AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,The distribution of fiscal limits; Sovereign risk premium,DEBT; SUSTAINABILITY,"It is widely known that Japan has the highest debt-to-GDP ratio among OECD countries. If Japan's national debt continues to balloon, fiscal crisis may occur in the future. This paper develops a closed economy model with defaultable government debt and conducts a simulation to investigate future sovereign debt risk. First, we estimate the fiscal limit which is defined as the sum of the discounted maximum fiscal surplus in all future periods. It is assumed that a partial default occurs when the amount of government debt exceeds the fiscal limit. We calculate the revenue-maximizing tax rate at the peak of the Laffer curve to derive the fiscal limit. As a result, the estimated average fiscal limit in Japan is much higher than that in Greece. In the Japanese economy, households are more patient and desire greater savings from greater discount factor derived from a lower real interest rate. Household saving habits support government bonds. This is the main reason why the Japanese government could have had a massive debt in addition to some room to raise the tax rate. Second, we simulate the model, using the estimated fiscal limit and non-linear computational methods. If the government debt-to-GDP ratio continues to increase for the next 20 years, the default probability will be over 10% and the sovereign risk premium will be approximately 2%. Furthermore, the default probability will reach approximately 80% and the sovereign risk premium will be 10% 30 years later. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we examine how the Big Five personality traits are related to measures of young adults' financial distress. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health in the United States, we find that conscientiousness is negatively correlated, and neuroticism positively correlated with financial distress. These correlations are robust to controlling for early life background and Other demographic and socioeconomic factors.

Lendable supply increases with expected borrowing costs and decreases with financial statement constructs that indicate overvaluation. Although rising loan fees help ease supply constraints, we find shares are still least available when they are most attractive to short sellers. Using a number of firm characteristics, we derive useful instruments for real-time loan supply and demand conditions in the lending market. Further, we show that (1) when lendable supply is binding (non-binding), short-sale supply (demand) is the main predictor of future stock returns, (2) abnormal returns to the short-side of nine well-known market anomalies are attributable solely to special stocks, and (3) loan fees significantly reduce the profitability of the short side and several of these anomalies cease to be profitable. Overall our evidence highlights the central role played by the supply of lendable shares in equity price formation and returns prediction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Beneish, M.

The southern economy is characterized by open urban unemployment and rural-urban migration, a competitive agricultural sector and a monopolistically competitive manufacturing sector. Hence, there is potential for both inter- and intra-industry trade to arise on liberalization, in addition to distortionary effects of duality. Southern comparative advantage in agriculture may arise from the labor market distortion and the basis for intra-industry trade is love for variety. We characterize various configurations of the trade pattern, and the resulting welfare consequences of opening to trade in this context. We illustrate a new mechanism under which in some circumstances it may be possible for trade liberalization to lower economic welfare in the South.","[Gilbert, John] Utah State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Beladi, Hamid] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Oladi, Reza] Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Gilbert, J (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 3565 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",jgilbert@usu.edu,"Gilbert, John P/A-9031-2009; Oladi, Reza/AAA-7218-2019","Oladi, Reza/0000-0002-4621-7622",,,,,20,4,4,1,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The model has two key ingredients. First, liquidity in the banking sector is endogenous, so there is an opportunity cost of holding liquid assets. Second, banks are privately informed about the risk of their long-term assets, which can lead to adverse selection and high interest rates in the interbank market. We identify a novel form of a market break-down, which can lead to liquidity hoarding. It arises because adverse selection in the interbank market changes the opportunity cost of holding liquidity. We use the model to shed light on developments in interbank markets prior to and during the 2007-09 financial crisis, as well as the effectiveness of policy interventions aimed at restoring interbank market activity.

Assuming boards are concerned about providing higher quality financial information, they should discourage managers from adjusting earnings to beat the target if adjustment diminishes earnings quality.

Thereby, we utilize a sample of 468 listed firms with female CEOs and a matched sample of firms with male CEOs during 2007-2011. We then make a distinction between listed SOEs and non-SOEs in China. The empirical results show that female CEOs are associated with a higher level of corporate cash holdings, especially in Chinese listed non-SOEs. Compared with their male counterparts, female CEOs are more concerned with the precautionary motive of cash, while they care less about the opportunity cost of cash. Besides, we find that female CEOs moderate the over-investment problem of free cash flow, again indicating that they are more conservative than their male counterparts.

We decompose Treasury yields into inflation expectations and maturity-specific interest-rate cycles, which we define as variation in yields orthogonal to expected inflation. The short-maturity cycle captures the real short-rate dynamics. Jointly with expected inflation, it comprises the expectations hypothesis (EH) term in the yield curve. Controlling for the EH term, we extract a measure of risk-premium variation from yields. The risk-premium factor forecasts excess bond returns in and out of sample and subsumes the common bond return predictor obtained as a linear combination of forward rates.","[Cieslak, Anna] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60201 USA; [Povala, Pavol] Univ London Birkbeck Coll, London WC1E 7HX, England",Northwestern University; University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Cieslak, A (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60201 USA.",a-cieslak@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,58,80,91,4,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

In this article, we look at the effect of two tax events: a 5.5% sales tax on soft drinks imposed by the state of Maine in 1991 and a 5% sales tax on soft drinks levied in Ohio in 2003. We investigate this question by using sales data collected by scanner devices in the two states, where soda taxes where enacted as well as on neighboring states. We employ a difference-in-difference matching estimator (DIDM) that, in our setting, permits the comparison among treatment and control groups based on brand identity. Results suggest that neither sales tax had a statistically significant impact on the consumption of soft drinks. This finding is robust to several alternative specifications.

The only exceptions are interest rate decisions in the respondent's home region. In general, the Fed is watched most closely, followed by the ECB, the BoJ, and the BoE. Second, ordered probit estimations reveal that the perceived reliability of media coverage is negatively associated with degree of self-monitoring and positively related to the probability of using media reports, particularly in the case of asset managers. The perceived importance of central bank events is positively related to the degree of self-monitoring in the case of traders.

For this purpose, we use firm-level data from firms in France operating in different services sectors over the time period 1998-2007 and formulate two-part models consisting of (1) (dynamic) export equations and (2) (dynamic) export share equations. Our results confirm the view that a relatively low share of SMEs engages in services trade. In line with the new-new trade theory, our results also corroborate that more productive SMEs have a higher export probability. The key finding of this paper is that the export decisions of SMEs in services sectors are estimated to be extremely persistent, implying that trade policy efforts, including the allocation of scarce trade promotion budgets, should be directed at addressing the barriers faced in establishing the first export operation. Finally, our sub-sectoral estimates reveal considerable heterogeneity across different types of services.","[Lejarraga, Iza] OECD, Directorate Financial & Enterprise Affairs, Investment Div, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Oberhofer, Harald] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Oberhofer, Harald] Austrian Inst Econ Res, Arsenal, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Oberhofer, H (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",Iza.Lejarraga@oecd.org; Harald.Oberhofer@wu.ac.at,,"Oberhofer, Harald/0000-0003-1575-7164",,,,,62,18,21,1,46,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Here, these dynamics are modeled at a monthly scale to provide an open-access spatio-temporally resolved data source for research purposes (www.vbd-air.com/data). By refining an annual-scale model of Huang et al. (2013), we developed a set of Poisson regression models to predict monthly passenger volumes between directly connected airports during 2010. The models not only performed well in the United States with an overall accuracy of 93%, but also showed a reasonable confidence in estimating air passenger volumes in other regions of the world. Using the model outcomes, this research studied the spatio-temporal dynamics in the world airline network (WAN) that previous analyses were unable to capture. Findings on the monthly variation of WAN offer new knowledge for dynamic planning and strategy design to address global issues, such as disease pandemics and climate change. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We show that variations in the discount factor estimated using inventories, which may be interpreted as fluctuations in a generalized investment wedge, play a key role in explaining the shifts in U.S. business cycles observed after the mid-1980s.

Our findings exemplify the importance of small cap firms' liquidity in explaining the state of the economy and support the flight-to-quality argument.

We show that social welfare may be maximized by keeping some markets untaxed, even when it is still possible to collect positive net tax revenues from additional markets. The unequal burden of the tax policy can lead to negative externalities due to the inequality in consumption across individuals. A nonwelfarist planner could restrain taxation to avoid greater inequality, leading to lower provision of the public good.

This study on 18 emerging markets finds that individual stock liquidity is more affected by systematic volatility than by idiosyncratic volatility, suggesting that higher commonality in liquidity in emerging markets could be caused by higher co-variation in stock volatility and co-variation in inventory risk. Consistent with this conjecture, commonality in liquidity is found to be positively related to co-movement in volatility, and negatively related to the level of development of the financial markets. This study also documents that liquidity co-movement across emerging markets has a strong geographic component and is related to a correlation in market-wide volatility. The results do not support the presence of a global liquidity factor, and suggest that liquidity risk can be diversified by constructing global portfolios. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

While their analysis explores the determinants of negative campaign spending using a classic spatial voting model, this paper relies instead on a probabilistic votingmodel, extending the use of this popular model to a new setting. The main lesson of the analysis is that negative campaign spending is higher for the relatively more-centrist candidate. The more-extreme candidate in the electoral contest devotes, by contrast, comparatively more of her funds to positive campaign spending. This result, which at first appears unrelated to the main findings of Harrington and Hess (Games Econ Behav 17: 209-229, 1996) and Chakrabarti (Scottish J Polit Econ 54: 136-149, 2007), actually can be viewed as aligning with their conclusions, although the underlying mechanics are very different.

Based on 2964 announcements from 1985 to 2011, we find that joint ventures and strategic alliances create significant value for bondholders. The average two-month abnormal bond return is 0.64% for joint ventures and 0.70% for strategic alliances. We find no evidence of a wealth transfer between the bondholders and stockholders. We further explore the determinants of bond value creation through hypotheses on the synergy effect, the alleviation of financial constraints, and real options. The results of our study show that financial synergy is a main driver of bondholder wealth effects in joint ventures, while operating synergy is a dominant factor in strategic alliances. We also find evidence to support the real option hypothesis for both events. Finally, we show that the structure of bond contracts plays an important role in the link between synergy and abnormal bond returns. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In equilibrium, firms default with positive probability and their assets are liquidated at fire-sale prices. The equilibrium features underinvestment and is constrained inefficient.

Everyone would like to free ride on the efforts of others, but there is disagreement over who is free riding. The Kyoto approach, based on dividing up emission rights, has an inherent problem in that such rights could easily reach a monetary value of over a trillion dollars a year The approach suggested here avoids any attempt at a grand solution to the fair allocation of these rights. A low-carbon economy could be achieved through the imposition of a moderate carbon price, which would raise substantial revenue and allow a reduction in other taxes, thereby keeping the deadweight loss small. Countries should be given flexibility in how they meet their obligations whether through a carbon tax, a system of cap and trade, or even possibly certain regulatory mechanisms. But a fully voluntary agreement likely cannot include countries that export a significant amount of fossil fuel. A green fund financed by allocating say 20% of carbon revenues collected in developed countries could be used to implement differentiated responsibilities.","Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Stiglitz, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,9,27,30,1,32,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

We present spillover tables and indices that demonstrate financial stress innovations to and from other indices, in addition to spillover plots that show the dynamics of stress. Furthermore, we examine the relationship between financial stability and macroeconomic fundamentals by investigating the effects of financial stress on growth and on price levels. We proxy financial stability and monetary stability with a financial stress index (FSI) and a consumer price index (CPI), respectively, and examine their interdependence. Our findings indicate that the securities markets are the main net transmitters of stress to the other markets. In addition, up to 42.8% of the forecast error variance in all the markets examined emanates from stress spillovers. Finally, our findings highlight the interrelationship of financial and monetary stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

NASDAQ fluctuations during the book-building phase are used as an instrument for IPO completion. Using patent-based metrics, I find that the quality of internal innovation declines following the IPO, and firms experience both an exodus of skilled inventors and a decline in the productivity of the remaining inventors. However, public firms attract new human capital and acquire external innovation.

We find a strong association, and that it is primarily due to higher HIV risk among violent men; neither women's decreased ability to protect themselves from HIV within marriage, nor their risky sexual behavior, explains the link. Thus, it is not violence per se that spreads HIV, but that violent men are more likely to become HIV positive and then infect their wives. Programs that aim at reducing HIV by eliminating IPV should therefore also focus on men's risky sexual behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The SLMOI is the activity, a set of institutions and processes for creating, communicating and maintaining the sustainable lifestyle of an individual (SLOI). The SLOI is an individual's sustainability-oriented pattern of living represented by his or her activities, interests and opinions. The SLOI refers to a sustainable pattern of life (daily activities within the family), a sustainable pattern of consumption, a sustainable pattern of work and production (as employees in organizations) and a sustainable pattern of behavior in the society and the environment they live in. The SLOI reflects an individual's choices with respect to spending time, money and energy in accordance with the sustainable pattern of life. The SLOI stands for sustainable behavioral patterns on the basis of attitudes and values. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the attitudes of the population towards sustainable lifestyles and the SLMOI (performed by different actors) and behaviors on the basis of attitudes. Using a face-to-face questionnaire interview, the study was conducted on a sample of 400 citizens of Serbia. There are three key conclusions. First, the SLMOI leads to the SLOI, and the SLOI further leads to sustainability. Second, the creation and maintenance of the SLOI is a long-term process. Third, a holistic approach is needed as well as the engagement of numerous actors in that process of creating and maintaining the SLOI.","[Rakic, Mira; Rakic, Beba] Megatrend Univ, Grad Sch Business Studies, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Rakic, M (通讯作者)，Megatrend Univ, Grad Sch Business Studies, Belgrade, Serbia.",rakic.mira@gmail.com,"Rakic, Beba/G-5252-2015; Rakic, Mira/M-7117-2015","Rakic, Beba/0000-0001-7779-4548; Rakic, Mira/0000-0003-4937-7645",,,,,29,18,19,1,40,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2015,17.0,40,,,,,891,908,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365317700004,0

In addition, we find that the strength of tariff pass-through was also affected by firm ownership: tariff pass-through was lower for products imported by Chinese state-owned enterprises than it was for products imported by foreign-owned enterprises (FOEs).

When controlling owners retain tight control of their firms by insufficient equity investment, the discrepancy between voting rights and cash flow rights induces an entrenchment problem and undermines minority shareholder protection. This study finds that the market reaction to share repurchase announcements is contingent on minority shareholder protection. The signaling effect of repurchase announcements is weak for firms subjected to poor minority shareholder protection, especially for the repurchase purposes of converting debt to equity and signaling undervaluation. Moreover, the results show that poor minority shareholder protection is negatively associated with the long-term operating performance following repurchase announcements. We also find that repurchasing firms with poor minority shareholder protection experience notably declines in R&D expenses, cash holdings, and inventory when they repurchase shares to convey undervaluation.","[Wu, Ruei-Shian] Yuan Ze Univ, Coll Management, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Wang, Chuan-San] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Management, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",Yuan Ze University; National Taiwan University,"Wang, CS (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Management, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",wangcs@ntu.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology,Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),This work was financially supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology.,,21,0,0,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

Using data for 1975 to 2009, reduced form and structural models are estimated. The results show that faced with situations of disequilibrium, prices adjust more rapidly than stocks. Similarly, they demonstrate that demand shows low sensitivity to variations in prices and real interest rates. By contrast, it is highly sensitive to demographic changes and the evolution of the labor market. The evidence confirms that permanent income has greater weight than prices as a determinant of demand. On the contrary, supply is highly sensitive to variations in prices and interest rates.","[Arrazola, Maria; de Hevia, Jose; Romero-Jordan, Desiderio] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid 28032, Spain; [Felix Sanz-Sanz, Jose] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid 28223, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Complutense University of Madrid,"Arrazola, M (通讯作者)，Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain.",maria.arrazola@urjc.es; jose.dehevia@urjc.es; desiderio.romero@urjc.es; jfelizs@ccee.ucm.es,"romero-jordán, desiderio/L-4219-2014; de Hevia, Jose/AAP-8798-2021; romero-jordán, desiderio/AAZ-2424-2020; Arrazola, María/AAP-8781-2021","de Hevia, Jose/0000-0002-8730-6269; romero-jordán, desiderio/0000-0002-5699-5364; Arrazola, María/0000-0002-4407-9510",,,,,75,10,10,0,8,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

These equilibria involve a run on the central bank's interest target, whereby money grows fast, private agents borrow as much as possible against the central bank, and the shadow interest rate is different from the policy target. We argue that these equilibria represent a particular danger when banks hold large excess reserves, such as is the case following periods of quantitative easing. Our analysis suggests that successfully managing the exit strategy requires additional tools beyond setting interest-rate targets and paying interest on reserves; in particular, freezing excess reserves or fiscal-policy intervention may be needed to fend off adverse expectations.

Military CEOs pursue lower corporate investment, are less likely to be involved in corporate fraudulent activity, and perform better during industry downturns.

We investigate if regulators, who can have an informational advantage relative to the potential entrant, support entry-deterring practices. The paper demonstrates that, while entry-deterring equilibria only emerge under restrictive conditions when the regulator is perfectly informed, these equilibria arise under larger settings as he becomes uninformed. Furthermore, we show that the regulator is willing to support the incumbent's entry-deterring practices regardless of his degree of information if entry costs are sufficiently high. However, when entry costs are lower, the regulator only sustains this type of practices if he is poorly informed.","[Espinola-Arredondo, Ana; Munoz-Garcia, Felix] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Washington State University,"Espínola-Arredondo, A (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, 111C Hulbert Hall, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",anaespinola@wsu.edu; fmunoz@wsu.edu,,"Espinola-Arredondo, Ana/0000-0002-5983-9527; Munoz-Garcia, Felix/0000-0001-6727-3618",,,,,24,3,4,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

In particular, political fractionalization has a greater impact on delays in periods of macroeconomic distress.

The analysis takes into account the scarcity of agricultural land and evaluates two public policies: a production quota reserved for domestic markets and imposed to exporters and a subsidy to producers specialized in domestic crop. We show how a minimum production quota reserved for domestic markets does not suffice, when practiced separately, to simultaneously satisfy food security and producers participation objectives. Conversely, a subsidy for producers specialized in domestic crop can satisfy those two objectives. A combination of these two instruments (subsidy and minimum domestic production quota) is more effective than a single intervention to increase the total available supply but less effective for improving the participation of local producers, which is better when only subsidy is used.","[Hammoudi, Abdelhakim; Hamza, Oualid; Migliore, Stefano] INRA, INRA ALISS Alimentat & Sci Sociales, F-94205 Ivry, France",INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay,"Hamza, O (通讯作者)，INRA, INRA ALISS Alimentat & Sci Sociales, 65 Bd Brandebourg, F-94205 Ivry, France.",hammoudi@ivry.inra.fr; oualid.hamza@ivry.inra.fr; stefano.migliore@ivry.inra.fr,,"Hammoudi, Abdelhakim/0000-0001-6887-1003",,,,,28,0,1,1,19,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

This paper employs a pooled regression technique that can distinguish between the impact on fund flow of raw performance and market-adjusted performance. This paper also investigates the impact of fund affiliation with large financial groups on the flow-performance sensitivity as the Japanese fund industry is often portrayed as being fee-hungry where large groups play an influential role. The primary determinant of future net fund flows is the fund's current raw return, which by itself can explain a large proportion of the variation in net fund flow. Hence, our model's estimates of future fund flows would be of practical use to investment managers when planning asset purchases and managing cash reserves. Interestingly, we find that if a fund is part of a large financial group then its fund flow is more sensitive to its performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using an instrument based on rural households' combination of market positions in four markets - land, labour, means of production and product - I identify five agrarian classes: the capitalist employer class, the petty-bourgeois class of commercial farmers, two labouring classes of dual-employment households and wage workers, and subsistence peasants. This classification is then used as a heuristic device to organize the empirical analysis that examines how dynamics of agrarian change drive class differentiation in rural China. For the capitalist employer class, the analysis focuses on their diverse paths of accumulation; for the petty-bourgeois commercial farmers, their contingent resilience and tendencies of differentiation; and for the two classes of labour, the commodification of their subsistence.

One mechanism with the potential to alleviate traffic congestion which requires further empirical research is ridesharing. Using national microdata on ridesharing from different regions of the United States and a novel multilevel methodology, the study explores how these two different approaches might best be balanced to promote ridesharing in the future. Results suggest that macroeconomic conditions in the form of historically high gasoline prices are conducive to ridesharing, but that most of the variation in ridesharing nationwide is attributable to differences in the economic, demographic, and social characteristics of commuters. Results also suggest that working women will be unduly disadvantaged by employer-based policies to promote ridesharing given the greater propensity to drive alone among (family and nonfamily) female householders. Further empirical research is necessary to more fully explore the intended and unintended consequences of other economically-oriented policy tools to promote ridesharing relative to other mode choices.

These models predict that the term structures of expected returns and volatilities on dividend strips (i.e., claims to dividends paid over a prespecified interval) are also upward sloping. However, the empirical evidence suggests otherwise. This discrepancy can be reconciled if these models replace their proposed dividend dynamics with processes that generate stationary leverage ratios. Under such policies, shareholders are forced to divest (invest) when leverage is low (high), which shifts risk from long- to short-horizon dividend strips.","[Belo, Frederico; Goldstein, Robert S.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Belo, Frederico; Collin-Dufresne, Pierre; Goldstein, Robert S.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Collin-Dufresne, Pierre] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Finance Inst, Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Bureau of Economic Research; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI),"Belo, F (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,,,,,,,69,46,55,4,58,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

This paper analyzes these linkages through an examination of both banking systems' foreign credit exposures and borrower countries' reliance on foreign bank credit. It does this by combining BIS data with bank-level data. The results indicate that the proposed refinements on measuring those two exposures are important, especially when foreign bank affiliates' funding relies heavily on local deposits. After developing novel and necessary break-in-series and exchange rate variation adjustments, estimations looking at the driving factors of both measures during 2006-2012 highlight: (i) the role of systemic banking crises and global financial conditions in the evolution of banks' foreign credit exposures; (ii) the role of a larger set of factors in the case of the evolution of borrower countries' reliance on foreign bank credit how countries borrowed, from whom they borrowed, and global financial and domestic demand conditions.

While efficacy of monetary policy depends on how banks create liquidity, the existing literature does not find any conclusive evidence that monetary policy variables explain aggregate bank liquidity creation. We use both stock market and the Treasury bond market liquidity as proxies for asset market liquidity, and find that: (1) asset market liquidity and credit-spreads explain aggregate bank liquidity creation and liquidity creation of larger banks; (2) stock market liquidity rather than credit-spreads or the Treasury bond market liquidity has robust and higher impact on aggregate liquidity creation; (3) while stock market liquidity better explains off-balance sheet liquidity creation, the short-term off-the-run Treasury bond liquidity has higher impact on on-balance sheet liquidity creation; (4) the Federal funds rate as a proxy for monetary policy impacts liquidity creation of smaller banks more than it does liquidity creation of larger banks.

Efforts are positively correlated but with a kink: agents follow a low-performing but not a high-performing peer. This contradicts major theories of social preferences which predict that efforts are unrelated, or negatively related.

We show that when the manager has stronger self-esteem concerns, it requires higher managerial ownership to induce effort. In equilibrium, the manager's net hedging position increases with the strength of the manager's self-esteem concerns. Each of managerial hedging and self-esteem concerns added to an otherwise standard agency model increases the equilibrium pay-performance sensitivity. The agency cost increases as the manager's self-esteem concerns become stronger, but the manager's access to hedging opportunities itself does not change the agency cost. We also discuss how our basic model can be extended to account for circumstances under which managerial hedging can affect firm value. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Our contribution to the literature is twofold: First, we extend the Ho and Saunders (1981) model to capture interest rate risk and expected returns from maturity transformation. Banks price interest risk according to their individual exposure separately in loan and deposit intermediation fees, but reduce (increase) these charges for loans (deposits) when positive excess holding period returns from long-term exposures are expected. Second, we test the model-derived hypotheses not only for the commonly investigated net interest margin but also for interest income and expense margins separately in a sample encompassing the German universal banking sector between 2000 and 2009. Our results suggest that banks price their individual interest rate risk and corresponding expected excess holding period returns via the asset side into the net interest margin. For liabilities, we find that interest rate risk exposure is only priced in by smaller, local banks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, compared to jump-in-growth models, jump-in-volatility models generate more realistic volatility dynamics and stronger predictability of returns by the variance risk premium. Finally, both jump-in-volatility and jump-in-growth models suggest that a nontrivial portion of the equity risk premium is due to compensation for jump risks.","Bank Canada, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Bank of Canada,"Jin, JJ (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",jianjin78@gmail.com,,,,,,,45,9,9,1,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

We find that borrower concentration is positively related to non-performing loans and negatively related to financial performance. We also find that the voting power of bank's controlling shareholder is positively related to the borrower concentration. The evidence is consistent with the view that controlling shareholders divert resources away from banks by extending a high volume of loans to a few related parties, which leads to high borrower concentration. Further evidence indicates that some seemingly unrelated large borrowers, as reported in the financial disclosure, are actually related to the controlling shareholders. We also provide evidence that going public mitigates the tunneling activities of controlling shareholders. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A benchmark model of laissez-faire economy shows that the chance of adoption increases in market size, a result ubiquitous in the paper. With optimal subsidy, adoption is more likely than in the laissez-faire economy. The chance is even higher if firms make adoption decisions before the government sets the tax rate. Negative externality of the commodity lowers the chance of adoption under optimal tax, but not below that in the laissez-faire economy unless the government moves first and the market is too small. However, if the new technology is clean, the chance of adoption can be significantly improved, even when the externality is only partially remedied. Moreover, a clean technology is more likely adopted than a technology without externality issue when the market is sufficiently large. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The paper provides a new structural economics perspective of such failures. The Washington Consensus reform failed to recognize that many firms in a transition economy were not viable in an open, competitive market because those industries went against the comparative advantages determined by the economy's endowment structure. Their survival relied on the government's protections and subsidies through various interventions and distortions. The Washington Consensus advised the government to focus their reforms on issues related to property rights, corporate governance, government interventions, and other issues that may obstruct a firm's normal management. Without resolving the firms' viability problem, such reforms led to the firms' collapse and an unintended decline and stagnation of the economy in the transition process. This paper suggests that the viability assumption in neoclassical economics be relaxed when analyzing development and transition issues in socialist, transition, and developing economies.","Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Lin, JY (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",justinlin@ccer.pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,100,38,41,2,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

The main reason for this important feature is the strict superrnartingale property of benchmarked savings accounts under the real world probability measure, which the calibrated parameters identify under the proposed model.

Focusing on if (as opposed to when) a forecast is given, we link insider selling to silence in advance of earnings disappointments. This raises the question of whether the absence of incriminating trading drives reductions in litigation risk potentially attributed to warnings. We find that the absence of a warning combined with the presence of selling exacerbates the consequences associated with the individual behaviors. Yet, selling prior to a warning typically does not offset all of the warning's benefit. In so doing, we supply the first robust evidence of a litigation benefit associated with warning.

Here we present a novel modelling framework for offset schemes which can be used in computable general equilibrium models to quantify the sector-specific and macroeconomic impacts of clean-development investments. Compared to conventional approaches that mimic offset schemes as sectoral emissions trading, our framework adopts a micro-consistent representation of an offset scheme's incentive structure and its investment characteristics. In our empirical application, we show that incentive compatibility implies that the offset-generating sectors do not suffer, and that overall cost savings from the offset scheme tend to be lower than suggested by conventional modelling approaches.","[Boehringer, Christoph; Springmann, Marco] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany; [Rutherford, Thomas F.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Springmann, M (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.",christoph.boehringer@uni-oldenburg.de; rutherford@aae.wisc.edu; marco.springmann@uni-oldenburg.de,,"Springmann, Marco/0000-0001-6028-5712",,,,,39,12,12,2,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We show that when these costs are calibrated to match the observed infrequency of households' trading, the model is able to generate patterns of portfolio stock allocation over age and wealth that are constant or moderately increasing, thus more in line with the existing empirical evidence.

Yeung, and Yu (2000), this paper investigates whether and how news commonality varies according to a country's institutional environments. Using a unique global news data set across 41 countries for the 20002009 period, we document three notable findings. First, firm-level news comoves more in countries with weaker institutional environments than in those with stronger institutional environments. Second, news commonality is positively associated with both stock return comovement and stock liquidity commonality. Third, the effect of news commonality on stock return and liquidity comovement is higher in countries with stronger institutions than in those with weaker institutions. These results suggest that a country's institutional environments affect firm-specific information production and, more importantly, support the information-efficiency view that lower price synchronicity is caused by greater capitalization of firm-specific information.

To do so, the paper addresses two empirical questions: (i) how travel time impacts families' strategies for choosing and using social services, and (ii) how service characteristics become part of the constraints families have to face when using services. Both questions refer to problems that are of time nature (e.g., long waiting hours or the imposition of additional tasks and travel to finally obtain access to the service). The use of a space time approach introduces a theoretical innovation for studying access to urban public social services in the region, shedding light on the micro-processes underneath macro-aggregated indicators. This is performed by examining in a qualitative manner the way in which space time constraints are distributed among different types of families and by looking at families' strategies for accessing services in a city like Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay. The empirical evidence is a qualitative study with 13 households with at least one child between 0 and 3 years of age. These households were selected from a purposive sample that allowed the study of a group of cases from different socioeconomic strata living in different geographical locations. The paper results suggest that households use travel time as an input to manage total time investment (travel plus participation) when defining a strategy to reach better services. In addition, empirical evidence reflects the distorting effects that uncertainty about the time to be spent in using the services may have on the activities of households. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

By contrast, in naturally occurring environments, investment decisions can often lead to a loss of one's own money. This paper investigates whether trust found in one-shot anonymous laboratory interaction is robust to own money environments. Our results show that, consistent with previous investment game results, most investors send a positive amount, and most trustees return at least the transfer amount, regardless of whether the investors purchase or are gifted their endowment. However, investments are on average lower when participants use their own money, and the fraction of maximum investments (the most risky investment decision) is only half as large under own money as it is under gifted endowments. Our results explain why one should exercise caution in placing trust in any government's ability to spend other people's money prudently.","[Houser, Daniel] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Houser, Daniel] George Mason Univ, Interdisciplinary Ctr Econ Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Xiao, Erte] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",George Mason University; George Mason University; Monash University,"Houser, D (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Univ Dr,MSN 1B2, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",dhouser@gmu.edu; erte.xiao@monash.edu,"Houser, Daniel/JXX-4326-2024","Xiao, Erte/0000-0002-3920-7979",,,,,31,7,9,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2015,163.0,1-2,,,SI,,187,199,,10.1007/s11127-014-0218-7,0.0,,,13,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CF6WW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352698400013,0

The problem is interesting due to differences in both available information and objectives at local and national levels. Generally, the national regulator is less informed than the local agency about the characteristics of the polluting agents. This leads to the use of uniform standards and the delegation of the enforcement activity to the local agency. On the one hand, the local agency partially corrects for the inefficiency caused by uniform standards by setting a differentiated inspection strategy. On the other hand, the level of the standard is distorted to partially correct for the inefficiency caused by the divergence between national and local objectives. The interactions between local and national decisions are influenced by the size of the divergence in objectives and the level of environmental damages.","[Arguedas, Carmen] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Rousseau, Sandra] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, CEDON, Brussels, Belgium",Autonomous University of Madrid; KU Leuven,"Arguedas, C (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",carmen.arguedas@uam.es,"Rousseau, Sandra/C-8723-2011; Arguedas, Carmen/H-4170-2016","Rousseau, Sandra/0000-0001-8948-8644; Arguedas, Carmen/0000-0002-2719-6918",Spanish Government [ECO2011-25349],Spanish Government(Spanish Government),"We wish to thank Anthony Heyes, two anonymous referees and the participants of the annual EAERE conference in Prague for very useful comments and suggestions on earlier drafts.

Our findings suggest that rural women's work-family experiences may be more constrained than urban women's work-family experiences.","[Glauber, Rebecca; Young, Justin Robert] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Sociol, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Glauber, R (通讯作者)，Univ New Hampshire, Dept Sociol, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",rebecca.glauber@unh.edu; jrobertyoung@gmail.com,,"Glauber, Rebecca/0000-0003-2397-576X",,,,,67,14,17,1,11,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

It finds capital requirements to be highly sensitive to whether key model parameters are calibrated on a point-in-time versus stress-period basis, whether the risk tolerance metric adequately captures tail-risk events, and the ability - or lack thereof - to define exposures on the basis of netting sets spanning multiple risk factors. Our results suggest that there are considerable benefits from prudential authorities adopting a more prescriptive approach to central counterparties' risk buffers, in line with recent enhancement of the capital regime for banks' trading books.

In times of rising importance of ethic leadership and employee development, it is of large interest to better characterize the biological underpinnings of Machiavellian behavior endangering these rather new important aims for companies/organizations. The present study investigated in 630 healthy participants by means of a molecular genetic approach whether a prominent polymorphism of the DRD3 gene is associated with individual differences in Machiavellianism measured with the self-report scale Mach-IV. As the investigated DRD3 Ser9Gly (T/C) polymorphism (rs6280) has been associated with schizophrenia before, we also assessed schizotypy in a subgroup of participants as a personality trait measured by the SPQ-B. The present study yields evidence that schizotypal personality positively correlates with the construct of Machiavellianism. Moreover, the CC variant (Glycine/Glycine) is associated with highest Machiavellianism scores. These findings show that the neurotransmitter dopamine might play a crucial role in explaining the biological basis of Machiavellian behavior.","[Montag, Christian] Univ Ulm, Dept Psychol, D-89081 Ulm, Germany; [Hall, Jeremy] Cardiff Univ, Neurosci & Mental Hlth Res Inst, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [Plieger, Thomas; Felten, Andrea; Markett, Sebastian; Melchers, Martin] Univ Bonn, Dept Psychol, Bonn, Germany; [Plieger, Thomas; Felten, Andrea; Melchers, Martin] Univ Bonn, Lab Neurogenet, Bonn, Germany; [Markett, Sebastian; Reuter, Martin] Univ Bonn, Ctr Econ & Neurosci, Bonn, Germany; [Reuter, Martin] Univ Bonn, Dept Psychol, Neurogenet Lab, Bonn, Germany",Ulm University; Cardiff University; University of Bonn; University of Bonn; University of Bonn; University of Bonn,"Montag, C (通讯作者)，Univ Ulm, Dept Psychol, Mol Psychol, Helmholtzstr 8-1, D-89081 Ulm, Germany.",christian.montag@uni-ulm.de,"Reuter, Martin/B-3456-2010; Markett, Sebastian/G-6328-2018; Montag, Christian/H-6536-2019","Montag, Christian/0000-0001-8112-0837; Hall, Jeremy/0000-0002-0403-3278",German Research Foundation (DFG) [MO 2363/3-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The position of Christian Montag is funded by a Heisenberg grant awarded to him by the German Research Foundation (DFG; MO 2363/3-1).,,41,8,9,0,18,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

Of the job demands and resources considered here (work hours, work pressure, face time norms, job flexibility, and coworker support), all but face-time norms were significantly associated with the dependent variable in at least one of the statistical models. Job demands and resources were more useful in models examining subjective health outcomes (feeling worried or stressed, feeling overwhelmed, and feeling healthy and energetic) than models examining preventive health behaviors (days of adequate exercise, sleep, and healthy diet). For working mothers, the combination of work hours and job flexibility was important across models, whereas for working fathers, coworker support was influential.

Older self-employed men across all characteristics examined are more likely to continue working at each age, while self-employed women do not respond to age-related factors (such as the pension system) to the same extent as paid employees.

While banks honored credit lines drawn by firms during the 2007 to 2009 crisis, this liquidity provision was only possible because of explicit, large support from the government and government-sponsored agencies. At the onset of the crisis, aggregate deposit inflows into banks weakened and their loan-to-deposit shortfalls widened. These patterns were pronounced at banks with greater undrawn commitments. Such banks sought to attract deposits by offering higher rates, but the resulting private funding was insufficient to cover shortfalls and they reduced new credit.","[Acharya, Viral V.] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Acharya, Viral V.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mora, Nada] Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, Kansas City, KS USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Kansas City,"Acharya, VV (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,"Acharya, Viral V./HCH-4349-2022",,,,,,36,211,247,2,148,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Estimating a propensity model on an unbalanced panel of firms and correcting for the selection bias when firms opt for exit shows that the impact of productivity on the outsourcing decision could be much larger than estimated so far. The paper further explores the impact of outsourcing on a firm's future performance and finds that the effect is non-uniform and productivity dependent, and outsourcing mostly brings improvements to firms that initially had low productivities. The most productive firms seem to outsource for other reasons such as focusing on innovation and exports with an eye on longer-term returns.","[Bakhtiari, Sasan] Australian Dept Ind, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia; [Bakhtiari, Sasan] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Bakhtiari, S (通讯作者)，Australian Dept Ind, 10 Binara St, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia.",sasan_bakhtiari@yahoo.com,,"Bakhtiari, Sasan/0000-0001-9019-0351",,,,,29,7,9,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Using 25 years of home sales data from St. Louis County, Missouri, and modern geographic information system tools to measure views, we estimate a hedonic property fixed-effects model that captures the effects of changing land cover on house sale prices. Unlike previous studies, our approach minimizes bias from omitted variables and uniquely captures changes over time. We find that forest views negatively affect home prices, whereas farmland views have positive effects.

However, it is still not perfectly clear which reforms actually lead to a fall in unemployment. One crucial issue is that reforms do not work in isolation, but have labor market effects which depend on other institutional factors. Such institutional interactions have rarely been considered in empirical macroeconomic studies in a systematic way, mainly due to model uncertainty. As a solution to this problem, a Bayesian model averaging approach is adopted in this paper to identify robust and significant institutional interactions for unemployment. Using a panel data-set for 17 OECD countries from 1982 to 2005, five robust and significant interaction terms are identified, and country-specific reform effects for the institutional indicators are derived.","Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Sachs, A (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany.",sachs@zew.de,,,,,,,27,4,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Nevertheless, there are issues and challenges being faced by the institutions that could give impact towards their sustainability. Among others are moral hazards and adverse selection problems among participants that would ultimately give potential risks to the institutions. Hence, maintaining its sustainability by way of risk management is significant in ensuring financial inclusion of the poor and materializing the objective of poverty alleviation.

Revolutionizing on business strategy and entrepreneurial skills, also implementing innovation and practices to enhance its performance are necessary for these organizations to be more cost-efficient and increase their efficiency. The study aims to clarify issues of whether measurement has a positive effect on different aspects of innovation and best practices. The study contributes to the current understanding in three ways; firstly by presenting the important aspects of organizational innovation and best practices. Secondly, it shows the importance of measurement in promoting different aspects of innovation and best practices. And thirdly, it examines the link between innovation, best practices and sustainability in microfinance. The study has been executed by conducting a qualitative study toward the microfinance industry. A representative of management and employees in each company was selected through an invitation to participate in getting information for data collection purpose in the study. The study contains a comprehensive description of the impacts of measurement on different aspects of innovation and best practices towards sustainability in both microfinance industries and SMEs. Findings from this study show that performance measurement has positive effects on issues related to innovation and best practices. The measurement for several aspects of innovation and best practices has good potential in microfinance industries. Additionally, measurement on innovation and best practices are positively related with each other to enhance organization performance. The study suggests that both academics and practitioners should focus on the development of new methods and practices to describe and scrutinize further understanding for measuring issues which is related to innovation and best practices, in order to better develop the aspect of innovation and best practices towards sustainability.

We report that funds under pressure engage more in SBOs. Pressured buyers pay higher multiples, use less leverage, and syndicate less suggesting that their motive is to spend equity.

We model a simple financial system in which banks decide about their investment strategy based on a private belief about the state of the world and a social belief formed from observing the actions of peers. Observing a larger group of peers conveys more information and thus leads to a stronger social belief. Extending the standard model of Bayesian updating in social networks, we show that the probability that banks synchronize their investment strategy on a state non-matching action critically depends on the weighting between private and social belief. This effect is alleviated when banks choose their peers endogenously in a network formation process, internalizing the externalities arising from social learning. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The main objective is to investigate, whether hospitals use debt as a source of funding, in the absence of sufficient profits from operating activities. Using statistical methods, we have proved a negative relationship between the profitability measured on many levels (ROA, EBIT margin, EBITDA margin) and hospitals' total debt ratio. On the other hand, we have found a positive relationship between the debt and profitability, taking into account only short-term and long-term loans and credit. That might suggest, that hospitals characterized by poor financial condition, try to finance their operating activities with payment obligations. Research sample includes financial data from over 333 hospitals in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary (the data comes from Amadeus and Emis databases). Research sample covers hospitals, having, at least an admission room and two hospital wards, with total assets and operating turnover above 1 min EUR.","[Bem, Agnieszka; Siedlecki, Rafal] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Management Informat & Finance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland; [Predkiewicz, Pawel] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Econ Sci, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland; [Ucieklak-Jez, Paulina] Jan Dlugosz Univ Czestochowa, Dept Social Sci, PL-42200 Czestochowa, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business; Wroclaw University of Economics & Business; Jan Dlugosz University,"Bem, A (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Management Informat & Finance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",agnieszka.bem@ue.wroc.pl; pawel.predkiewicz@ue.wroc.pl; p.ucieklak@ajd.czest.pl; rafal.siedlecki@ue.wroc.pl,"Bem, Agnieszka/D-6983-2015; Prędkiewicz, Paweł/L-5706-2018; Ucieklak-Jez, Paulina/S-8495-2018; Siedlecki, Rafal/T-9084-2018","Bem, Agnieszka/0000-0003-1653-6558; Prędkiewicz, Paweł/0000-0002-8965-665X; Ucieklak-Jez, Paulina/0000-0002-4106-6984; Siedlecki, Rafal/0000-0001-7444-4737",,,,,33,10,11,0,9,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,20,+,,,,,,3,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200003,0

The data were collected based on the opinion about thirteen factors of leadership quality practices in the department or agency by using seven-point Likert scale. The data are analysed under descriptive statistics and factor analysis. Further, the reliability of the data is tested by using Cronbach alpha test, and the validity of data is tested by checking the normality of data through Shapiro Wilk test and graphical method. Overall, 82.5% of the respondents mentioned that they practice leadership factors in their department. However, the priority of these factors of leadership quality differs among the services schemes. Overall, the practice of leadership quality of the financial schemes group is strong. However, the practice of leadership quality in the medical & health scheme is below the overall average level. The public sector in Malaysia needs to focus more on the development and practice of leadership quality and its proper assessment system to become a reliable and efficient sector.

We investigate if the idea of increasing competition in EU as a result of a single European market it fits with the issue of financial stability of the European financial system. We test the competition implications on financial stability during the crisis and pre-crisis period, too. We use as proxy for competition two structural indicators - Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and the concentration rate of the top five largest banks (CR5). The banks' financial stability is represented by Z-score. The model is estimated on a panel of 923 commercial banks from 27 countries members of European Union for the 2001-2009 periods. Because we work with a large number of cross-sections and a short times series, we will use Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) Dynamic Panel Data models. The results validate both views, depending on group of countries and pre-crisis /crisis period. In the case of CR5, all results are statistically relevant, less for the euro zone and, except for the new member states, increased concentration has a negative impact on financial stability, so it confirms the competition stability theory. The results for the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) are statistically relevant only for the countries outside the euro zone and the new members and it is validated the competition-fragility vision: the greater the concentration in the system, measured by the HHI index (i.e. less competition), the higher the Z-score indicator, therefore the bank financial stability increases.

Firstly, from a theoretical point of view, the existing models used for determining the level of risk premiums will be presented through a comparative analysis. Then, through an empirical approach we'll present our results by taking into consideration cat bonds covering earthquake risk issued during 1999-2012. The first model shows the existing relationship between the expected losses of the company that requires coverage through an alternative risk transfer instrument such as cat bonds and the level of risk premium. By estimating our model in different conditions, taking as parameters the location and the frequency of the events, the fluctuations of risk premiums can be observed. In case of cat bonds covering USA earthquakes the risk premium is greater than those covering Japan earthquakes. Through the second model we aim to observe the determinants that influence risk premium. The explanatory variables taken into consideration are: the issuing amount, the probability of event occurrence, conditional expected loss, the probability of exhaustion, maturity, the rating and the trigger type of each bond. The results show that the probability of event occurrence and credit rating of the bond are significant determinants of risk premium, being considered by the investors when they decide to diversify their portfolio through financial instruments that are not affected by the volatility from financial markets. These results are mostly consistent with existing theoretical models but can also be observed certain differences which will be discussed. The moment when investors start to lose money is perceived more serious than the amount they will lose. As regards the rating, it offers information about the quality of the bond. Given the importance of this risk premium determinant we'll also present the main factors considered by the rating agencies in the moment of setting a certain rating for a cat bond.

In the last decade, health tourism featuring an ongoing development saw a dynamic development primarily in the area of wellness tourism at both national and international levels. The countries with the most significant wellness supplies and tourist movement are located in the first place in Europe (mostly in German-speaking and Mediterranean countries), North America and Southeast Asia (Kiss K. Torok I. 2001, Ratz T. 2004). The general trends such as the enhancement of individualization, demographic transformations, changes in women's social roles, spiritualization, the appreciation of healthy lifestyles have created the social background of the demand for wellness services and products (Friedl H. 2007, Zsigmond E. 2007). As for experts in various areas of science, the wellness market, due to social transformations and the favourable economic performance of the sector, is likely to become one of the fastest developing touristic and economic sectors (Ardell D. 1985, Nefiodov L. 1996, Horx, M. 2001, Scholz, J. 2003, Pilzer, P. 2007). The fact, however, that the various countries are unable to fully exploit the potentials hidden in natural endowments is not exclusively a problem in Hungary; moreover, it leads to the uniformity of supply and endangers the sustainability of natural assets. In the coming decades well-to-do, ageing but at the same time active age groups aspiring for a higher quality of life, particularly in North America, Scandinavia and Western Europe may represent a huge potential for wellness tourism. Regarding wellness data there are no uniform measurement systems, i.e. terminological differences in various countries hinder the comparison of data on recreation and wellness. Both the sector and the customers need more information, data and resources to make wellness services competitive and trustworthy. For this reason, this study seeks to introduce the international and national trends in tourism, including recreational tourism and also to draw up a general picture of the international wellness market.

Their main interest is related to the epistemological complexity of the economic research methodology in explaining the meaning of socio-economic consequences of globalization and transition. The paper shows that all the terms used in social sciences are changeable social constructions rather than forever defined givenness. Terms are social products and their meanings are changed in symbolic and other forms of interaction among people and communities. The root of economics is a rational individual (homo oeconomicus) that strives to maximize one's personal gains. However, that is not enough. The aim is to show that research hypotheses cannot be replacements for theories and values, such asa body cannot be a replacement for spirituality. Research perspectives should be thoroughly, not superficially presented and explained in the light of small details that do not fit into the dominant story or discourse. Facts, events, and phenomena must be presented in their relation to other facts, events, and phenomena. Facts mean nothing outside reflectively and critically mediated knowledge and specific context. A popular method of data collection or attitude research, by means of a public opinion survey, may become absurd if one day, under the influence of the social media and poor education, most subjects lose their ability of balanced thinking and judgment. Hypothetically speaking, this is possible. The aim of the paper is to show the tendencies for minimizing the importance of theoretical work and of book reading and eliminating thoughtful studying from lectures and research process, all in the name of pleasure or in the name of creating the global knowledge society. We argue in favour of phronetic interdisciplinary research that might contribute to responsible dialogue and practice of rethinking these tendencies, which is the most important result of this paper.","[Delic, Zlatan; Alibegovic, Abdel] Univ Tuzla, Fac Philosophy, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Delic, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Tuzla, Fac Philosophy, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",zlatan.delic@untz.ba; abdel.alibegovic@untz.ba,"Alibegović, Abdel/GNP-3206-2022","Alibegović, Abdel/0000-0002-0041-6773",,,,,25,0,0,0,1,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,600,613,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700037,0

Our empirical results indicate that forecasting errors in the Federal funds futures market do have implications for the asset market's natural price discovery process, since expectations in this market affect long term interest rates and inflation. We also find that the price discovery process may be exacerbated if the policy transmission mechanism is more pronounced under a transparency objective because of the negative feedback loop mechanism. The results further show that the aggregate demand and inflation expectations channels appear to be much more pronounced under the Bernanke regime than Greenspan leading to a much stronger policy transmission. In fact a policy tightening through both channels would have a visibly stronger deflationary and employment impact under Bernanke relative to Greenspan. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The TAM variables are perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and intentions. In this study, we suggest the extension of the TAM for its application in the E-commerce field. The original TAM will be extended, by adding four predictor variables. The four predictor variables are process satisfaction, outcome satisfaction, expectations, and E-commerce use. In addition, the TAM will be extended by measuring actual behavior as opposed to measuring intentions as a substitute for actual behavior in previous TAM application studies. We suggest measuring actual use variable in terms of four criterion variables, namely, purchase, access number, access total time, and access average time. The extended TAM is expected to better explain actual behavior in E-commerce environments than the original TAM. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The concept of integrated financial reporting as a new accounting concept slowly creates its importance and popularity, intending to make companies being more reponsible to environmental, social and societal issues. Integrated reporting is a challenge for modern companies that, in addition to financial reporting of their business operatins, they report about theis business strategies in short, medium and long term, as well as about models of creating and perserving companies' value. The conducted pilot projects of analyzing the possibilities for the application of integrated financial reporting to its formal adoption, showed that the application of the concept requried some additional accounting tools, among which the most significant is a well designed and developed concept of management accounting. Given the topicality of the issues and the fact that Montenegro in 1991 became an ecological state, as well as taking into account the current process of negotiations of Montenegro for access to the EU, which requires the fulfillment of certain criteria related to sustainable development, the authors will work through survey research target group in Montenegro in order to draw conclusions about the possibility of applying environmental accounting, as a segment of the process of integrated reporting.

We find that affiliates' local deposits and performance have been stabilizing loan supply. By contrast, relying on short-term wholesale funding has increasingly proven to be a disadvantage in the crisis, which has seen inter-bank and capital markets freeze. By introducing a liable approximate measure for intra-bank flows, we detect competition for intra-bank funding between the affiliates abroad as well as an increasing focus on the parent bank's home market activities. In addition, the more an affiliate abroad relies on intra-bank funding in the crisis, the greater its dependence on its parent bank having a stable deposit and long-term wholesale funding position. We consider changes in long-term lending to the private sectors of 40 countries by the affiliates of the 68 largest German banks. To obtain a more precise picture, we clean our lending data from valuation effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The human resources of a non profit organization are composed by workers and volunteers. Volunteering is a crucial renewable resource for social and environmental problem-solving the world over. Volunteers are workers who voluntarily choose to provide services to a non profit, without any expectation of compensation. Volunteers satisfaction and retention are crucial for the success of a non profit organization, which are known for attracting highly committed volunteers who are motivated by mission. Effective volunteer engagement is critical to the success of a non profit. The time, talent and treasure provided by volunteers help an organization maximize results in working toward its mission. The work in the first part is theoretical. In the second part predominantly employs the quantitative methods; authors present an empirical analysis based on observed and measured phenomena and derives knowledge from actual experience rather than from theory or belief.

Our short discussion of the published literature suggests that while the CAPM is still popular with the professional practice, its effectiveness for risk premium determination is limited. So in the next part we shortly describe the applicability of the time-varying CAPM as an augmented approach to the traditional CAPM form. To illustrate applicability of the model we employ this augmented concept by incorporating only unexpected changes in the autoregressive time series models in a specified company Dell Inc.

The index captures various economic and social aspects (GDP/capita, labour productivity and life expectancy), offering a synthetic measure of development which is further used for assessing the degree of convergence among Romanian counties over 1995-2012. We computed the annual coefficients of variation among counties and tested for sigma convergence using standard statistical methods such as Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron tests. The results indicate a significant sigma divergence trend on the long run, despite temporary decrease in inequalities associated with strong economic growth. It seems that territorial development in Romania was persistently unbalanced and the disparities have had a tendency to widen in time. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In our sample, the measures of oil volatility do not provide any improvement of the estimation and show no causal links with real exchange rates in US and Eurozone.","[Hajko, Vladimir] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Sebek, Vaclav] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Masaryk University Brno,"Hajko, V (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",vladimir.hajko@mendelu.cz; vaclav.sebek@mail.muni.cz,"Hajko, Vladimir/I-4626-2018","Hajko, Vladimir/0000-0002-4089-979X",,,,,38,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,246,256,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000028,0

The final calculation of economic indicators was done by CODEX software system s. r. o. company. The harvest of roots of sugar beet in years show significant variability: 30.05 t. ha(-1) in 2011 to 73.11 t. ha(-1) in 2010. We used the polynomial model for the analysis of the costs development per 1 ha with the use of dummy variable that specifies the development from 2009 (before the crisis) and after 2009 (after the outbreak of crisis). The development of own costs per hectare was characterized by polynomial trend, taking into account the onset of the crisis in 2009. The own costs vary from 1,247 EUR. ha(-1) in 2009 to the maximum of 1,823 EUR. ha(-1) in 2011. The development of the profit per 1 hectare of arable land in 2007 - 2013 showed a fluctuating course. The average value of profit is 699.50 EUR. ha(-1). We used logarithmic trend function to describe the development of profit. We assume that the profit in 2015 will move around the level of 935 EUR. ha(-1). We calculated the loss in the profit ratio of costs without support, -24.68 % in 2012 and -53.81 % in 2007.

Leader approach is offering limited support for rural area in order to encourage cultural activities, architecture rehabilitation, valorizing natural landscape and rural tourism. Through its direct and indirect impacts, tourism attracts significant foreign exchange, investment and know-how and stimulates the local economy, with a significant multiplier effect on many other areas of the economy. In the same time, it has to be paid a great attention to the effects generated upon the rural communities by the tourists' activities. Certainly, tourism development should be considered with all financial, material and human efforts that have to be done in order to support it. Tourism development in rural area should be strategically planned and its negative effects on nature and social-cultural environment of tourism areas should be limited. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This study examines board characteristics among SMEs in Malaysia namely size, independence, expertise, ethnicity, and CEO duality and how they differ between family owned and non-family owned SMEs. A survey on SMEs in Klang Valley and Selangor finds that overall, the quality of board of directors of SMEs is low. The existence of more than 55% of family owned SMEs does not really provide a monitoring on the management. Differences in poor board characteristics between family owned and non-family owned SMEs are not significant.

The research presented in the paper investigates presence of outsourcing in business practice and effects of its implementation and analyzes the relevant accounting information and financial data used by company's management while making decisions on the selection and implementation of the outsourcing strategy. As a matter of fact, by using the relevant accounting information and analyzing potential advantages and disadvantages of outsourcing implementation from the accounting aspect, it is possible to create the model for making decisions on outsourcing and to set the assumptions for its implementation. The paper aims at defining the needs of modern companies for the outsourcing strategy and specifying the relevant accounting information and defining the ways for their proper usage, so that managers would be able to make the right decisions on the implementation of the outsourcing strategy which would then lead to desired results. The empirical research and its results presented in the paper included 34 Bosnian and Herzegovinian (BiH) companies. The questionnaire was used as a data collection instrument and it was filled in by managers. The research results indicate that 65% of the companies surveyed use outsourcing for one or more business activities, while 35% of them do not use this strategy. The activities that are mainly subject to outsourcing are the segments related to transport and distribution, marketing services, export/import, and legal services. The research results also show that the subjects believe the key advantage of outsourcing is the reduction and better control of costs, focus on company's core activities and increased flexibility.","[Islambegovic, Selma Novalija; Delic, Adisa] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Islambegovic, SN (通讯作者)，Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",selma.novalija@untz.ba; adisa.delic@untz.ba; dina.dervisevic3101@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,336,351,,,,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700020,0

They follow also the consistency of the accounting procedures applied by the company with the generally set financial accounting rules, particularly the tendencies to minimize the tax obligations of the firms. The extensive violations of the accounting and financial rules, forces the State bodies, as well as corporate executives to take measures to prevent, or minimize the damage resulting from such practices. The control and audit therefore increasingly deploys the highly sophisticated methodological tools (of mathematics and statistical nature) that are capable to detect not only violations of the principles of accounting, but also the intentional distortion of the accounting data. The main objective of this article is to contribute to study of this problem. We present an overview of the selected economic indicators, namely the volumes of assets and for a set of approximately 5000 small and medium enterprises operating in Slovakia (during 2010-2012). In particular, we underline the significant differences in the economic parameters of the different NACE groups and recommend, where appropriate, the deeper statistical analysis for the data under consideration.","[Kabat, Ladislav] Sch Publ Adm, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Majkova-Sobekova, Monika] Paneuropean Univ, Bratislava, Slovakia",Pan-European University,"Kabát, L (通讯作者)，Sch Publ Adm, Bratislava, Slovakia.",ladislav.kabat@vsemvs.sk; monika.majkova@uninova.sk,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,350,358,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000039,0

The reason is that these systems come along with an implicit tax structure that features high tax rates at the beginning of working life and low tax rates toward the end. When the costs of human capital investment are mainly time costs, such an implicit tax structure lowers the costs of human capital investments and simultaneously increases the payoff. The fact that higher skilled workers tend to have steeper wage profiles over the working phase than the unskilled enforces this mechanism. I first show this result in a simple analytical model and then quantify the macroeconomic and welfare effects of making the implicit tax structure age independent in a large-scale overlapping generation model, in which households can invest in human capital both by going to college and through on-the-job training. In terms of welfare, such a reform comes along with a lot of intergenerational redistribution. Although the welfare of current retirees may increase by about 4.5% of their remaining life-time resources, current older workers will lose due to an increase in their implicit tax rates. The welfare of future generations slightly declines by 0.1%.","Univ Wuerzburg & Netspar, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg,"Kindermann, F (通讯作者)，Univ Wuerzburg & Netspar, Sanderring 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",kindermann.fabian@uni-wuerzburg.de,,"Kindermann, Fabian/0000-0002-7845-4948",,,,,33,6,8,1,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

But there is lack of desired result within the branding efforts without the efficient method of brand value quantifying. Nowadays, there are many methods of brand valuation, which can be grouped into internally homogeneous groups based on their access to financial indicators usage, possible objectives, intended universality of value, brand risk representing and so on. These methods have differences among themselves, particularly in relation to the scope and nature of the input data and reliability and validity of obtained results in relation to its further applicability in branding. This is the reason why the results of critical evaluation focused on different methods of brand valuation in the context of the Slovak branding specifics, is the aim of this paper. Most of published results form part of the special research realized to analyze possible sources of competitive advantages of Slovak enterprises. In this research, it was found that the current state of branding in the Slovak Republic is unsatisfactory and not competitive with foreign. As one of the reasons, the absence of a continuous brand value monitoring was detected. So, we offer a brief overview of applicable methods, which are convenient to specific Slovak conditions and which could be used to make brands competitive on the international base of globalized market.

Aware of the gravity of the situation and country's uncertain future, the paper makes an attempt at assessing the potential of collective farming in establishing food security for Bangladesh's rural poor by contrasting individual and collective farming practices. It does that by producing a set of four scenarios using Rangpur division data as a base and a hypothetical village model to generate the results, revealing potential boosts in rice production ranging from 32.38% in case of land aggregation and 300% cropping intensity, a further 41.55% if selected improvements are introduced, and an additional 31.18% should high-yielding varieties be grown under optimal growing conditions, for a total increase of 145.81%, compared to current production levels. Financial side of collective farming and possible constraints are addressed as well using specific examples such as minimum farm holding size needed to justify the ownership of selected pieces of equipment and the cost-benefit analysis of substituting some of the more labor-intensive activities with appropriate mechanized equipment, while at the same time highlighting the importance of government support in establishing and maintaining collective farming initiative.","[Milovanovic, Vladimir; Smutka, Lubos] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Milovanovic, V (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",milovanovic@pef.czu.cz; smutka@pef.czu.cz,"Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333",,,,,28,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,282,291,,,,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600031,0

Sustainability of social enterprises and their impact upon local development, as well as the quality and stability of jobs created within these structures represent recent topics of interest at national level. Most discourses on sustainability focus on financial aspects, although sustainability is not limited to these aspects. Financial sustainability allows the organisation to develop and invest more in order to reach social objectives, which are essential for social enterprises; however, the achievement of these objectives is insufficient for the long-term development of the organisation. A major obstacle for long-term sustainability resides in the dependence of many social economy structures on grants or different donors. An analysis on sustainability proves relevant as consistent amounts of money have been allocated by the European Social Fund for the establishment of social enterprises. In this context, the paper aims at analysing the discourses of professionals from the social economy field on the sustainability of social enterprises and of the entire sector, as well as its potential to contribute to improving the quality of life and to local development.

Therefore, the aim of the paper is to examine the efficiency of holdings controlled by females in comparison with males with focus on agricultural firms. On one hand, the farms managed by females can be less efficient as women may be using traditional technologies either due to lack of knowledge, lack of access to modern inputs associated with new technologies or higher costs to adopt the new technologies. Also discrimination against women in the allocation of credit might weaken their bargaining position. On the other hand, this is truer for developing countries than for developed ones. The most estimates of male-female differences in technical efficiency from production function studies show that male and female farmers are equally efficient farm managers, controlling for levels of inputs and human capital. In this article we apply Stochastic Frontier Analysis on the Czech farms' accounting data from Albertina database and business register. An unbalanced panel contains information about 117 agricultural holdings for years 2007 to 2012. Altogether there are 526 observations. Traditional inputs (material, services and capital - adjusted for price changes, labour, and land - adjusted for soil quality) are used as explanatory variables in production function in Cobb-Douglas form. A true fixed effect model with truncated normal distribution of inefficiency term is estimated. The results are statistically tested and discussed in the context of previous researches.

The sample is then divided on males and females and the differences in technical efficiency of their farms are tested.

However, despite its growth and contribution to the GDP, this fragmented sector has a poor coordination among its project participants, leading to horrific material control with time and cost overrun. As such, there is a need to investigate the coordination aspect of the business conduct among project participants, particularly the procurement process that is considered as the initiator of construction project. At the same time, the firms' internal resources such as human success factor (HSF) and information technology (IT) play a significant part in determining the operational performance of construction project. Thus, the main objective of this study is to propose a conceptual framework on the relationships of internal resources (HSF and IT) and performance, mediated by procurement process coordination (PPC). The framework is using resource-based view as the underpinning theory to explain the relationships of the variables used. The scope of study is on one of the key business processes in supply chain management (SCM) and concentrating on one of the groups (G7) in the population. Future empirical research is expected to be carried out in effort to test this proposed conceptual framework.

The research team uses a sample of 101 employers from BiH and performs the logit model maximum likelihood estimation. The results show that the size of organization, in terms of the number of employees, primarily influences likelihood of employment of persons with disabilities. There is an inverse relationship between employment opportunities and the organization size. One possible explanation for this relationship is that large companies already recruit persons with disabilities and therefore have no additional opportunities. Other coefficients in the estimated model are not statistically significant.

One novel feature of this work is the division of poultry into two distinct import products-cooked (safe) and uncooked (less safe). Analysis shows that HPAI (H5N1) outbreaks had statistically significant impacts on EU27 import demand for meats, increasing cooked poultry and decreasing uncooked poultry, beef, pork, and other meats. The shift in import demand regime was permanent and statistically significant, making cooked poultry imports EU27's largest, averaging more than 50 percent of EU imports in 2013 and 2014.","[Taha, Fawzi A.] USDA, Food Secur & Dev Branch, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20024 USA; [Hahn, William F.] USDA, Anim Prod & Cost Prod, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Taha, FA (通讯作者)，USDA, Food Secur & Dev Branch, Econ Res Serv, 355 E St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",ftaha@ers.usda.gov; whahn@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,2,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

That is the case, mainly due to the limited efficiency of previously employed instruments, to an increase in instability of the financial side of the economy unless drastically controlled, but also due to the need for viable alternatives. The Euro Area established certain financial support mechanisms meant to bring back onto a floating level seriously damaged economies - bankrupt or affected by the foreign debt crisis, but preventing mechanisms have not yet been installed, and the transition towards a new stage of economic growth and expansion would further even more this possibility. This paper envisages to provide a brief assessment of such options - elements composing a solid financial regulatory system in Europe. Also, a brief analysis of the existing architecture is presented.

These are businesses, government and government institutions, universities, civil society and diaspora. The methodology of this work is based on research as to how the impact of these five components could speed up development of economy in Bosnia and Herzegovina. For economic development during nineties of the last century, the Triple Helix model was recommended, which supposed to include three important factors for starting entrepreneurship, namely; Government, through incentives and stimulation of entrepreneurship, businesses and involvement of research institutes and universities. During following decades, a new circumstance for the development of project proposals required the use of funds from international donors, financial institutions and funds in cross-border cooperation with neighbouring countries, the EU funds. This new opportunity created a need to involve the civil sector through Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in the promotion of economic development, what has been known as Quad helix model. Since the Diaspora wanted to get involved into development of its homeland, application of Penta helix model in all segments of society has been proposed (start new businesses, cooperation and partnerships with universities and the civil sector). Based on scientific research on using the proposed development models, considering the great number of emigrants and experiences they have gained in the area of entrepreneurship as well as their capital, the Penta component in using the Penta helix model is considered acceptable by researchers. The aim is to point out the need for applying Penta helix model for an accelerated development of Bosnia and Herzegovina.","[Tonkovic, Anka Masek] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia; [Veckie, Walter; Veckie, Edward A.] Unified Engn Com Corp, Hamilton, ON, Canada",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Tonkovic, AM (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",masek.efos@gmail.com; walterv@unifiedengineering.com; eveckie@unifiedengineering.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,496,505,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700030,0

Linguistically, the concept is based on semantics as an enhanced approach of syntactic procedure, with a view to understanding the customer's demands. From a semiotic perspective, paradigmatic marketing implies the presence of relationships or their absence based on meaning rather than on proximity like in the syntagmatic case. Practically speaking, by using web semantics and linked data, the herein marketing conceptualization is built upon a large non-structured interne database of entities connected through meaning that relies on ontology. The role of linked data is to connect products/services and customers with each other (e.g. product with customer, customer with customer). Semantics rely on linked data and ontology so that a useful common meaning or attribute should be assigned to a cluster of entities (either products or customers). Different methods and procedures are then applied to this cluster in order to identify a potential need of a client. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The model is a step towards more complex building-stock power modeling, whose goal is to predict the sources and the amount of demand response potential under different conditions. The heat loss rate is the fraction of thermal power needed to compensate for the heat loss via exterior walls, windows, roofs, floors and ventilation in the buildings. The heat loss rate depends on the physical characteristics of the building envelope and ventilation and on weather conditions. We first examine the current state of power and energy modeling. We then describe the research object of this study and the calculation method. The calculation results presented in the third section are illustrated at the hourly level, sorted by the main source of the heating energy of the building. In addition to the analysis of the building stock level, the heat loss rate was calculated on a building level using some typical building information models for validation purposes. The validation indicated that the results obtained with the two methods were consistent and that the order of magnitude was reasonable. The Finnish building stock was used as a research object in the demonstration of the model. Finally, some further needs for research are discussed. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Own price elasticities suggest that CARICOM's poultry import demand is highly price responsive in both the short run and the long run, and that any significant increases in imported poultry prices could be expected to trigger greater than proportional decreases in quantities demanded from all source countries except Brazil. Results also suggest that if the CET were removed, all source countries would be able to expand poultry product exports into CARICOM. Canada is the only country that would decrease exports to CARICOM in the long run if the CET were removed.

We construct the valuation model based on -maxmin expected utility to evaluate the reduction in ambiguity size and risk level as well as estimate the subjects' ambiguity attitude. Our model can bring an interesting policy implication. If the subjects are ambiguity-averse, a reduction in ambiguity size with a constant risk level can increases welfare. Thus, even if risk level cannot be lowered, reduction in ambiguity size can also be used as a measure toward increasing welfare. Our model can empirically estimate this welfare change resulting from the reduction in ambiguity size. To demonstrate how our model works, we apply it to survey data on a public program that reduces mortality probability in accidents caused by wildlife.","[Watanabe, Masahide] Osaka Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Higashiyodogawa Ku, Osaka 5338533, Japan; [Fujimi, Toshio] Kumamoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Kumamoto 8608555, Japan",Kumamoto University,"Watanabe, M (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Higashiyodogawa Ku, 2-2-8 Osumi, Osaka 5338533, Japan.",wmasa@osaka-ue.ac.jp; fujimi@kumamoto-u.ac.jp,,"Watanabe, Masahide/0000-0003-2504-7238","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25780176, 26820214, 23580319] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,30,2,2,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Review results also show that manipulation effect of CEO power on EPPS does exist across the world. However, the strength and nature of such manipulation effect have not been recognized clearly. It is the newest trend to recognize that the manipulation effect of CEO power on EPPS is a kind of contingent effect instead of absolute effect. In the future, more scholars should discuss the critical contingent variables that can affect the relationship between CEO power and EPPS in depth, such as CEO tenure.","[Zhang, Changzheng; Gao, Zhuoqin] Xian Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710054, Shanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Technology,"Zhang, CZ (通讯作者)，Xian Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710054, Shanxi, Peoples R China.",zcz7901@163.com; 952623209@qq.com,"Zhang, Chang/HTO-2939-2023",,,,,,12,0,0,0,6,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-62520-68-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2015,8.0,,,,,,476,481,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD7OC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363373700093,0

The data used are from the Spanish Technological Innovation Panel for the period 2006-2011. To control for selection bias and endogeneity, a combination of nonparametric matching techniques is used. Our results show that R&D subsidies increase the number of R&D employees, but no contemporaneous increase is found in the average level of qualification of R&D staff members in subsidized firms. Nevertheless, in the subsequent years there is a positive effect on the recruitment of PhD holders.

We conduct a number of incentivized choice experiments on Chinese adult twins to measure decision making behavior, and use a within-twin-pair fixed-effects estimator to deal with unobservable family-specific effects. The estimation results show that a higher education level tends to reduce the degree of risk aversion towards moderate prospects, moderate hazards, and longshot prospects. For anomalies under risk and uncertainty, college graduates exhibit significantly more Allais-type behavior compared to high school dropouts, while high school graduates exhibit more ambiguity aversion as well as a familiarity preference relative to high school dropouts. For decision making involving time, a higher education level tends to reduce the degree of impatience, and to reduce behavioral anomalies including hyperbolic discounting, dread, and hopefulness. The experimental observations suggest that people with a higher education level tend to exhibit more behavioral anomalies in risk attitudes but fewer behavioral anomalies involving time, hence implying that education has multi-functions in preference formation and human capability building. This study contributes to the understanding of the nature of these behavioral anomalies and the roles of education in human decision making.","[Chew, Soo Hong; Yi, Junjian; Zhong, Songfa] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore, Singapore; [Zhang, Junsen] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",National University of Singapore; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Zhong, SF (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore, Singapore.",zhongsongfa@gmail.com,"Zhong, Songfa Z/I-4718-2016","Yi, Junjian/0000-0002-4963-1052; Chew, Soo Hong/0000-0003-1245-0909","Chinese University of Hong Kong; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology [AOE-MG/H-03/06]; National University of Singapore [R-122-000-211-133, R-122-000-232-646]",Chinese University of Hong Kong(Chinese University of Hong Kong); Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore),"We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Focused Innovations Scheme), the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Project No. AOE-MG/H-03/06), and National University of Singapore (FASS Start-up Grant No. R-122-000-211-133 and HSS Grant No. R-122-000-232-646).",,64,5,6,2,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

Using these targets as instrumental variables, this study finds that this policy mandating an increase in the share of ethnic minority officers in a given force is associated with a decrease in the number of crimes in the area under the force's jurisdiction during the 10-year period. It is argued that greater representativeness and diversity within a public organization improves organizational integrity, which influences bureaucrats' attitudes and behaviors toward minority citizens. In the context of policing, diversity can mitigate the institutionalized practice of officers acting on implicit assumptions about minorities being inherently more unlawful than whites: Police representativeness is associated with a decrease in the overrepresentation of black individuals among those subject to stop and search. Such a change may make minority citizens more willing to cooperate in the coproduction of public values, facilitating the attainment of organizational goals.

Specifically, we hypothesize that attacks executed in Islamic countries on citizens from Western countries will generate spatial spillovers of three kinds. Firstly, tourism from the victims' countries to Islamic destination countries other than the location of the attacks will decline. Secondly, tourism from other Western countries to the country in which the attacks took place will decline. Thirdly, tourism from other Western countries to other Islamic destination countries also will decline. These spatial spillover effects occur because the terror message is strategically addressed at Western citizens in general rather than the tourists' countries of origin per se. Tourists update their priors after such attacks, rationally expecting a greater chance of becoming victimized in other Islamic countries as well, given the transnational character of Islamist terror groups and the limited capacity of governments in Islamic countries to prevent such attacks.","[Neumayer, Eric] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England; [Neumayer, Eric] PRIO, London, England; [Pluemper, Thomas] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Socioecon, Vienna, Austria",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Neumayer, E (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England.;Neumayer, E (通讯作者)，PRIO, London, England.",e.neumayer@lse.ac.uk,"Plümper, Thomas/Q-4695-2016; Neumayer, Eric/ABF-3741-2021; Pluemper, Thomas/S-3241-2019; Pluemper, Thomas/G-7559-2011","Neumayer, Eric/0000-0003-2719-7563; Pluemper, Thomas/0000-0002-1461-0737; Pluemper, Thomas/0000-0002-1461-0737",,,,,31,69,75,0,47,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2016,169.0,3-4,,,,,195,206,,10.1007/s11127-016-0359-y,0.0,,,12,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,EA3ML,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386506800003,0

Many technologies that could spur considerable increase in welfare, however, are often adopted at low rates even when donors and NGOs have invested their effort in them heavily. This paper develops a framework to analyze inefficiencies caused by fit-risk (potential users are not certain whether the technology will fit their needs, lifestyles, social feedback or capabilities), and the role of marketing tools, such as demonstration, in reducing fit-risk and enhancing the efficiency of development projects. We find that, in the presence of fit-risk, there is always unrealized demand and resource waste. Donors who ignore fit-risk always overestimate the project value and over-subsidize the products they are promoting. We identify conditions under which introducing demonstration may help alleviate fit-risk and improve the overall project values.

However, the existence and extent of gendered household food security or lack thereof remains unclear. This study extends existing knowledge by assessing gender inequality in household food (in) security among small-holder farm households in urban and rural areas of South Africa. In doing-so, we use the gender of the head of household and treatment effects framework. Our results show that male-headed households are more food secure compared to female-headed households, with the latter depending more on agriculture to increase household food levels. We further find that the household food security gap between male- and female-headed households is wider in rural than in urban areas, where rural male- and female-headed households are more likely to report chronic food insecurity, i.e., are more likely than their urban counterparts to experience hunger. Interestingly, the effects of climatic characteristics on household food security are more apparent in rural than in urban areas. Our findings suggest that household food security initiatives are likely to be more effective, in closing the gender gap in household food security, if aligned with policies on urban and rural agriculture and development.

This is the first comprehensive, and empirical quantification of the relative importance of multiple geographic levels in shaping poverty distribution in India. We used multilevel logistic models to partition variation in poverty by levels of states, regions, districts, villages, and households. We also mapped the residuals at the state, region and district levels to visualize the geography of poverty. We used data on 35 states, 88 regions, 623 districts, 25,390 villages and 202,250 households from the National Sample Survey in years 2009-10 and 2011-12. Our study found that geography of poverty in India cannot be fully explained by clustered distribution of poor households, and that there may be important contextual factors operating at the state and village levels. We found 13% of the variation in poverty to be attributable to states, 12% to villages, 4% to districts and 3% to regions, after accounting for important household characteristics. Similar variance partitioning was observed for rural and urban sample. The relative importance of one contextual level was highly sensitive to other levels simultaneously considered in the model. Findings from this study suggest that further explorations using multilevel modeling are warranted to identify specific contextual determinants of poverty at the state and village levels to reduce poverty and promote balanced regional development in India.

Employing a cross-country dataset on more than 100 banking and/or currency crises during 1981-2007, this work examines the effects of financial crises on indicators of human and social wellbeing. Through employing an event study analysis, the findings of this analysis suggest that the aftermaths of financial crises are characterized by increases in the growth rates of suicide rates, crime rates, and income inequality rates relative to their pre-crisis trajectories. Additionally, declines in the growth rates of health and educational expenditures, government welfare expenditures, and food quality and quantity intakes are common during periods immediately following financial crises. Such deteriorations are observed across different countries with income levels and also for crises that are and are not accompanied by recessions. On average, though, human and social indicators are hit harder during financial crisis events accompanied by recessions. This is especially true for crises in low- and middle-income economies in comparison to those in high-income countries. As a result, not only are financial crises directly responsible for more rapid increases in income inequality within countries; they may also be responsible for increasing inequalities of income, security, health, nutrition, and educational outcomes between richer and poorer countries. Needless to say, deteriorations in many of these fronts are often associated with persistent or permanent losses in human and social wellbeing and cannot be assumed to be simply and immediately reversed with an economic recovery. Therefore, the paper calls on the need for more concerted effort on the part of the policymakers to actively protect human and social outcomes during financial crises, rather than trying to address such losses in the aftermath of crises, because some of these losses are simply not recoverable.

Firms that offshore either outsource their activities to unaffiliated businesses, or internalize production by establishing subsidiaries from which they import intrafirm. We argue that the political environment in trade partner countries influences U.S. offshoring patterns in ways that have been ignored in the extant literature. Drawing on the political business cycle literature, we expect higher production costs and lower profits for firms in capital (labor) intensive sectors when the Left (Right) is in power. These partisan cycles, in turn, shape the sectoral composition of exports from the partner to the United States, and the degree to which trade is conducted intrafirm. Under a Left- (Right-) leaning government in a partner country, U.S. intrafirm imports of capital- (labor-) goods increase relative to total imports in these industries. Examining highly disaggregated U.S. import data, we find strong support for our argument. Our results indicate that the effect of partisan governments on offshore outsourcing depends on factor intensities of production, which vary across industries. The degree of internalization in global sourcing is shaped in part by the distributional objectives of partisan governments, and not by economic factors alone.","[Pinto, Pablo M.] Univ Houston, 3551 Cullen Blvd,Room 431, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Weymouth, Stephen] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston; Georgetown University,"Pinto, PM (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, Dept Polit Sci, 3551 Cullen Blvd,Room 431, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",ppinto@central.uh.edu,"Weymouth, Stephen/C-9562-2013",,,,,,58,1,1,7,20,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Contrary to the traditional wisdom, we find that government banks can play a beneficial role under certain circumstances. Government banks have higher loan growth rates than private banks during the crisis. In countries with low corruption, the increased lending by government banks is associated with better bank performance and more favorable GDP and employment growth in the crisis period. In contrast, the results for countries with high corruption are more consistent with the political view: the increased lending by government banks is associated with underperformance relative to private banks, and creates no beneficial effects on either GDP growth or employment.

Indeed, it is clear that the commons had multifarious ecological and economic benefits for both medieval and early modern rural societies in Western Europe. That being the case, many scholars have seen the increasing expropriation of the commons in the transition to the early modern period as a sign of increasing inequality characterizing pre-industrial Europe, and many have lamented the loss of communal grazing privileges connected to processes such as land enclosure - pushing poor peasants into the abyss' with the removal of their final form of welfare. However, in this paper it is argued that the social distribution of the benefits to the commons were rarely, if ever, entirely equitable. In fact, in many historical contexts the benefits of the commons could also be highly restricted - crystallizing and entrenching stratifications themselves, and even serving as the vehicle' of further inequality. The expropriation of the commons did not necessarily make Western European rural societies any more unequal.","[Curtis, Daniel R.] Univ Utrecht, Res Inst Hist & Art Hist, Drift 6, NL-3521 BS Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Curtis, DR (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Res Inst Hist & Art Hist, Drift 6, NL-3521 BS Utrecht, Netherlands.",d.r.curtis@uu.nl,"Curtis, Daniel/AAJ-4978-2021","Curtis, Daniel/0000-0001-8355-4153",ERC [339647]; European Research Council (ERC) [339647] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"Daniel Curtis is a postdoctoral researcher on an ERC-project led by Prof. Bas van Bavel entitled 'Coordinating for Life.

The first comparison is based on the Condorcet committee efficiency which is defined as the conditional probability for a peculiar voting rule to select the Condorcet committee, provided that such a committee exists. The second comparison is based on the likelihood of two paradoxes of committee elections: the Prior Successor Paradox and the Leaving Member Paradox, which occur when a member of an elected committee exits.

Based on an empirical investigation of the neoliberal soy regime in Paraguay, I document how the profound transformation of this country's agricultural mode of production over the past two decades, spurred by the neoliberal restructuring of agriculture and the biorevolution, has jeopardized rural livelihoods. In particular, I demonstrate how the transgenic soyization of Paraguay's agriculture has led to an increased concentration of landholdings, as well as the displacement and disempowerment of peasants and rural labourers who have been rendered surplus to the requirements of agribusiness capital. At the same time, the consolidation of this new agro-industrial model has fostered a growing dependence on agrochemicals that compromise environmental quality and human health. Thus, I argue, a development policy based on industrial monocropping of genetically modified (GM) soy is inappropriate, unsustainable and unethical.","[Ezquerro-Canete, Arturo] St Marys Univ, Int Dev Studies, 923 Robie St, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada,"Ezquerro-Cañete, A (通讯作者)，St Marys Univ, Int Dev Studies, 923 Robie St, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada.",arturo_ezquerro@hotmail.co.uk,,,,,,,45,38,43,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We first study a case in which the creative capital units are perfect substitutes in the production of the final good. We show that the equilibrium outcome is inefficient and that there is too little application of effort. Second, we define an indicator of inequality and show that an increase in inequality enhances efficiency and that it is possible to achieve complete efficiency. Third, we focus on the case where the individual creative capital units are perfect complements and show that the equilibrium outcome is inefficient with too little effort application. Finally, we contend that our theoretical results provide a possible rationale for the observed income inequality in cities and regions in which the activities of the creative class constitute a large part of all economic activities.

We present a model which analyzes this policy choice where two countries, home and foreign, face a terrorist threat based in the foreign country. The home country chooses how much to invest in defending itself and in reducing terrorist resources either indirectly by subsidizing the foreign country or by directly by intervening itself and risking destabilizing the foreign country. Using a calibrated model, we are able to show that direct intervention is only an equilibrium if foreign and home efforts are not good substitutes in the technology used to reduce the resources of the terrorist group. A higher relative military efficiency by the home country makes intervention more likely. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Garcia-Alonso, Maria D.

Posturing arises when an informed party needs to send a strong signal to induce skeptical third parties like employees, suppliers, customers, or competitors to develop/maintain relationships with the firm or take other actions that increase firm value. In the venture capital context, this can be credibly achieved if the VC publicly invests at high prices in later rounds. This tempers holdup by shifting ex-post bargaining power toward the entrepreneur, inducing him to exert greater effort.","[Khanna, Naveen] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Mathews, Richmond D.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Michigan State University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Mathews, RD (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, 4411 Munching Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",rmathews@rhsmith.umd.edu,,,,,,,72,6,9,5,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

Since the optimal hedge ratio can be expressed by the ratio of variance of futures returns to the covariance of spot and futures, the BGARCH model is quite useful to estimate the conditional hedge ratio. However, it is well known that high variability of an estimated conditional hedge ratio results in lower hedge effectiveness. In this study, we consider a simple shrinkage method to deal with this inverse relationship between volatility of the conditional hedge ratio and hedging effectiveness. Our main idea is that the shrinkage version of the optimal hedge ratio can be obtained from a convex combination of unconditional sample covariance matrix and conditional covariance matrices of a conventional BGARCH model. Our empirical results show the usefulness of our proposed model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we analyze how specific announcements related to vulnerable eurozone member states, European Central Bank (ECB) actions, and credit rating downgrades affect the value and the crash risk of the euro. We proxy the appreciation and depreciation of the euro by its abnormal foreign exchange (FX) rate returns with respect to 35 currencies. The crash risk of the euro is proxied by the conditional skewness of the FX rate return distribution with respect to the same currencies. We find that the market reacts positively to news related to countries under EU/IMF rescue umbrella. We discover that ECB actions on average result in a euro depreciation on the day of the announcement reflecting obvious concerns of market participants, but the effect is partly reversed the day after. Our analysis also shows that sovereign and corporate credit rating downgrades tend to lead to a depreciation of the euro and, more importantly, to an increase of the euro crash risk. Interestingly, we find that specific announcements about Greece on average do not substantially affect the euro exchange rate directly; however, it does have an overall significant effect on the euro crash risk, imposing a substantial risk for the stability of the common currency in the eurozone.

There is a significant and negative relationship between news sentiment and changes in CDS spreads, which is consistent with ex-ante expectations that credit risk will decrease (increase) with positive (negative) news. This relationship is asymmetric with negative news inducing a stronger effect than positive news. There is also an apparent strengthening in this news sentiment/credit risk relationship during the crisis period. This coincides with a period when the number of news articles is highest, and the availability of news has a significant influence on CDS spreads. There is some evidence that whilst market determined credit measures (CDS spreads) respond to news releases, bank determined measures (LIBOR-OIS spreads) do not. Such results add to the discussion on whether banks correctly incorporate news into their own evaluation of credit risk. Understanding the behaviour of credit risk measures aids market participants, regulators, and central bankers in determining appropriate policy choices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To help meet the needs of struggling homeowners, housing counseling agencies provided education and assistance to offer support. However, after services ended and housing outcomes were identified, families returned to their daily life. Little is known about the experiences and needs of households during and after receiving housing counseling services. This qualitative, in-depth, phenomenological assessment gives voice to the experience of housing instability for families 3 years after initially receiving services from an agency in one economically challenged, urban, Midwestern community. The findings from this study highlight the experience of four Midwestern families, through the use of Seidman's (Interviewing as qualitative research, 4th edn. Teachers College Press, New York, 2012) three stage interview design, in which the researchers conducted three distinct interviews with each of four participants and two interviews with former housing counselors from the same agency.

It is applied to investigate the relationship between inequality and the SE on a cross-section of 118 countries. We disentangle the effect of inequality on the SE ratio by estimating both direct and indirect effects on both the numerator and denominator of the ratio separately. We find that an increase in inequality increases the SE ratio. This positive correlation is primarily due to a reduction in the official GDP rather than an increase in the SE. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, we argue that, at times, academics choose to launch an independent company vis-A -vis pursuing alternative business engagement activities when their university provides inadequate support. Drawing from hybrid entrepreneurship and necessity entrepreneurship, we model the individual decision to spin-off as a reaction to the organizational characteristics of the parent university, rather than to its outcome. Through a longitudinal study of 559 spin-offs from 85 Italian universities from 1999 to 2013, we find that although stronger administrative support from the parent university leads academics to create more technology spin-offs, a U-shaped relationship instead exists between the number of administrative staff within a university and the rate of establishment of non-technology spin-offs. When the level of administrative staff is too low or too high relative to the fitted amount estimated using several university-level factors, academic staff reacts by establishing firms to achieve improved cash and human resource management.","[Meoli, Michele; Vismara, Silvio] Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Via Pasubio 7b, I-24044 Dalmine, BG, Italy; [Meoli, Michele; Vismara, Silvio] Univ Bergamo, CCSE, Bergamo, Italy; [Meoli, Michele; Vismara, Silvio] Univ Augsburg, CCSE, Augsburg, Germany",University of Bergamo; University of Bergamo; University of Augsburg,"Meoli, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Informat & Prod Engn, Via Pasubio 7b, I-24044 Dalmine, BG, Italy.",michele.meoli@unibg.it,"Meoli, Michele/X-2093-2019","Meoli, Michele/0000-0002-9438-0782; Vismara, Silvio/0000-0001-5411-0326",,,,,59,69,71,3,112,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

While fire sales do cause damage no matter how they arise, the tools available to lessen the harm from the two types of fire sales are different.

Nonetheless, economists also recognize the production advantages of urban density in the form of positive agglomeration externalities. The long-run equilibrium outcomes in economies with multiple correlated but offsetting externalities have yet to be fully explored in the literature. Therefore, I develop a spatial equilibrium model of urban structure that includes both congestion costs and agglomeration externalities. I then estimate the structural parameters of the model using a computational algorithm to match the spatial distribution of employment, population, land use, land rents, and commute times in the data. Policy simulations based on the estimates suggest that congestion pricing may have ambiguous consequences for economic welfare. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This is termed economic depreciation and it may be influenced by the age and quality of buildings, amount and timing of expenditure, and wider market and economic conditions. In this paper, we examine why individual assets experience different depreciation rates, applying panel regression techniques to 375 office and industrial assets in the United Kingdom. The results suggest that rental value depreciation rates reduce as buildings get older, while a composite measure of age and quality provides more explanation of depreciation than age alone. Furthermore, economic and local real estate market conditions are significant in explaining how depreciation rates change over time.","[Crosby, Neil; Devaney, Steven; Nanda, Anupam] Univ Reading, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Crosby, N (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Reading RG6 6UD, Berks, England.",f.n.crosby.@henley.reading.ac.uk; s.devaney@reading.ac.uk; a.nanda@reading.ac.uk,"Nanda, Anupam/L-4226-2019","Nanda, Anupam/0000-0002-3036-5890; Devaney, Steven/0000-0002-1916-2558",,,,,40,6,6,0,3,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

Consistent with voluntary information disclosure theories, we find that a public announcement is less likely to be made when the start-up firm is in the seed stage but more likely when the parent company is large, active in concentrated markets and in non-high-tech industries; spends heavily on internal R&D and capital expenditures; has low leverage ratio; and faces more information asymmetry problems. In addition, corporate venture capital programs managed externally disclose more often than internal programs. We find that parent companies facing more severe asymmetric information problems enjoy the highest abnormal returns in response to announcements.

Under the standard approaches to modeling the group size paradox, individual welfare declines as the size of the group expands. However, this may not be true if we apply the group size paradox to politics. In particular, if a smaller group attempts to extract a fixed income transfer from a larger group, the welfare of individuals in the larger group is increasing monotonically in the size of their group under a standard contest success function. Even though the probability of the transfer taking place is rising monotonically in the size of the group, the expected transfer per member shrinks because more members share the burden of financing the transfer. A similar result is obtained if the transfer is modeled as a fixed entitlement to be received by each member of the smaller group. By contrast, if the transfer imposes a fixed cost per member of the larger group, the result that individual welfare in the larger group is falling monotonically in its own group size is restored.","[Pecorino, Paul] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Box 870224, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Pecorino, P (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Box 870224, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",ppecorin@cba.ua.edu,"Pecorino, Paul/AAA-9292-2019","Pecorino, Paul/0000-0002-7659-7873",,,,,40,3,3,1,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2016,168.0,1-2,,,,,137,152,,10.1007/s11127-016-0353-4,0.0,,,16,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DR5EY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379927300008,0

As such, the transition from roving to stationary bandit is likely to involve the redefinition of the in-group, its collective interest, and the type of goods that it provides. To illustrate these points, I employ a case study of the roving Visigothic confederacy as it evolved during the fourth and fifth centuries towards the stationary Visigothic Kingdom. The illustration provides insights into why competition amongst roving bandits does not always (or often) lead to the emergence of a non-predatory state.","[Young, Andrew T.] West Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University,"Young, AT (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",Andrew.Young@mail.wvu.edu,,,,,,,92,18,18,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2016,168.0,1-2,,,,,75,102,,10.1007/s11127-016-0350-7,0.0,,,28,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DR5EY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379927300005,0

This paper finds empirical support for the importance of the central institutional constraint for a 14-country sample of Latin American countries over 1990-2012. These results suggest that greater central bank autonomy has indeed helped reign in fiscal excesses in a region that has been plagued by inflationary deficit expansion for much of the post-war period. The ability to potentially discipline government policy adds to an independent central bank's inherent role in adding to the checks and balances essential to a well-functioning democracy.,"[Burdekin, Richard C.

In this paper, we examine a much larger set of countries and time periods to attempt to gain insights into this relationship. In particular, the central question is whether corruption can compensate for a bad business climate. Our results are clear; corruption hurts entrepreneurship. The impact is smaller, but remains negative, when business climates are bad. This is in contrast to previous literature that suggests corruption may increase entrepreneurship under a bad business climate. We find corruption never improves entrepreneurship; it simply hurts less when business climates are not conducive to growth in the first place.","[Dutta, Nabamita] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA; [Sobel, Russell] The Citadel, Sch Business Adm, Charleston, SC 29409 USA",University of Wisconsin System,"Dutta, N (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA.",ndutta@uwlax.edu; russell.sobel@citadel.edu,"Dutta, Nabamita/K-3728-2019","Dutta, Nabamita/0000-0002-0943-5217; Sobel, Russell/0000-0001-6820-5414",,,,,69,135,143,2,64,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This study investigated perceptions of stepfathers' obligation to financially support stepchildren using quantitative and qualitative methods, and built on previous research by including contextual variables to explore the processes underpinning judgements of kinship responsibilities using a distributive justice framework. Data from a community sample in Western Australia (N = 200) showed a large amount of variability in responses, however most participants believed stepfathers should contribute financially to some extent. Significant reductions in perceived obligations were associated with both cohabiting relationship status and maternal employment, but not with the presence of prior child support commitments by the stepfather.

This paper examines the existence of a non-linear relationship between emissions and economic growth using methods that do not restrict the relationship to be any particular shape. The methodology employs instrumental variables in the place of per capita GDP to deal with potential concerns about errors in variables and endogeneity. The empirical results provide strong support for the environmental Kuznets curve, with estimated turning points in 1966 and 1967 for and , respectively. These turning points correspond roughly with the introduction of the Clean Air Act in the UK as well as the reduction in the use of coal as an energy source; and together, they provide a snapshot of the forces driving the turning points. The paper continues by further investigating the temporal behavior of the inverted U-shaped relationship. The findings indicate that if emissions and per capita GDP deviate from their long-run relationship, emissions do the heavy lifting to restore the system to equilibrium. This result is intuitively pleasing because mitigation is directly affected by legislation as opposed to declining economic growth.","[Sephton, Peter] Queens Univ, Sch Business, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Mann, Janelle] Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada",Queens University - Canada; University of Manitoba,"Sephton, P (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Sch Business, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",Psephton@business.queensu.ca; Janelle.Mann@ad.umanitoba.ca,"Sephton, Peter/JFS-9778-2023","Sephton, Peter/0000-0002-8871-6649",,,,,28,48,48,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

A reduced factor, time-independent and Markovian representation of the forward curve is developed that explains 99% of the curve dynamics and incorporates implied volatility seasonality. A system of partial differential equations for valuation and optimization is derived. The resulting PDEs are solved using a specialized implementation of the radial basis function (RBF) technique. The combination of the time-independent, Markovian, framework facilitates the optimization of high-deliverability storage contracts. In addition, as a by-product of the RBF-PDE solution process, a series of analytic RBF expansions for the value of the gas storage contract is produced. These expansions can be differentiated analytically at virtually no cost to obtain hedging statistics. These expansions can also facilitate the millions of individual contract valuations required to price and hedge CCR. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

They lie in a single-digit range, i.e. substantially lower than previous estimates based on older data. Our results may reflect the progressive phasing out of command-and-control instruments such as quantitative restrictions in many countries; they also suggest that sanitary and technical regulations have not substituted for them as trade-restrictive interventions. Most interestingly, we show that deep-integration clauses in regional trade agreements, in particular the mutual recognition of conformity-assessment procedures, substantially reduce the price-raising effect of NTMs, possibly reflecting lower compliance costs.","[Cadot, Olivier] Univ Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Cadot, Olivier] CEPR, London, England; [Cadot, Olivier] FERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Gourdon, Julien] CEPII, Paris, France",University of Lausanne; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Cadot, O (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.;Cadot, O (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.;Cadot, O (通讯作者)，FERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France.",olivier.cadot@unil.ch; julien.gourdon@cepii.fr,,,"France's Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-10-LABX-14-01, ANR-12-JSH1-0002-0]; Switzerland's NCCR WP6 Impact assessment; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-12-JSH1-0002] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)",France's Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Switzerland's NCCR WP6 Impact assessment; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We are grateful to Lionel Fontagne, Sebastien Jean, Frank Van Tongeren, Michael Ferrantino, Anne-Celia Disdier, Gianluca Orefice and to other participants at CEPII Conference Non-tariff measures: Economic Analysis and Policy Appraisal'' in Paris and at the Issues on quantification of Non-tariff measures'' session of the GTAP conference in Shanghai for useful comments and suggestions.

In particular, it accounts for the possibility that firms can not only export their products, but also internationally source their inputs, either directly or indirectly. Using a cross section of firm level data for several advanced and developing economies, the study confirms the productivity-sorting prediction according to which domestic firms are less efficient than those that resort to an export intermediary, while the latter are less productive than producers which export directly. We show that the same sorting exists on the import side. By considering firms involved in both exporting and importing activities, we also find that direct two-way traders are on average more productive than firms trading indirectly on one of the two trade sides. The latter are in turn more efficient than indirect two-way traders. Finally, we investigate the effects of source-country characteristics on the sorting of firms into different modes of international trade.","[Grazzi, Marco] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy; [Tomasi, Chiara] Univ Trento, Dept Econ, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Tomasi, Chiara] Scuola Super Sant Anna, LEM, Pisa, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Trento; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Tomasi, C (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Econ, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy.;Tomasi, C (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, LEM, Pisa, Italy.",chiara.tomasi@unitn.it,"Grazzi, Marco/A-6195-2012","Grazzi, Marco/0000-0002-4196-6122; Tomasi, Chiara/0000-0002-1962-7351","Fondazione Cassa dei Risparmi di Forl, Grant ORGANIMPRE","Fondazione Cassa dei Risparmi di Forl, Grant ORGANIMPRE","We thank Andrew B.

Significant fractions of housing transactions involve sales prices that are either below or above asking price, which might suggest that asking price has limited relevance. However, many housing transactions involve a sales price exactly equal to asking price (a fact that has previously drawn little notice), strongly suggesting that asking price does matter. The paper develops a model where asking price is neither a binding commitment nor a ceiling, yet still directs buyer search and impacts sales price. Using novel survey data, the paper provides empirical evidence consistent with asking price playing a directing role in buyer search. Consistent with theory, this effect is stronger for more atypical houses and in bust markets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Existing business cycle models appear inconsistent with the evidence. This paper presents a model of the business cycle in which households have imperfect knowledge of long-run growth rate of endogenous variables and continually learn about these growth rates. The model features comovement and mutual influence between households' growth expectations and market outcomes. It can replicate the evidence on growth forecasts and suggests that optimism and pessimism about long-run growth rates is a crucial ingredient in understanding business cycle fluctuations.

Until the innovative ISO 9001:2015 proposal it was no direct connection to the other management systems like risk management, knowledge management or environmental management. So far, only few bodies ensured interconnections between different systems of management or associated the quality management system with the strategic planning process. However, healthcare encapsulates supplementary requirements which affect a number of different systems. Additionally, the financial crisis has encouraged the trend to operate integrated reporting beyond financial aspects. This paper aims at presenting the experience on the development of integrated management and reporting system integrated in an organization belonging to the health sector. The work clarifies the steps towards merging distinctly regulated management systems (quality, health or environmental management) with strategic planning and controlling, via a Balanced Dashboard (Balanced Scorecard -BSC) as well as integrated reporting according to the model International Integrated Reporting Initiative (IIRI) in a German medical company - Radiologische Netzwerk Rheinland - RNR AG. Using the case study method, the paper's purpose is to highlight approaches and results of the company that could support practitioners from medical area and bezound. The literature review clarified theoretical concepts while the case study allowed converging comprehensive information and knowledge accumulated by RNR AG, thus helping to bridge the gap between literature on total integrated management reporting and reporting system in healthcare.","[Nagel-Piciorus, Claus; Nagel-Piciorus, Luciana; Sarbu, Roxana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Nagel-Piciorus, Claus] RNR AG, Leverkusen, Germany",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Nagel-Piciorus, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.;Nagel-Piciorus, C (通讯作者)，RNR AG, Leverkusen, Germany.",claus.nagel-piciorus@outlook.com,"Sarbu, Roxana/K-1659-2016; Sarbu, Roxana/Q-9937-2017",,,,,,25,6,6,0,35,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2016,18.0,42,,,,,432,445,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DP1SW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378270700013,0

An extended bio-economic model of a fishery is developed to include nutrient enrichment and built into a general model of the polluting and fishery sector with nutrient concentration and fish stock as state variables. The marginal damage function for nutrient enrichment is derived. This function can be compared with the marginal abatement cost and hence it provides a basis for policies that balance the use of nutrients in land-based industries (for example agriculture) with the external cost to the marine environment. The model is empirically applied to the case of the Baltic Sea, where Eastern Baltic cod fisheries are affected by nutrient enrichment. The results indicate that nitrogen loading needs to be reduced slightly (around 1 %) to reach optimal levels. The results also show that the optimal fishery policy plays a more important role in producing the net benefits than nitrogen reduction policies do. Further, the impact on the productivity of the fish stock from pollution reduction is higher when an optimal policy is followed.","[Thanh Viet Nguyen] VNU Univ Econ & Business, Fac Dev Econ, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Ravn-Jonsen, Lars; Vestergaard, Niels] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Environm & Business Econ, Ctr Fisheries & Aquaculture Management & Econ FAM, Esbjerg, Denmark",Vietnam National University Hanoi; University of Southern Denmark,"Vestergaard, N (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Environm & Business Econ, Ctr Fisheries & Aquaculture Management & Econ FAM, Esbjerg, Denmark.",nv@sam.sdu.dk,"Viet Nguyen, Thanh/ABA-8492-2020","Viet Nguyen, Thanh/0000-0001-5829-6965; Vestergaard, Niels/0000-0001-9270-2461; Ravn-Jonsen, Lars J./0000-0003-4063-852X",European Community [226675],European Community,"The authors thank participants at the II Workshop on age-structured models in fishery economics and bioeconomic modelling (2011), the Norwegian University of Science and Technology Seminar (2012) and The Danish Environmental Economic Conference (2013) for comments and suggestions.

This paper attempts to examine the ATDC scheme, particularly focus on the knowledge construction at macro level of design and the knowledge encounter at micro level of daily operation based on the case studies in Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique. Our study finds multiple facets of the ATDC, i.e., the cleavage between the macro-level of policy design and micro level of implementation realities; the interplay between knowledge and politics, and appearance of possible alternative development pathways stimulated by ATDCs in African countries. The paper argues that even though the ATDC is a technology-centered scheme, it is inevitably a social and political process in implementation, resulting in the discontinuity of the policy results. With a whole set of ideas and imaginaries being delivered, frustrated, and negotiated, the ATDC creates a very different vision to the established CG system, or the western bilateral aid programs. As an embodiment of a traveling technocratic rationality, the ATDCs are important sites for negotiations over knowledge and politics, and the meanings of aid, investment, and development, as part of the wider playing out of China's engagement in Africa.

It defines an individual's choice set of plausible activity locations and influences his/her daily activity-travel patterns. Despite its importance, how individuals' activity travel patterns interact with their mental maps on a daily basis is largely unknown, mainly due to data, operation, and measurement issues. The aim of this study is to address this. A total of 57 individuals in Stockholm were asked to record a two-week travel diary and draw their familiar areas in the specified maps. The familiar areas, which in this study are considered as representative of individual mental maps, were manually drawn and transferred from graph to ASCII code in ArcGIS for modelling purposes. The recently visited activity locations were used to construct the individuals' activity spaces. The crucial determinants that related to these activity spaces and familiar areas were investigated. The marginal effect of each key variable was calculated in order to understand the magnitude of influence of each variable to the individuals' activity spaces and familiar areas. The results show that an individual's activity space is partially or completely located within the individual's familiar areas and they are strongly correlated to each other. Large activity centres, such as Stockholm's central areas and areas of Huvudsta have higher probabilities to be included in both individuals' familiar areas and activity spaces than other areas that are closer to home.

Model risk, which is the potential for different models to provide inconsistent outcomes, is shown to be increasing with market uncertainty. During calm periods, the underlying risk forecast models produce similar risk readings; hence, model risk is typically negligible. However, the disagreement between the various candidate models increases significantly during market distress, further frustrating the reliability of risk readings. Finally, particular conclusions on the underlying reasons for the high model risk and the implications for practitioners and policy makers are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using a novel dataset that tracks user requests for accounting reports stored in the SEC EDGAR database, we find that requests for historic reports during the fiscal year are positively associated with financial reporting complexity and that requests around earnings announcements are positively associated with accounting discretion and negative earnings shocks (particularly for conservative firms). Finally, we find that daily requests for historical reports are positively associated with shocks to firm value (particularly negative shocks). Overall, our evidence suggests that historical reports make up an important component of the information mosaic assembled by investors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using a large sample of IPOs from 1987 to 2010, we estimate regressions of offer prices and first-day underpricing on tax rates. Supporting tax capitalization, IPO offer prices decrease in long-term capital gains taxes. Supporting lock-in, IPO underpricing increases in the long-term and short-term tax rate differential.

They aim to identify contributing risk factors and calculate risk rates based on - most of the time - highly aggregated statistical data. In contrast to such explanatory study designs, the presented study follows an exploratory approach, focusing on the absolute number of crashes. The aim is to reveal and describe patterns and dynamics of urban bicycle crashes on various spatial scale levels and temporal resolutions through a multi-stage workflow. Spatial units are delineated in the network space and serve as initial units of aggregation. In order to facilitate comparisons among regions and quantify temporal dynamics, a reference value of crash frequency is simulated for each unit of the respective spatial scale level and temporal resolution. For the presented case study, over 3000 geo-coded bicycle crashes in the city of Salzburg (Austria) were analyzed. The data set covers 10 years and comprises all bicycle crashes reported by the police. Distinct spatial and temporal patterns with clusters, seasonal variations, and regional particularities could be revealed. These insights are indicators for urban dynamics in the transport system and allow for further, targeted in-depth analyses and subsequent counter measures. Moreover, the results prove the applicability of the proposed multi-stage workflow and demonstrate the added value of analyses of small aggregates on various scale levels, down to single crashes, and temporal resolutions.

Furthermore, compared to individuals with an external Locus of Control, individuals with a more internal Locus of Control have a significantly higher probability of being higher-paid instead of low-paid. Conditional on being low-paid, individuals with an internal Locus of Control have a significantly higher probability, of moving to higher-paid employment in the following year than individuals with an external Locus of Control.

We then confront our model with data from an experiment using prepared, restaurant-style meals-a good that is transparent in immediate pleasure (taste) but non-transparent in future harm (calories). Our results support the notion that strategic self-ignorance matters: nearly three of five subjects (58%) chose to ignore free information on calorie content, leading at-risk subjects to consume significantly more calories. We also find evidence consistent with our model on the determinants of strategic self-ignorance.","[Thunstrom, Linda] HUI Res AB, S-10329 Stockholm, Sweden; [Thunstrom, Linda; Shogren, Jason F.; van't Veld, Klaas] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Nordstrom, Jonas] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Box 117, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Nordstrom, Jonas] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Ehmke, Mariah] Univ Wyoming, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wyoming; Lund University; University of Copenhagen; University of Wyoming,"Thunström, L (通讯作者)，HUI Res AB, S-10329 Stockholm, Sweden.;Thunström, L (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",lthunstr@uwyo.edu; jonas.nordstrom@nek.lu.se; jramses@uwyo.edu; mehmke@uwyo.edu; klaas@uwyo.edu,"Ehmke, Mariah/J-1402-2019; Nordström, Jonas/AAR-6623-2020; Shogren, Jason/N-8193-2019","Ehmke, Mariah/0000-0003-0402-0896; Nordström, Jonas/0000-0001-8608-7976; Shogren, Jason/0000-0003-3757-959X; Thunstrom, Linda/0000-0002-5728-4089",Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research; Swedish Retail and Wholesale Development Council; University of Wyoming's College of Agriculture and Natural Resources' Global Perspectives Funds,Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)); Swedish Retail and Wholesale Development Council; University of Wyoming's College of Agriculture and Natural Resources' Global Perspectives Funds,"We thank David Granlund for helpful comments and suggestions, and seminar participants at the FOI, University of Copenhagen, and participants at the AAEA Annual Meeting 2012.

Consistent with predictions from theory, the data show additional saving and a shift toward safer assets in the years leading up to unemployment, and depletion of savings after job loss. In the years after job loss, the households' after-tax labor income is reduced by about USD 12,500. Over the same time period, households deplete USD 3,000 of their financial assets, of which one third is accumulated prior to the job loss. This suggests that at least some households can foresee and prepare for the upcoming unemployment, which indicates that private savings can, to some extent, serve as a substitute for publicly provided unemployment insurance.","[Basten, Christoph] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Basten, Christoph] FINMA, Zurich, Switzerland; [Fagereng, Andreas; Telle, Kjetil] Stat Norway, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Statistics Norway,"Basten, C (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.;Basten, C (通讯作者)，FINMA, Zurich, Switzerland.;Fagereng, A; Telle, K (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway.",basten@kof.ethz.ch; andreas.fagereng@ssb.no; kjetil.telle@ssb.no,,"Fagereng, Andreas/0000-0002-0427-9737; Basten, Christoph/0000-0001-8104-1370",Norwegian Research Council [184563],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"We are indebted to Luigi Guiso, Andrea Ichino, and Erzo Luttmer for helpful guidance, and grateful for helpful comments from the Editor, two anonymous reviewers, Christopher Carroll, John Cochrane, Russell Cooper, Stefano DellaVigna, Sigurd Galaasen, Torbjorn Haegeland, Sturla Lokken, Jorgen Modalsli, Monica Paiella, Kjell Salvanes, and Ola Lotherington Vestad, as well as seminar participants at the 2010 Oxford Clarendon Conference on Labour and Finance, the 2010 Congress of the European Economic Association, the 2012 conference of the European Association of Labour Economists, the 2012 DNB Conference on Household Finances and Behaviour in Times of Crisis, the 2013 Research Symposium at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the 2013 Royal Economic Society Annual Conference, the 2014 SEEK Conference on Public Finance and Income Distribution in Europe, the Harvard Labor and Public Economics Brownbag, and the microeconometrics workshops at the European University Institute and Statistics Norway.

While it has become increasingly clear that nominal price levels influence investor behavior, why prices matter to investors is a question that as of yet has gone unanswered. We find widespread evidence that investors systematically overestimate the skewness of low-priced stocks. In the broad cross-section of stocks, we find that investors substantially overweight the importance of price when forming skewness expectations. Asset pricing implications of our findings are borne out in the options market. A zero-cost option portfolio strategy that exploits investor overestimation of skewness for low-priced stocks generates significant abnormal returns. Finally, investor expectations of future skewness increase drastically on days that a stock undergoes a split to a lower nominal price. Empirically, however, future physical skewness decreases following splits. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using the firm level data on Chinese enterprises during 2001-2007, we find that interest payment of private enterprises is negatively related to the return on sales (ROS) and asset growth, which implies a detrimental effect of bank loans on private firms' performance. But this linkage is significantly positive for state-owned enterprises. Focusing on private enterprises, the grabbing impact from banks is strongest for firms without government subsidies, with low production values, with small size, or with low capital intensity. Our results are robust to alternative estimation approach and variable specifications. To conclude, the bank-centred financial system in China has assisted in the development of state-owned enterprises, while the development of private enterprises has been impeded by Chinese banks.

Out-of-sample forecasts, which are conducted according to the asset allocation problem, reveal a swing in REIT-stocic lower tail dependence during the global financial crisis. The lower-tail dependence exceeds 0.8, and thus implies stronger cross-asset linkages and fewer diversification opportunities in asset busts. These findings further suggest that the range-based volatility (asymmetric CARR) model is superior to the return-based (GJR-GARCH) framework, particufarly as the global financial crisis prevails. Positive economic values of dynamic strategies are more evident during the crisis than pre- and post-crisis sub periods. The mortgage spread and VIX are informative in predicting REIT-stock tail dependences, and out-of-sample economic values improve as the mortgage and term spreads are considered.

This study uses community-, household-, and parcel-level data from rural Uganda to examine the causes and consequences of different forms of land-related conflicts. We pay special attention to how population pressure and internal migration affects land conflicts. We find more land conflict cases in migrant host and ethnically diverse communities. We also find a higher probability of having land conflicts in districts that have had high population growth rates. As a consequence, we find that the yield is 22% lower on parcels with land conflicts than on parcels without conflicts, owned by the same household. After unbundling conflicts, we find that eviction conflicts hurt productivity more than other conflict types. Parcels with eviction conflicts have 45% lower yield compared with those without conflicts. Our results suggest that population pressure and internal migration weakens social cohesion and hence negatively affects community-specific informal land arrangements and conflict resolution mechanisms, which in turn, result in land conflicts. Ethnic diversity increases the likelihood of eviction-related conflicts which hurts production. Indeed we find that farmers in migrant host communities are less likely to consult informal conflict resolution channels when faced with conflicts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Empirical identification of these effects, however, remains difficult because user group characteristics are unlikely random across systems and data of communally managed resources are hard to come by, exposing analyses to omitted variable bias. To address this issue, I collect a panel data set of 50 communal irrigation systems in New Mexico. With annual observations from 1984 to 2011, I test for the impact of group size, new users, and group heterogeneity using fixed effects, controlling for a number of time-invariant factors that would otherwise be omitted. I find robust results demonstrating that larger user groups experience worse outcomes. However, if I forgo the fixed effects and mimic cross-sectional analysis, I identify a result smaller in magnitude and statistical significance, suggesting that omitted variable bias can account for some of the weak evidence in the existing literature.","[Smith, Steven M.] Haverford Coll, Econ & Environm Studies, Haverford, PA 19041 USA",Haverford College,"Smith, SM (通讯作者)，Haverford Coll, Econ & Environm Studies, Haverford, PA 19041 USA.",ssmith4@haverford.edu,,"Smith, Steven/0000-0002-9653-2663","Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1115009] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,58,19,21,1,9,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Does large FDI inflow automatically lead to the export boom? Or is it a must for China to have certain absorptive capacity (AC) given FDI? This work investigates how manufacturing exports (MX) are affected by the AC-FDI interaction. MX performance is assessed by three indicators: export capacity, export intensity, and export quality. AC is defined as a host-country's ability to capture potential benefits from FDI, and such ability is proxied by govemment FDI policy, human capital, R&D, and infrastructure. Estimates are conducted with the data on 21 manufacturing sectors for 31 regions over 8 years (2005-2012). We find that (a) AC is necessary condition for China to benefit from FDI in MX, and contributions of FDI alone to MX are limited; (b) China's strong AC largely comes from well-designed FDI policy and high quality infrastructure, both of which complement with FDI in strengthening export capacity, intensity and quality; and (c) human capital and R&D seems to be more helpful for China to capture spillovers from FDI to export quality.

A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted, being answered by 350 respondents: mix of graduate and post graduate doctors of private and public hospitals of Karachi City, and pharmaceutical personnel (mix of sales and marketing) of national and multinational pharmaceutical companies operating in Pakistan. To test hypothesis, structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed using AMOS 7 software package. As data are normally distributed, maximum likelihood method of estimation was used. Factorial ANOVA also enables us to examine the interaction effect between the factors. The results from factorial ANOVA test all the hypotheses of model, and results were declared significant at p <0.05. Findings are interesting as they establish association between variables (scientific literatures, promotional material, regular follow up, CMEs & conferences, personalized activities) and prescription behavior of doctors mediated by strong phenomenon of medical representative PR and brand image of a company/product in changing the prescription behavior of doctors. Based on the results of this study, the pharmaceutical companies can device better marketing strategies keeping in view of these mediating effects. The article presents only two mediating and five marketing factors, whereas, more marketing and mediating variables can be added and tested, so, in future this gape can be overcome by other researchers. Moreover, a larger sample size could be applied and the scope of study can be enhanced.","[Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem; Awais, Muhammad] Indus Univ, Karachi, Pakistan; [Vveinhardt, Jolita; Streimikiene, Dalia] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Lithuanian Sports University,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania.",dalia.streimikiene@lei.lt,"Awais, Muhammad/HCI-3725-2022; Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/B-9632-2016; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Asif, Muhammad/IQS-5311-2023; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020","Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/0000-0001-5844-5502; Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912",,,,,60,15,16,0,19,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2016,18.0,41,,,,,153,167,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DF9WN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371713100011,0

Nevertheless, he realizes a large fraction of his profits from trading on long-term price changes. The fast speculator's behavior matches evidence about high-frequency traders.

This paper investigates whether the depositor discipline of banking works in the context of an emerging economy under financial repression and implicit government guarantee, such as the Chinese economy; how banking market discipline is affected by Internet finance development; and whether the impact of Internet finance development on market discipline changes across heterogeneous banks. The results suggest that, in general, measures of bank risk are negatively associated with the growth of deposit volumes. Internet finance development alters the sensitivity of deposit growth ratios to some bank risk measures. For non-state-owned banks, fewer measures of bank risk are significantly negatively associated with the growth of deposit volumes, and the attenuation impact of Internet finance development on market discipline for bank capitalization instead relatively increases. For large banks, market discipline works significantly, except in the case of the bank capitalization variable; moreover, these significant market disciplines are strengthened with the development of Internet finance.

In order to catch up with the most competitive regions, the region of Bucharest-Ilfov needs to develop a service-inclusive innovation system, which in turn requires an adequate policy mix. The main aim of this paper is to provide an assessment of the service innovation system in the Bucharest-Ilfov region, by confronting its current performance with the regional innovation policy context. On one hand, we characterize the performance of the service innovation system in accordance with the methodology and the data provided by the European Service Innovation Scoreboard. On the other hand, using desk research and in-depth interviews with experts, we investigate the service innovation policy mix on conceptual grounds provided by the literature regarding the typology of service innovation policy approaches. We find that the policy measures supporting innovation that are available in the Bucharest-Ilfov region are not specifically targeted to regional development priorities and are predominantly technology oriented. Policies are not systemic and ignore the potential of knowledge intensive business services to be a driver for innovation in the region. This paper highlights the stakes of adopting a coherent regional innovation policy, designed systemically, and exploiting the full potential of knowledge-based services. Being aware of the current state of service innovation within the region and its potential, the stakeholders may benefit of the recommendations included within the paper.","[Iosif, Alina-Elena; Tachiciu, Laurentiu] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Iosif, AE (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",iosif.alinaelena@gmail.com,"Iosif, Alina-Elena/B-4435-2015","Tachiciu, Laurentiu/0000-0002-2566-0342",,,,,25,3,3,0,16,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2016,18.0,41,,,,,8,24,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DF9WN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371713100002,0

Participants (N=120) had to make choices between a certain and risky payoff only for themselves (individual context) and choices in which the participants were paired with another randomly assigned participant who functioned as a passive recipient (interpersonal context). In the interpersonal context the risky option was beneficial for the other person while the certain option was not. Thus, the interpersonal choice context was an abstract representation of the incentive structure in helping situations, which yield risk only for the helper. Risky options in the interpersonal context yielded different payoff distributions, which allowed us to identify how considerations of fairness affect interpersonal risky choices. To assess other-regarding preferences, a dictator game was played. First we found that participants were generally less risk averse in the interpersonal choices; however, the degree of risk aversion was affected by the distribution of payoffs between decider and recipient. Furthermore, we found that changes of risk aversion in an interpersonal context could be predicted with the proposed splits in the dictator game. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Banks may compensate this adverse effect by taking more risk. These offsetting effects render an intermediate level of transparency optimal.

We propose that informality can be understood in terms of property rights (presence/absence, strength, completeness, and ambiguity). Drawing on the property rights (entitlements) theories of Sen, de Soto, Ostrom, Alchian, and Coase, we refine a list of property rights effects that can be tested empirically. Using a household questionnaire survey of 1,208 respondents from a representative sample of 60 urban villages in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, we use robust regression models to detect statistical relationships between household performance on six poverty domains as a function of four property rights domains, controlling for income, human capital, and other influences. We find evidence for what we call Sen effects and de Soto effects. Our models show that some property rights are associated with lower poverty indicators. But we also find evidence to show that the absence, weakness, or ambiguity of property rights also reduce poverty indicators on particular domains, through what we assume to be a substitution effect. Informal settlements permit poorer household to live at lower costs than is usually, or officially, acceptable, and thus spend more on other welfare-enhancing expenditures.

Studies on performance generally measure health attainment using the average health level of the population and quantify health improvement employing the change in attainment over time. However, this approach is flawed because the change in attainment does not satisfy good properties, on the one hand, and because health attainment should not only account for the average health level but also for disparities in health in the population, on the other hand. We propose a solution to the first limitation by following the lead of Kakwani (1993), who uses achievement and improvement measures which are based on attainment measures and which satisfy important properties. For the second limitation, we extend the work of Kakwani and propose new definitions of attainment that account for the average health level but also for health inequalities in the population. Specifically, we focus on overall and social health inequalities and on the health of the poor. By including these new attainment variables into Kakwani's indices, we generate new classes of achievement and improvement indices. Using data on 11 low- and middle-income Asian countries in the twenty-first century, we highlight that child and maternal health have generally improved in recent decades, due to both an increase in the average health level and a decrease in inequalities.","[Apouey, Benedicte H.] CNRS, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Silber, Jacques] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, Ramat Gan, Israel; [Silber, Jacques] INSTEAD, CEPS, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Paris School of Economics; Bar Ilan University,"Apouey, BH (通讯作者)，CNRS, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",,"Apouey, Bénédicte/S-8030-2019","Apouey, Bénédicte/0000-0003-1575-8423",,,,,36,1,1,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78560-993-0; 978-1-78560-994-7,RES ECON INEQUAL,,,2016,24.0,,,,,,181,214,,10.1108/S1049-258520160000024008,0.0,,,34,Economics; Social Issues,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Issues,BI1QE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406693400007,0

At the same time, long-term consequences and the effects of the recent crisis on foreign banks' behaviour are still controversial. Several studies have explored the relation between the mode of entry (i.e. by acquiring a local bank, or greenfield) and the subsequent behaviour of the new entities on the local banking markets. The present paper intends to enrich these approaches by studying, in a comparative pre- vs. post-crisis view, the evolution of the main foreign-owned bank groups in the region, broken down by mode of entry. Our findings, in line with similar previous researches, allow us to formulate critical interpretations on the importance of the entry mode on various markets in the corporate strategy of large international banking groups.","[Badulescu, Daniel; Morutan, Radu] Univ Oradea, Fac Econ Sci, Doctoral Sch Econ, CP 114,Oficiul Postal 1,Str Univ 1, Oradea, Romania",University of Oradea,"Badulescu, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oradea, Fac Econ Sci, Doctoral Sch Econ, CP 114,Oficiul Postal 1,Str Univ 1, Oradea, Romania.",dbadulescu@uoradea.ro; raalmoru@yahoo.com,"Badulescu, Daniel/O-4877-2017","Badulescu, Daniel/0000-0001-8653-0149",,,,,15,2,2,0,1,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

This tool used for government fiscal policy is a determinant of macroeconomic stability due to the effects on growth, employment and investment variables. In this context, the analysis of domestic debt dynamics has a vital importance especially for developing economies. As a developing economy for Turkey, the deterioration of fiscal balance after 1990's has led to a consistent increase in domestic debt. Aftermath of 2001 crises, domestic debt was restrained by the fiscal discipline which came into prominence by Transition to Strong Economic Program. In this regard, our study examines the structure of domestic debt process in Turkish economy over the period 1998-2015. Firstly, we investigate the linearity of the domestic debt series.

The net increase in the number of hectares comes partly from the conversion of conventional farms, but also in part from the acreage expansion of existing organic farms. So far, empirical research has focused on analysing conversion to organic farming, and lately on reversion to conventional farming. However, changes in individual organic farm sizes have remained ignored by empirical researchers. Additionally, the occurrence and the extent of farm growth are largely dependent on the regional conditions of land market, farm structure and policy measures. Therefore, it remains unclear what other factors besides increasing demand for organic products might influence growth of organic farms. The main objective in this study is to determine whether organic farms are changing their scale of operation and, if so, which factors contribute to - or stagnate - farm growth and to what extent. To answer these questions we analyse growth in a unique panel dataset of 453 farms over the 1993-2005 period using the system generalised method of moments estimator (SGMM). The results reveal that all farms increase area by a maximum of 10 ha and large farms change farm size more frequently than smaller ones. Increases in organic area are influenced by subsidies for organic farming and intensity of livestock production. Farm growth measured in terms of output is affected by farm size, land, capital, soil quality, and intensity of livestock production.","[Brenes-Munoz, Thelma; Lakner, Sebastian; Bruemmer, Bernhard] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Brenes-Muñoz, T (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",thelma.brenes@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Brümmer, Bernhard/C-5067-2009; Lakner, Sebastian/AAF-2585-2019","Brümmer, Bernhard/0000-0001-8052-4346; Lakner, Sebastian/0000-0002-5122-8924",,,,,66,11,11,3,32,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The main factors that determine the operating cycle of the company is its stock supply term, production stage time and debt payment due. These factors determine the amount of net working capital. Net working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from short term liabilities and the management of net working capital is extremely important for the liquidity of a company. Many businesses may have financial difficulty even go bankrupt tragically due to miscalculation net working capital need or incorrect financial resources to finance to the net working capital need. In this study, it is intended to analyse the effects of changes in macroeconomic data over net working capitals of enterprises.

This result is robust even if the licensor firm can engage in R&D investment in the long-run.,"[Chang, Ray-Yun] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hwang, Hong] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hwang, Hong] Acad Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; [Peng, Cheng-Hau] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Econ, New Taipei, Taiwan",Chinese Culture University; National Taiwan University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Fu Jen Catholic University,"Peng, CH (通讯作者)，Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Econ, New Taipei, Taiwan.",chpon@fju.edu.tw,,"Hwang, Hong/0000-0001-5103-8947; Peng, Cheng-Hau/0000-0002-7522-7002",,,,,18,1,1,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

The results of research show that the policy facilitates the cash dividends of the companies which have higher rates of assets and liabilities, non state-owned holding and low profitability, but inhibits the cash dividends of the companies which have lower rates of assets and liabilities, state-owned holding and higher profitability. Overall, after the promulgation of the policy, the company which has the future financing pressure will be forced to raise the level of cash dividends, to meet the demand for refinancing, and the company which does not exist strong refinancing pressure will reduce the level of cash dividends.","[Chen, Yuting; Zhou, Yan] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Science & Technology,"Zhou, Y (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zyyang77@126.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-262-6,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,16.0,,,,,,241,246,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8DJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392234100038,0

The main objective was to identify the state of the financial assets of small scale farmers in the Toba Samosir and Samosir regencies. Another aim of the study was to identify gender issues and related problems if relevant. We selected the Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) as an appropriate set of methods. Semi-structured questionnaires as part of RRA were used for primary data collection as well as observation and in depth interview. Eventually, data were statistically processed by SPSS/20. The applied statistical methods were the descriptive ones, as well as Bivariate Spearman's correlation, Independent and Paired Samples T. Concerning financial capital, respondents in both regencies reported an imbalance in incomes and expenditures. People do not save money and are frequently indebted. Regarding possible gender issues, women have surprisingly quite a big decision making power and responsibility for most of activities.

Our results highlight that the nature of the ultimate controlling owner affects a firm's different forms of visibility and its response in terms of the extent of sustainability reporting.

We confirm the absence of such a monotonic relationship, but document instead a strong discontinuous relationship. Countries whose level of economic integration (trade and finance) was above a certain cutoff saw a much larger drop in growth than less integrated countries, a finding that is robust to a wide variety of controls. The paper argues that standard models based on transmission of exogenous shocks across countries cannot explain these facts. Instead it explains the evidence in the context of a multicountry model with business cycle panics that are endogenously coordinated across countries.","[Hausmann-Guil, Guillermo; Zhang, Gang] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [van Wincoop, Eric] Univ Virginia, Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [van Wincoop, Eric] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Virginia; University of Virginia; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hausmann-Guil, G (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",,,"Hausmann Guil, Guillermo/0000-0003-3488-7714",Bankard Fund for Political Economy; Bank of Spain,Bankard Fund for Political Economy; Bank of Spain,The authors would like to thank two referees and the editor for many useful comments that have helped improve the paper.

The preferences of the local population in the surrounding areas of a landfill are evaluated utilizing a discrete choice experiment in which subjects are presented with alternative policy decisions that involve reducing the material processed through the landfill. Various models were employed in order to capture heterogeneous preferences, resulting in a mixture of normals modelling approach (MN-MNL) outperforming other alternative models of heterogeneity. The results show that the policy of moving the landfill away from the population does not provide the most benefits when compared to a policy of increasing recycling in the household. The economic benefits of the waste management policies are heterogeneous across the population surrounding the landfill and so the distance decay functions. Thus, the economic benefits for most waste management policies can increase or decrease the further away the subject lives from the landfill, depending on the preferences of his/her segment and the type of policy employed.","[Leon, Carmelo J.; Arana, Jorge E.; de Leon, Javier; Gonzalez, Matias M.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Tourism & Sustainable Econ Dev, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Arana, Jorge E.] Univ South Australia UniSA, Inst Choice I4C, Adelaide, SA, Australia",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; University of South Australia,"de León, J (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Tourism & Sustainable Econ Dev, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",jleon@defc.ulpgc.es,"Araña, Jorge E./D-1139-2011; DE LEÓN LEDESMA, JAVIER/AAF-8194-2021; Gonzalez Hernandez, Matias Manuel/L-3532-2017","Araña, Jorge E./0000-0003-0878-9934; DE LEÓN LEDESMA, JAVIER/0000-0002-4648-8924; Gonzalez Hernandez, Matias Manuel/0000-0002-7503-928X",Spanish Government (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad) [ECO2011-30365],Spanish Government (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author(s) received financial support for the research from the Spanish Government (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad) under the research program ECO2011-30365.",,83,14,17,2,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Entrepreneurs may help to mitigate adverse trade shocks through several mechanisms, i.e., more flexible output structure, diversified economic portfolio, and higher knowledge spillovers from trade-induced R&D activities. Our empirical work embeds the analysis of entrepreneurship, measured using self-employment rates, into a framework of international trade and local labor markets. The empirical results show that the marginal impacts of Chinese import penetration on job losses are dampened in localities with higher self-employment rates, which suggests self-employment or entrepreneurial activities can mitigate the adverse impacts of trade penetration from low-income countries.

This objective go hand in hand with Article 8 (1) of the Treaty on the European Union (EU): The Union shall develop a special relationship with neighbouring countries, aiming to establish an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness, founded on the values of the Union and characterized by close and peaceful relations based on cooperation. The assessment of this policy reveals some ambiguities concerning its objectives, mechanisms, and its perception by member countries and neighboring countries as well as its position in the foreign policy of the Union. Indeed, this policy has been implemented immediately after 2004 enlargement to avoid the emergence of new dividing lines with neighboring countries. It supposes the application of the same approach applied to countries applying for membership become then a member of the EU. However, this policy excludes membership option for neighboring countries following the former president of the European Commission M. Romano Prodi's formula everything but institutions. The conditional offer proposed by EU to neighboring countries makes this policy unilateral based on the principle more for more. The EU offer is limited to a financial and technical assistance as well as an association agreement, which presents more challenges than advantages. This approach has been criticized by the EU itself in the consultation document entitled towards a new neighborhood policy. The case of Ukraine is revealing. The implications of the signature of the Association Agreement with the EU on its territorial integrity have further strengthened the EU accession aspirations among pro-European Ukrainian. The complexity of the means, objectives and the design of the ENP exacerbates ambiguity of this policy. Actually, this policy concerns several neighboring countries and managed by bilateral agreements. The way in which this policy has developed and the current challenges and threats faced by the EU and neighbouring countries after more than ten years of its launch lead us to seek if this policy had the means and the necessary implementation measures to achieve its strategic objectives and if this policy still able to achieve this objective particularly since the policy review was launched. The case study methodology focusing on Ukraine with comparisons made with other countries of the neighbor is used to argue findings related to the failure of the EU to anticipate and manage the Ukraine crisis, complexity, and ambiguity that characterizes the ENP.","[Mouhoub, Redouane; Debbihi, Abdelmalek] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Romana Sq,Sect 1, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Mouhoub, R (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Romana Sq,Sect 1, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",mouhoubredouane@hotmail.fr; malek2015@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,54,64,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300004,0

They also have a more hierarchical management approach, and see their role as maintaining the status quo rather than bringing about change. In contrast, CEOs of non-family firms emphasize shareholder-value-maximization.

This is achieved by means of sign restrictions that attempt to identify shocks in past data that match a set of assumed directional responses of other variables to future changes in capital requirements aimed at increasing the resilience of the banking system to losses during an upswing. This may provide policy-makers with a plausible 'upper bound' on the short-term effects of future increases in macroprudential capital requirements in certain states of the UK economic cycle. An increase in the aggregate bank capital requirement during an economic upswing is associated with a reduction in lending, with a larger effect on lending to corporates than on that to households. The impact on GDP growth is statistically insignificant. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We consider the Brazilian air transport industry of the 2000s, in which network concentration rapidly increased and was followed by a period of massive flight delays and cancelations, which resulted in the big blackout of 2006-2007. We develop an econometric model of network concentration, accounting for demand, cost and competition variables that may affect the propensity of carriers to concentrate flights and passenger connections on a few airports of a network. The main focus of the paper is on the relation between networks leading to the problems of the blackout episode. We investigate the dynamic pattern of the evolution of concentration before and after the abnormal period of operations and find that concentration began to rise at least six quarters before, and persisted at a high level until two quarters after the blackout - and then plunged steeply toward the end of the decade. We believe that our analysis contributes to an improved understanding of the behavior of air transport systems subject to network concentration and congestion. With respect to methodology, we suggest and employ the use of alternative measures of network concentration to check the robustness and validity of our results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Results show that the technology change in time was negative as same as the total factor productivity change. There was not a frontier shift due to innovations in the sector.

Heterogeneous effects in terms of different characteristics are also found in this paper.","[Shi, Xinzheng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Shi, XZ (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",shixzh@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71103108],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"I thank Albert Park for his contribution in the early stage of this paper, and I thank two referees for their useful comments.

The analysis is based on transparency reports for years 2011-2014. Auditors that in the reporting period carried out the statutory audit at some public interest entity are required to compile and publish the transparency report. Among other information, auditors are required to specify their total turnover split into turnover of audit fees and turnover of non-audit fees. Globally recognized Herfindahl-Hirschman index is selected as an appropriate analytical tool. Herfindahl-Hirschman index is complemented by indicators of market share (Current ratios) and the Lorenz curve which graphically displays the unequal distribution of the turnover on the market of audit services. These data show that in the period under investigation the firms forming Big4 obtained about 85% of audit fees. In the year 2014 the Big4 firms occupied 80% of total fees and 84% of audit fees. As a major player on the Czech market of audit services can be regarded two firms - Ernst & Young (EY) in the area of total fees and KPMG in the area of audit fees.The analysis clearly indicates a high level of market concentration of audit services in the Czech Republic. The high level of market concentration has its impacts on the audit quality and leads Authorities in the US and in the EU to the tightening of audit regulation.","[Sindelar, Michal; Mullerova, Libuse] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Fak Financi & Ucetnictvi, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Sindelár, M (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Fak Financi & Ucetnictvi, Prague, Czech Republic.",michal.sindelar@vse.cz; libuse.mullerova@vse.cz,"Šindelář, Michal/AHA-5223-2022","Šindelář, Michal/0000-0002-0474-3675",,,,,28,3,3,2,9,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

We focus on the earnings differentials that can be explained by observable characteristics and unobservable time-invariant individual heterogeneity. We first, estimate the standard Mincer earnings equations using ordinary least squares (OLS), controlling for individual, household, and job characteristics. Next we use, panel data and the quantile regression (QR) techniques in order to account for unobserved factors which might affect the earnings and the intrinsic heterogeneity within formal and informal sectors. OLS results confirm the existence of an informal sector penalty almost half of which is explained by observable variables. We find that formal-salaried workers are paid significantly higher than their informal counterparts and of the self-employed confirming the heterogeneity within the informal employment. QR results show that pay differentials are not uniform along the earnings distribution. In contrast to the mainstream literature which views informal self-employment as the upper-tier and wage-employment as the lower-tier, we find that self-employment corresponds to the lower-tier in the Turkish labor market. Finally, fixed effects estimation indicates that unobserved individual characteristics combined with controls for observable characteristics explain the pay differentials between formal and informal employment entirely in the total and the female sample. However, informal sector penalty persists in the male sample.","[Tansel, Aysit] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Tansel, Aysit] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Tansel, Aysit] ERF, Cairo, Egypt; [Acar, Elif Oznur] Cankaya Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Cankaya University,"Tansel, A (通讯作者)，Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.;Tansel, A (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Tansel, A (通讯作者)，ERF, Cairo, Egypt.",,"TANSEL, Aysit/H-8096-2012","TANSEL, Aysit/0000-0001-9556-2396; Acar, Elif Oznur/0000-0002-3104-9013",,,,,36,9,9,1,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78560-993-0; 978-1-78560-994-7,RES ECON INEQUAL,,,2016,24.0,,,,,,121,154,,10.1108/S1049-258520160000024006,0.0,,,34,Economics; Social Issues,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Issues,BI1QE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406693400005,0

Venture capital funds are able to build companies from the simplest form to mature organizations. Venture capital investors generally actively engage with management of the company by typically taking place on the board. Through the due diligence process the venture capital firms concentrate on the founders, the management team, the concept, the marketplace, the revenue model, the value-added potential of the firm, the amount of capital needed to heal the business and whether all these fit to the fund's objectives. Over the next three to eight years, the venture firm works with the founding entrepreneur/s to grow the company. Once a company funded by venture capital matures and becomes successful, venture funds generally exit by taking it public through an initial public offering (IPO) or by selling it to big companies. This allows the venture funds to be free from the previous investment and invest in the next generation of companies. United States, Europe, Israel, Canada, China and India have the most developed markets for venture capital environment. The size of the venture capital market is nowadays about $50 billion and the United States has the most funds for venture capital of $33.1 billion in 2013. Venture capital firms may invest in promising firms in stages of seed, first round, second round or later. The median investment amounts in the United States in 2013 are $0.5 million for seed, $2.5 million for first round, $5.7 million for second round and $10 for later stage. The most attractive sector for venture capital is information technology for the United States, Israel and Canada, invested over $10 billion in 2013, while the most attractive sector is consumer products for Europe, China and India, invested over $4.8 billion in 2013.

Still, SR production can be difficult with lack of a trademark, asset investment, and collective action. Empirical enquiry into this situation remains limited. We address this gap by analyzing determinants and intensity of SR adoption in Vietnam by using a sample of 336 farmers from Red River Delta (RRD) who were interviewed between October and December 2014. We follow the adoption behavior model based on the utility maximization criterion and adopt a two-step approach, starting with a Probit model for determinants of SR adoption before analyzing the intensity of adoption using a Tobit model. The selected independent variables included: households' sociodemographic and economic characteristics. Probit model estimates indicate that for every additional sao (equals to 360 m2) and network size the probability of SR adoption increases by 5% (p-value<0.01). Distance to the nearest market and number of laborers are however significant and negatively effecting the probability of SR adoption. Overall, 50% of the probability of SR adoption is explained by the selected independent variables. Tobit model estimates show that group membership (such as in agricultural cooperatives, farmer's union, women's union, etc.) and possession of a twowheel- tractor increase the share of land allocation to SR production by 3.4% and 7.8% respectively. The model explains 14.8% of the variation of the share of SR planted area and the LR test equals to 44.4 (p-value<0.01) rejecting the null-hypothesis at least one of the predictors' regression coefficients is not equal to zero. Policy adjustments towards improving infrastructure, building social networks, promoting farmer groups, and land reforms would accelerate SR adoption and, thus, the rural economy in Vietnam.","[Thai Thuy Pham] Georg August Univ Goettingen, RTG GlobalFood Transformat Global Agrifood Syst 1, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Heinrich Duker Weg 12, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [The Anh Dao] Field Crops Res Inst, Ctr Agr Syst Res & Dev, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Theuvsen, Ludwig] Georg August Univ Goettingen, Chair Management Agribusiness, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,"Pham, TT (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Goettingen, RTG GlobalFood Transformat Global Agrifood Syst 1, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Heinrich Duker Weg 12, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",pham.thai@agr.uni-goettingen.de; daotheanh@gmail.com; theuvsen@uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-4781,,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,259,267,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000033,0

The objective is to identify the factors that have positive effects on women's life in rural areas by biogas technology. This research also deeply assessed how economic situation of rural households particularly women improved after biogas technology adoption. A sample of totally 254 respondents included 186 biogas users and 68 non-biogas users were randomly chosen from rural areas in Northern and Central Vietnam in summer 2013 by a semi-structured interview method. Quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed. Binary logistic regression was used to identify the determinant variables affecting women life after biogas adoption. Descriptive statistic and correlation test were used to explore economic effectiveness of biogas technology. The findings show that biogas technology improved life of targeted women by two variables save time and economic increasing. With more free time which saved from energy sources collection, livestock management, and energy expenses respondents had more time to contribute other economic activities. Moreover they can benefit from sub-products of the technology such as fertilizer. Their income also improved thank to enlarging number of livestock. Income level of respondents was increased from 25 % to 50 % after biogas technology adoption.

When an economy's population becomes older-that is, when the proportion of individuals 65 years of age and older increases-two effects are at work: a direct effect from the changing age composition of the population and an indirect, equilibrium effect from the change in asset holdings by owner's age. The main result is that wealth inequality in an aging population may decrease or increase depending on the cause of the aging. An increase in life expectancy tends to increase inequality, whereas a reduction in the population growth rate tends to reduce it.","[Vandenbroucke, Guillaume] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Vandenbroucke, G (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,"Vandenbroucke, Guillaume/I-5754-2016","Vandenbroucke, Guillaume/0000-0003-4056-3177",,,,,7,2,2,0,2,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Potential voters' behaviour is based on anticipated regret, where voters will experience regret if they fail to vote or vote for the wrong candidate. Furthermore, such regret is stronger when the margin of victory is smaller. We characterize mixed and pure-strategy equilibria, which can be desirable, where the right candidate is always elected in all states, or undesirable, where the wrong candidate is elected in some state. Our model yields distinctive comparative statics results. First, an increase in the proportion of informed citizens may cause the winning margin for the right candidate to either rise or fall, depending on the type of equilibrium. In addition, such an increase can have a non-monotonic effect on turnout of uninformed citizens. Second, as the prior becomes more favourable towards the ex ante favoured candidate, turnouts of informed and uninformed voters both change in a non-monotonic way. Furthermore, total turnout can be positively or negatively correlated with winning margins. The distinctive implications of our model could be tested using experimental or empirical studies. In addition, given its inclusion of uncertainty, our model can be used to study, in future research, information provision and acquisition as well as other policy questions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In a representative sample of the U.S. population, we measure ambiguity attitudes in the gain and loss domains. We find that ambiguity aversion is common for uncertain events of moderate to high likelihood involving gains, but ambiguity seeking prevails for low likelihoods and for losses. We show that choices made under ambiguity in the gain domain are best explained by the alpha-MaxMin model, with one parameter measuring ambiguity aversion (ambiguity preferences) and a second parameter quantifying the perceived degree of ambiguity (perceptions about ambiguity). The ambiguity aversion parameter a is constant and prior probability sets are asymmetric for low and high likelihood events. The data reject several other models, such as MaxMin and MaxMax, as well as symmetric probability intervals. Ambiguity aversion and the perceived degree of ambiguity are both higher for men and for the college-educated. Ambiguity aversion (but not perceived ambiguity) is also positively related to risk aversion. In the loss domain, we find evidence of reflection, implying that ambiguity aversion for gains tends to reverse into ambiguity seeking for losses. Our model's estimates for preferences and perceptions about ambiguity can be used to analyze the economic and financial implications of such preferences.","[Dimmock, Stephen G.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Nanyang Business Sch, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Kouwenberg, Roy] Mahidol Univ, Coll Management, 69 Vipawadee Rangsit Rd, Bangkok 10140, Thailand; [Kouwenberg, Roy] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Mitchell, Olivia S.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, NBER, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Peijnenburg, Kim] Bocconi Univ, NETSPAR, Milan, Italy; [Peijnenburg, Kim] Bocconi Univ, IGIER, Milan, Italy",Nanyang Technological University; Mahidol University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Pennsylvania; Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Kouwenberg, R (通讯作者)，Mahidol Univ, Coll Management, 69 Vipawadee Rangsit Rd, Bangkok 10140, Thailand.",roy.kou@mahidol.ac.th,"Dimmock, Stephen/AAF-4306-2019; Kouwenberg, Roy/AAT-2635-2020","Dimmock, Stephen/0000-0003-3404-9307; Kouwenberg, Roy/0000-0001-9312-4587; Mitchell, Olivia/0000-0002-6419-8314",Netspar; National Institute on Aging [P30 AG-012836-18]; National Institutes of Health-National Institute of Child Health and Development Population Research Infrastructure Program [R24 HD-044964-9]; Pension Research Council/Boettner Center; Wharton Behavioral Labs at the University of Pennsylvania,Netspar; National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); National Institutes of Health-National Institute of Child Health and Development Population Research Infrastructure Program; Pension Research Council/Boettner Center; Wharton Behavioral Labs at the University of Pennsylvania,"The survey module fielded by the authors in the RAND American Life Panel (ALP) was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania.

Our results hold across various measures of growth rates in housing prices and are robust to controlling for potential biases due to measurement errors in estimating the implied cost of equity capital.

The study clarifies the effects of constituency size and the electoral strength of constituencies on candidates' political stances. The empirical results provide evidence that politicians' preferences for trade policy are sensitive to electoral pressure, but their reactions differ depending on the characteristics of each constituency. The results reveal that for a broad constituency with a large concentration of agricultural workers, election candidates are more likely to support protectionism than their counterparts running in a narrow constituency. For city district election candidates, electoral strength measured by the vote margin significantly affects their trade policy preferences. Candidates in close elections are more likely to be protectionist than candidates elected by a substantial majority, suggesting that electoral pressures deter politicians from supporting trade liberalization.","[Ito, Banri] Senshu Univ, Tama Ku, 2-1-1 Higashimita, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148580, Japan",,"Ito, B (通讯作者)，Senshu Univ, Tama Ku, 2-1-1 Higashimita, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148580, Japan.",ito-banri@isc.senshu-u.ac.jp,,"Ito, Banri/0000-0003-3912-9947",JSPS KAKENHI [25380284]; Senshu University,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Senshu University",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI grant no. 25380284 and a research grant from Senshu University.,,33,12,12,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2015,165.0,3-4,,,,,239,261,,10.1007/s11127-015-0306-3,0.0,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DD6ZV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370074300004,0

J,"Keane, C",,,,"Keane, Claire",,,Irish Public Finances through the Financial Crisis,FISCAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,fiscal policy; Great Recession; public deficit; public debt; redistribution,,"Ireland was one of the countries most negatively affected by the Great Recession. GDP fell by 13 per cent and unemployment rates increased sharply. The recession uncovered fundamental flaws in the Irish economy such as an over-reliance on the construction sector for employment and taxes and a move away from income-based taxes. A collapse in house prices and a sharp reduction in construction activity led to job losses and falls in the tax take. Irish banks had become over-reliant on foreign funds to finance lending and regulation was lax. The bursting of the construction bubble was therefore coupled with a financial crisis resulting in a bailout' of Irish banks by the government. As the gap between revenue and expenditure grew and borrowing increased, a government-backed guarantee of Irish bank deposits eventually led to worries about the solvency of the Irish government and the inability to borrow in international bond markets. This resulted in Ireland entering into a financial assistance programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Union (EU) and the European Central Bank (ECB). The government embarked on a series of austerity measures amounting to one-fifth of GDP between 2008 and 2015, with roughly one-third of the response being increased taxes and two-thirds expenditure reductions. Taxes have increased, a residential property tax was introduced and social welfare rates have been reduced for those of working age. The redistributive effects of these changes cannot be viewed as either regressive or progressive, with the top decile experiencing the sharpest cut to disposable income, followed by the bottom decile. Recovery has been strong in recent years, however, with GDP forecast to return to its 2007 peak level in 2015. The unemployment rate has fallen to just under 10 per cent from its 2011 peak of 15 per cent but still remains well above its pre-crisis level of 4 per cent.","[Keane, Claire] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Econ & Social Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90071 USA",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Keane, C (通讯作者)，Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Econ & Social Res Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90071 USA.",claire.keane@oecd.org,,"keane, Claire/0000-0002-7087-6206",,,,,16,8,8,0,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Under strong political constraints, state ownership reduced the managerial pay levels and increased pay-for-performance sensitivity (to asset-based benchmarks). Board independence and compensation committees do not curb managerial pay, and market-based factors do not have a significant influence.

While the penalty generates herding behavior, correlated trading among managers is exacerbated when a strategic setting is considered. The equilibrium portfolios are driven by the least restricted manager, who may vary according to the realization of returns. I compare model predictions to evidence from the Colombian pension fund management industry, where six asset managers are in charge of portfolio allocation for the mandatory contributions of the working population. These managers are subject to a peer-based underperformance penalty, which is known as the minimum return guarantee (MRG). I study trading behavior by managers before and after a change in the strictness of the MRG in June 2007. The evidence suggests that a tighter MRG results in more trading in the direction of peers, a behavior that is more pronounced for underperforming managers. I show that these findings are consistent with the qualitative and quantitative predictions of the theoretical model.","[Pedraza, Alvaro] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20005 USA",The World Bank,"Pedraza, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",apedrazamorales@worldbank.org,,,,,,,30,8,8,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

We find that third-party monitoring does not affect distributional outcomes in a three-person ultimatum game. Our results show that a large majority of individuals is willing to pay for a right to monitor decision-making processes despite pecuniary incentives to the contrary. We observe that third-parties are over-confident in believing that an opportunity to scrutinize decision-making processes changes distributional outcomes for their own benefit.

In 2005, CVG processed over 22.7 million passengers. By 2013, CVG provided fewer than 180 daily departures to 77 destinations and processed fewer than 6 million passengers per year. The purpose of this paper is to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of CVG's dehubbing process. We highlight the operational, market and geographic factors that contributed to CVG's decline and use basic exploratory data analysis to provide perspective and deepen our understanding of this process. Results suggest that a combination of commercial carrier strategies, operational efficiencies, hub structures, network topologies and regional competition contributed to the deterioration of CVG.

The estimators explicitly allow for time-varying prices of risk, time-varying betas, and serially dependent pricing factors. Our approach nests the Fama-MacBeth two-pass estimator as a special case. We provide asymptotic multistage standard errors necessary to conduct inference for asset pricing tests. We illustrate our new estimators in an application to the joint pricing of stocks and bonds. The application features strongly time-varying, highly significant prices of risk that are found to be quantitatively more important than time-varying betas in reducing pricing errors.

In order to overcome this difficulty, we propose a model that allows time-varying Granger causality between these prices. The model is used to investigate the time-varying causal linkages between the daily spot and futures prices for maturities of one, two, three and four months of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil benchmark over the period January 2, 1986-July 31, 2013. The results indicate that the causal links between these oil prices are strongly time-varying. Both variables have a predictive power for each other during various subperiods, but not in all periods. Further, these periods coincide with major influential changes in the oil and stock markets and the geopolitics, implying that the findings are not statistical artifacts, but reflect real economic, financial and geopolitical regime changes. The full sample's conditional Granger causality tests based on the Markov-switching vector-error correction (MS-VEC) model reject both the causal impact of the lagged futures prices on the spot prices and the causal impact from the lagged spot prices on the futures prices. Therefore, the results show that the lead-lag relationship between the spot and futures oil markets exists only temporarily. While encompassing the previous findings, they also offer new insights into the nature of the lead-lag relationships between the spot and futures oil markets by taking non-linearity and time-variation into account.

It uses information on the offshoring potential of jobs from representative task data and merges it with linked employer-employee data, for which information on different modes of offshoring behaviour is available. It empirically identifies individual and plant-level determinants of offshoring activity and additionally analyses how offshoring potential influences the realisation of offshoring by German plants. Depending on the measure for actual offshoring, it mostly finds a negative link: firms are less likely to outsource or offshore parts of their production processes if their outsourcing and offshoring potential is high. This indicates that existing measures of offshoring potential can indeed be interpreted as not-yet realised offshoring, or offshoring that cannot be realised, e.g. due to trade barriers.","Inst Appl Econ Res, Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Brändle, T (通讯作者)，Inst Appl Econ Res, Tubingen, Germany.",tobias.braendle@iaw.edu,,,German Research Foundation (DFG) [BO 2793/3-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This paper is part of the research project 'Trade in tasks - potential for internationalization and their effects on the wage structure and composition of employment', funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) (BO 2793/3-1).

I exploit variation across Mexican regions in import exposure stemming from initial differences in industry specialization in order to estimate the effect Chinese competition had on local Mexican labor markets. Also, by taking advantage of the Mexican exports' high dependence on the U.S. market, I estimate the effect that China-caused trade diversion had on Mexican labor markets. I find that the increase in competition decreased the employment share in manufacturing for the average Mexican local labor market. This effect was found to be larger for regions with high exposure to Chinese competition in the U.S. market, showing that there was a significant, negative indirect effect from China's trade growth. I also find that workers' mobility across local labor markets increased due to this negative shock. Wages remained largely unaffected. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We found that the dependence structure differed across precious metals, all of which displayed different average and tail dependence features. Gold and silver prices were highly dependent except at the upper tail, whereas silver prices were integrated with those for platinum and palladium except at the upper tail. The gold market was very little integrated with the platinum and palladium markets. We document asymmetric downside and upside price spillover effects that differed in magnitude across precious metals; silver, in particular, had a greater downside and upside price impact on gold. Our results, indicating that precious metals do not behave as a single asset class, have implications for risk management, trading and hedging strategies for portfolios that include precious metals.

We present the reader with both an historical overview and a review of conceptual and practical developments in this field. It is important to emphasize the influence of the early studies since later financial assessment models were built on the earlier paradigms. The basic thrust of this effort is to encourage the greater employment by managers of quantitative models that allow decision makers to generate all the factors needed to estimate real financial gains and/or losses before any intervention strategy is implemented in the workplace. As indicated, the use of these quantitative models to estimate the net financial gains of using particular intervention strategies or the value of certain types of worker behaviors, can ultimately save companies from making gross tactical errors and, more positively, can assist management in promoting the organization's long-term economic goals with all the incumbent rewards.","[Tziner, Aharon] Netanya Acad Coll, Netanya, Israel; [Birati, Assa] Bar Ilan Univ, IL-52100 Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Tziner, A (通讯作者)，Netanya Acad Coll, Netanya, Israel.",atziner@netanya.ac.il,,,,,,,29,4,6,0,18,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2015,17.0,,,,9,,1259,1272,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365318300011,0

Survey data are from a choice experiment used to value the conservation of threatened native species in New Zealand's production forests. In line with recent literature, we argue that attribute non-attendance can be taken as one of the important measures of behavioural efficiency. We focus on how this varies when alternative design criteria are used. Attribute non-attendance is inferred using an approach based on constrained latent classes. Given our proposed criterion to evaluate behavioural efficiency, our data indicate that the Bayesian D-efficiency criterion provides behaviourally more efficient choice tasks compared to the other two criteria.","[Yao, Richard T.] Scion NZ Forest Res Inst Ltd, Econ Ecosyst & Climate Team, Rotorua, New Zealand; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Queens Univ, Gibson Inst, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Rose, John M.] Univ S Australia, Inst Choice, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Turner, James A.] AgResearch, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Waikato; Queens University Belfast; University of South Australia; AgResearch - New Zealand,"Yao, RT (通讯作者)，Scion NZ Forest Res Inst Ltd, Econ Ecosyst & Climate Team, Private Bag 3020, Rotorua, New Zealand.",richard.yao@scionresearch.com; ric.scarpa@gmail.com; John.Rose@unisa.edu.au; james.turner@agresearch.co.nz,"Turner, James Alan/AAU-9221-2020; Rose, John/AAO-2897-2021; Scarpa, Riccardo/AAF-8435-2019","Turner, James Alan/0000-0003-4396-3280; Scarpa, Riccardo/0000-0001-6449-5389; Yao, Richard/0000-0002-9408-1862; Rose, John/0000-0003-4211-0980",,,,,75,24,24,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Most of the industries in Euro countries show a dependence increase with the Euro-area after the introduction of the Euro. The effects are strongest in countries with larger market capitalization and in the Financials, Industrials, Consumer Goods, Utilities, Technology and Telecommunications industries. Overall, the export intensity, interest rate sensitivity and competitiveness of an industry and the financial development and economic openness of a country are the most important determinants of changes in equity market dependence. The period around the Lehman collapse also shows higher equity market dependence between European countries, while the lower dependence increase during the period of the recent European sovereign debt crisis suggests that country-specific factors may matter more than before.

Therefore, the effect of subsidies on both R&D input and R&D output is compared between independent high-tech young firms (NTBFs), independent low-tech young firms (LTBFs) and their non-independent counterparts. A treatment effects analysis reveals that full crowding-out with regard to public funding is rejected for all firm types. However, the treatment effect is highest for independent high-tech firms. The indirect effect of subsidies on R&D output is evaluated within a patent production framework. These results show that independent high-tech firms have no lower output effects than other firms and thus suggest that the current policy focus on certain firm types is not ineffective.","[Czarnitzki, Dirk; Delanote, Julie] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Czarnitzki, Dirk; Delanote, Julie] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr R&D Monitoring ECOOM, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; [Czarnitzki, Dirk] ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",KU Leuven; KU Leuven; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Czarnitzki, D (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",dirk.czarnitzki@kuleuven.be; julie.delanote@kuleuven.be,"Czarnitzki, Dirk/AAV-4124-2021",,,,,,74,60,62,2,85,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Using a dynamic factor model, we decompose the price-rent ratios of 23 major housing markets into a national factor and independent local factors, and we link these factors to the economic fundamentals of the housing markets. We find that a large fraction of housing market volatility is local and that the national factor has become more important than local factors in driving housing market volatility since 1999, consistent with the findings in Del Negro and Otrok (2007). The local volatilities mostly are due to time variations of idiosyncratic housing market risk premia, not local growth. At the aggregate level, the growth and interest rate factors jointly account for less than half of the total variation in the price-rent ratio. The rest is due to the aggregate housing market risk premium and a pricing error. We find evidence that the pricing error is related to money illusion, especially at the onset of the recent housing market bubble. The rapid rise in housing prices prior to the 2008 financial crisis was accompanied by both a large increase in the pricing error and a large decrease in the housing market risk premium.","[Fairchild, Joseph] Bank Amer, Charlotte, NC 28202 USA; [Ma, Jun] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Wu, Shu] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",Bank of America Corporation; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Kansas,"Fairchild, J (通讯作者)，Bank Amer, Charlotte, NC 28202 USA.",joseph.fairchild@bankofamerica.com; jma@cba.ua.edu; shuwu@ku.edu,,,,,,,31,25,24,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The major findings can be summarized as follows. First, the built environments of subway PCAs in Seoul were found to be compatible with TOD principles in terms of density and diversity. They have declining density gradients of population and employment that extend outward from a station and have a high level of mixed-use land. Second, population and employment densities, land use mix diversity, and intermodal connectivity all have a positive impact on subway ridership, but differ in their spatial ranges. In particular, the influence spans of residential and commercial development patterns (population density and the proportion of commercial land) and mixed land use on ridership were limited to only the core and primary PCAs. Consequently, with respect to TOD in a compact city like Seoul, we recommend that a PCA be defined to encompass a radius of 600 m. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While sunk costs act as a barrier to entry into R&D for some firms, fixed costs are the binding obstacle for many more firms. Simulation based on the estimated model reveals that one-shot trigger subsidies cause a substantial increase in both the share of R&D firms and average R&D expenditures. This effect shows persistence over time, but totally fades away after seven years as firms are gradually hit by negative R&D profitability shocks.","[Arque-Castells, Pere] Northwestern Univ, Searle Ctr Law Regulat & Econ Growth, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Arque-Castells, Pere] UB, Fac Econ & Empresa, Inst Econ Barcelona, Barcelona 08304, Spain; [Mohnen, Pierre] Maastricht Univ, UNU MERIT, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Northwestern University; University of Barcelona; Maastricht University,"Arqué-Castells, P (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Searle Ctr Law Regulat & Econ Growth, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",pere.arque@uab.cat; mohnen@merit.unu.edu,"Arqué-Castells, Pere/L-2513-2014; Mohnen, Pierre/ACL-4047-2022","Mohnen, Pierre/0000-0002-2289-7379",Instituto de Estudios Fiscales; Generalitat de Catalunya [SGR-2009-102]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2010-16934],Instituto de Estudios Fiscales; Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),"We are grateful to the Editor, three anonymous referees, Jose Garcia-Quevedo, Emmanuel Duguet, Elena Huergo, Georg Licht, Jarle Moen, Juan Sanchis-Llopis, Alejandro Esteller-More and Mo Xiao for their helpful comments.

Our flexible approach allows for the potential interdependence between the holding of assets and liabilities at the household level and also encompasses a two-part process to allow for differences in the influences on asset or liability holding and on the respective amounts held. Furthermore, the framework is dynamic in order to allow for persistence in household finances over time. Our findings endorse the joint modelling approach and provide evidence supporting the importance of dynamics. In addition, we find that certain independent variables exert different influences on the binary and continuous.parts of the model thereby highlighting the flexibility of our framework and revealing a detailed picture of the nature of household finances.

In a monocentric city where road (bridge) capacity is financed by budget-balancing user fees, decentralized capacity choices (made by individual zones within the city) generate the social optimum despite the presence of spillovers. Optimality also requires the correct population distribution across the city's zones, conditional on bridge capacities. This outcome is achieved because the user fees function as optimal congestion tolls, a result that follows from the famous self-financing theorem of transportation economics.","Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Brueckner, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",jkbrueck@uci.edu,,,,,,,19,9,9,2,12,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

The relative value of annuities across demographic groups converges considerably under finer-grained pricing, but the change in consumers' well-being is asymmetric.

To this end, we focus on accountability within dictatorships using a model where both the selectorate and the citizens are the principals and the autocrat is the agent.

This paper addresses this problem by specifying an empirical model to disentangle the two structural effects. The analysis uses a data set that includes the banking sector and 28 manufacturing industries across 30 Chinese provinces over the period 1999-2007. In order to identify the channel through which banking structure affects industrial growth, two interactive variables are constructed to capture the interaction of the prevailing banking structure with labor intensity and the share of non-state-owned enterprises in each industry, respectively. The regression results are robust and make the case for the ongoing banking reforms to reduce state ownership and promote small banking institutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Introducing a new dataset of legal texts constituting the fiscal rules, allows a joint empirical analysis of different types and designs of numerical fiscal rules. In various empirical exercises the change in the difference between the exact variable constrained by the fiscal rule and its numerical limit is analysed. Statistics show that countries comply with their fiscal rules only in about 50% of the years. Nevertheless, various econometric exercises demonstrate that the introduction of fiscal rules does significantly change the behaviour of fiscal policy. If countries do not comply with their fiscal rule in the year or forecast before, there is a strong downward tendency of the constrained variable towards the numerical limit. The results show that fiscal rules act as kind of a benchmark for policy makers and the public, and even though they might be complied with only in half of the years, they still tilt fiscal policy towards the numerical limit in times of non-compliance.

GLD holds physical gold, and provides traders with a convenient and cost-effective way to gain exposure to gold. We find that after the introduction of GLD, the liquidity of gold company stocks declined, and their adverse-selection risk increased. Over the two-month period after GLD's introduction, the stocks' relative effective bid-ask spreads increased by over 15%, while their adverse-selection cost, as measured by the price impact of trades, went up by more than 30%. Gold stocks also experienced significant negative abnormal returns (-12% on average) in the month after GLD started trading. Our findings suggest that GLD attracted traders, especially uninformed traders, away from gold company stocks, and that the resulting negative demand shocks and decrease in the stocks' liquidity caused their prices to decline. Our results show that existing securities can be seriously adversely affected when a new security enters the market. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We offer an analytical explanation to show that it may be a direct outcome of asymmetric information between immigrants and potential employers in the rich countries. Limiting occupational choices to self-employment and employment, we show that skilled immigrants vis-a-vis natives may be proportionally over-represented in small businesses. This compensates for the income loss in the labor market. It results from higher critical risk aversion among skilled immigrants compared with natives and subsequently leads to higher average income for all immigrants in the cross-section. Finally, we show why a lesser number of unskilled immigrants enter self-employment and discuss the speed of income convergence between all immigrants and natives.","[Beladi, Hamid] Univ Texas San Antonio, Coll Business, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Kar, Saibal] Ctr Studies Social Sci, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Kar, Saibal] IZA, Inst Study Lab, Bonn, Germany",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Kar, S (通讯作者)，Ctr Studies Social Sci, Kolkata, W Bengal, India.",hamid.beladi@utsa.edu,"Kar, Saibal/AAC-8174-2019","Kar, Saibal/0000-0001-8134-1517",,,,,59,9,11,1,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The conducted empirical survey examines the relationship between marketing strategy and sustainability from the perspective of enterprises in Slovakia. The authors have used binary logistic regression as an evaluation method. The empirical findings are based on 896 responses from different forms of companies in Slovak Republic. The results show that the legal form of a business organization is a relevant determinant of philosophy of sustainability when organization defines a marketing strategy and implements it into corporate strategy. Based on the results it can also be concluded that the environmental aspect of sustainability is determined by the size of organization and the sector of national economy where a company operates, while the social aspect is mainly determined by the share of foreign capital in the ownership structure of an organisation. This study contributes to the European research that studies the relation between sustainability and the marketing strategy by means of an empirical investigation in business organisations in a transition economy such as Slovakia.","[Cheben, Juraj] Metropolitan Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic; [Lancaric, Drahoslav; Savov, Radovan; Toth, Marian] Slovak Univ Agr, Nitra, Slovakia; [Tluchor, Jan] Westbohemian Univ Pilsen, Plzen, Czech Republic",Metropolitan University Prague; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Cheben, J (通讯作者)，Metropolitan Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",j_cheben@yahoo.com,"Toth, Marian/H-4857-2016; Tluchor, Jan/AAL-1967-2020; Lancaric, Drahoslav/AAD-8710-2019; Cheben, Juraj/O-2699-2014; Tóth, Marián/AAD-8706-2019","Tluchor, Jan/0000-0003-0779-1792; Cheben, Juraj/0000-0002-2624-8659; Savov, Radovan/0000-0002-4882-0978; Lancaric, Drahoslav/0000-0002-1262-6698",,,,,69,14,14,1,31,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2015,17.0,40,,,,,855,871,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365317700002,0

To address this question, we decompose aggregate uncertainty into 'good' and 'bad' volatility components, associated with positive and negative innovations to macroeconomic growth. We document that in line with our theoretical framework, these two uncertainties have opposite impact on aggregate growth and asset prices. Good uncertainty predicts an increase in future economic activity, such as consumption, output, and investment, and is positively related to valuation ratios, while bad uncertainty forecasts a decline in economic growth and depresses asset prices. Further, the market price of risk and equity beta of good uncertainty are positive, while negative for bad uncertainty.

In a model with a convex investment and portfolio balance adjustment cost, and endogenous credit-in-advance constraint, we find that investment is determined solely by opportunity cost of physical capital unrelated to portfolio capital inflows when the constraint is slack. However, once credit availability is tightened up by capital outflows, the negative liquidity constraint dominates the opportunity-cost factor, causing an economic downturn. Financial fragility against capital outflows is an outcome of pecuniary externalities, which, however, can be moderated by prudential capital controls. Even when exchange rates float freely, capital controls ease the macro-stabilizing burden of monetary policy, as they help shield the economy from financial instability. Prudential tax on foreign debt is most preferred, and works the best when the exchange rate float is managed.","[Wong, Chin-Yoong; Eng, Yoke-Kee] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Fac Business & Finance, Kampar 31900, Perak, Malaysia; [Wong, Chin-Yoong] Stockholm Sch Econ, SCERI, Stockholm, Sweden",Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR); Stockholm School of Economics,"Eng, YK (通讯作者)，Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Fac Business & Finance, Jalan Univ, Kampar 31900, Perak, Malaysia.",wongcy@utar.edu.my,"Wong, Chin-Yoong/Q-6952-2017","Wong, Chin-Yoong/0000-0002-5524-5270","Lars-Erik Thunholms Stiftelse For Vetenskaplig Forskning; Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) from the Ministry of Education, Malaysia [FRGS/2/2013/SS07/UTAR/02/1]","Lars-Erik Thunholms Stiftelse For Vetenskaplig Forskning; Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) from the Ministry of Education, Malaysia","Wong: Faculty of Business and Finance, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Universiti, Bandar Barat, 31900 Kampar, Perak, Malaysia.

In assessing this interest rate risk, we use probabilities of alternative interest rate scenarios that are obtained from a dynamic term structure model that respects the zero lower bound on yields.

We use the principal component analysis and the hybrid meta-frontier DEA model, separating inputs into radial inputs that change proportionally and non-radial inputs that change non-proportionally to measure the technical efficiency and technology gap ratios of publicly listed Chinese firms in different manufacturing industries during 2010-2013. The input variables are the net value of fixed assets, staff number, and the characteristics of the corporate governance system, while the output variables are gross revenue and total profit. The empirical result shows that inefficiency due to corporate governance is the main reason for lower efficiency in most manufacturing firms. For the technology gap ratio (TGR), the metal and mineral and the machinery, equipment and instrument are the two highest efficient sectors, whereas the paper and allied products sub-industry has the lowest efficiency during 2010-2013. In addition, the ratio of state-owned firms whose inefficiency is mainly caused by corporate governance to total state-owned firms is greater than that of non-state-owned firms in each year. The TGR analysis shows that the efficiency performance of non-state-owned firms is greater than state-owned firms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

While many studies have considered this question, commonly employed methodologies fail to address the unique statistical challenge of modeling modes with small mode shares. Additionally, personal characteristics that are not adequately accounted for may lead to overestimation of built environment impacts. This study addresses these two key issues by using an ordered probit Heckman selection model to jointly estimate participation in and frequency of commuting by bicycle, controlling for demographics, residential preferences, and travel attitudes. The findings suggest a strong influence of attitudinal factors, with modest contributions of bicycle accessibility. Bicycle lanes act as magnets to attract bicyclists to a neighborhood, rather than being the catalyst that encourages non-bikers to shift modes. The results have implications for planners and policymakers attempting to increase bicycling mode share via the strategic infrastructure development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous researchers have only mentioned their subjective judgments in related papers and well-accepted change point detection methods are not available. So the objective of this paper is to propose a multiple change point detection approach from the perspective of risk dependence by using copula function. Since the inter-dependence of different types of risks during crisis and non-crisis periods is significantly different, we monitor the change of dependence structure over time. The first step is to choose a proper copula that can accurately describe the dependence structure of the data. Thereafter, using the chosen copula to fit the data dynamically, a series of parameters are attained. Finally, the change points are identified by analyzing the trend of the fitted parameters. Based on the financial data of the top 100 American banks in Forbes' list, we empirically detect the start point, end point and peak period of the subprime crisis in American banking. The results show that the crisis started in 2007Q4 and ended in 2011Q3, and the peak period of the crisis was from 2009Q3 to 2010Q2. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

First, the study decomposes the total change in emissions for each period to obtain the contribution of change in emissions per unit output emissions coefficient), change in technology (technology effect), and change in final demand. The study observed from the first-stage decomposition that emissions coefficient and final demand drive the change in the first period (1995-2000) while the technology effect drives the change in the second period (2000-2005). The high contribution of the technology effect is driven by activities of iron and steel; coke, refined petroleum and gas; road transportation; and electricity sectors. Having observed the trend of the technology effect across the two periods, the study carried out a second-stage decomposition on technology effect in the second period to examine the contribution of each sector and observed that chemical and pharmaceuticals; iron and steel; road transportation; and construction sectors are mainly responsible. In conclusion, improvement in technical efficiency especially at the industrial process level of each industry will help Japan achieve greater level of emissions reduction.","[Akpan, Uduak S.; Green, Ovunda A.; Isihak, Salisu] Sustainabil Policy & Innovat Dev Res SPIDER Solut, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria; [Bhattacharyya, Subhes] De Montfort Univ, Inst Energy & Sustainable Dev, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England",De Montfort University,"Akpan, US (通讯作者)，Sustainabil Policy & Innovat Dev Res SPIDER Solut, 15 Etim Umana St, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.",uduaksakpan@gmail.com; oagreen@yahoo.co.uk; subhesb@dmu.ac.uk; risalisu@gmail.com,"Akpan, Uduak S./AAE-8761-2020; Isihak, Salisu/N-9370-2019; Bhattacharyya, Subhes C/O-5293-2016","Isihak, Salisu/0000-0001-7741-4189; Bhattacharyya, Subhes C/0000-0002-1196-496X",,,,,57,33,36,2,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

When these externalities are not internalized by a bank's shareholders and executives, borrowing and fire sales are higher than the socially optimal level. Our analysis shows that plain-vanilla equity fails to internalize fire sales externalities. Deferred equity and long-term bonuses unrelated to short-term profits can restore social efficiency. Bail-in bonds can achieve efficiency at a smaller cost since they allow for state-contingent payments.

It shows that, in some circumstances, elite control can be a way of ensuring the provision of pubic goods and that conflict between elites can benefit project outcomes.

We show that pre-announcement abnormal option volumes in acquiring firms strongly increase ahead of a stock merger (by approximately 300%). Furthermore, we show that the direction of option trades (puts or calls) prior to an announcement can predict post-announcement stock returns. Our results also indicate that higher wealth-to-performance sensitivities of top executives are related to higher abnormal put than call option trading before stock merger announcements. Overall, our results support the view that top executives have a hedging motive. They tend to purchase protection against, e.g., confounding (negative) information policies and/or empire-building mergers with negative NPVs, in order to avoid short-term salary losses (lower bonuses, lower stock options, etc.).

The central notion is that the influence of generalized trust on policy attitudes is conditional on confidence in both state actors and major companies. The starting point is the idea that individuals who generally distrust other persons have a stronger taste for the regulation of economic activities, while people with high interpersonal trust are in favor of less stringent regulatory control. Yet, people who do not trust unknown others also tend to mistrust government and private companies. If mistrust in state actors dominates, we should not necessarily expect stronger interventionist preferences. Estimating the determinants of interventionist attitudes using data from the World Values Survey/European Values Study for approximately 130,000 individuals in forty OECD- and EU-countries, we find evidence that the impact of social trust on government intervention attitudes is conditional on institutional trust. Confidence in major companies appears to have a stronger effect on preference formation than trust in state actors.","[Pitlik, Hans] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Kouba, Ludek] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Pitlik, H (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",hans.pitlik@wifo.ac.at; kouba@mendelu.cz,"Kouba, Ludek/E-9951-2013","Kouba, Ludek/0000-0001-6171-8428; Pitlik, Hans/0000-0001-8124-1110",European Commission [290647],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 under Grant agreement no. 290647.

Building on the formal tools and theories developed by social network analysis, we examine the network organisation of 136 large traders in two border regions between Niger, Nigeria and Benin. In a business environment where transaction costs are extremely high, we find that decentralised networks are well adapted to the various uncertainties induced by long-distance trade. We also find that long-distance trade relies both on the trust and cooperation shared among local traders, and on the distant ties developed with foreign partners from a different origin, religion or culture. Studying the spatial structure of trade networks, we find that in those markets where trade is recent and where most of the traders are not native of the region, national borders are likely to exert a greater influence than in those regions where trade has pre-colonial roots. Combining formal network analysis and ethnographic studies, we argue, can make a significant contribution to the current revival of interest in cross-border trade in the policy field.","[Walther, Olivier J.] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Border Reg Studies, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Walther, OJ (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Border Reg Studies, Alsion 2, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark.",ow@sam.sdu.dk,"Walther, Olivier/IUN-5660-2023; Walther, Olivier/AAE-9131-2020","Walther, Olivier/0000-0002-5768-2845",National Research Fund of Luxembourg (CROSSTRADE Project) [C10/LM/783313]; National Research Fund of Luxembourg (WANETS Project) [MOBILITY/12/4753257],National Research Fund of Luxembourg (CROSSTRADE Project); National Research Fund of Luxembourg (WANETS Project),"This research was supported by the National Research Fund of Luxembourg (CROSSTRADE Project C10/LM/783313 and WANETS Project MOBILITY/12/4753257).

We estimate a panel autoregressive model with generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) errors and regime-specific effects on both the conditional mean and conditional variance. For the G7, we find that, relative to the fixed ER regime, only the freely floating regime shows higher RERD volatility; under the managed floating regime the RERD is equally volatile and under the crawling peg it is actually less volatile. Instead, in the case of the LA17, more flexible ER regimes are associated with more volatile RERD rates, with higher volatility under the managed floating regime than under the crawling peg and with extremely high volatility under the freely falling ER regime.","[Cermeno, Rodolfo] CIDE, Div Econ, Mexico City 01210, DF, Mexico; [Sanin, Maria Eugenia] Univ Evry Essonne, EPEE, Paris, France; [Sanin, Maria Eugenia] Ecole Polytech, Paris, France",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

More than 15 years' experience with this financial instrument in the United States has led to the conclusion that these bonds are characterized by low liquidity issues. Recently, various papers have started to analyze the impact of liquidity on ILB yields. This paper develops a new strategy for estimating the liquidity premium based on Campbell and Shiller's (1996) hypothetical ILB yields. We find significant effects of ILB-specific liquidity measures for the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. Based on these findings, we derive the liquidity premium in ILB yields, liquidity-adjusted estimates for the break-even inflation rate and the inflation risk premium. In the United States, for instance, the average of the liquidity premium is 0.56%-points, and the average liquidity-adjusted break-even inflation rate and inflation risk premium amount to 2.67%-points and 0.22%-points, respectively.

The five-factor model's main problem is its failure to capture the low average returns on small stocks whose returns behave like those of firms that invest a lot despite low profitability. The model's performance is not sensitive to the way its factors are defined. With the addition of profitability and investment factors, the value factor of the FF three-factor model becomes redundant for describing average returns in the sample we examine.

We show that even small and less productive firms, if involved in production chains, can take advantage of reduced costs of entry and economies of scale that enhance their probability of exporting. The empirical analysis is carried out on an original database, obtained by merging and matching balance-sheet data with data from a survey on over 25,000 Italian firms, which include direct information on the involvement in supply chains. We find a positive and significant relation between being part of a supply chain and the probability of exporting, as well as the intensive margin of trade. The number of foreign markets served (the extensive margin), on the other hand, does not seem to be affected. We also investigate whether being in different positions along the chain, i.e., upstream or downstream, matters, and we find that downstream producers tend to benefit more. Our results are robust to different specifications, estimation methods, and the inclusion of the control variables typically used in heterogeneous firms models.","[Giovannetti, Giorgia; Marvasi, Enrico] Univ Florence, Dept Econ, I-50127 Florence, Italy; [Giovannetti, Giorgia] European Univ Inst, Global Governance Programme, I-50014 Fiesole, Italy; [Sanfilippo, Marco] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Florence; European University Institute; University of Antwerp,"Marvasi, E (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dept Econ, Via Pandette 32, I-50127 Florence, Italy.",emarvasi@gmail.com,"Marvasi, Enrico/AAJ-5521-2020; Marvasi, Enrico/GSM-8939-2022; Marvasi, Enrico/P-6733-2019","Marvasi, Enrico/0000-0003-2411-8030;",Regione Sardegna for the project CIREM Analysis of competitiveness of Sardinia's production system,Regione Sardegna for the project CIREM Analysis of competitiveness of Sardinia's production system,"We would like to thank two anonymous referees, Tadashi Ito and the participants to the Royal Economics Society Conference (Manchester, April 7-9, 2014); the Italian Trade Study Group Conference (November 2013); the 15th European Trade Study Group Conference (September 2013); the 10th c.Met05 Workshop (July 2013) and seminars at University of Florence, and IDE-JETRO for their comments on previous drafts of the paper.

Hence, accurately modeling the joint statistical distribution over time of defined benefit pension underfunding and sponsor terminations is critical for estimating PBGC's prospective cash flows and evaluating its financial position. It appears that the current Pension Insurance Modeling System (PIMS) approach to modeling risk does a reasonable job of capturing its statistical properties effects on PBGC cash flows, although some of the aspects might be improved, and metrics expanded. The present paper outlines, how an option-based approach to modeling the joint distribution of defaults and underfunding in PIMS might be implemented, while preserving the strengths of the current model. Moving to an option-based approach would allow PIMS to be used to estimate the fair values of future liabilities. Such an approach could have a significant effect on the perceived financial position of PBGC.","MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Lucas, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, 100 Main St,E62-640, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",dlucas@mit.edu,,,U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) as part of the Retirement Research Consortium (RRC); Pension Research Council at The Wharton School,U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) as part of the Retirement Research Consortium (RRC); Pension Research Council at The Wharton School,"The research reported herein was pursuant to a grant from the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) funded as part of the Retirement Research Consortium (RRC); the author also acknowledges support from The Pension Research Council at The Wharton School.

The results demonstrate that the impact of stock market liquidity on growth is positive and significant only in jurisdictions where there is high level of property rights protection. Similar effect is discerned in the case of strong minority shareholders protection. Using the market size as a measure of stock market development, the paper also documents a positive growth effect of market size when property rights and minority shareholders protection are strong. However, there is mixed evidence in the low to medium degrees of protection. Further analyses using other broader governance indicators as threshold variables and instrumental variable threshold regressions reaffirm the main findings. The study upholds the better finance, more growth proposition and contributes to the identification of thresholds above which institutional quality can positively shape the impact of stock market on economic growth.

This paper investigates the evolution of regional inequality in the global shipping network by analyzing the changing positions of world regions during the period from 2001 to 2012. This was a period of both prosperity and recession in maritime shipping. Using data on inter-regional flow connections, the positions of seventeen regions in the global shipping network are analyzed in terms of their traffic development, centrality, dominance and vulnerability. The East Asian, Northwest European and Europe Mediterranean regions have consistently held the highest positions, while East African and North African regions have held the lowest positions. By commanding the largest flows in the network, East Asia assumes a dominant position. The Australasian, North American West Coast, Northwest European and Southern African regions show an increasing dependency on East Asia. The analysis also identifies a few emerging regions that have had the highest growth rates in total traffic volume and connectivity for the studied period, namely South American North Coast, South American East Coast, West Africa, Southern Africa and West Asia. The empirical results of this paper supplement existing research on global shipping network evolution. One implication of the analysis is that the traffic growth of East Asia does not imply that, there is an equivalent improvement in its position in the global shipping network. The paper also shows that indicators from network analysis may be used to provide a more nuanced understanding of port-regional development than existing measures based solely on total traffic volume.

We focus on the business regulatory environment as an arena for autocratic rent-creation, as a source of information asymmetry between the autocrat and the disenfranchised, and as a potential political grievance for the disenfranchised. Within this context, we revisit the role of macro shocks as a catalyst for political instability and propose a novel informational channel through which macro shocks may trigger costly political action when the autocrat chooses to create rents through regulation that deteriorates the mean macroeconomic outcome. We then provide an empirical investigation of our theoretical hypotheses employing fixed-effects panel regressions and an instrumental variable strategy over a sample of non-democratic countries. Consistent with our theoretical hypotheses, we demonstrate that adverse economic shocks increase the probability of mass protest episodes, but that the magnitude of the effect depends on the extent to which business regulation is market-distorting.","[Dorsch, Michael T.] Cent European Univ, Sch Publ Policy, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Maarek, Paul] Univ Cergy Pontoise, Dept Econ, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France",Central European University; CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Dorsch, MT (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Nador U 9, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary.",dorschm@ceu.edu,"maarek, paul/HGH-4161-2022","maarek, paul/0000-0001-6593-4179",,,,,46,11,11,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2015,162.0,3-4,,,,,381,404,,10.1007/s11127-015-0239-x,0.0,,,24,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CD3RE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350997000012,0

We model a cheap-talk game in which a CRA assigns positive weights to the divergent goals of issuing firms and investors. The CRA wishes to inflate ratings but prefers an unbiased rating to one whose inflation exceeds a threshold. Ratings coarseness arises in equilibrium to preclude excessive rating inflation.

The data come from the Life in Transition-2 survey, conducted in 2010 in 30 post-socialist economies of Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia. We find that households hit by crisis are more likely to bribe and, among people who bribe, crisis victims bribe a wider range of public officials than non-victims. The crisis victims are also more likely to pay bribes because public officials ask them to do so and less likely because of gratitude. The link between crisis and bribery is stronger in the poorest countries of the region.

To guard against data snooping, researchers have suggested use of Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to account for the uncertainty about prediction models. In common with other researchers, I find evidence of predictability during time periods when a hypothetical investor uses BMA with no restrictions on what variables may be included in the model. However, when the hypothetical investor is limited to using only variables whose predictive ability would have been known at the time of the forecast, predictability disappears. Moreover, predictability also disappears when data are updated through 2010, even without constraints on variable use. The results cast doubt on whether stock returns were ever predictable in real time and also suggest that returns may no longer be predictable even if real-time constraints are removed.","Weber State Univ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Weber State University,"Turner, JA (通讯作者)，Weber State Univ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA.",jamesturner@weber.edu,,,,,,,39,4,4,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Search-matching frictions affect permanent income, and increase future employment uncertainty, heightening workers' incentives to save and generating a greater response of consumption and the current account. The greater consumption response feeds into larger fluctuations in workers' willingness to work, while interest rate shocks lead to variations in firms' willingness to hire; both of these outcomes contribute to highly variable wages.","[Boz, Emine] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Durdu, C.

The main finding of this paper is that, in liquid times, some money market funds (MMF) enhanced their returns by investing in riskier assets. By doing so they outperformed other MMFs, as long as liquidity in the market was high. Investing in riskier money market products, however, widens the typically narrow structure of MMFs and makes them vulnerable to withdrawals. When market liquidity declined during the subprime crisis, illiquid MMFs experienced withdrawals, while funds with safer and liquid portfolios functioned as a safe haven. As German MMFs calculate the value of their shares based on fluctuating net asset value, the findings inform the current debate on regulating MMFs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

But these are not some undivided entities. Beyond the place in the global division of labour, they are fiefs of in-built specialization among the corporate governance stakeholders, each of them representing individual-based aggregations of pure catallactic functions. With an atomized, anonymous, asymmetrical and amalgamated ownership in a globalized capital market, with the multi-level directorship, delegated to harmonize profit-orientated investment interests, with creditors, but also with other suppliers of factors of production, modern corporations seem to have overshadowed both the real entrepreneurs-actors as well as the pure corresponding function. Our article is a (praxeo)logical exercise to pinpoint and reveal the realistic field of definition of the entrepreneurship function within the modern corporate spectrum, delimiting and portraying the entrepreneurial aspect out of the real characters that inhabit the corporate entourage (precisely said, of shareholders, managers, creditors). It seems that the modern literature on the law and economics of the firm has lost sight of the entrepreneur(ship), whose presence is felt but rarely positively identified. The endeavour to locate and isolate this, along with the associated incentives and logic of action is a task with some analytical merits. A thorough discrimination of the entrepreneurs' position inside the corporate field and, respectively, of the natural vs. allowed decision spheres can generate sounder judgments about the well-structured and poorly-structured companies (good vs. poor corporate governance) or about institutions found to be business (un)friendly (good vs. poor corporate law-making). We define good governance at the level of the corporate form the situation when incentives are aligned with rights and obligations, and the good law the norm which does not alter the common sense of property rights and freedom of contracting. Without knowing them, any legal organization of the corporate form will be fraught with problems.","[Jora, Octavian-Dragomir; Topan, Mihai-Vladimir; Musetescu, Radu Cristian; Apavaloaei, Matei-Alexandru] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Jora, OD (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",octavian.jora@yahoo.com,"Topan, Mihai Vladimir/AAY-9149-2020; JORA, Octavian-Dragomir/AAS-6677-2021; Musetescu, Radu Cristian/B-6311-2015; Musetescu, Radu Cristian/A-3948-2016","Topan, Mihai Vladimir/0000-0002-1011-8737; Musetescu, Radu Cristian/0000-0003-1964-9048; JORA, Octavian-Dragomir/0000-0001-7111-3078","project Routes of academic excellence in doctoral and post-doctoral research - REACH; European Social Fund, by Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/137926]","project Routes of academic excellence in doctoral and post-doctoral research - REACH; European Social Fund, by Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development","This work was financially supported through the project Routes of academic excellence in doctoral and post-doctoral research - REACH co-financed through the European Social Fund, by Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, contract no POSDRU/159/1.5/S/137926.",,48,1,1,0,30,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2015,17.0,38,,,,,456,473,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352213800029,0

Using a mixed-method approach of qualitative analysis and regression modeling, we find that infrastructure was associated with a 66% increase in education among females. Service provision increased literacy by 62%, enhanced income by 36%, and reduced health costs by 26%. Evidence suggests that a gender-sensitive consideration of infrastructure is necessary and that a 'one-size-fits-all' approach will not suffice.

For this purpose, the study constructed well-being index for 17 major states of India for the period 1981-2011 based on five broad dimensions. Our results showed that the economic well-being of states has declined since the reforms. The interstate disparities have increased and the states (except Punjab and West Bengal) which performed well prior to the reforms continued to perform well in the post-reform years too. In addition, our regression results for the high well-being and low well-being states revealed that the reforms have benefited more developed high well-being states, rather than low well-being states. While human capital was found significantly and positively related to per capita incomes in both groups of the states, financial development was positively related in high well-being states, but a negative association was visible in the low well-being states.","[Arora, Rashmi Umesh] Univ Bradford, Bradford Ctr Int Dev, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England; [Ratnasiri, Shyama] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Gold Coast, Australia",University of Bradford; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus,"Arora, RU (通讯作者)，Univ Bradford, Bradford Ctr Int Dev, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England.",r.arora6@bradford.ac.uk,"Ratnasiri, Shyama/AAP-9863-2021","Ratnasiri, Shyama/0000-0002-9295-4076",,,,,68,2,4,3,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Our approach involves modeling the expected outcome from investing in a portfolio of active managers, for investors who believe they have ability to select good managers and may anticipate benefits from replacing managers when alpha expectations fall. Numerical calibrations using inputs consistent with the literature find that certain investors can credibly invest through active managers at observed fee levels, most notably institutions. However, participation in active management at fees paid by some retail investors can only be explained by allowing for behavioral biases. Our analysis suggests that the wide use of active management reflects a diversity of investors who form expectations based on information other than expected alpha for the average manager, some of which entails cognitive error.","[Foster, F.

The aim is also to monitor the discipline of entities in meeting legal obligations. The dependence between existing obligations to measure the growing volume of forest stand and also to disclose its value in accordance with Czech legal regulations and the need to do so is statistically evaluated. At the same time, the need of more suitable methodology for forest stand valuation is determined bearing the existing legal obligations in mind. The extent of fulfilling obligations arising from legal regulations by forest owners is investigated by quantitative research. Data for statistical investigation were provided by 264 respondents, including legal and natural persons, municipal and state forests, etc. The results are compared with similar studies by Czech and foreign authors. Problematic parts of the current legal status of providing information about the value of growing forest are highlighted and possibilities and consequences of potential changes are discussed. The paper results from the need of higher awareness of professionals and general public of the financial and proprietorial situation of subjects - owners of forests - in the Czech Republic; their economic viability is derived from it. The fact that forest land in the Czech Republic was 2.66 million hectares in 2012 and its proportion of the total area of the country is 34% adds importance to the topic.","[Cermankova, Helena; Navratilova, Miroslava; Starova, Marta] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Finances, Kamycka 129, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Cermánková, H (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Finances, Kamycka 129, Prague, Czech Republic.",cermakovah@pef.czu.cz; navratilovam@pef.czu.cz; starovam@pef.czu.cz,"Stárová, Marta/H-3653-2018; Navratilova, Miroslava/H-3769-2018","Navratilova, Miroslava/0000-0002-8528-1109",,,,,22,0,0,0,0,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,132,141,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000015,0

Using this discontinuity, we find that additions to the Russell 2000 result in price increases and deletions result in price declines.

Investors should understand investment conditions and comply with them so as to avoid risks as much as possible because risks are inevitable and you would never be prudent enough to enter into capitalist market. It is well known that China is a socialist country. Since implementing reform and opening-up policy, our country has gradually established a socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics. When it comes to the discussion of Chinese economy, features of Chinese system should never be neglected. Central Committee of the Communist Party of China will make detailed plans for the development of Chinese economy. Exampled by the Twelfth Five-Year Plan for national economy and social development, Central Committee of the Communist Party of China puts forward the following twelve suggestions: 1.Accelerate to change economic development mode, create a new situation of scientific development 2.Adhere to the strategy of expanding domestic demand, maintain a stable and relatively fast economic development 3.Boostagricultural modernization, accelerate to construct new socialist countryside. 4.Develop modern industrial system, increase core industrial competitiveness. 5.Promote coordinated development of regions, actively and stably carry out urbanization. 6.Accelerate to construct resource-saving and environment-friendly society, improve the level of ecological civilization. 7.Deepen the enforcement of the strategy of rejuvenating China through science and education, the strategy of reinvigorating China through human resource, accelerate to construct an innovation-originated nation. 8. Strengthen social construction, establishing a perfect basic public service system. 9. Promote the development of culture, improve cultural soft strength. 10. Accelerate the speed of reform, perfect socialist market economy system. 11. Implement open strategies with mutual benefit and win-win result, further increase the level of opening up 12. People of all nationalities throughout the country should be united to fight for the realization of Twelfth Five-Year Plan Viewing from these short twelve suggestions, we can see that economic onstruction is the core task of our country. Through consulting the outline of Twelfth Five-Year Plan for the national economy and social development of People's Republic of China, it can be found out that the headline of Chapter 48 is Deepening Reform of Financial System. The concrete content: Comprehensively promote financial reform, opening up and development. Construct a financial system with multiple organizations, efficient service, prudent supervision and controllable risks. Function of financial market will be strengthened constantly so as to provide a better service for accelerating the change of economic development mode. As the core of national economy, financial market provides basic conditions for economic development that capital accumulation can be promoted and then converted to investment. Financial activities can save the cost of social exchange which is beneficial to the development of social exchange. It is because finance has such a powerful ability that our country needs to strengthen the reform of financial system.",,,,Guoermi@126.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-62520-68-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2015,8.0,,,,,,586,589,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD7OC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363373700116,0

Most of these challenges were witnessed by the previously owned state companies which had to reform in order to survive. This process was a very long and difficult one, since most of the previously state-owned companies had difficulties in adapting to the private environment. Thus the number of these companies which are still active on the Romanian Stock Exchange and which constitute interest for the private investors was reduced significantly. Under these circumstances the goal of the current paper was to analyze the financial health of 10 most significant HORECA companies registered on the Bucharest Stock Exchange(BVB) especially when considering the evolution of their liquidity and solvency indicators. The study considered for analysis the financial data presented in their balance sheets and profit and loss accounts which were reported on the Bucharest Stock Exchange website: www.bvb.ro or published in their annual reports.

Social reformers promote the idea that a high score of open budget index is the main incentive to influence policymakers to adopt policies to reliably optimize public finances. Based on data from the literature we developed a multiple regression model in panel (during 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012) and we have examined the links between corruption control (CC), which is the level at which public power is exercised over private gain, and got a very strong causal relationship, which budgetary transparency, as measured by Open Budget Index, and economic performance, as measured by the GDP per capita. Over 50 % of the variation of the dependent variable, the (CC) is explained by the independent variables, budgetary transparency (OBI) and GDP per capita. The independent variables OBI and GDP per capita have a positive and significant effect on the level of corruption control in all countries. The central argument of the empirical study shows that high budget transparency scores determine both reducing of corruption and also improves government policies as well as providing vital information to the public.

We also fail to proof the additional hypothesis that the exception to superneutrality validity is a group of countries with smaller in-sample inflation mean.","[Deev, Oleg] Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic; [Hodula, Martin] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Technical University of Ostrava,"Deev, O (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",oleg@mail.muni.cz; martin.hodula@vsb.cz,"Deev, Oleg/G-8486-2013",,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,79,86,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200011,0

This approach also provides a framework to examine policy related issues. According to the SCP hypothesis, there is a positive correlation between bank profits and market concentration due to the greater possibility of collusion. From a social viewpoint, bank concentration creates an environment that can reduce social welfare. This is an issue that has important public policy implications. If the market structure in a given country is found to be highly concentrated (thus increasing the likelihood of collusion), public policy should focus on measures of increasing competition, such as discouraging mergers and acquisitions. On the other hand, if bank concentration is positively correlated with the stability of the banking system, policies should be directed at facilitating mergers or consolidations.","[Dobre, Claudia; Popovici, Veronica; Munteanu, Irena] Ovidius Univ Constanta, Fac Econ, Constanta, Romania",Ovidius University,"Dobre, C (通讯作者)，Ovidius Univ Constanta, Fac Econ, Aleea Univ 1, Constanta, Romania.",dobre_claudia@yahoo.com; verovnp@yahoo.com; irena.munteanu@yahoo.com,"claudia, dobre/IAO-0454-2023",,,,,,29,0,0,0,7,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,97,108,,,,,,12,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300011,0

After discussing the basics of statistical volatility modelling and the basis of artificial neural networks we perform the experiment on real financial data. We quantify several ARCH and GARCH models; we also implement various RBF neural network prediction models. The comparative analysis of out-of-sample forecasts evaluated using MSE evaluation measures is performed.

The evolution of public finance theory went through many recurrences of the basic questions. During a 150 year period between the end of the 18th century and the First World War no less than four schools of thought on public finance have emerged-the English, the French, the Italian and the German. These four schools presented different views on the three main issues of public finance: who is the state in relation with the individuals; which is the reason for paying taxes; what can a state do when it does not have enough resources.

The efficiency score is expressed for each subject analyzed and used to compare the transformation of multiple inputs into multiple outputs. Two-stage models allow comparing the efficiency of subprocesses, into which the whole process is divided. By adding the sequence of steps consisting of the application of various statistical methods, two-stage models allow to assess the efficiency of the subprocesses and thereby to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the analyzed subjects, respectively of individual subgroups of subjects. The aim of this paper was to compare the efficiency of Slovak and Czech insurance companies using the two-stage models. At the same time, efficiency score values from the classical DEA model and the two-stage model are compared. Methods of analysis, synthesis, comparison and mathematical-statistical methods are used in this paper. A part of the analysis is the traditional DEA model and the two-stage model.

Empirical results show that there are conflicting conclusions with different methods for measuring corporate investment efficiency.","[Guo Wenli; Wang Jian] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Zhao Fuyang] Dalian Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dalian 116028, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology; Dalian Jiaotong University,"Guo, WL (通讯作者)，Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.",,"Wang, Jianxin/V-2800-2018",,,,,,12,0,0,0,8,DALIAN UNIV TECHNOL PRESS,DALIAN,"2 LINGGONG RD, DALIAN 116024, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89437-146-1,,,,2015,,,,,,,71,75,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000364787100013,0

The Eurozone technically has unlimited financial resources at its disposal to solve its recent financial problems, but the potential threats are rather of a political origin. The most important challenges are the distinct expectations that the strongest European economies harbored before the foundation of the Eurozone. The French sought to gain more autonomy in the conduct of their domestic economic policy, which had been impeded by external constraints, particularly exacerbated by German monetary policy. The German goal was to prevent permanent upward pressure on their currency, which had been undermining their export-led economic model. These distinct expectations did partly influence the institutional arrangement of the Economic and Monetary Union. However, the essence of the Franco-German conflict has not been adequately addressed and we hold that the Eurozone in its current setting is not able to fully resolve it. That being said, the ECB can employ means that could allow it to postpone the solution for a very long time.","[Hodulak, Vladan; Krpec, Oldrich] Masaryk Univ, Dept Int Relat & European Studies, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Hodulák, V (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Int Relat & European Studies, Jostova 10, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",hodulakv@gmail.com; okrpec@gmail.com,"Hodulak, Vladan/W-5422-2019; Krpec, Oldrich/C-6670-2013","Hodulak, Vladan/0000-0002-6988-0048; Krpec, Oldrich/0000-0003-4892-7086",,,,,13,0,0,0,1,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,214,224,,,,,,11,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300023,0

However, the limitedness of the historic data of Chinese mortality, manifesting as data missing, lack of samples and high data fluctuation, will have serious effects on the robustness and validity of pricing results along the path from mortality projection, risk-adjusted survival probability distribution towards pricing results. So, against the background of Chinese limited population data, this article will devote itself to longevity risk pricing within bayes MCMC method framework including several innovative approaches, hoping to ensure the success of longevity derivatives development in China. Specific contents and methods are as follows:(1) as to low sample size and the estimation error from the traditional box-jenkins method while predicting future mortalities, this article will use bayes MCMC method and WinBUGS software programming to get parameter estimation and mortality projection under an unified framework; (2) in view of the adverse influence of limited data on probability distribution giving by such traditional methods as Wang transform and risk-neutral measure change, this article will, under the bayes framework, generate N paths of survival probability by MCMC sampling, and then use the minimum cross-entropy optimization to change the empirical probability distribution into risk-neutral probability distribution, with the aim of reducing the adverse influence from limited data; (3) A comparison between traditional method and Bayesian method will be made to study the improvement. The results show that the unified Bayesian framework will improve the accuracy of mortality projection and reduce the adverse impacts of low quality data on the pricing results.

This makes it challenging for a university to develop an ecosystem of knowledge creation. The full benefit from a university can only be obtained if the university and society are organically linked together. The needs of society have to be at the centre of a university's activities, and flexible adjustment to changing needs is necessary but often lacking. Campus management has a major role in the facilitation of multidisciplinary interaction between students, scientists, entrepreneurs and other industry partners that inspire each other with different perspectives on the same subject. One significant tool to support open innovation with diverse stakeholders is to provide supportive spaces with relevant services. This paper aims to identify the requirements of a Co-creation Centre as a concept serving the third role of a university. The literature review was conducted and, based on the result, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for capturing the key requirements for developing a multiuser Co-creation Centre. The framework consists of the requirements on the demand and supply sides of campus management. The main findings in this paper are that different modes of knowledge conversion have different capabilities to support knowledge co-creation requirements. Knowledge co-creation process requirements in the multiuser Co-creation Centre for university-industry collaboration are best supported by originating Ba, which means the place where individuals share feelings, emotions, experiences, and mental models and the place where the knowledge-creation process begins. The results contribute to the concept development in campus management and provide a starting point for evaluating the success of multidisciplinary and multi-actor innovation environments.

This model allows one to capture the short- and long-run nonlinearities while taking into account the potential of extreme movements and excluding the noise components of the underlying data. We find evidence of significant and asymmetric pass-through of exchange rates to oil prices in both the short and long run. In particular, the long-run negative changes in exchange rates (dollar depreciation) exert a greater impact on oil prices than do the long-run positive changes (dollar appreciation), even though the sign of the effect is commonly negative in most cases. Our results finally suggest that denoising the crude oil and exchange rate data is effective and necessary before their interactions can be analyzed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates this phenomenon by exploring the channels through which macroeconomic shocks are transmitted across borders. Macroeconomic shocks affect current and expected future short-term rates as central banks react to changing economic environments. Investors could also respond to these shocks by altering their required compensation for risk. Macroeconomic shocks thus influence bond yields both through a policy channel and through a risk compensation channel. Using data from the US, the UK, and Germany, we find that world inflation and US yield level together explain over two-thirds of the covariance of yields at all maturities. Further, these effects operate largely through the risk compensation channel for long-term bonds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The research has been conducted using the methods of empirical (regression) analysis, theoretical explanations, descriptive analysis, and Granger causality test. The six states under consideration had very diverse economic and reform pasts despite all having emerged from the post-soviet period. However the programme approach indicated is rather unified, that seems not rational and can explain the slow movement of reforms in the region and not rapid and un-effective changes towards the EU standards.

The essential objective of these regulations is to prevent the risk-taking subjects of the insurance market from getting insolvent, i.e. being unable to meet their financial obligations towards the risk-ceding subjects. In order to mitigate the insolvency prospect, a precise risk analysis is to be performed. Actuarial modelling quantifies the future financial performance of a risk-taker. Related to Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA), an integral part of Solvency II, this paper focuses on a particular actuarial segment catastrophic risk in crop insurance. Such a risk is proposed to be hedged via the financial market.

Careful design of monetary and fiscal institutions so as to make the central bank and the government agree on the ideal levels of output and inflation leads to better outcomes.

Using surname matching definition, we created a sample of 890 Czech large and medium-sized family businesses. Then we used the matched-pair investigation to determine the major gaps in profitability, labor productivity, liquidity and leverage between family and nonfamily firms. The results suggest that Czech family businesses are more profitable in terms of return on assets, profit margin and absolute values of earnings. Czech family businesses also have higher labor productivity and capital intensity, however, the asset turnover appears to be lower. Another important finding is that the overall level of debt is lower in the case of family companies which is accompanied by a higher level of liquidity and working capital.","[Machek, Ondrej; Hnilica, Jiri] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Machek, O (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, W Churchilla 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",ondrej.machek@vse.cz; jiri.hnilica@vse.cz,"Hnilica, Jiri/J-8098-2015; Machek, Ondrej/L-4203-2018","Hnilica, Jiri/0000-0002-3429-1593; Machek, Ondrej/0000-0003-3955-7853",,,,,43,15,15,3,20,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

In the second part environmental taxes to GDP on the figure in 1995 and 2012 are compared. In the third part cluster analyses in 1995 and in 2012 are compared. Data shows a very different development of the cluster. E.g. Estonia has higher environmental taxes to GDP by about 1.8 % in 2012 than in 1995. Because of this growth, the clusters have to be different in 2012 than in 1995. By contrast, Portugal has a different development.

The major parts of dust which has polluted Iran's atmosphere, mainly comes from Iraq. This dust phenomenon has also had a lot of economic and social damages for these two countries. The main aim of this study is to analyse the advantages of cooperation between Iran and Iraq against this phenomenon. The significant damage of this phenomenon has been estimated on health and hygiene, transportation and agriculture sections. The expenditure in contrast with this problem has also been calculated in the crucial zone of creation dust. According to the estimation of this study, total damages of dust for Iran and Iraq are 1043.5 and 1404 million dollars, respectively. While the cost of solving this problem is about 2425.7 million dollars. By applying cooperative games theory, the cooperation between Iran and Iraq to combat dust phenomenon has been analysed. Net benefits of these two countries has been calculated in two cooperation games and their characteristic functions has been derived. Then by using Shapley solution, outcome benefits have been distributed between these two countries. The results suggest that the net benefits of two countries will increase if they associate with each other. In the meantime, based on the results of coalition, a fairly allocation has also been used for costs which has been utilized against dust phenomenon between Iran and Iraq. So these two countries should spend 1442.6 and 1082.1 million dollars to conquer this phenomenon, respectively. The managers of Iranian environmental protection organization should have more effective cooperation with Iraq to resolve dust problem by using diplomatic means and provide parts of its cost by side payments.","[Meibodi, Ali Emami; Abdoli, Ghahreman; Taklif, Atefeh; Morshedi, Behnam] Allameh Tabatabai Univ Tehran, Fac Econ, Dept Energy Econ, Tehran, Iran",,"Meibodi, AE (通讯作者)，Allameh Tabatabai Univ Tehran, Fac Econ, Dept Energy Econ, Tehran, Iran.",emami@atu.ac.ir; abdoli@ut.ac.ir; a.taklif@atu.ac.ir; benimorshedi@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,16,19,1,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-5671,,,PROC ECON FINANC,,,2015,24.0,,,,,,409,418,,10.1016/S2212-5671(15)00697-8,0.0,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF4KC,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000381113800051,0

Due to its many specifies, such aslow market capitalization, poor liquidity and turnover, missing data and so on, stock classification in case of frontier capital markets can be challenging. One of the criteria for stock classification is liquidity which can be defined as ability to buy or sell significant quantities of a stock quickly, anonymously, and with minimal or no impact on price. Therefore, this paper is designed to explain basic discriminatory variables between highly liquid and liquid stocks traded on the frontier capital market of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a representative of highly liquid stocks we will use constituents of the Bosnian traded index (BATX) which is made up of the most actively traded and highest capitalized stocks at the Sarajevo and Banja Luka Stock Exchange. As a representative of the liquid stocks constituents of two indices, SASX-30 and BIRS will be used. Based on the fundamental and market variables, stock classification will be done by using discriminant analysis. These variables will be measured by liquidity, profitability, activity and debt ratios, P/E ratio and EPS. Expected results will provide valuable information in decision making of individual and institutional investors.","[Okicic, Jasmina; Unkic, Nahid] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg; [Unkic, Nahid] Gradmont Doo, Donje Ledenice, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Okicic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",jasmina.okicic@untz.ba; nahidunkic@live.com,"Okicic, Jasmina/AAG-9595-2020","Okicic, Jasmina/0000-0002-3440-413X",,,,,25,0,0,0,1,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,715,727,,,,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700045,0

Fear of liftoff-the reluctance to start the process of policy normalization after the end of a recession-serves as an example. Drawing on public choice and cognitive psychology perspectives, the author discusses causes of this problem: The Federal Reserve could adopt a framework that relies on a simple policy rule subject to periodic reviews and adaptation. Replacing meeting-by-meeting discretion with a simple policy rule would eschew discretion in favor of systematic policy. Periodic review of the rule would allow the Federal Reserve the flexibility to account for and occasionally adapt to the evolving understanding of the economy.

The paper analyzes the long-term development tendencies and it is assessing the current situation of agriculture in CR. Analyzed are the land resources structure, the crop areas of farm plants, and crop yields of these, the livestock numbers and livestock production. It is based on the historical development of Czech agriculture's efficiency and it mentions changes in farm products consumption, too. The solution connects to accessible data sources (Czech Statistical Office, Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping and Cadastre, CR Ministry of Agriculture). Therefore, the time series are not explicitly limited. Data are analyzed and modeled by means of the time series analysis methods. The farm crop areas have been diminishing permanently. The crop species diversity has been changing. The crop yields have been increasing following the more intensive application of spraying, crop improvement and modernization of the machinery and technology. Also the allocation of crops into more suitable soil and climate conditions for the given type of culture has contributed to higher yields. From the long-term viewpoint, significant changes are appearing in the structure and use of the plants grown. Growing of cereals (rye and barley, mostly) is giving way to the technical plants areas. The long-term decrease of livestock numbers in the CR is reflected negatively in the production of fattened cattle heads. In spite of the cattle slaughter performance increasing we are not self-sufficient in livestock production. Based on long-term time series, stability in the domestic livestock production can be really expected. As it concerns the future prospect, the considerable improvement of investments into agriculture using multi-resource financing offers positive expectations.","[Prasilova, Marie; Prochazkova, Radka] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Deparment Stat, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Prásilová, M (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Deparment Stat, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521, Czech Republic.",prasilova@pef.czu.cz; prochazkova@pef.czu.cz,"Prasilova, Marie/H-7428-2018","Prasilova, Marie/0000-0003-2922-2291",,,,,8,1,1,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,347,353,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600039,0

In other words the logistics-company and the SME will act in collusion with a specified probability, and the bank will also choose to supervise with another specified probability.

Since fee income represents the largest part of non-interest income earned by banks, it remains a major challenge for bank management to set and maintain an appropriate fee policy. However, solving for the optimal fee structure has not yet been accomplished either on a theoretical level, or in actual practice. In the empirical part of the paper, we analyse banking fee income in EU banking sectors based on three different indicators: the magnitude of net fee and commission income relative to total operating income, to total assets and to gross domestic product. Our results show that the Czech banking sector was not abnormally dependent on fee income compared to other EU countries in the period 2007-2012. As a result, we argue that the high profitability of Czech banks cannot be attributed to abnormal banking fees and commission income, but rather that other factors should be considered. We also concluded that the market concentration of the Czech banking sector declined since the Herfindahl index decreased in last years.

It is used the Eurostat's definition to categorize tax burden by economic functions and implicit tax rates of consumption, labour and capital are investigated. Empirical analysis is based on annual panel data of 22 EU Member States in years 1995-2012 (time span is divided into a pre-crisis and a post-crisis period). Explanatory variables are examined using Generalized Method of Moments. For a model specification, Dynamic Panel Data Model Wizard is applied. Results confirm positive and statistically significant impact of consumption taxes and weaker but negative effect of labour taxation on economic growth. In a post-crisis period, findings report increase of labour taxes as the strongest and the only significant variable affecting economic growth. It suggests that harmful effect of labour taxation is enlarging in a time of unfavorable economic conditions. A tax shift on capital taxation has negative but often statistically insignificant impact on economic growth.","[Szarowska, Irena] Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Szarowská, I (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",szarowska@opf.slu.cz,"Szarowská, Irena/J-6391-2012","Szarowská, Irena/0000-0002-5197-6455",,,,,25,0,0,0,0,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,862,871,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000094,0

Establishing and nurturing entrepreneurial behaviour and practices so that they become part of an organisation's culture and ethos can provide the opportunity to initiate renewal and create innovation. One of the major factors repeatedly suggested to affect innovation is also leadership. The leaders of organizations help define and shape work contexts that contribute to organizational innovation, can create and manage an organizational culture that promotes innovation.

In spite of its considerable importance the concept does not have a single objective indicator facilitating its quantification and a unique assessment. From the viewpoint of economics the level of living is defined by consumption of goods and services and it is measurable by means of macro-economic indicators. When conceived by sociology, it is the quality of life as assessed by indicators of non-material nature whose quantification is very difficult. Hence, a need arises here to set up indicators combining elements both of material and non-material nature that compose the level of living. The paper analyzes the development of selected level of living indicators as related to households of the Capital of Czech Republic and further it compares levels of special index numbers within EU. Distribution of wealth of the society is assessed using the Gini index number and the level of living is valued by means of the HDI (Human Development Index). The HDI is subdivided into the partial index numbers of health, education and income and the partial index numbers next give rise to the resulting HDI using gross domestic product. The region of the Czech Republic Capital presents very good results from the viewpoint of development tendencies and levels of the indicators assessed. Data sources have been obtained from the data banks of Czech Statistical Office, Eurostat and World Bank and have been processed using statistical methods from time series and index analysis area.

The front-line teachers of higher vocational education found that skills competition has many effects on professional course teaching during the guidance of competitors. In this paper, it gives a detailed introduction to the effect of skills competition on freshmen's first class, selection of vocational teaching contents, teachers' capability for professional course, teaching methods, course arrangement and teaching quality inspection; and thus the reform direction for professional course teaching is concluded. In recent years, national skills competitions among higher vocational colleges have been held frequently, and higher vocational institutes themselves also often hold such kind of competitions; however, is this phenomenon good or bad? Does the skills competition have any effect on reform of professional courses during vocational education? After investigation, students who participated in skills competitions have a sound and deep understanding of what they've learned. At the same time, professional teachers can obtain much knowledge beyond the books during guiding students in skills competition, which can promote teachers' practical ability. That is to say, professional knowledge is the theoretical guidance for students' participation in skills competition, while participation in skills competition can promote students' practical skills in turn. By participating in skills competition, students' mastery of basic knowledge and practical skills can be tested, teachers' quality of teaching can be tested, and meanwhile curriculum construction and teaching quality in the college can be tested as well. The author of this paper guided vocational students' participation in Blue Bridge Cup National Professional Software Talents Design and Innovation Competition for C programming language[1], during which the author has found that skills competition can make some difference for professional course teaching.

Our model uncovers that offshoring occurs and endogenously evolves in a bell-shaped pattern when trade costs decline, explaining some stylized facts in developed countries. Furthermore, this simple framework can be applied to examine the welfare issue. We find that a fall in offshoring costs benefits the high-wage country but hurts the low-wage country. On the other hand, the low-wage country benefits with trade liberalization. The impact of falling trade costs on the welfare of the high-wage country depends on the values of offshoring freeness.

United States economic earnings of tourism industry is about $110 billion annually, and ten times more that in the European Union, even with the financial economic downturn from the last five years, making tourism a key factor solution to cross over the economic crises. In this paper we are discussing the correlation between tourism and creating sustainable development through eliminating business complexities, and ways to measure tourism development. The study takes three emergent markets from the EU and compares them to Romania as a case with its medium of 10 million annual visitors. Results reveal that the majority of developed economies consider tourism a fundamental industry for their economic growth because it depends on other productive sectors making the infrastructure of a zone and cycling its economic wheel. The elimination of business complexity at both macro- and microeconomic level can help developing markets to reach a higher level of efficiency and eventually increase quality.

We build a network model of optimizing banks featuring contagion on both sides of balance sheets: runs on short term liabilities and'banks' liquidity hoarding induce liquidity freezes; fire sale externalities and interconnected debt defaults produce asset risk. We use the model, which is calibrated to European data via simulated method of moments, to study the effects of phase-in increases of liquidity coverage ratios. Interestingly we find that the systemic risk profile of the system is not improved and might even deteriorate. Based on those insights we propose an alternative approach: differential (across banks) application of coverage ratios based on a systemic importance ranking help to mitigate the externalities and deliver a much more stable system.

(2) What have been the macroeconomic indicators of UK banking instability? and (3) What have been the consequences of UK banking instability for the cost of credit? Using a unique dataset of bank share prices from 1830 to 2010 to assess the stability of the UK banking system, we find that banking instability has grown more severe since the 1970s. We also find that interest rates, inflation, lending growth, and equity prices are consistent macroeconomic indicators of UK banking instability over the long run. Furthermore, utilising a unique dataset of corporate-bond yields for the period 1860 to 2010, we find that there is a significant long-run relationship between banking instability and the credit-risk premium faced by businesses.

In our model, a monopolistic seller offers different price-quality bundles of theproduct. A consumer's preference is private information. With demarketing, consumers must make a costly effort to purchase and/or utilize the product, whereas with marketing, the seller instead makes the effort so that the consumer's purchasing decision is independent of the cost of effort. Our result suggests that, for small or large effort costs, it is optimal for the seller to engage in marketing. For intermediate effort costs, however, demarketing can be optimal. With demarketing, the seller induces only the consumers with high valuation to make transaction effort. By doing so, the seller can price discriminate more effectively, thus extracting more surplus. We extend our analysis to the case where the seller can offer special deals through exclusive sales channels along with demarketing. Then, demarketing can be optimal even for large costs of effort.","[Kim, Jaesoo] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Shin, Dongsoo] Santa Clara Univ, Dept Econ, Leavey Sch Business, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; Santa Clara University,"Kim, J (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Econ, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",jaeskim@iupui.edu; dshin@scu.edu,"Kim, Jaesoo/GYQ-9324-2022",,Leavey Research Grant,Leavey Research Grant,"We are grateful to the Editor and three anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

This article examines how the innovation performance of European firms changes when they begin to internationalize their R&D activities. Propensity score matching and difference-in-differences methods are applied to control for self-selection and to estimate the causal effect of R&D internationalization. Patent inventor data are used to track the locations of corporate R&D activities. Information on patent applications, patent citations, and technological fields is used to measure innovation output, quality, and diversity, respectively. The results indicate that firms with a greater number of previous innovations are more likely to begin international R&D activities. Moreover, beginning R&D internationalization further increases the innovative output of firms. The results also indicate a weaker increase in the technological diversity of innovation activities. In contrast, the difference in the average quality of innovations in favor of international firms is shown to be due to self-selection.","[Rahko, Jaana] Univ Vaasa, Dept Econ, Vaasa, Finland",University of Vaasa,"Rahko, J (通讯作者)，Univ Vaasa, Dept Econ, Vaasa, Finland.",jaana.rahko@uva.fi,"Rahko, Jaana/IYJ-7867-2023","Rahko, Jaana/0000-0002-2891-5953",Finnish Cultural Foundation; Nissi Foundation; Wihuri Foundation,Finnish Cultural Foundation(Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish IT center for science); Nissi Foundation; Wihuri Foundation,"This work was supported by the Finnish Cultural Foundation, Nissi Foundation, and Wihuri Foundation.",,68,36,39,8,100,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We find that, in the financial sector, there is a case for liberalization, in terms of lowering inflation. However, a quasi-liberalized system in the sector proves to have a greater potential to reduce inflation in Ghana. In the exchange market, non-liberalization has the edge over liberalization in reducing inflation in Ghana. However, a quasi-liberalized system in the sector has a greater potential to lower inflation. There is evidence of a strong intra-continental transfer of inflation from Cote d'Ivoire to Ghana, but this transmission has been significantly moderated downwards by the implementation of prudent fiscal management in Cote d'Ivoire. We also find that monetary targeting and inflation targeting have deflationary effects, but we cannot claim that this has significantly reduced inflation. The implication of the result is that; a system that achieves the correct balance between the market mechanism and command system in the exchange and financial sectors has a greater potential to lower inflation in Ghana.

We fill this gap in the literature analyzing the characteristics of failed M&A operations in a large sample, including all the major domestic and cross-border deals in the banking sector announced worldwide between 1992 and 2010. The results show that the most important factors which determine the failure of an announced operation are deal specific characteristics, in particular the hostility of the bidder and the presence of multiple potential acquirers. Moreover, lengthier negotiations have a lower probability of success. Contrary to expectations, cross-border operations are more likely to be successfully completed than domestic ones.

The 2011 Banking Laws Bill was first introduced in 2005, but lapsed with the dissolution of the 14th Lok Sabha. The Bill was passed in December 2012 and raised the voting cap in private sector banks from 10 to 26 percent. We present evidence that the removal of the voting cap enhances the value of votes of bank stocks by reducing the wedge between cash-flow and control rights, thus increasing monitoring and the probability of takeover. Post-deregulation analysis reveals that the passage of the Bill was followed by increasing blockholders' number and percentage of shares held in larger and government banks. Furthermore, a stronger negative relationship between banks' profitability and size, as well as share of non-performing loans is observed. This study makes an important contribution to the growing literature on the valuation impact and efficiency gains of liberalization of ownership restrictions in emerging markets, as well as the rich literature on corporate governance and control relating to the value of voting privilege in companies with disparate voting rights.

In this paper, we examine whether managers use voluntary disclosure to mitigate these negative effects. Employing cross-sectional and within-firm designs, we find a robust positive relation between financial statement complexity and voluntary disclosure. This relation is stronger when liquidity decreases around the filing of the financial statements, is stronger when firms have more outside monitors, and is weaker when firms have poor performance and greater earnings management. We also examine the relation between financial statement complexity and voluntary disclosure using two quasi-natural experiments. Employing a generalized difference-in-differences design, we find firms affected by the adoption of complex accounting standards (e.g., SFAS 133 and SFAS 157) increase their voluntary disclosure to a greater extent than unaffected firms.

The decision of whether to participate can be analyzed in the same way as the decision to exercise an option. We consider this decision when there are two groups in society: the ruthless and average citizens. We assume that the ruthless differ from the average citizens because they invest in fighting technology and therefore face a lower cost of participation. The participation decision then captures two important (and conflicting) incentives. The first is that, since participation is costly, there is value in waiting to participate. The second is that there is value in being the first mover and capturing a greater share of the spoils of war if the revolution is successful. Our model generates the following implications. First, since participation is costly, there is some positive threshold for the net benefit that must be met before any individual decides to participate. Second, if the ruthless do not have a significant cost advantage, then one cannot predict, a priori, that the ruthless lead the revolt. Third, when the ruthless have a significant cost advantage, they have a lower threshold and always enter the conflict first. Finally, existing regimes can delay revolution among one or both groups by increasing the cost of participation.","[Hendrickson, Joshua R.] Univ Mississippi, 229 North Hall, University, MS 38677 USA; [Salter, Alexander William] Texas Tech Univ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",University of Mississippi; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Hendrickson, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, 229 North Hall, University, MS 38677 USA.",jrhendr1@olemiss.edu,,,,,,,38,3,3,0,7,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Unlike previous theoretical microstructure models, the market considered is unique in that the market makers do not face significant inventory costs or risk from informed traders. The model derives the time structure of the optimal markups over a certificate's fair theoretical value and its relationship with optimal spreads, unhedgeable risk faced by the issuer and investors' buying and selling decisions. It shows that (i) the optimal markups decrease inter-temporally, (ii) issuers adjust the markups according to investors' demand, (iii) unhedgeable risk results in higher markups and influences their time structure, (iv) the markups and the spread are negatively related. Using data from the German market for leverage certificates, we find strong empirical support for the model derived hypotheses, except for (iv). We find spreads exhibit little variation and this suggests that mark ups and spreads are not substitute profit sources for issuers in this market. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It argues that the order does provide important principles for both transmission planning and expansion, though. It thus presents a cost allocation methodology which channels the order's strengths.

We find that the APP announcement caused a broad based depreciation of the euro by signalling that the ECB's future monetary policy stance will remain accommodative. At the same time, the APP announcement boosted equity prices around the world by supporting investor confidence and reducing the risk of deflation and persistent stagnation in the euro area. Exchange rates appreciated more strongly vis-a-vis the euro in response to APP-related news for countries which are more integrated with the rest of the world overall, which exhibit less bilateral trade and financial integration with the euro area, which are under a more flexible exchange rate regime, and which are perceived to be more risky. Finally, we do not find any evidence that the APP announcement led to an increase in portfolios flows to emerging market economies. Quite the opposite, the ECB's APP seems to have induced a re-balancing by global investors out of emerging into advanced economies' financial markets.

While previous studies mostly focus on rainfall shocks in tropical or dry climate areas, our focus is on the extremely harsh winter that hit Mongolia in 2009-10. The severe winter-locally referred to as a dzud-caused catastrophic damage and resulted in the death of 10.3 million livestock. Our analysis identifies the causal impact of the weather shock on children's height by exploiting exogenous variation in the intensity of the shock across time and space. We use data on the height of children from two waves of a panel survey specifically designed to assess the impact of weather events. Results reveal that the shock significantly slowed the growth trajectory of exposed children from herding households. This negative effect is persistent, remaining observable in both panel waves, three and four years after the shock. The effect is driven by children who experienced the shock in utero. There is indicative evidence that the provision of emergency aid mitigates the negative consequences of the shock. Moreover, child height has a significant and positive association with households' receipt of informal help. Our findings are robust to alternative measures of shock intensity from different data sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our analysis suggests that the extension effect of a supermajority rule-that requires logrolling across additional members-increases with the ratio of seats in the House relative to seats in the Senate. Using a panel of US states, 1970-2008, we find that the ratio of House-to-Senate seats has a robust, positive impact on the tendency of a supermajority rule to inflate the budget. Our finding implies that a supermajority rule can have a perverse effect on budget outcomes in bicameral legislatures owing to two factors: the geographic overlap between chambers and the low price elasticity of demand for public goods.","[Lee, Dongwon] Sungkyunkwan Univ, 53,Myeongnyun Dong 3 Ga, Seoul 110745, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Lee, D (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, 53,Myeongnyun Dong 3 Ga, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",danlee200@skku.edu,,"Lee, Dongwon/0000-0003-4568-5982","Samsung Research Fund, Sungkyunkwan University","Samsung Research Fund, Sungkyunkwan University","I wish to thank two anonymous reviewers, editors William F.

The proportional feature of a flat tax system is assumed to lead to higher performance, while the fairness of the redistributive progressive tax system is assumed to result in higher tax compliance. However, empirical findings on the topic are inconclusive. Both work performance and tax compliance under different tax systems were examined in an experiment, with special attention devoted to the effect of a change in tax systems. A flat tax system was supposed to induce greater work performance, whereas a progressive tax system was expected to increase tax compliance based on fairness perceptions, allowing for the opposite effect due to higher complexity. Furthermore, it was assumed that performance and tax payments would be influenced by motives of self-interest. The design included 20 rounds with a real-effort task in each round, determining participants' experimental income. Participants (N = 191) made decisions about their tax payments from round-to-round in four different experimental conditions: (1) a flat tax system, (2) a progressive tax system, (3) starting with a flat and changing to a progressive, and (4) starting with a progressive and changing to a flat tax system. Results indicate higher work performance in a progressive system. However, a change from a progressive tax system to a flat system led to increased tax compliance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Considering the spatiotemporal factors for commuting efficiency evaluation, the timetable-dependent passenger carrying capacity of the transit station and the time-varying passenger demand at originating sites have been formulated into the BTA model. Moreover, the proposed BTA measure could reflect the commuting trip demand elasticity, which is caused by travel distance and transfer tolerance. In the meantime, this BTA measure can provide an important basis for transit timetable adjustment in the study area during different time periods. The proposed measure is tested on a small transit network to display its function, and finally, it is applied to an empirical case to draw practical findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines this issue using a panel of Chinese banks. We find that state-ownership is in general associated with higher risks. In addition, we find that banks controlled by the central government have the highest credit risk, while those owned by local governments have the lowest capital adequacy ratio and liquidity ratio. By compiling a complete list of cross-border acquisitions in China's banking sector, we investigate the impact of foreign acquisition on state-owned banks' risk-taking using differences-in-differences and matching estimators. We find that foreign acquisition has a reducing effect on state-owned banks' risk-taking and this effect is particularly significant for banks that are controlled by central or local government. We also find that this risk-reducing effect depends on the percentage of foreign ownership, the local business involvement of the foreign investors, and the number of foreign members on the banks' boards of directors.

Our regression discontinuity analysis uses an exogenous source of variation in school closure an Ohio law that requires charter schools to close if they fail to meet a specific performance standard to estimate the causal effect of closure on student achievement. The results indicate that closing low-performing charter schools eventually yields achievement gains of around 0.2-0.3 standard deviations in reading and math for students attending these schools at the time they were identified for closure. The study also employs mandatory closure as an instrument for estimating the impact of exiting low-quality charter schools, thus providing plausible lower-bound estimates of charter school effectiveness. These results complement the more common lottery-based estimates of charter school effects, which likely serve as upper-bound estimates due to their focus on oversubscribed schools often located in cities with high-performing charter sectors.

Although the DIC based on the conditional likelihood-obtained by conditioning on the latent variables-is widely used for comparing stochastic volatility models, recent studies have argued against its use on both theoretical and practical grounds. Indeed, we show via a Monte-Carlo study that the conditional DIC tends to favor overfitted models, whereas the DIC based on the observed-data likelihood-calculated using the proposed importance sampling algorithms-seems to perform well.

The rise of cliometrics, originally known as the new economic history, has fostered much debate about the proper balance of economics and history in economic history. The emphasis on theory and formal modeling that distinguishes cliometrics from the old economic history now blurs the distinction between economic history and economic theory.

Specifically, we estimate the log odds that teachers of varying experience and effectiveness levels transfer out of their schools to other schools in the district in Washington kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) public schools. We find little consistent evidence relating voluntary transfer provisions in CBAs to patterns in teacher mobility, but do find evidence that patterns in within-district mobility by teacher experience and effectiveness vary between districts that do not use seniority in involuntary transfer decisions and those that use seniority as a tiebreaker or the only factor in these moves. In models that consider teacher experience, the interaction between teacher experience and school disadvantage in teacher transfer decisions is more extreme in districts with strong involuntary seniority transfer protections; novice teachers are even more likely to stay in disadvantaged schools, and veteran teachers are even more likely to leave disadvantaged schools. On the other hand, models that consider value-added measures of teacher effectiveness suggest that more effective teachers are less likely to leave disadvantaged schools in districts that do use seniority in involuntary transfer decisions, that is, seniority transfer provisions could actually make the distribution of output-based measures of quality more equitable. Taken together, these results suggest that seniority transfer provisions may have differential impacts on the distributions of teacher experience and effectiveness.

Its main prediction is that loss averse investors, who evaluate their investment performance too frequently and therefore often observe small losses on their stock portfolios, would invest too little in equity. We investigate the link between myopic loss aversion and actual investment decisions of individual investors, using survey data. Our results are consistent with the predictions of Benartzi and Thaler. Higher myopic loss aversion is associated with lower stock investment as a share of total assets. Investors tend to evaluate their stock portfolio performance too often, which contributes to the prevalence of myopic loss aversion. The effect of myopia is most apparent when investors both evaluate their portfolios frequently and trade stocks regularly. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Due to the large number of participants typically involved in supply chain operations, organizations often find that it is difficult to effectively share information within a supply chain; hence, this research examined ways to improve information sharing within supply chain operations for one marine transportation services organization. An action research, case study approach used the Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) methodology to design an information technology solution that effectively communicates information between the layers within the supply chain regarding the movement of materials via inland tank barges. The comparative analysis of verification and baseline measurements conducted suggests this project was successful because the new process fulfilled the needs of the work environment for which it was designed. For the organization that participated in this research, the successful adoption of the new approach for information sharing improved communication and decision making within their supply chain.

Probabilities that prices, separated by up to k periods, move in the same direction are derived and compared to empirical probabilities using a Wald statistic. The hypothesis is evaluated for 48 monthly commodity prices and five major stock price indices. Nominal commodity prices show evidence of symmetric momentum in up and down movements. Stock indices have momentum in up movements, with a positive trend due to more frequent up movements. The testing reveals fundamental differences between commodity and asset prices. Several commodities show evidence against the null hypothesis, while none of the stock indices reject the hypothesis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

I develop a general equilibrium model of MMFs to study how sponsor support affects the industry's fragility and regulation. Adverse asset-quality shocks lead MMFs to liquidate assets. When liquidity in asset markets is limited, asset prices are lower if more funds liquidate. Lower asset prices, in turn, make sponsor support costlier and even more liquidations occur. This feedback leads to complementarities in sponsors' support decisions. Based on the model's insights, I derive implications for the regulation of MMFs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Overall, our results suggest that regulations on selling market data can play an important role in improving market quality and trader welfare.","[Easley, David] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [O'Hara, Maureen] Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [O'Hara, Maureen] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Yang, Liyan] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada; [Yang, Liyan] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Cornell University; Cornell University; University of Technology Sydney; University of Toronto; Peking University,"O'Hara, M (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;O'Hara, M (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",dae3@cornell.edu; mol9@comell.edu; liyan.yang@rotman.utoronto.ca,"yang, liyan/HNB-9033-2023","Yang, Liyan/0000-0002-2599-1328",Bank of Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),Bank of Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)CGIAR),Yang thanks the Bank of Canada and Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) for financial support.

We also document that leaving out CEO fixed effects in a longitudinal compensation study can lead to potentially erroneous conclusions about the role of several governance attributes in CEO compensation contracting.

Using a natural experiment, we show that when external financiers observe a firm's choice to voluntarily obtain an audit, the firms obtaining an audit significantly increase their debt, investment, and operating performance, and become more responsive to their investment opportunities. Further, we find that these effects are stronger for firms that are financially constrained and weaker for firms with other means to reduce financing frictions. Overall, our evidence suggests that the audit choice conveys information to capital providers, which reduces financing frictions and improves performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The construction of long-short portfolios based on liquidity proxies introduces errors such as extraneous risk factors and hedging error. We develop a new measure for liquidity risk using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that attempts to minimize this error. We form a theoretically-supported measure that is long ETFs and short the underlying components of that ETF, i.e., long and short a similar set of underlying securities with the same weights. Pricing discrepancies between the long and short positions are driven by liquidity differences between the ETF and its underlying components. Constructing liquidity risk factors in a number of markets, we undertake several tests to validate our new liquidity metric. The results show that our illiquidity measure is strongly related to other measures of illiquidity, explains bond index returns, and reveals a systematic illiquidity component across fixed-income markets.

Individual and district characteristics explain some, but not all, of the variation observed.","[Clark, Robert L.] N Carolina State Univ, Econ & Management, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Clark, Robert L.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hanson, Emma; Pathak, Aditi] N Carolina State Univ, Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Hanson, Emma] North Carolina Dept State Treasurer, Raleigh, NC USA; [Morrill, Melinda Sandler] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University; National Bureau of Economic Research; North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University,"Clark, RL (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Econ & Management, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.;Clark, RL (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",robert_clark@ncsu.edu; evhanson@ncsu.edu; melinda_morrill@ncsu.edu; aspathak@ncsu.edu,,"Morrill, Melinda/0000-0002-1479-1996",TIAA CREF Institute,TIAA CREF Institute,"This paper was prepared for the NBER Conference on Retirement and Health Benefits in the Public Sector, April 10-11, 2015, and the authors are grateful for comments from Brigitte Madrian and other conference participants.

This is certainly the case in urban contexts of sub-Saharan Africa where mobility forms an integral part of livelihood and income-generating activities. Drawing on in-depth qualitative research conducted in Accra, the capital of Ghana, this paper explores the mobility of urban residents in differing parts of the city in relation to their livelihood strategies. Through illustrating the ways in which the mobility of urban residents is aided or hindered by Accra's transport system, and by examining how this in turn influences their livelihood strategies, the paper contributes to an alternative new mobilities paradigm that is more considerate of, and builds upon insights from, the global South where such research has a longer pedigree than in the global North.

In this diffused context, Henry Bernstein used an approach developed by French scholars, filieres vivrieres', to analyse the ethnicized concentration of capital in South African maize markets (Bernstein 1996). The first part of this essay critically introduces the background to this approach, and Bernstein's development of it, to examine capital accumulation and public and private regulation. The second part merges insights from filieres with a systems approach to post-harvest activity. It revisits four decades of research on South Indian agriculture and its paddy-rice markets to show how petty production and trade can coexist with capitalist accumulation, showing how, to what extent and why the relations of agricultural commodity marketing fail to complete' the process of polar class differentiation and consolidate petty commodity production in the post-harvest sphere of circulation - the filiere - as well as in production.","[Harriss-White, Barbara] Univ Oxford Wolfson Coll, Oxford OX2 6UD, England",University of Oxford,"Harriss-White, B (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Wolfson Coll, Oxford OX2 6UD, England.",barbara.harriss-white@qeh.ox.ac.uk,,,DFID-ESRC; ESRC [ES/I033769/1] Funding Source: UKRI,DFID-ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"During the four decades, many people have helped with this project of fieldwork.

In Experiment 1 we investigated the influence of outcome valence (positive vs. negative outcome) and externality valence (positive vs. negative externality) framing on players' willingness to cooperate in a repeated public good game. We found a significant interaction effect on first-round cooperation, indicating larger cooperation rates when there is a negative outcome valence and a positive externality on others. Furthermore, this effect remained largely stable when comparing cooperation over all rounds, resulting in 45-63% increased cooperation compared to the other conditions. In Experiment 2 we replicated the effect in an applied vignette study, lending support for the generalizability of this framing effect. Taken together, these findings suggest that public goods provisions may be increased substantially by framing the situation's outcome valence as negative rather than positive. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
