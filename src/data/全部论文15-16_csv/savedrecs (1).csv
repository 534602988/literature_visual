Thus, productive firms self-select into exporters and the less productive firms can only serve domestic consumers. This paper presents a similar but different case in China, whose domestic markets are segmented by provincial borders mainly owing to the various (hidden) protective measures favoring local firms. These discriminative measures are de facto trade barriers. It applies the heterogeneous trade theory to examine the effects of firms' productivity on their sales choices in both the international and domestic markets, in the presence of intra-national and international trade costs. We find that productive firms not only self-select into exporters, but also into sales in other provincial markets. This pattern is sensitive to firms' locations and ownerships. For foreign direct investment (FDI)-controlled firms, increases in productivity are associated with a higher probability of selling into other provincial markets, rather than into international ones. Productivity increases for firms operating in the inland area exhibit different patterns than those in the Eastern area.","[Wang, Yanling] Carleton Univ, Norman Paterson Sch Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Wang, Yanling] Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Kaifeng, Henan, Peoples R China; [Bao, Qun] Nankai Univ, Dept Int Trade & Econ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jiuli] Nankai Univ, Ctr Transnat Studies, TEDA Coll, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jiuli] Nankai Univ, Inst Int Business, TEDA Coll, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",Carleton University; Henan University; Nankai University; Nankai University; Nankai University,"Bao, Q (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Dept Int Trade & Econ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",Yanling_Wang@carleton.ca,"wang, yan/JBJ-7462-2023; wang, yan/GSE-6489-2022; wang, yi/GVT-8516-2022; Wang, Yanbo/HFZ-8018-2022",,China's National Science Fund [71473136]; Excellent Scholar Research Program [NCET-11-0248]; Huo Yingdong Research Fund [141083]; National Social Science Fund of China [13BJL050]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in Universities [NCET-13-0298],China's National Science Fund; Excellent Scholar Research Program; Huo Yingdong Research Fund; National Social Science Fund of China; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in Universities(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)),"Wang: Norman Paterson School of International Affairs, Carleton University, 5306 River Building, 1125 Colonel By Drive, Ottaway, ON, Canada K1S 5B6.

A smooth transition approach,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gold; Hedge; Safe haven; Smooth transition; Stock prices,PRECIOUS METALS; MARKET; EFFICIENCY; INFLATION; PRICE; MODEL; SPECIFICATION; HYPOTHESIS; FUTURES; ASSET,"This study deals with the issue whether gold actually exhibits the function of a hedge or a safe haven as often referred to in the media and academia. In order to test the Baur and Lucey (2010) hypotheses, we contribute to the existing literature by the augmentation of their model to a smooth transition regression (STR) using an exponential transition function which splits the regression model into two extreme regimes. One accounts for periods in which stock returns are on average and therefore allows to test whether gold acts as a hedge for stocks, the other one accounts for periods characterized by extreme market conditions where the volatility of the stock returns is high. The latter state enables us to test whether gold can be regarded as a safe haven for stocks. The study includes a broad set of 18 individual markets as well as five regional indices and covers a sample period running from January 1970 to March 2012 on a monthly frequency. Overall, our findings show that gold serves as both a hedge and a safe haven. However, this ability seems to be market-specific. In addition, by applying a portfolio analysis we also show that our findings are useful for investors. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM.

This paper analyzes behavior in the centipede game when a traditional game-theoretical assumption that players maximize expected utility is relaxed. We demonstrate the existence of a descriptively adequate subgame perfect equilibrium under two standard decision-theoretical assumptions. First, players choose under uncertainty in a probabilistic manner as captured by embedding a core deterministic decision theory in a model of probabilistic choice. Second, players adopt non-linear decision weights and overweight the likelihood of rare events as captured, for example, by rank-dependent utility or prospect theory. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Based on an extended definition of income - including additional components which do not appear in the standard Eurostat definitions - we complement the information provided by the Gini index and quantile ratios by computing an alternative inequality indicator, developed by Zenga (2007), and its decomposition by income source. While broadly confirming the distributional effect of the crisis documented in previous studies, we find that in specific countries the level of inequality appears higher when alternative measures are taken into account, and that the rise of inequality since 2008 has not been as modest as the previous studies would suggest The paper further looks at how the distribution of income has evolved during the crisis by income quantile groups (i.e. 'zooming-in'). The results point to varying contribution of labour income in 2011 compared to 2007. In addition, while the impact of individual households' characteristics shows a non-linear pattern across income quantile groups before the crisis, such dispersion has decreased in 2011. We argue that, on the basis of our analysis, not only euro area countries are differently unequal in that inequality has developed in a very peculiar way in different countries, but also because it needs to be tackled at a finer level of analysis.

We derive several policy design lessons; e.g., we show that it is possible that linking leniency across products increases the likelihood of conviction in the first product investigated but reduces it in subsequent products. Thus, firms may have an incentive to form sacrificial cartels and apply for leniency in less valuable products to reduce convictions in more valuable products.

I find that gender is the only of the characteristics that significantly affects risk taking, both for individual investments and group investment decisions by consensus. In individual decisions, women are more risk averse than men. In groups, risk aversion is increasing in the number of female group members. I make out-of-sample predictions of group decisions for different gender compositions based on the sample of individual preferences using simulation of various 'social decision schemes'. Generally, none of the schemes predicts group decisions well. These results pose new challenges for theories of preference aggregation in groups and have practical implications for organizations that rely on teams to make decisions under risk.

Because it solves the model in closed-form, the paper provides analytical insight on the forces that drive the economy's phase transition and the associated qualitative transformation of industrial activity. The resulting S-shaped path of GDP per capita replicates the key feature of the data: an accelerating phase followed by a deceleration with convergence to a stationary growth rate. The model also yields predictions for grand ratios like consumption/GDP, profits/GDP, and the distribution of income across factors of production. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The outcome measures of interest are grade repetition in primary and secondary schools and track attendance after primary education. Using the variation in the fraction of migrant students among cohorts within schools, the analysis shows that native students are not affected by the share of migrant students. For students with a migration background, adverse effects are found for grade repetition and high track attendance. The higher the share of migrant peers is, the more likely migrant students repeat a grade and the less likely they attend high track schools. The negative spill-over effects for grade repetition are particularly strong between students from the same area of origin. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we examine the effect of this new product on telephony demand and its evolution in the market using the Consumer Expenditure Survey from 1994 to 2012. This represents a period much longer than previous studies and over which most cell phone adoptions took place. We develop and estimate a model of household choice of telephony options using a mixed logit as a function of consumer characteristics, unobserved alternative-specific attributes, and prices over time. Unlike previous research, our focus is on the evolution of demand and choices made by households. To illustrate the evolution, we construct market segments and track adoptions over time by market segment, allowing for an assessment of whether cell phones are substitutes or complements for landlines. The evidence suggests that the move to cellular telephone services is driven by young households and by households with larger families. We then develop and apply a decomposition of substitutability and find significant evidence that substitutability differs through time and by market segment.","[Thacker, Michael J.; Wilson, Wesley W.] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of Oregon,"Wilson, WW (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",thacker@uoregon.edu; wwilson@uoregon.edu,"Wilson, Wesley W/A-4256-2013",,,,,,19,2,6,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The goal of this article is to assess their semantic role: representation theorems are purported to provide definitions of the decision-theoretic concepts involved in the evaluation criteria (such as those of utility or subjective probability that feature in the subjective expected utility criterion).

The issue with classified loans provided by the socialist monobank State Bank of Czechoslovakia before 1989 had been solved through special consolidation institutions operated by the government in the 1990s and 2000s. The topic seems to be quite historical but infact the opposite is true - the state's involvement in the process of consolidation of bad loans created good conditions for rent seekers, whose efforts led to out-of-court remuneration, i.e. additional costs of consolidation for Czech public finances in 2013. The article consists of a broad analysis of the Czech way of bad loan consolidation using information from financial statements and reports of consolidation institutions, and a calculation of returns from individual and block sales of receivables. The calculations show individual sales had higher return ratios than block sales, while the average return to nominal value was under 20%. A comparison with the different Slovak approach to the problem is also included.","Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Rod, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",ales.rod@vse.cz,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JUL 3,2015,27,3,,,,,411,427,,10.1080/14631377.2015.1055984,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CP1BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359609600007,0

Under the assumption that changes in the trend of an economic structure are statistically significant, the method extrapolates I-O tables by combining time series models with an MTT and proceeds with only the total value added during the target years. A simulation study and empirical analysis are conducted to compare the forecasting performance of the MTT to the Generalized RAS (GRAS) and Kuroda methods.

Indeed, enhancing contractual efficiency in high-quality supply chains may adversely affect the market structure by driving low-quality vertical chains out of the market and consequently reduce consumer surplus. Due to the finiteness property, (counter-)integration in the low-quality channel does not allow this channel to be in business.

In this paper I study informal trade as a first-best outcome. In the model I propose rigid regulations can be necessary to achieve efficiency even though they are always sidestepped. The key assumption is that the regulations define the trading parties' fall-back position in case the informal bargaining process breaks down. I set up a field experiment to test the model's mechanisms in the Cape Town market for metered taxis. Consistent with the model, I find that sidestepping the regulations increase cost efficiency (taxis take the shortest route). The price is however unaffected, suggesting informal bargaining leads to a Pareto improvement. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Despite this positive influence on educational outcomes, it is still unclear why some children are more prosocial than others in school. The current study investigates a possible link between following a prosocial norm and self-regulation. We tested 433 children between 6 and 13 years of age in two variations of the Dictator Game. Children were asked what they should or would give in the game and then played an actual DG. We show that most children hold a common norm for sharing resources, but that some children fail to follow that norm in the actual game. The gap between norm and behavior was correlated with self-regulation skills on a parent-report individual differences measure. Specifically, we show that two components of self-regulation, attention and inhibition, predict children's ability to follow the stated norm for giving. These results suggest that some children are poorer at holding the norm in mind and following through on enacting it.

What is the relative importance of persistent shocks, transitory shocks and heterogeneous profiles? To what extent do taxes, transfers and the family attenuate these various factors in the evolution of life-cycle inequality? In this paper, we use rich Norwegian population panel data to answer these important questions. We let individuals with different education levels have a separate income process; and within each skill group, we allow for non-stationarity in age and time, heterogeneous experience profiles, and shocks of varying persistence. We find that the income processes differ systematically by age, skill level and their interaction. To accurately describe labor income dynamics over the life-cycle, it is necessary to allow for heterogeneity by education levels and account for non-stationarity in age and time. Our findings suggest that the redistributive nature of the Norwegian tax-transfer system plays a key role in attenuating the magnitude and persistence of income shocks, especially among the low skilled. By comparison, spouse's income matters less for the dynamics of inequality over the life-cycle. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Using a detailed database of plant-level refinery outages for both upstream and downstream refining units, I estimate the effects of outages on product prices controlling for the crude oil price and the ability of operating plants to respond to the outage. I also consider the effect of current market profitability on the likelihood of planned refinery outages and the effects of high utilization rates and planned maintenance on the prospects for unplanned outages. I then use plant-level capacity data to analyze the effects of outages, profitability, and utilization rates on future investment decisions of the refinery. Results based on probit and hazard models show that planned outages tend to occur during the spring and fall and during times of relatively low margins as measured by the crack spread, while unplanned outages are negatively associated with the capacity utilization rate. Price regressions show that atmospheric distillation and catalytic cracking outages are positively associated with gasoline prices and the association is stronger the higher is the utilization rate at the time of the outage. The relationship between both upstream and downstream investment and outages is mixed though refiners tend to invest less when nearby plants have made investments in the prior year. While causal relationships between outages, prices, and investment are difficult to estimate due to simultaneity and unobserved variables, these descriptive results show that outages are an important factor affecting refined product prices and future refinery investment.

In every period the receiver determines a test about the unknown state whose result is privately observed by the sender. After the sender sends a costless message about an outcome of the test, the receiver selects a test in the next period. After a finite number of periods of interaction, the receiver makes a decision. The paper offers a sequence of tests that refine sender's information step-by-step and preserve truthtelling in every period. This sequence allows the receiver to learn the state in a subinterval of the state space with an arbitrary precision and has appealing theoretical properties. It consists of simple binary tests which reveal whether the state is above a certain cutoff, where the cutoffs are monotonic across periods and independent from results of the previous tests. Finally, we show that the relative payoff efficiency of multi-stage interaction compared to a single-stage game increases without a bound as the bias in preferences tends to zero.","McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada",McMaster University,"Ivanov, M (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Kenneth Taylor Hall,1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada.",mivanov@mcmaster.ca,,,,,,,23,6,7,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

When optimal effort is fully pooled across agent types for multiple principal types, it is also pooled across those principal types. When optimal effort separates some agent types for multiple principal types, efforts of those agent types may be separated across principal types. But then, somewhat perversely, some agent type's effort is decreasing in the principal's value of effort. When agent type is uniformly distributed, that applies to agent types with lower effort cost, so reducing the difference in effort between low and high effort cost types. This result extends to the principal's type being observed only by the principal if the marginal cost of effort to the agent is sufficiently convex. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The empirical results show that hospitals are quite responsive to changes in price policy. The fee revisions have certainly achieved the policy objectives of reducing patient-nurse ratios and the length of hospital stays. As a result, hospitals have responded by greatly increasing the number of expensive beds for acute care. However, this was not exactly predicted by the Japanese government, which has aimed to reallocate health-care resources, such as beds, to subacute or long-term care.","[Noguchi, Haruko] Waseda Univ, Tokyo 1698050, Japan",Waseda University,"Noguchi, H (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Sch Polit Sci & Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishiwaseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",h.noguchi@waseda.jp,"Noguchi, Haruko/ABF-3059-2020","Noguchi, Haruko/0000-0002-4437-8238","Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare [H26-chikyukibo-ippan-009]","Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare(Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan)","This research is funded in part by the generous support of a research grant from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Principal investigator: Shibuya Kenji, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, H26-chikyukibo-ippan-009).

I argue that trade barriers play a crucial role in shaping the cross-country pattern of specialization across many tradable goods. I construct a multi-country, general equilibrium model of trade and derive tractable predictions that show how specialization affects relative prices. I calibrate the model to match the patterns of prices, levels of development, and bilateral trade across 103 countries. Through counterfactuals I find that removing trade barriers eliminates more than half of the gap in the relative price of services between rich and poor countries with only a minimal systematic effect on the absolute price of tradables.

How much investors are willing to lend to a country's government depends on the country's expected primary surplus, the level and volatility of its rate of growth, and how much debt the government expects to be able to raise in the future for the purpose of servicing the debt it seeks to raise today. We provide a simple formula that computes a country's maximum sustainable debt (MSD) as a function of four easy-to-estimate parameters.

This study examines whether the presence of politicians from new parties affects the size of government (measured by public spending and tax revenue). The study focuses on Colombian municipalities, where new parties have been numerous and successful in recent years. Regression discontinuity estimates show that public spending and tax revenues are significantly higher in municipalities governed by a mayor from a new party. Using information about local politics and the features of the new parties, I argue that this result is not associated with new party ideology, but instead relates to new parties having lower probability of reelection which raises the incentives to increase short-term rent seeking.

Our initial Generalised Method of Moments estimation, based on a filtered output gap variable and including supply shocks, also gives an unrealistic downward sloping AS. But we find measures of asymmetries in price changes outperform traditional measures of supply shocks. Estimation using marginal costs as a proxy for the output gap gives a positive coefficient that reduces in size on including our comprehensive supply shock variable, implying the correct AS has a small positive slope, but is subject to multiple shifts. The semi-structural specification, closer to firms' actual decisions, gives estimates of structural parameters such as degree of price stickiness and extent of forward-looking price adjustment. The results more correctly separate shocks from cyclicality, help to interpret India's growth and inflation experience, and have implications for policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We also compare the levels of social welfare attainable under these tax systems versus that in the autarkic equilibrium. Both two-period and infinite-horizon settings are considered. Under empirically plausible parameter values, separating taxation is optimal in the two-period model, whereas autarky is optimal when the time horizon is infinite. The effects of varying the degree of wage inequality, the populations of low-skill and high-skill workers, and the discount rate are explored as well. For reasonable changes in these parameters, separating taxation remains optimal in the two-period model, while autarky remains optimal in the infinite-horizon model. Pooling is not optimal in either the two-period or infinite-horizon models for all parameter changes considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper explores a pattern of bribery between an auctioneer and a favored bidder, and also investigates the regulation scheme of buyer. In the model, the favored bidder is allowed to submit two bids simultaneously with the advantageous one to be announced; auctioneer decides the share of the difference between two bids which is the bribe transfer. The analysis shows that, the favored bidder does not participate in the corruption if his cost exceeds a threshold; otherwise he submits two bids whose difference is decreasing in the share. The corruption benefits both the auctioneer and the favored bidder but harms other bidders. The bribery endogenously leads to allocation inefficiency with a probability decreasing in the bribe share. Specifically, with two uniformly distributed bidders, we examine how the auctioneer optimizes the bribe share and how the buyer regulates the corruption. We find that by driving the auctioneer to charge a higher bribe share that is less attractive for the favored bidder, severer regulation tends to reduce the probability of corruption. A buyer who adopts extremely severe regulation can exclude the corruption and achieve maximum social welfare, while a buyer who aims to maximize his own profit should tolerate some degree of the corruption.

Since the objective of a centrally controlled system is to minimize the expected daily operating costs subject to the availability of generating units and storage capacity, the basic economic question is whether the savings in the annual system cost of supply, including the capital cost of installed generating capacity, can offset the capital cost of installing deferrable demand capacity. The analysis uses a new multi-period model of a power grid that treats stochastic generation explicitly and determines the optimum hourly commitment of conventional generators and the charging/discharging of deferrable demand needed to maintain the reliability of supply. A simulation example shows that deferrable demand can reduce system costs by (1) shifting demand from expensive peak periods to less expensive off-peak periods, (2) providing ramping services to mitigate the variability of wind generation, and (3) reducing the amount of installed peaking capacity needed for System Adequacy and the associated capital costs. If customers pay rates for electricity that reflect the true system costs of supplying their patterns of purchases from the grid, customers with deferrable demand will pay lower bills for electricity and their savings will be substantially more than the cost of installing deferrable demand devices. The results also show that if customers pay typical flat rates for electric energy, the economic incentives for installing deferrable demand are perverse.","[Jeon, Wooyoung] Korea Energy Econ Inst, Ulsan, South Korea; [Lamadrid, Alberto J.] Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Mo, Jung Youn] Korea Inst Ind Econ & Trade, Sejong, South Korea; [Mount, Timothy D.] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY USA",Korea Energy Economics Institute; Lehigh University; Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade (KIET); Cornell University,"Lamadrid, AJ (通讯作者)，Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",wyjeon@keei.re.kr; ajlamadrid@ieee.org; jymo@kiet.re.kr; tdm2@cornell.edu,,"Lamadrid L., Alberto J./0000-0003-2539-9487","Lehigh Faculty Innovation Grant; US Department of Energy through the Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solutions (CERTS); Power Systems Engineering Research Center (PSERC), an NSF I/UCRC; NSF [64581]; Division Of Computer and Network Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1135844] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Lehigh Faculty Innovation Grant; US Department of Energy through the Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solutions (CERTS); Power Systems Engineering Research Center (PSERC), an NSF I/UCRC; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Computer and Network Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE))","The authors would like to thank Ray D.

Our analysis is based on a bivariate unobserved components model of inflation and unemployment in which inflation is decomposed into a stochastic trend and a transitory component. As in recent implementations of the New Keynesian Phillips Curve, it is the transitory component of inflation, or inflation gap, that is driven by the real-activity gap, which we measure as the deviation of unemployment from its natural rate. We find that both trend inflation and the inflation gap have been consistent and substantial determinants of inflation at business cycle horizons for all G7 countries since 1960. Also, the real-activity gap explains a large fraction of the variation in the inflation gap for each country. These results provide empirical support for the New Keynesian Phillips Curve augmented with trend inflation.","[Morley, James] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Piger, Jeremy] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Rasche, Robert] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Oregon; Michigan State University,"Piger, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, 1285 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",jpiger@uoregon.edu,"Morley, James C/J-9166-2012","Morley, James/0000-0003-2380-6747",,,,,45,15,15,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We move one step further in the model with stochastic prices and include risk aversion in the objective function. We prove that, as in the deterministic case, the optimal program is periodic both in the risk neutral and risk averse frameworks, when the benefit function is linear. We find the optimal rotation ages in both stochastic cases and show that they may differ significantly from the deterministic rotation age. In addition, we show how the drift of the price process affects the optimal rotation age and how the degree of risk aversion shortens it. We illustrate our findings for an example of a biomass function and for different values of the model's parameters.","[Piazza, Adriana] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Matemat, Valparaiso, Chile; [Pagnoncelli, Bernardo K.] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Escuela Negocios, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria; Universidad Adolfo Ibanez,"Piazza, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Matemat, Ave Espana 1680,Casilla 110-V, Valparaiso, Chile.",adriana.piazza@usm.cl,"Piazza, Adriana/GWC-7534-2022",,"Basal Project CMM, Universidad de Chile; FONDECYT [1140720, 1120244, 11130056]; CONICYT Anillo [ACT1106]","Basal Project CMM, Universidad de Chile(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/BASAL); FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); CONICYT Anillo(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/ANILLOS)","This research was partially funded by Basal Project CMM, Universidad de Chile.

The theoretical model introduces product quality differentiation amongst heterogeneous firms and focuses on supply-side determinants of international trade. Among other results, in general equilibrium, trade liberalization decreases the share of high-quality varieties in exports and the average productivity of exporters. These changes affect average export price in opposite ways. Nevertheless, trade liberalization in the quality-extended model increases consumers' welfare by more than in the benchmark model.","Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame,"Gervais, A (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",agervais@nd.edu,,"Gervais, Antoine/0000-0002-4363-0155",,,,,30,3,3,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We apply Kilian's (2009) methodology to disentangle shocks to the crude oil market into distinct demand and supply shocks, and examine the response of the U.S. real and nominal trade-weighted U.S. dollar exchange rate indexes, as well as six other bilateral exchange rates to these shocks. Our analysis indicates that oil supply shocks have no significant effects on exchange rates, while global aggregate demand and oil-specific demand shocks lead to depreciations.

We empirically test our model on a large dataset of U.S. infrastructure stocks in different subsectors (utility, telecommunication, and transportation) and over a long period of time (1983 to 2011). The new factor model is able to capture the variation of infrastructure returns better than the Fama/French three-factor, the Carhart four-factor or the extended Fung/Hsieh eight-factor models. Thus, our model helps to improve the evaluation of infrastructure funds and to better determine the cost of capital of infrastructure firms, something that is increasingly relevant in light of the growing need for privately financed infrastructure projects.

Much of the earlier literature assumes public monitoring. Departures from public monitoring to private monitoring that incorporate differences in players' observations may dramatically complicate coordination and the provision of incentives, with the consequence that equilibria with private monitoring often seem unrealistically complex or fragile. We set out a model in which players accomplish cooperation in an intuitively plausible fashion.

The counter-hooliganism measures, grounded on an entry card, namely a fidelity card', were designed to keep out hooligans from stadiums so favouring the attendance of either occasional spectators or uncommitted fans. According to our econometric investigation the expected substitution between committed fans and uncommitted fans did not take shape.

We test for price excess co-movement in 12 commodities - 11 non-energy ones and oil spanning over a hundred years: 1900-2010. To this end, we approximate commodity demand/supply factors by their apparent consumption. We carry out several tests and find some evidence in favor of excess co-movement, but its nature appears to be time-dependent. In particular, we conclude that excess co-movement with oil is generally present, particularly in the industrial metal class. We also explore the interdependence between portfolio investment decisions and excess co-movement for three unrelated assets: cotton, copper, and petroleum. Based on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization, we found some correlations between the two, when short sales are excluded, during 1971, 1999-2004, and 2008. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Among many of the changing environmental factors, we focused on the institutional environment and investigated the role of the restructuring of state owned enterprises and the growth of privatized firms on Korean firms' location choices. With samples of Korean manufacturing firms invested in 31 cities and provinces from 1989 to 2011, we analyzed the determinants of location choice with the dependent variable measured by total investment amount. Using Tobit regression analysis, we found that the number of SOEs and the industrial output share of SOEs are significantly and positively related with Korean firm's location selection.","[Han, Byoung-Sop] Chonnam Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Gwangju, South Korea; [Kim, Jae-Jin] Maeil Business Newspaper, Econ & Business Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Moretti, Raul] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Global Business, Chuncheon Si, South Korea",Chonnam National University; Kangwon National University,"Han, BS (通讯作者)，Chonnam Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Gwangju, South Korea.",hanbs@jnu.ac.kr; jin4sky@hanmail.net; moretti@kangwon.ac.kr,,,,,,,42,1,1,1,13,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

We provide evidence supporting the money illusion hypothesis in China. The recursive unit root test is suited to practical implementation with time series and delivers a consistent date-stamping strategy for determining the origination and termination of multiple bubbles.

I consider the extent of intergenerational redistribution and use time series data to examine the changes in these policies. The results show that the policies of the 1990s led to a reduction in the financial burden of the present generation, including people in their 20s, by passing this burden on to future generations. This situation lasted through the early half of the 2000s, but changed in the latter half of that decade. The decline in the lifetime net burden of the future generation between 2004 and 2007 was achieved by increasing the lifetime net burden of those in the young generation and not by reducing the remaining lifetime net benefit of the retired generation. The decline in the burden of the future generation in the latter half of 2000s was, however, not sufficient to correct the degree of generational imbalance in 1990. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The decomposition explains the link between the inequality trend and the changes in country ranking, population size, and per capita CO2 emission disparities. We show that all components of inequality change can be further decomposed by subgroup. This provides analysts with a decomposition technique detecting the within-group and between-group contributions to each component of inequality change.

In an initially all-white neighborhood, real estate brokers thus either keep the neighborhood in a steady-state white equilibrium or trigger racial transition by matching sellers to minority buyers, a process called blockbusting. Racial transition leads to a higher rate of property turnover in the neighborhood once the fraction of minorities has reached a tipping point but racial transition also leads to lower prices, and this is the trade-off faced by a broker. The model shows that with multiple brokers, blockbusting profit per broker is lower as brokers free ride on each other's groundbreaking efforts. The model predicts that racial transition will happen in the neighborhood when (i) the number of brokers is limited, (ii) racial preferences lie in an intermediate range, (iii) the arrival rate of offers is intermediate. Otherwise, real estate brokers steer white households toward white buyers. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Are these merely costly liabilities to the countries that supervise them, or is their global reach also beneficial for the real economy and for FDI in particular? Recent literature has focused on the risks, emphasizing transmission of shocks from one country to many countries. On the positive side, this paper hypothesizes that global banks have made investing abroad easier and more successful for their home-market customers. Using a new detailed data set of outward FDI, this paper finds that banks' direct investment abroad is positively associated with the volume of non-financial FDI from the same home market. The result is robust to various robustness exercises which show that the main results are not likely to be driven by reverse causality. The effect is stronger in countries where investing is more hazardous, those with worse corruption and weaker rule of law. Conversely, this paper does not find evidence that host-market domestic or third-country foreign banks facilitate FDI. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Estimation results based on combined sample of men and women indicate that the frequency of exposure to mass media is positively related to the support for Koizumi but not for his principal policy.

In addition, it is also observed that the crime rate is positively linked with the level of inflation, unemployment rate, as well as inequality in consumption and employment between the rural and urban sectors.

The sellers are characterized by qualities that are the buyer's private information. Comparing the outcomes of different policies regarding the revelation of such information prior to the auction, we find that maximizing the procurer's expected utility requires either concealing or privately revealing the suppliers' quality, depending on the degree of heterogeneity in costs and qualities. Asymmetric revelation, if allowed, increases the buyer's expected utility when costs differences are large. Conversely social efficiency calls for public disclosure of qualities. Hence there is a trade-off between efficiency and rent extraction by which the buyer has incentive to withhold information that would benefit social welfare.","[Colucci, Domenico; Doni, Nicola; Valori, Vincenzo] Univ Florence, Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Doni, N (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Florence, Italy.",nicola.doni@unifi.it,"DONI, NICOLA/A-4999-2016","DONI, NICOLA/0000-0001-6480-6343; Valori, Vincenzo/0000-0002-8021-4185",Italian Ministry of the University [2008RHJCKP],"Italian Ministry of the University(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))",We acknowledge support from research project 2008RHJCKP on Mechanism Design and Auctions funded by the Italian Ministry of the University.

We here extend Galenson's formal statistical methods to a new sample of American artists born prior to 1900, a period when according to Galenson, most American artists can be identified as experimental. Specifically, we explore the use of quantitative and qualitative analysis to shed light on the relationship between age and artistic productivity. We investigate whether this classification has substantial explanatory power for the age at which the most important artistic work is achieved over the life cycle.

In periods of increasing profits, firms governed by historical relativism, the peak-end rule and overconfidence will opt for the status quo. In the following profit recession, actors become more alert, calculating and creative, favoring a transformation, especially if they fear that the survival of the firm is at stake. The theory of transformation pressure was tested by a within-subjects experiment where undergraduate students in macroeconomics acted as managers for an established company. The role play sheds light on the students' investment strategy choices and underlying psychological perceptions under varying profit conditions. The theory was only partly confirmed by the experiment. There are arguments in industrial economics, psychology and neuroscience for a qualified theory of transformation pressure.

This contributes to explaining why total employment in Mexico displays low cyclicality and variability over the business cycle when compared to Canada, a developed economy with a much smaller share of informal employment. To account for these empirical findings, we build a business cycle model of a small, open economy that incorporates formal and informal labor markets and calibrate it to Mexico. The model performs well in terms of matching conditional and unconditional moments in the data. It also sheds light into the channels through which informal economic activity may affect business cycles. Introducing informal employment into a standard model amplifies the effects of productivity shocks. This is linked to productivity shocks being imperfectly propagated from the formal to the informal sector. It also shows how imperfect measurement of informal economic activity in national accounts can translate into stronger variability in aggregate economic activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Exceptions to this pattern of two-sided selection are occupations with steeply rising (declining) productivity, where mainly the lower (higher) paid workers within this occupation tend to leave. The facts conflict with several existing theories that are used to account for endogeneity in occupational choice, but it is shown analytically that the patterns are explained consistently within a theory of vertical sorting under absolute advantage that includes learning about workers' abilities.","[Groes, Fane] Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Kircher, Philipp] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Manovskii, Iourii] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Copenhagen Business School; University of Edinburgh; University of Pennsylvania,"Groes, F (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark.",,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-0922406]; European Research Council [284119]; European Research Council (ERC) [284119] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1357903] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We would like to thank the editor and two anonymous referees for their comments and suggestions.

Generalized IRFs are widely used in threshold representations to illustrate and even test the presence of asymmetries (Potter, 1995; van Dijk et al., 2007). However, GIRF have known no comparable development in Markov-switching VAR. I show that whether IRF and GIRF recently developed in this framework impose sign and size symmetries or display poor properties. In this paper, I propose a new GIRF for general Markov-switching structural VAR with fixed transition probabilities. In a simulation framework inspired from Rubio-Ramirez et al. (2005), I relax the assumption of perfect knowledge of the regime and introduce the updating step proposed by Camacho and Perez-Quiros (2013). As a consequence, sign/size asymmetries can now be examined in MSIAH-VAR and the GIRF now incorporates the dependence on future shocks without extra complexity. Visited regimes can now differ endogenously between the shocked and baseline trajectories due to the initial and future shocks but the only exogenous difference in the simulated trajectories relies on the initial structural shock. I use this approach to implement a test for sign and size asymmetries on US aggregate gross job flows. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In previous research with Canadian university students, it was shown that the FTS was a psychometrically sound measure, associated with failing personal financial conditions, threat-related personality characteristics, and depreciated psychological health. The present investigation further examines the FTS in a diverse set of non-student European samples. Data were collected in four countries using a self-report questionnaire which included measures of ones' financial situation, personality, and psychological health. Results were highly similar to the findings of the previous study. The FTS is unidimensional, reliable, and its validity was supported by moderate statistical relations with variables such as job insecurity, self-esteem, and emotional exhaustion. Importantly, financial threat was higher in countries that fared poorly in the recent financial crisis than countries that fared well, and it mediated the relation between economic hardship and psychological well-being.

Driving faster also has external costs (pollution, adverse health impacts and injury to other drivers). This paper uses large-scale speed limit increases in the western United States in 1987 and 1996 to address three related questions. First, do the social benefits of raising speed limits exceed the social costs? Second, do the private benefits of driving faster exceed the private costs? Third, what is the optimal speed limit? I find that a 10 mph speed limit increase on highways leads to a 3-4 mph increase in travel speed, 9-15% more accidents, 34-60% more fatal accidents, and elevated pollutant concentrations of 14-24% (carbon monoxide), 8-15% (nitrogen oxides), 1-11% (ozone) and 9% higher fetal death rates around the affected freeways. Using these estimates, I find that the social costs of speed limit increases are two to seven times larger than the social benefits. In contrast, many individual drivers would enjoy a net private benefit from driving faster. Privately, a value of a statistical life (VSL) of $6.0 million or less justifies driving faster, but the social planner's VSL could be at most $0.9-$2.0 million to justify higher speed limits. I conclude that the optimal speed limit was lower, but not much lower, than 55 mph. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This concept of equilibrium is motivated by unspecifiable differences of economic agents and the presence of all kinds of micro shocks facing them. Our model mimics the empirically observed distribution of labor productivity. The distribution of productivity resulting from the matching of workers and firms depends crucially on aggregate demand. When aggregate demand rises, not only the unemployment rate declines, but more workers are employed by firms with higher productivity. The effect of the reservation wage on unemployment also depends on aggregate demand so that the distinction between cyclical and structural unemployment is ambiguous. The model, a general equilibrium model of monopolistic competition with friction and uncertainty provides a micro-foundation for Keynes' principle of effective demand.","Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Yoshikawa, H (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",yoshikawa@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,JSPS [24243027],"JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","This work is supported by the Grant-in Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) Grant Number 24243027 by JSPS.

This article examines the possibility that trade diversion occurred in that sector during the period 1991-2010, assuming that product costs fell as a result of market expansion. The analysis is based on the concepts of cost reduction and trade suppression coined by Corden (1972), which capture the effects of economies of scale. Indices of regional orientation and revealed comparative advantages are used in combination to assess whether the trade bloc is evolving in line with comparative advantages. The results suggest efficiency gains for automotive-sector products, exports of which from Brazil to MERCOSUR grew more vigorously because the expanded and relatively protected market made it possible to exploit the economies of scale that are characteristic of the automotive industry.","[Zago de Azevedo, Andre Filipe; Massuquetti, Angelica] Univ Vale do Rio dos Sinos UNISINOS, Postgrad Programme Econ, Sao Leopoldo, RS, Brazil",Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (Unisinos),"de Azevedo, AFZ (通讯作者)，Univ Vale do Rio dos Sinos UNISINOS, Postgrad Programme Econ, Sao Leopoldo, RS, Brazil.",aazevedo@unisinos.br; angelicam@unisinos.br,"Massuquetti, Angélica/GPX-8163-2022; de Azevedo, André Filipe Zago/A-1544-2017; Azevedo, André Filipe Zago de/GPX-8182-2022","de Azevedo, André Filipe Zago/0000-0002-2745-0381; Azevedo, André Filipe Zago de/0000-0002-2745-0381",,,,,20,0,0,0,5,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,APR,2015,,115,,,,,145,163,,,,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CO9NA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359501300008,0

Agents can adopt one technology or the other, under the influence of social interactions and network externalities. Sustainable transitions are addressed as a multiple equilibria problem. A pollution tax can trigger a sudden transition as a bifurcation event, at the expenses of large policy efforts. Alternatively, periodic dynamics can arise. Technological progress introduced in the form of endogenous learning curves stands as a fundamental factor of sustainable transitions. For this to work, the positive feedback of network externalities and social interaction should be reduced initially, for instance by promoting niche markets of clean technologies and making technological standards and infrastructure more open. Traditional policy channels such as pollution tax and feed-in-tariffs have an auxiliary - yet important - role in our model. Compared to feed-in-tariffs, a pollution tax promotes smoother and faster transitions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Similar to US studies, we find that a 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate of men is associated with a 13 % decline in the number of marriages formed per thousand single females each quarter. Unlike US studies, we do not find a significant relationship between unemployment rates and aggregate flows into divorce. Using stock measures of marital status and family type, we show that the importance of the business cycle varies substantially by age group. Among 25-44 year olds, there is a significant increase in single parents with children under 18 when unemployment rates rise. Among 35-54 year olds, there is a significant increase in those living alone. There is some evidence of elderly parents joining the households of 45-54 year olds and young adults (18-24) remaining with their single parents during recessions. Overall, the observed decline in marriages during recessions appears driven by a decline in remarriages rather than a decline in first marriages.","[Ariizumi, Hideki; Hu, Yaqin; Schirle, Tammy] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Schirle, T (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, 75 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",tschirle@wlu.ca,,,,,,,39,11,11,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

In economics this refers to household decisions being independent of who generates the income in the household; in economic psychology it refers to the management of household finances. Here, we consider the link between the two concepts using a Danish expenditure survey providing information on both notions and on the assignment of expenditures. More importantly, we investigate whether either type of pooling is related to the sharing of expenditures between the two partners, and whether there are different correlations between the income distribution and the sharing of expenditures among double-career couples and other couples. We find that in most households the income distribution is correlated with the sharing of consumption-the economic approach-and that this holds true even if the household pools its resources-the economic psychology approach, implying that there is no strong relationship between the two approaches.","[Bonke, Jens] Rockwool Fdn Res Unit, DK-1307 Copenhagen, Denmark",,"Bonke, J (通讯作者)，Rockwool Fdn Res Unit, Soelvgade 10, DK-1307 Copenhagen, Denmark.",jb@rff.dk,,,,,,,43,20,21,0,54,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Our results indicate that over-education and greater occupational segregation associated with the emergence of new graduate job profiles are important determinants of earnings inequality. Whilst our focus is on graduates' early careers, demonstrating that occupational assignment and selection into employment shape gender pay gaps amongst the highly skilled provides a more pessimistic view on the ability of educational expansion or equal pay legislation to significantly reduce gender pay inequality. Southern European economies are also particularly interesting to look at since there may be a greater degree of mismatch between the pace of higher education expansion and the changes in the job structure, making women particularly vulnerable to over-education.","[Figueiredo, Hugo] Univ Aveiro, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Figueiredo, Hugo; Rocha, Vera; Biscaia, Ricardo; Teixeira, Pedro] Ctr Res Higher Educ Policies, London, England; [Teixeira, Pedro] Univ Porto, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Rocha, Vera] Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Biscaia, Ricardo] Portucalense Univ Infante D Henrique, Oporto, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade do Porto; Copenhagen Business School; Universidade Portucalense Infante D.

Growth models incorporating both human and physical capital accumulation led to the conclusion that a high physical/human capital ratio can cause a lower economic growth in the long run, hence offering an explanation for the failure of socialist economies. In this paper, we show theoretically and empirically that according to the logic of the socialist planner, it was optimal to achieve a higher physical to human capital ratio in socialist countries than in the West. Using a VAR analysis, we find empirical confirmation that within the Material Product System of national accounting, the relative dominance of investment in physical capital accumulation relative to human capital was indeed more efficient than under the system of national accounts.","[Foldvari, Peter; van Leeuwen, Bas] Univ Utrecht, Dept Hist & Art Hist, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [van Leeuwen, Bas] Univ Utrecht, Int Inst Social Hist, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Utrecht University,"Földvári, P (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Hist & Art Hist, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",p.foldvari1@uu.nl; b.vanleeuwen1@gmail.com; didenko_d_v@veb.ru,"Foldvari, Peter/AAW-9861-2021; Didenko, Dmitry V./F-7793-2017","Foldvari, Peter/0000-0003-4557-8810; Didenko, Dmitry V./0000-0001-5295-2538; van Leeuwen, Bas/0000-0001-7817-5298",,,,,35,5,5,1,25,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

In this paper, we provide the first estimates of broad-scale welfare and distributional implications of this supply boom. We provide new estimates of supply and demand elasticities, which we use to estimate the drop in natural gas prices that is attributable to the supply expansion. We find large, positive welfare impacts for four broad sectors of gas consumption (residential, commercial, industrial, and electric power) and a negative impact for producers, with variation across regions. We then examine the evidence for a gas-led manufacturing renaissance and for pass-through to prices of products such as retail natural gas, retail electricity, and commodity chemicals. We conclude with a discussion of environmental externalities from unconventional natural gas, including limitations of the current regulatory environment. Overall, we find that between 2007 and 2013 the shale gas revolution led to an increase in welfare for natural gas consumers and producers of $48 billion per year, but more data are needed on the extent and valuation of the environmental impacts of shale gas production.","[Hausman, Catherine; Kellogg, Ryan] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Hausman, C (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,,78,49,77,0,18,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

We explore the robustness of this mechanism to the existence of price discrimination in the supply of goods to the public and private sectors. We then describe optimal monetary and fiscal policy in our New Keynesian economy subject to the additional externality of deep habits and explore the ability of simple policy rules to mimic fully optimal policy. We find that the presence of deep habits at empirically estimated levels can imply large externalities that significantly affect the conduct of monetary and tax policy. However, despite the rise in government spending multipliers implied by deep habits, government spending is barely used as a stabilisation tool under the optimal policy. (C) 2014 The Authors.

In Africa, taxation is an instrument that can be used to promote development. Like other countries, African governments have undertaken tax reforms aimed at increasing tax revenues, but at the same time reducing trade taxes and high marginal tax rates. Reforms include introducing broad-based consumption taxes, simplified tax design and improved tax administration. Emerging ideas include the 'optimal tax policy', which states that all taxation distorts market incentives, and reforms should be driven by the aim of minimising these distortions. A challenging aspect of a 'growth friendly' tax reform agenda would be how to ensure that increasing taxation does not erode the small existing tax base by inducing further distortions. The three papers in this special edition look at tax reform in relation to investment, to tax evasion and economic growth and also to the equity and efficiency trade-offs. Tax reforms are found to be successful inmodestly increasing GDP growth, while reducing poverty and inequality. These outcomes are driven by the positive impacts that expenditures on infrastructure, operations andmaintenance have on total factor productivity. Improved legal and regulatory frameworks, coupled with transparent and accountable institutions in Africa, and well-developed social welfare expenditure architecture capable of recycling revenues back to poor individuals will help improve tax collection and development. Without these features, the tax reform agenda would likely have almost no impact on the African economies.","[Mabugu, Ramos E.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Simbanegavi, Witness] AERC, Nairobi, Kenya",Stellenbosch University; African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),"Simbanegavi, W (通讯作者)，AERC, Nairobi, Kenya.",witness.simbanegavi@aercafrica.org,"Mabugu, Ramos Emmanuel/HPF-8840-2023","Mabugu, Ramos Emmanuel/0000-0001-8405-3051; Simbanegavi, Witness/0000-0003-3109-9528",,,,,24,0,0,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Indeed, it is well shown that at the low frequency, the coefficient associated to exchange rate volatility's effect on exports is greater than that at the high frequency and conversely when subtracting energy's share.

This can be complicated for consumers because making intertemporal evaluations may expose them to a variety of psychological biases such as present bias, projection bias, and salience effects. We investigate whether consumers are affected by such intertemporal biases when they purchase automobiles. Using data for more than 40 million vehicle transactions, we explore the impact of weather on purchasing decisions. We find that the choice to purchase a convertible or a four-wheel-drive is highly dependent on the weather at the time of purchase in a way that is inconsistent with classical utility theory. We consider a range of rational explanations for the empirical effects we find, but none can explain fully the effects we estimate.

Previous experiments lend support to this notion but they ignore realistic aspects of trading relationships such as informal agreements and ex-post renegotiation or revision. Here we show that the central behavioral mechanism underlying contractual reference points is robust to such considerations. Our data reveal that informal agreements can mitigate the trade-off between rigidity and flexibility but they do not fully resolve the problem of misaligned reference points. Our experiments also show that contract revision is a more nuanced process than the previous literature has recognized. We find, for example, that it is sometimes better for parties to write a simple (rigid) contract and then revise it ex post if needed, rather than to anticipate and include future contingencies in a (flexible) contract from the outset.","[Fehr, Ernst] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hart, Oliver] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Zehnder, Christian] Univ Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Zurich; Harvard University; University of Lausanne,"Fehr, E (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",ernst.fehr@econ.uzh.ch; ohart@harvard.edu; christian.zehnder@unil.ch,,"Zehnder, Christian/0000-0001-6199-4975",,,,,24,32,38,0,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

Such effects are often referred to as FDI externalities or spillover effects. In addition, the paper examines whether such spillover effects depend on the home country's income level. Our empirical findings indicate that FDI flows have positive effects on less developed countries (South countries), and that the effect of FDI flows from the developed countries (North countries) is stronger than that from less developed countries. That is, these results confirm the so-called North-South effects but provide no evidence of South-South effects. Furthermore, another channel of spillover effects is imports, which have significant effects on TFP. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Researchers have attributed this rising inequality within the industrial wage structure to: (i) increasingly competitive labour markets leading to better matches between worker pay, worker skills and employer demands; or (ii) residual government control in some industrial sectors that has generated high wages through monopoly rent sharing. We argue that the rise in China's industrial wage dispersion is primarily attributable to increasingly competitive labour markets, which have led to greater returns to schooling and to efficient redistribution of workers across major industry groups. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that the level or changes in government monopoly power has had negligible impact on China's rising industrial wage dispersion.","[Kwon, Ohyun] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI USA; [Chang, Simon] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fleisher, Belton M.] Ohio State Univ, Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Fleisher, Belton M.] IZA, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Central University of Finance & Economics; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Fleisher, BM (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, 1945 N High St Room 410, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",fleisher.1@osu.edu,,"Chang, Simon/0000-0002-2918-956X",,,,,49,5,5,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

The data used in the paper are a sample of individual loans generated on Prosper, a large US online lending market. The out of sample predictions and the model specification test suggest a misspecification of the Probit model due to the violation of the normality assumption. Estimation results suggest that a borrower's past financial credit score is a reasonably good indicator of one's loan performance. In general, the higher one's credit score ranking, the lower the probability that one would default. One exceptional finding is that a borrower with score ranking B is less likely to default than a borrower with score ranking A. Such a finding suggests that individuals who are in the middle range of credit grades may be more financially credit-dependent than those with higher rankings. As a result, they are more willing to keep their loans in good standings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

When a cost-based access charge is imposed on an incumbent, the incumbent has a weak incentive to invest in infrastructure upgrades due to insufficient rewards for the investment. Then, the incumbent's underinvestment induces the overuse of a bypass by an entrant that chooses productively efficient technology, when the degree of spillover is large, the production cost of the bypass is low, and the incumbent's investment cost is high. The overuse of a bypass decreases the incumbent's profits, which further reduces the incumbent's incentive for investment. Thus, the overuse of a bypass generates a vicious cycle of underinvestment in infrastructure upgrades.","[Mizuno, Keizo] Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Business Adm, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan; [Yoshino, Ichiro] Nagoya Univ Commerce & Business Adm, Sch Econ, Nisshin, Aichi 4700193, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University; Nagoya University of Commerce & Business,"Mizuno, K (通讯作者)，Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Business Adm, 1-1-155 Uegahara, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan.",kmizuno@kwansei.ac.jp,"Ichiro, Yoshino/HCH-1137-2022",,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25245031, 24530285, 25285077] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,38,0,0,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The identification strategy relies on the fact that the primary purpose of Russian colonization was to protect the country's access to warm-water ports. Therefore, settlement varied depending on the proximity to the Black Sea coast. Instrumenting the share of settlers by the distance to the coast, I show the positive impact of settlement on literacy among the indigenous population with long-term effects on income, educational attainment and the quality of local governance. To insure the validity of the instrument, I conduct a placebo test that shows that distance to the coast does not predict literacy and income in the South Caucasus, where Russians had no strategic interest in protecting the coastline. The mechanisms of influence include administrative integration, school building policies and social structure. (C) 2014 Association for Comparative Economic Studies. Published by Elsevier Inc.

These impacts have been examined at aggregated level for world representative sample as well as for the sample disaggregated by the development level of the countries. We have estimated static panel using fixed effects model and dynamic panel using system GMM. The empirical analysis confirms a positive relationship between institutions and economic growth. The positive impact of control over corruption, qualitative and effective bureaucracy and desirable law and order situation on economic growth is greater in high income countries as compared to low income countries. The impact of investment profile is more growth enhancing in developing countries in contrast to developed economies. The crux of the analysis is that the institutions are indeed important in determining the long-run economic growth. It is also established that institutions play a greater role in determining growth in developed economies relative to developing economies. The implication of this finding is that different countries require different sets of institutions for ensuring long-term economic growth. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In doing so, we study the differences in the theatre elasticity of box-office revenues between distributors, once the other determinants of movie box-office revenues and unobserved film characteristics have been controlled for. The empirical exercise involves estimating a panel for the weekly box-office revenue in the US motion picture market during the 2002-2009 period. Given the dynamic nature of our data and the endogeneity problems that some of the independent variables may present due to the presence of unobserved individual effects of movies, we use the Hausman-Taylor estimator. Regarding theatre allocation, we find evidence of similar, but not homogeneous, behaviour among the so-called Majors, which, in turn, differs from that observed for non-Majors regarding theatre allocation to films. These differences are greater when we consider a selection of more successful movies that are exhibited for a longer run, maybe due to the rise in the amount of uncertainty for this sample. Our results provide indirect evidence of the differences in the market power of distributors.","[Prieto-Rodriguez, Juan; Gutierrez-Navratil, Fernanda] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Oviedo, Spain; [Ateca-Amestoy, Victoria] Univ Pais Vasco Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, Dept Econ Anal 2, Bilbao, Spain",University of Oviedo; University of Basque Country,"Prieto-Rodriguez, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Avda Cristo S-N, Oviedo, Spain.",juanprieto@uniovi.es; gutierrezluisa@uniovi.es; victoriamaria.ateca@ehu.es,"Prieto-Rodriguez, Juan/C-7766-2013; ATECA-AMESTOY, VICTORIA/B-3292-2011; Gutierrez-Navratil, Fernanda/I-2619-2015","Prieto-Rodriguez, Juan/0000-0001-9163-3011; ATECA-AMESTOY, VICTORIA/0000-0002-5648-4863; Gutierrez-Navratil, Fernanda/0000-0001-9465-4563",,,,,36,9,10,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Additionally, it appears that females have larger labour supply elasticity than males (it should be noted that male labour supply elasticity becomes even more insignificant when we use robust standard errors). Our results are consistent with the similar findings in USA, Africa, UK and Poland, however, they cannot be generalised for larger companies, since the nature of ISH testing largely depends on the size of the company and its decision-making processes.

This approach differs from others in its emphasis on the use of macroprudential policy measures rather than capital flow measures for improving domestic financial stability in the face of volatile capital flows.","[Akcelik, Yasin] JPMorgan Chase Bank, Credit Risk Modeling Dept, Columbus, OH USA; [Akcelik, Yasin; Basci, Erdem; Ermisoglu, Ergun] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Ankara, Turkey; [Ermisoglu, Ergun] Turkish Court Accounts, Balgat Cankaya Ankara, Turkey; [Oduncu, Arif] US Congress Budget Off, Project & Modeling Unit, Washington, DC USA; [Oduncu, Arif] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Oduncu, Arif] Cent Bank Turkey, Ankara, Turkey",JP Morgan Chase & Company; Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey; Congressional Budget Office; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Prime Ministry Turkey; Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Ermisoglu, E (通讯作者)，Yildirim Beyazit Univ, Banking & Finance, Ankara, Turkey.",,"Başçı, Erdem/AAZ-8500-2021",,,,,,37,2,2,0,5,PALGRAVE,BASINGSTOKE,"HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-137-42768-7; 978-1-137-42766-3,INT ECON ASSOC SERIE,,,2015,154,,,,,,31,54,,10.1057/9781137427687.0007,0.0,,,24,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF4AA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380610700003,0

Departing from the elements of the Czech National Bank's current g3 forecasting model (Andrle,Hledik,Kamenik, and Week, 2009), we introduce a comprehensive fiscal sector incorporating a number of modeling features that are often neglected in the mainstream DSGE literature, e.g. allowing government consumption and government capital to be productive. Furthermore, we extend our fiscal model to include unemployment in a way proposed by Gall, Lopez-Salida and Valles (2007). Crucial fiscal parameters, related mainly to the specified fiscal rule, are estimated using Bayesian techniques. The model is then used to calculate a set of fiscal multipliers for individual revenue and expenditure items of the government budget We find that the largest real GDP fiscal multipliers in the first year are associated with government consumption (0.6), social security contributions paid by employers (0.6), and government investment (0.5).

The exemption from automatic stay has been one of the key contributors to the development of the repo market as a major source of funding for many financial market participants. At the same time the exemption has raised concerns that the default of a large institution could cause externalities on other markets, in the form of fire sales. We find that exempting repos from the automatic stay may increase the size of the repo market by enhancing the liquidity of collateral, but it can cause fire sales that are associated with reductions in real investment. Hence, policy makers face a trade-off between the benefits of investment activity and the benefits of liquid repo markets.

Based on monthly data for 10 European countries over the period 1995-2012, our analysis reveals the following empirical regularities. First, the tourism-economic growth relationship is not stable over time in terms of both magnitude and direction, indicating that the tourism-led economic growth (TLEG) and the economic-driven tourism growth (EDTG) hypotheses are time-dependent. Second, the aforementioned relationship is also highly economic event-dependent, as it is influenced by the Great Recession of 2007 and the ongoing Eurozone debt crisis that began in 2010. Finally, the impact of these economic events is more pronounced in Cyprus, Greece, Portugal and Spain, which are the European countries that have witnessed the greatest economic downturn since 2009.

The effects of asset purchases depend on the way that they affect collateral constraints. We show that under some circumstances, central bank purchases relax financial constraints, increase aggregate demand, and may even achieve a Pareto improvement; but in other cases, they tighten financial constraints, reduce aggregate demand, and lower welfare.

Doyne",,,The dynamics of the leverage cycle,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Leverage cycles; Pro-cyclical and countercyclical leverage; Systemic risk; Financial market simulation,,"We present a simple agent-based model of a financial system composed of leveraged investors such as banks that invest in stocks and manage their risk using a Value-at-Risk constraint, based on historical observations of asset prices. The Value-at-Risk constraint implies that when perceived risk is low, leverage is high and vice versa; a phenomenon that has been dubbed pro-cyclical leverage. We show that this leads to endogenous irregular oscillations, in which gradual increases in stock prices and leverage are followed by drastic market collapses, i.e. a leverage cycle. This phenomenon is studied using simplified models that give a deeper understanding of the dynamics and the nature of the feedback loops and instabilities underlying the leverage cycle. We introduce a flexible leverage regulation policy in which it is possible to continuously tune from pro-cyclical to countercyclical leverage. When the policy is sufficiently countercyclical and bank risk is sufficiently low the endogenous oscillation disappears and prices go to a fixed point. While there is always a leverage ceiling above which the dynamics are unstable, countercyclical leverage policies can be used to raise the ceiling. We also study the impact on leverage cycles of direct, temporal control of the bank's riskiness via the bank's required Value-at-Risk quantile. Under such a rule the regulator relaxes the Value-at-Risk quantile following a negative stock price shock and tightens it following a positive shock. While such a policy rule can reduce the amplitude of leverage cycles, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the choice of parameters. Finally, we investigate fixed limits on leverage and show how they can control the leverage cycle. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Aymanns, Christoph; Farmer, J.

The concept of B2B brand equity is one of the most intriguing concepts connected to B2B brands. Although there have been some attempts to conceptualise and measure B2B brand equity in the literature, in practice no consensus about the concept has been reached so far. Unlike previous studies, this study examines the applicability of Keller's brand equity model in a specific industry and market - the B2B chemical market. For that purpose, a series of semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with buyers of specific industrial chemical products in the South and Eastern European B2B chemical market. The results show that the Keller's brand equity model can be applicable in the B2B chemical market, however, the six brand building blocks - salience, performance, imagery, judgements, feelings and resonance - as well as subdimensions that assemble the blocks, need arrangements in different ways in order to meet the logic of the B2B marketing philosophy. As a result, the respondents perceive corporate brands to be more important than product brands. They also point to the significance of the relationship with sales representatives in building brand equity. At the top block of the pyramid respondents set partnership relations, and cooperation in developing solutions oriented towards improvement of customers' production processes.","[Coric, Dubravka Sincic] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Jelic, Domagoj] Dow Europe GmbH, Representat Off Zagreb, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Dow Chemical Company,"Coric, DS (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Kennedyev Trg 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",dsincic@efzg.hr,"Ćorić, Dubravka Sinčić/H-9929-2018","Ćorić, Dubravka Sinčić/0000-0002-1834-5491",,,,,28,5,5,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Devastating impacts in African and other developing countries have often been attributed to the failure of formal (state and market) institutions for risk management, frequent in these countries. While the predominance of informal response mechanisms has been acknowledged in these countries, they are presumed to disintegrate in the face of covariate shocks. This article argues that an overly ambitious emphasis on states and markets and a negligence of the role of informal, socially embedded institutions in the effective management of natural disasters is grossly responsible for the negative effects of natural disasters and their perverse implications on Africa's development. A multi-sector framework that can be used for modelling natural disaster management in Africa which has the potential of reducing the negative consequences of disasters is suggested. This is based on the premise that natural shocks must be perceived as social phenomena that are best managed with the participation of those involved. Empirical evidence is included, and the implications of a multi-stakeholder approach to managing disasters to enhance development in Africa are discussed.","[Edoun, Emmanuel Innocents; Mbohwa, Charles] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Qual & Operat Management, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Balgah, Roland Azibo] Univ Bamenda, Dept Sci, Bamenda, Cameroon",University of Johannesburg,"Balgah, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Bamenda, Dept Sci, Bamenda, Cameroon.",balgazib@yahoo.com,"Mbohwa, Charles/JNR-1017-2023; Mbohwa, Charles/HHM-3522-2022; Balgah, Roland Azibo/AGT-9655-2022","Balgah, Roland Azibo/0000-0002-6117-2282; Mbohwa, Charles/0000-0002-8268-5984",,,,,40,3,3,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The study also examines the relationship between these capacities and the level of export commitment using structural equation techniques. The study is based on a sample of 128 internationallydiversified SMEs from the Spanish region of La Rioja. Using different modelling techniques, the results of the study confirm the existence of a significant relationship between different SME resources and the export policies of SMEs. Specifically, we find that the size of a company, the extent of its coverage of the domestic market, its international experience, having growth as a business objective, its commitment to technological activities, and the international experience of its managers all have a positive effect on its international commitment. Finally, we consider some of the potential implications of the results obtained in this study in both research and business practice.","[Fernandez-Ortiz, Ruben] Univ La Rioja, Logrono 26004, Spain; [Arteaga Ortiz, Jesus] Univ Los Palmas Gran Canaria, Los Palmas De Gran Canar 35017, Spain; [Clavel San Emeterio, Monica] Int Univ La Rioja, Logrono 26002, Spain",Universidad de La Rioja; Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR),"Fernandez-Ortiz, R (通讯作者)，Univ La Rioja, Logrono 26004, Spain.",ruben.fernandez@unirioja.es; jarteaga@dede.ulpgc.es; mclavel.se@gmail.com,"Fernández, Rubén/AAA-4521-2019; SAN EMETERIO, MONICA CLAVEL/AAA-4518-2019","SAN EMETERIO, MONICA CLAVEL/0000-0003-2478-0198; /0000-0002-6908-0657",,,,,69,4,6,2,45,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Whether, and to what extent, gender differences in attitudes toward competition lead to differences in naturally occurring labour markets remains an open question. To examine this, we run a natural field experiment on job-entry decisions where we randomize almost 9000 job-seekers into different compensation regimes. By varying the role that individual competition plays in setting the wage and the gender composition, we examine whether a competitive compensation regime, by itself, can cause differential job entry. The data highlight the power of the compensation regime in that women disproportionately shy away from competitive work settings. Yet, there are important factors that attenuate the gender differences, including whether the job is performed in teams, whether the position has overt gender associations, and the age of the job-seekers. We also find that the effect is most pronounced in labour markets with attractive alternative employment options. Furthermore, our results suggest that preferences over uncertainty can be just as important as preferences over competition per se in driving job-entry choices.","[Flory, Jeffrey A.] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Leibbrandt, Andreas; List, John A.] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [List, John A.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont McKenna College; Monash University; University of Chicago,"Flory, JA (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",,,"Flory, Jeffrey/0000-0001-9377-1303; Leibbrandt, Andreas/0000-0003-2126-3232",,,,,59,172,203,5,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In addition to meter rates, the determinants of demand include personal income, gasoline prices and the price of a substitute good, parking garage spaces. Because international bridges connect downtown El Paso to neighbouring Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico, the impacts of transboundary traffic flows, bridge tolls and other cross-border economic variables are also included as potential determinants of metered parking demand.

We show that this individual approach is important, as the possible effects for different types of individuals may differ from other estimates in the literature, based on aggregate or firm-level data, hence complementing them. Our main finding is that older people experienced the largest increase in the probability of losing their job, when compared with other age groups, including young people. The intuition is simple: among the affected (low-productivity) workers, young people are expected to increase their productivity more than older ones, who are in the flat part of their life-cycle productivity curve. Consequently, an employer facing a uniform increase in the minimum wage may find it profitable to retain young employees and to fire older ones.","[Galan, Sofia; Puente, Sergio] Banco Espana, Madrid 28014, Spain",Banco de Espana,"Puente, S (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain.",sofia.galan@bde.es; sergio.puente@bde.es,,,,,,,18,5,5,0,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

However, the majority of the investors do not integrate conflict hazards with financial risks in this environment. Accordingly, the best way to select the right market for profitable investments requires the evaluation of bipolar risks covering conflict risk and financial risk using multi-criteria decision-making approaches. The aim of the paper is to discover the comparative performance of emerging markets based on the bipolar risks of the capital markets using hybrid multi-criteria decision analysis methods in economics. Fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS ( FAHP) and Fuzzy AHP-VIKOR methods were used to analyze the financial and conflict risk-based performance levels of selected emerging economies. The seven determinants in this model have been derived from the Advanced and Emerging Market Financial Stress Index and Conflict risk index. The findings demonstrate that the comprehensive performance results of the emerging markets vary based on the competencies of the bipolar risks. The two methods, with different steps for ordering the alternatives, had the same performance results in ranking the emerging economies. The overall performance of each method demonstrates that both methods give coherent results in ranking the E7 economies under the fuzzy environment. The originality of the study is that the FAHP gives more sensitive results than classic AHP method in evaluating the alternatives under a fuzzy environment. In addition, a comparative analysis was applied to evaluate the bipolar risk-based performance results using a hybrid approach under the fuzzy environment.","[Hacioglu, Umit; Dincer, Hasan] Istanbul Medipol Univ, TR-34810 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Medipol University,"Hacioglu, U (通讯作者)，Istanbul Medipol Univ, TR-34810 Istanbul, Turkey.",umithcl@gmail.com; dincerhasan1982@yahoo.com,"Yüksel, Serhat/W-1689-2017; Hacioglu, Umit/ABE-4247-2020; Dincer, Hasan/GPX-1316-2022; Hacioglu, Umit/O-4311-2015","Yüksel, Serhat/0000-0002-9858-1266; Dincer, Hasan/0000-0002-8072-031X; Hacioglu, Umit/0000-0002-0068-0048",,,,,89,14,16,1,45,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In addition, firm entry, growth, and survival dynamics can be tracked in terms of organic changes instead of changes associated with mergers and acquisitions or other forms of business ownership changes.

To assess the stance of public spending policies we use the indicators developed in Hauptmeier et al. (2011). Our results indicate that the overall expansionary expenditure stance in 1999-2009 was mainly driven by public consumption. Transfers and subsidies on the other hand were mostly expansionary after 2008 while public investment had boomed just before the crisis and turned restrictive during the crisis. The overall policy stance turned restrictive in 2010 and strongly so in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain. Most consolidation efforts focussed on public investment and on public consumption and while transfers and subsidies were largely spared. Our econometric analysis, which covers the 2000-2013 period, shows a significantly pro-cyclical stance of public consumption which was driving overall spending dynamics. The degree of spending expansion tends to be negatively affected by the size of government debt and the presence of effective fiscal rules. On the other hand, EMU-related interest savings coincided with an expansionary expenditure stance. Revenue windfalls and shortfalls exerted a significant effect on government investment spending.","[Hauptmeier, Sebastian] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Jesus Sanchez-Fuentes, A.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Jesus Sanchez-Fuentes, A.] GEN, Frankfurt, Germany; [Schuknecht, Ludger] German Minist Finance, Berlin, Germany",European Central Bank; Complutense University of Madrid,"Sánchez-Fuentes, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",ajsanchezfuentes@ucm.es,"SANCHEZ-FUENTES, A.

This study shows the need to implement strategic measures for boosting industrial sectors, particularly now when there is a resurgence of industrial policy.","[Hintzmann, Carolina] Univ Oberta Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain",UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya,"Hintzmann, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oberta Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Hintzmann, Carolina/E-3693-2019","Hintzmann, Carolina/0000-0003-0707-6115",,,,,58,2,2,0,11,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2015,,212,,,,,97,127,,10.7866/HPE-RPE15.1.4,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DE1ME,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370390300004,0

However, the standard CDO pricing model not only underestimates the risk to the asset pool due to a poor description of the correlation structure among obligors but is also incapable of reflecting the impacts of interdependent markets, credit risks and systematic sudden shocks on the asset pool. This paper studies the joint impact of interrelated market and credit risk factors on the key inputs of CDO pricing (default probability, default correlation and default loss rate) under the framework of factor copula CDO pricing model and constructs a risk-integrated model for CDO pricing. In addition, we extend the static integrated model to a dynamic version by allowing the risk factors driven by the copula-GARCH process. The simulation results show that, compared with an integrated model, the premium of senior tranches is significantly lower under the standard model. Such difference is mainly due to different assumptions of the distributions of risk-driving factor.","[Hu, Conghui] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Business, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xun] Shanghai Finance Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xun] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, CCER, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Gao, Qiuming] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics; Peking University; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Zhang, X (通讯作者)，Shanghai Finance Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",zhangxun@pku.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Xun/0000-0002-1991-4975; Hu, Conghui/0000-0001-5866-107X",,,,,24,2,3,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The method of generative listening is described as a listening from the emerging field of future possibility and transformative conversation. It can be seen as the ability to generate or transform one's own understanding and furthermore it can generate a new space of instructional activities. This type of listening moves beyond the current field and connects us to an even deeper realm of emergence. Peet et al describe it is a process of storytelling, listening, dialogue, and documentation that helps to identify and document the tacit knowledge embedded within key learning experiences. By having students generatively listen to one another, they learn how to surface, identify, and document their own and each other's' tacit capacities, strengths, and skills (Peet et al 2011). A very similar approach, the method of generative knowledge interviewing can be seen as a method of tacit knowledge retrieval, validation and sharing. Roughly speaking, classical learning theories argue that we learn from our past experience and adapt accordingly to cope with the future. Besides the classical theories several authors are proposing a second source of learning, thus a second source for knowledge creation: Learning from the (emerging) future (Greenleaf1977, Jaworski1998, Senge2005, Scharmer2013). Learning from the future signifies a heightened state of attention that allows individuals and groups to operate from a future space of possibility, in which they drop the non-essential aspects of the self and open themselves to new aspects of their highest future possible future self. It is an approach that builds on sensing, presencing and prototyping emerging opportunities. Our paper will be structured in three main parts. First, we will describe the two concepts laying a strong focus on the aspect of knowledge creation and building intellectual capital. Second we will shortly introduce Bewextra (Kaiser et al. 2014) which is a methodology and framework we have developed in the last two years and which uses the concept of generative listening as well as learning from the future. Finally we will present the most important outcomes of two case studies - one with pupils in an Austrian school and another one with Austrian bakers - where we have practically applied Bewextra and point out the potential for building intellectual capital by generative listening and learning from the future.","[Kaiser, Alexander; Kragulj, Florian] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Kaiser, A (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria.",alexander.kaiser@wu.ac.at; florian.kragulj@wu.ac.at,"Kragulj, Florian/Z-5577-2019; Kragulj, Florian/IAN-9013-2023","Kragulj, Florian/0000-0002-3849-7978; Kragulj, Florian/0000-0002-3849-7978",,,,,35,1,1,0,2,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,165,172,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600020,0

We provide experimental evidence of the reputational incentives of self-regulatory organizations (SROs) to publicly disclose versus cover-up fraud in an incomplete information environment. We find that observed behaviour is generally consistent with Bayesian equilibrium when subjects are informed about the relative likelihood of fraud detection by a vigilant' versus a lax' SRO type. In particular, a fraud disclosure equilibrium is supported when subjects are informed that the vigilant' SRO is more likely to detect fraud; otherwise, a cover-up equilibrium is supported. However, when subjects are not informed about the relative likelihood of fraud detection by the SRO types (as expected in real SR situations), no equilibrium is strongly supported. Our results suggest that in practice, the reputation-based incentives for effective SR may be inherently ambiguous and weak.","[Luis Lima, Jose; Nunez, Javier] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Luis Lima, Jose] Univ Chile, Intelis, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile,"Núñez, J (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.",jnunez@fen.uchile.cl,,"Lima Reina, Jose Luis/0000-0002-6856-5089",FONDECYT-Chile [1030812],FONDECYT-Chile(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),This work was supported by FONDECYT-Chile [project 1030812].,,31,4,4,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

During this period, constituency boundaries in India remained fixed. As a result, differences in population size between constituencies increased, thus changing the value of a single vote. Using this large variation in population size and informative data, this article carefully distinguishes the effect of population size from other factors. We find that an increase of one million electorates decreases voter turnout by 12-27%. In addition, we find that the share of votes gained by national political parties is greater in small-population constituencies. This suggests that political parties direct their efforts in electoral campaigns preferentially to less populous constituencies; as a result, voters in small constituencies are more likely to participate in elections.","[Mori, Yuko] Hitotsubashi Univ, Japan Soc Promot Sci, Inst Econ Res, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868603, Japan",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Hitotsubashi University,"Mori, Y (通讯作者)，Ryutsu Keizai Univ, Dept Econ, Ryugasaki, Ibaraki 3010844, Japan.",mori@rku.ac.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [246375]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [12J06375] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows [grant number 246375].,,27,0,0,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Offshoring is measured by an increase in the share of foreign to total intermediate inputs at the plant-level. We identify a positive productivity effect and isolate a negative downsizing effect from offshoring on employment, by exploiting differences between offshoring plants that do and do not simultaneously restructure. Furthermore, we cannot find evidence of negative indirect employment effects on domestic suppliers or competitors.

Although the restart effect is a well-known empirical regularity little research has been conducted regarding its causes. However, other scholars have noted that some kind of revision takes place during the stoppage that promotes cooperation. This research posits that certain common knowledge about when the stoppage occurs creates a coordination moment where group members simultaneously engage in revision and attempt to re-coordinate on a higher contribution level. Following Schelling's description that such coordination comes from focal points that are both prominent and conspicuous I design a VCM experiment that reproduces the standard restart result and then compares those sessions to sessions where the exact pattern of stoppages is unknown. I find that this subtle manipulation of ambiguity (over the when stoppages will happen) eliminates the restart effect.

The model introduces personal income distribution that supplements conventional concerns with functional income distribution. Endogenously generated changes in personal income distribution can generate endogenous shifts from profit-led to wage-led regimes and vice versa. A three-class economy generates richer patterns of class conflict because the middle class has shared interests and conflicts with both capitalists and workers.

We found that ERPT decreases with a decline in the inflation level, variability and persistence, thus supplementing findings previously acquired in panel studies across countries. Our findings can be explained by surging empirical evidence on state contingent behavior of pricing, which indicates a sharp increase in the frequency of price adjustment as one moves from moderate, via high to hyperinflation, suggesting that the degree of price rigidities is a key determinant of the size and speed of ERPT. ERPT estimates are embedded in careful analysis of inflation episodes in Serbia, showing that hyper and high inflation episodes subscribe to the same, fiscal explanation, as opposed to the moderate inflation ones, where supply and demand shocks have been the main inflation drivers.","[Petrovic, Pavle; Mladenovic, Zorica] Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ Belgrade, Belgrade 11001, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Petrovic, P (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ Belgrade, Belgrade 11001, Serbia.",pavle_petrovic@ekof.bg.ac.rs; zorima@eunet.rs,"Mladenovic, Zorica/AAY-8964-2020; Petrović, Pavle/ITU-7771-2023","Petrović, Pavle/0009-0004-5910-4178; Mladenovic, Zorica/0000-0003-1579-4205",,,,,30,2,2,0,9,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2015,62,4,,,,,409,427,,10.2298/PAN1504409P,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CT3GX,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362696300001,0

Our findings indicate that, in terms of variance reduction, the static models (OLS and VEC/VAR) are found to be the best hedging strategies.

We thus provide valuable directions for competition agencies when considering the joint ownership in vertically differentiated markets.","[Tarola, Ornella] Univ Roma La Sapienza, DISSE, Rome, Italy; [Vergari, Cecilia] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Bologna,"Tarola, O (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, DISSE, Rome, Italy.",,,"VERGARI, CECILIA/0000-0003-4585-984X",,,,,19,2,2,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

Using US data, we show this conclusion is more nuanced when considering an economy that has different potential states. We investigate regime-switching models which use the National Bureau of Economic Research US business cycle expansion and contraction data to create an indicator series that distinguishes bad and good economic times and use this series to investigate impulse responses and variance decompositions. We show the connection between consumer confidence to some types of consumer purchases is important during good economic times, but is relatively unimportant during bad economic times. We also use this type of model to in-vestigate the connection between news and consumer confidence and this connection is also shown to be state dependent. In the context of the animal spirits versus news debate, our findings show that during economic expansions, consumer confidence shocks likely reflect news, while during economic contractions, consumer confidence shocks are consistent with animal spirits. These findings also have important implications for recent policy debates which consider whether confidence boosting policies, like raising inflation expectations on big-ticket items such as automobiles or business equipment, would lead to a faster recovery.

In asymmetric environments, one team has a greater probability of winning given the same contribution level (unfair contests) or has a lower cost of contributing (uneven contests). We explore how such asymmetries impact behavior, asking how being advantaged or disadvantaged influences contributions. We find both advantaged and disadvantaged teams contribute much more than theory predicts, but in such a way that ex-post winning probabilities of the contests are consistent with theoretical predictions. At the individual level, contributions are predicted by beliefs about own team and opponent team contributions. The determinants of contribution by members of the disadvantaged team differ depending on the nature of asymmetry. Contributions by the disadvantaged team members are responsive to beliefs about contribution by opponents in unfair contests while in uneven contests they are responsive to beliefs about the contribution by teammates.

First, we propose a novel characterization of financial fragility that is not necessarily linked to indebtedness, distinguishes between expected and unexpected expenses, takes portfolio composition into account, and is free of subjectivity bias. Second, we use it to assess the importance of household portfolio composition for determining the difficulties related to coping with unexpected expenditures, besides socio-economic and demographic factors. Third, we test its ability to forecast future conditions of financial distress. The empirical analysis is based on the Bank of Italy Survey on Household Income and Wealth. The results highlight the relevance of portfolio choices as determinants of financial distress, that is, they provide evidence that homeownership increases the likelihood of financial fragility while the presence of a mortgage decreases it.

Outcomes for total payrolls and salary disparities differ substantially from prior seasons.

Secondly, we modify procedural fairness in a dynamic-i.e. over several repetitions of a game-as well as in a static-i.e. within a single game-sense. Thirdly, we analyse whether assigning individuals a minimal chance of achieving an advantaged position is enough to make them willing to accept substantially more inequality. We find that procedural fairness matters under all of these accounts. Individuals clearly respond to the degree of fairness in assigning initial roles, appraise contexts that are dynamically fair more positively than contexts that are not, and are generally more willing to accept unequal outcomes when they are granted a minimal opportunity to acquire the advantaged position. Unexpectedly, granting full equality of opportunity does not lead to the highest efficiency.","[Grimalda, Gianluca] Univ Jaume I Castello, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Grimalda, Gianluca] Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Grimalda, Gianluca] Univ Duisburg Essen, Ctr Study Global Cooperat Res, Essen, Germany; [Kar, Anirban] Univ Delhi, Delhi Sch Econ, New Delhi, India; [Proto, Eugenio] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Proto, Eugenio] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Proto, Eugenio] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Universitat Jaume I; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Duisburg Essen; University of Delhi; Delhi School of Economics; University of Warwick; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ifo Institut,"Grimalda, G (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume I Castello, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.;Grimalda, G (通讯作者)，Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.;Grimalda, G (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Ctr Study Global Cooperat Res, Essen, Germany.",grimalda@uji.es; e.proto@warwick.ac.uk,"; Grimalda, Gianluca/C-6441-2015","Proto, Eugenio/0000-0001-7766-6503; Grimalda, Gianluca/0000-0002-5605-5591",University of Warwick RDF grant [RD0616]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO 2011-23634]; Bancaixa [P1. 1A2010-17]; Junta de Andalucia [P07-SEJ-03155]; Generalitat Valenciana [GV/2012/045]; ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish,University of Warwick RDF grant; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Bancaixa; Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia); Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank Iwan Barankay, Dirk Engelmann, Enrique Fatas, Peter Hammond, Andrew Oswald, Elke Renner, Blanca Rodriguez, Tim Salmon, Stefan Traub for useful discussion, as well as participants in the Workshop on 'Procedural fairness-theory and evidence', Max Planck Institute for Economics (Jena), the 2008 IMEBE conference, the 2008 European ESA conference, the 2010 Seminar on 'Reason and Fairness', Granada, and seminar participants at Nottingham, Royal Holloway, Trento, Warwick.

But does resource abundance also lead to resource inefficiency? And if so, what can contribute to better usage of a country's resources for development? This paper examines 130 countries from 1970 to 2011, both resource-abundant and resource-scarce, and concludes that, on average, resource-abundant countries utilize resources less efficiently. Examining the institutional factors that may explain this disparity in usage, we find that several key institutions are necessary for increasing resource use efficiency, with private property showing the largest economic and statistical significance. By improving basic institutions, resource-rich countries can thus see more environmentally sustainable growth. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It analyses the redistributive effects of meal allowances on various income deciles providing rough estimates of the impact of meal allowance tax exemption on the government budget and simulating several scenarios for the replacement of the current meal allowance scheme with flat meal allowances. We estimate that meal allowance tax relief represents a direct burden of around 11.3 billion Czech korunas for the state budget, although this approximation does not take indirect effects into account and could thus be an overestimate. We provide evidence which suggests that the current form of meal allowances widens the income gap between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, within as well as across the income deciles. Affluent households receive meal allowances more frequently, and, moreover, the allowances they receive are both nominally and proportionately higher. According to our simulation using a constant budget of the size of our rough estimate replacing the current meal allowance scheme with a flat meal allowance system would promote income equality. Such a change would benefit the lower deciles, due to a higher share of individuals in these deciles being entitled to meal allowances, while the upper decile households would see a decline in their meal allowances.","[Jansky, Petr; Rohryova, Lenka] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Fac Social Sci, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Jansky, P (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Fac Social Sci, Prague, Czech Republic.",jansky.peta@gmail.com; lenkarohryova@gmail.com,"Jansky, Petr/H-4782-2014","Jansky, Petr/0000-0001-6499-9923",Technology Agency of the Czech Republic [TACR TD020188],Technology Agency of the Czech Republic,We would like to thank the Czech Statistical Office and CERGE-EI for the data and we are grateful to Libor Dusek for his comments and ideas on an earlier version of this paper.

The analysis focuses on wind because as compared with other modern renewable energy sources, wind is the only renewable energy source to make significant inroads into the U.S. electricity generation market.

Positive effects of a break-up due to lower domestic prices, increasing real wages and lower imports are fully compensated by the loss in international competitiveness. On industrial level, the negative implications are the strongest in those industries that depend strongly on exports. Strong indirect implications are expected for the business-related service sector.

The aim of this paper is to empirically investigate whether the relationship between height and-cognition holds in later-life using data from the first wave of The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). Seven measures of cognition are used. These measures capture aspects of cognition which are more likely to decline in old age, such as cognitive flexibility, processing speed, concentration and attention. It is found that height is positively and significantly associated with cognition in later-life also when education and early-life indicators are controlled for. The finding that adult height is a marker for nutrition and health environment experienced in early-life is widely accepted in the literature. The findings of this paper suggest that height might have a greater value added, as it appears to be a useful measure of unobserved childhood experiences. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A variance decomposition will attribute to news shocks movements in endogenous variables driven both by news about future exogenous fundamentals that has yet to materialize (what I call pure news) as well as movements driven by realized changes in fundamentals that were anticipated in the past (what I call realized news). I present a stylized model in which news about yet unrealized changes in fundamentals is irrelevant for output dynamics, but in which a variance decorriposition may nevertheless attribute a large share of the variance of output to news shocks. I then revisit the quantitative importance of news in the model of Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2012).

Using recent data from 22 OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries, we estimate this college wage premium at 28 per cent for male full-time working employees, on average, ranging from 18 per cent in Sweden to 50 per cent in the Slovak Republic. This premium is largely explained by the higher skill levels of graduates from higher education combined with their use of these skills at work, as well as the match with job requirements for this skill proficiency and skill use. We find no effect of labour market institutions (e.g. the employment protection legislation or the coverage rate) on cross-country differences in the college wage premium. However, we find that cross-country variation in this premium is related to the relative supply of higher educated workers.

Data concerning the religious beliefs of Chinese respondents was collected in 2007. We analyzed the data for the potential influence of religious beliefs on household borrowing decisions. By applying the ordered logit regression methods and IV estimator, we found that respondents with a religious family background borrowed less when other conditions remained unchanged. It was also discovered that, compared with non-believers, Buddhists borrow less than adherents of other religions. No other religious beliefs had a statistically significant influence. That is to say, different religious denominations exert different influences on Chinese household borrowing decisions.","[Zhong Chunping] Chinese Acad Social Sci, NAES, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Pan Li] China Inst Finance & Capital Markets, China Secur Regulatory Commiss, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Pan Li] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Pan Li] HUST, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Shu Lingwei] NYU, New York, NY USA",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Tsinghua University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; New York University,"Zhong, CP (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, NAES, Beijing, Peoples R China.",springzenith@gmail.com; panli@bisf.cn; slw1991mail@qq.com,"zhong, chun/JEZ-8722-2023",,,,,,25,10,10,1,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Using data on bilateral FDI flows between the 27 EU member countries in 2007, we find that in addition to geographic proximity, similarity in public debt levels drives cross-country correlation in FDI inflows. The public debt threshold of 60% of GDP prescribed by the Maastricht Treaty is a crucial driver of interdependence between FDI inflows. FDI inflows are correlated within the group of compliant countries as well as within the group of non-compliers. This is consistent with the fact that foreign investors distinguish between countries which violate this Maastricht criterion and those that do not. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this paper is to present a simple numerical framework that helps to better understand the timing of this episode, which we label a reverse speculative attack. We model a central bank which wishes to maintain a peg, and responds to increases in demand for domestic currency by expanding its balance sheet. In contrast to the classic speculative attacks, which are triggered by the depletion of foreign assets, reverse attacks are triggered by the concern of future balance sheet losses. Our key result is that the interaction between the desire to maintain the peg and the concern about future losses, can lead the central bank to first accumulate a large amount of reserves, and then to abandon the peg, just as we have observed in the Swiss case.

In this framework, we examine an important decision making problem, namely the determination of the optimal time to sell a diversified real estate portfolio. The optimization problem corresponds to the maximization of a concave utility function defined on both the free cash flows and the terminal value of the portfolio. We determine several types of optimal times to sell and analyze their properties. We extend previous results, established for the quasi linear utility case, where investors are risk neutral. We consider four cases. In the first one, the investor knows the probability distribution of the real estate index. In the second one, the investor is perfectly informed about the real estate market dynamics. In the third case, the investor uses an intertemporal optimization approach which looks like an American option problem. Finally, the buy-and-hold strategy is considered. For these four cases, we analyze in particular how the solutions depend on the market volatility and we compare them with those of the quasi linear case. We show that the introduction of risk aversion allows to better account for the real estate market volatility. We also introduce the notion of compensating variation to better measure the impacts of both the risk aversion and the volatility. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We first provide evidence that existing results relating credit expansions to economic expansions, real exchange rate appreciations and trade deficits hold more strongly for household credit than business credit. Then, using a two-sector real business cycle model of a small open economy, we study the model dynamics generated by shocks to household credit and business credit, the latter further divided into credit to tradable and nontradable sectors. The results show that the three types of credit shocks generate different dynamics in sectoral input and output levels as well as the real exchange rate. The model successfully generates the comovement between the cycle and different credit types, matching the strong positive correlation of household credit with output and real exchange rate, and the negative correlation with net exports. Our results underline the importance of distinguishing between household and business credit in studying credit dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This is why we examine whether regions which incorporate banks with a higher intermediation quality grow faster in normal times and are more resilient in bad ones. For this purpose, we measure the intermediation quality of a bank by estimating its profit and cost efficiency while taking the changing banking environment after the financial crisis into account. Next, we aggregate the efficiencies of all banks within a NUTS 2 region to obtain a regional proxy for financial quality in twelve European countries. Our results show that relatively more profit efficient banks foster growth in their region. The link between financial quality and growth is valid in normal and in bad times. These results provide evidence to the importance of swiftly restoring bank profitability in euro area crisis countries through addressing high non-performing loans ratios and decisive actions on bank recapitalization.

The dependence of domestic investment on domestic saving falls by half or disappears entirely, mitigating the Feldstein and Horioka (1980) puzzle. Changes in nominal GDPs in U.S. dollars become less variable across countries and line up with changes in real GDPs as much as with real exchange rates, mitigating the exchange rate disconnect puzzle.

We investigate the extent to which behavior towards female leaders is influenced by experience with women in leadership positions. We find evidence of significant male backlash against female leaders, which can be attributed to the transgression of social norms and in particular, a violation of male identity, when women are assigned to positions of leadership through gender based quotas. Increased exposure to female leaders reduces the extent of bias. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using a farsighted dynamic model, we endogenize the equilibrium path of PTAs among two close countries and one far country. Rising transport costs mitigate the cost of discrimination faced by the far country as a CU nonmember and diminish the value of preferential access as a CU member. Thus, sufficiently large transport costs imply that an FTA is the only type of PTA that can induce the far country's participation in PTA formation. Unlike CU formation, FTA formation can induce participation because FTAs provide a flexibility benefit: an FTA member can form further PTAs with non-members but a CU member must do, so jointly with all existing members. Hence, in equilibrium, CUs are intra-regional while FTAs are intra- and inter-regional. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find that friendships are based mainly on common play, and are independent of the need to find help for school activity and homework. Friendship networks among children arise on the basis of their sex, but also according to affinity of personality and cognitive skills, as much as on ethnic background. These findings are worth considering when multiculturalism is chosen as the foundation of the immigration policies. Rather than emphasizing what makes the individuals in an ethnic group different, a farsighted policy could try to point to the elective affinity among individuals. However, since differences in individual characteristics may be systematically associated with ethnic background, this finding may point to a lasting reason for a lack of cohesion in multiethnic societies.

In this paper, I propose a model that incorporates fairness concerns into the pricing decision for concert tickets. The hypotheses derived from this model are tested on data from the German club concert industry. The results are consistent with the model: Although (1) price dispersion is the dominant pricing strategy in the club concert industry and artists prefer to perform on a Friday or Saturday night, (2) artists do not set higher prices on the weekend. These results are consistent with fairness constraints, but are difficult to explain within a standard profit maximization framework.

This paper introduces and analyzes a dynamic auction for simply and efficiently allocating an item when participants are privately informed of their values. In the auction, the price rises continuously. A bidder who drops out of the auction, in return for surrendering his claim to the item, obtains compensation equal to the difference between the price at which he drops and the preceding drop price. When only one bidder remains, that bidder wins the item and pays the compensations of his rivals. We characterize the unique equilibrium with risk-neutral and CARA risk averse bidders. We show that dropout prices are decreasing as bidders become more risk averse. Each bidder's equilibrium payoff is at least 1/N-th of his value for the item. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The results show that the new tax regime for micro-businesses increased the number of newly registered firms by 27-41 % below the eligibility threshold during the first year of the reform, but not in subsequent years. We do not find an effect of the new tax regime for small businesses on formal firm creation in any year. Policy makers are often also concerned about abuse risks stemming from differentiated tax treatment of micro- and small businesses.

To incorporate a balance argument in a conventional setting, we develop an adjusted exposure level to study an individual's delinquency choice. We show this choice is affected by not only how many delinquent peers an individual directly and indirectly connects with, but also who those peers are. Specifically, exposure to delinquent peers is not universally risky, and could even be protective if the average exposure level of the individual's delinquent peers is significantly less than her own exposure level. In addition, we show that individuals with high exposure levels are more sensitive to structural changes in the delinquent network. Therefore, a policy aiming to isolate key players in the network could be more cost-effective than strengthening the law-enforcement system.","[Charles, Joni S.

It is shown that the optimal debt level depends on a positive marginal productivity of public capital. In general, it also depends on the demographic parameters, but not if the government is not allowed to borrow to cover revenue shortfalls for current age-related spending. In that context, balanced budget rules are not an approriate form of fiscal rule. The implication is that a government facing demograhic change or demands for more welfare spending will have to adjust its fiscal plans to accommodate those changes, most likely downward, if growth is to be preserved. An advantage of this model is that it allows us to determine in advance the way in which fiscal policies need to adjust as demographic parameters change.","[Bokan, Nikola] Croatian Natl Bank, Zagreb, Croatia; [Hallett, Andrew Hughes] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Jensen, Svend E.

This result typically relies on a framework where competitors are assumed to be symmetric. This paper demonstrates that under significant asymmetries of competing firms, the strong firm trades off current market share for future market share and the weak firm does the opposite. This inter temporal market sharing agreement generates unidirectional poaching and entails new and distinctive welfare implications. In particular, if consumers are sufficiently myopic, price discrimination softens price competition in relation to uniform pricing, overturning the conclusion of previous studies.

There is considerable debate about the choice of the best mechanism to reduce emissions under a climate policy. The aim of this paper is to measure the impact of a policy of taxing GHG emissions on the Brazilian economy as a whole and on different household groups based on income levels in 2009. The following databases were used: Supply and Use Tables, Household Budget Survey, National Household Sample Survey and emissions data from the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology and Innovation. A price system from a national input output model that incorporates the intensity of GHG emissions is used, as well as a consumption vector broken down into ten representative households with different income levels. The main results indicate that this taxation system was slightly regressive and had a small negative impact on output. There were, however, significant emissions reductions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Amid stricter environmental rules on CO2 emissions, a power plant operator needs to be able to judge how the purchase of carbon allowances affects the plant's expected value; and whether the plant's value rises from switching among turbines. This paper presents a model analysis of a spark spread and clean spark spread option based valuation of a power plant with multiple gas turbines - using a bivariate and a tri-variate lattice, respectively. Results demonstrate that the purchase of CO2 allowances lowers the plant's expected value. Conversely, when operations of turbines are switched in response to price movements, the plant's value increases. This outcome has implications for plant management decisions: when to switch among turbines and how the purchase of CO2 allowances affects the plant's value.

An understanding of the way in which environmental policy in advanced nations has developed and which policies have had a significant impact on the reduction in the emissions of various pollutants may yield important policy prescriptions relevant to the current climate change negotiations. In this paper we consider how Japan's little-known environmental interest rate policy and voluntary pollution control agreements contributed to Japan's ecological modernization and how these policies compare with the more traditional regulatory approach.

We find surprisingly that the gains to the import sector are larger than the gains to the export sector. Moreover, the size and the dynamic pattern of such gains are different across sectors. Overall, sectors with larger intermediate input shares from import-competing industries and with domestic demands less sensitive to changes in trade costs have higher welfare gains from trade liberalization.","[Riezman, Raymond] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Lai, Ting-Wei] Natl Chengchi Univ, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Wang, Ping] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Riezman, Raymond] Univ Nottingham, Globalizat & Econ Policy Ctr GEP, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Riezman, Raymond] Inst Econ Res CES Ifo, Ctr Econ Studies, Munich, Germany; [Wang, Ping] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Iowa; National Chengchi University; Washington University (WUSTL); University of Nottingham; Ifo Institut; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Riezman, R (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",raymond-riezman@uiowa.edu,,,Academia Sinica; National Science Council [NSC 99-2410-H-001-013-MY3],"Academia Sinica(Academia Sinica - Taiwan); National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The authors are grateful for comments by Eric Bond, Wen-Tai Hsu and Shin-Kun Peng.

However, statisticians and econometricians have stressed that results rely on untestable assumptions, and therefore, guidelines for researchers on how to improve credibility have been developed. We follow one of these guidelines with a data set analysed by other authors to evaluate the impact of Fair Trade certification on the income of coffee producers. We provide thereby a best practice example of how to evaluate the credibility of PSM estimates. We find that a thorough assessment of the assumptions made renders the data we use not suitable for a credible PSM estimation of the effects of treatment. We conclude that the debate about the impact of Fair Trade certification would greatly benefit from a detailed reporting of credibility checking.","[Lampach, Nicolas] CNRS, BETA, Strasbourg, France; [Lampach, Nicolas] Univ Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France; [Morawetz, Ulrich B.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Vienna, Austria","Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Lorraine; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Morawetz, UB (通讯作者)，Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Vienna BOKU, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",ulrich.morawetz@boku.ac.at,"Morawetz, Ulrich B./U-8875-2017","Morawetz, Ulrich/0000-0002-5481-8292",,,,,32,10,11,0,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This explanatory gap is the consequence of the analytical closed-endedness of the market processes described by the neoclassical framework, where social interactions do not result in new unpredictable information. However, entrepreneurship as profit-seeking under uncertainty is an open-ended process characterized by a creatively reflexive and emergent interactive behavior in society. This open-endedness involves the generation of novel, complex, and extensive future information that is not what anyone intended it to be. Neoclassical economics, with its predetermined assumptions on economic behavior, cannot really account for the fundamental uncertainty of open-ended processes because it cannot explain reflexivity or emergence. Therefore, it cannot explain entrepreneurship as either an innovatively cohesive or disruptive behavior that converges toward future market situations.","[Roche, Gabriel A.

For over a decade, these countries have been advised to follow 'the Norwegian model', saving resource revenues abroad, in offshore sovereign wealth funds for future generations. The three papers in this issue challenge that view. Together, they argue that there are three key motives for saving revenues abroad: intergenerational transfer, parking and stabilisation. The paper by Venables and Wills shows that only the second two are relevant for developing countries, which have pressing needs at home, arguing that revenues should be directed toward domestic investment to accelerate the countries along their development path. There are, however, other potential motives for investing resource rents offshore, in addition to intergenerational transfer, parking and stabilisation. These include political accountability, portfolio diversification of investment returns and Dutch disease considerations. Investment of resource rents in the domestic economy should be focused on projects with high social and financial returns, and is best achieved by collaboration between informed development banks and arms-length institutional investors.","[Wills, Samuel E.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Ctr Anal Resource Rich Econ, Dept Econ, Oxford, England; [Senbet, Lemma W.; Simbanegavi, Witness] African Econ Res Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Oxford; African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),"Wills, SE (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Ctr Anal Resource Rich Econ, Dept Econ, Oxford, England.",samuel.wills@economics.ox.ac.uk,,"Simbanegavi, Witness/0000-0003-3109-9528","African Economic Research Consortium; UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K009303/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N013344/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K009303/1, ES/N013344/1] Funding Source: UKRI",African Economic Research Consortium; UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),Support from the African Economic Research Consortium and the UK Economic and Social Research Council grant number ES/K009303/1 is gratefully acknowledged.,,44,8,10,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Japan imposed its system of well-defined property rights on some of its Asian colonies. In 1939, Japan began to register private land in its island colonies, an effort that was completed in Palau but interrupted elsewhere by World War II. Within Micronesia, robust economic development followed only in Palau where individual property rights were well defined. We show that well-defined property rights in Korea and Taiwan secured land taxation and enabled farmers to obtain bank loans for irrigation systems. Considering Japanese colonies, we use the presence or absence of a land survey as an instrument to identify the causal impact of new institutions. Our estimates show that property-defining institutions were important for economic development, results that are confirmed when using a similar approach with British Colonies in Asia.","[Yoo, Dongwoo] West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Steckel, Richard H.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",West Virginia University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Yoo, D (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",dongwoo.yoo@mail.wvu.edu; steckel.1@osu.edu,,,Presidential Fellowship of Ohio State University; Economic History Association Dissertation fellowship,Presidential Fellowship of Ohio State University; Economic History Association Dissertation fellowship,"The authors benefitted from comments or suggestions by Lee Alston, Price Fishback, Sumner La Croix, Gary Libecap, John Wallis, and by seminar participants at the NBER Summer Institute, the University of Michigan, the Social Science History Association meetings, and Ohio State University.

It will be the first approach which is able to combine the insights of market structure models with extensive and modern econometric analysis. Instead of directly modeling the electricity price as it is usually done in time series or data mining approaches, we model and utilize its true source: the sale and purchase curves of the electricity exchange. We will refer to this new model as X-Model, as almost every deregulated electricity price is simply the result of the intersection of the electricity supply and demand curve at a certain auction. Therefore we show an approach to deal with a tremendous amount of auction data, using a subtle data processing technique as well as dimension reduction and lasso based estimation methods. We incorporate not only several known features, such as seasonal behavior or the impact of other processes like renewable energy, but also completely new elaborated stylized facts of the bidding structure. Our model is able to capture the non-linear behavior of the electricity price, which is especially useful for predicting huge price spikes.

It is shown that, in contrast with the case of the absence of export tax/subsidy, a right-to-manage (RTM) arrangement always emerges endogenously as a sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium in agreement between parties. Moreover, such an arrangement may be also Pareto-optimal in both exporting countries in the sense that profits, workers' welfare (provided that union's power is sufficiently high) and social welfare as a whole are higher than the efficient bargaining (EB) arrangement. Moreover, since the government of the country in which there is EB (while in the other country the alternative agenda RTM is used) levies a tax on export, then the conventional result that under quantity competition it is always optimal for exporting countries to subsidise exports may be reversed.","[Fanti, Luciano] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Pisa, Italy; [Buccella, Domenico] Kozminski Univ, Dept Econ, Warsaw, Poland",University of Pisa; Kozminski University,"Buccella, D (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Dept Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",buccella@kozminski.edu.pl,"Buccella, Domenico/F-8981-2019","Buccella, Domenico/0000-0002-9594-0630",,,,,19,8,8,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We test whether the corporate tax shields explanation of capital structure is applicable to firms listed on the Spanish stock exchange over the period 2007-2013. Taxes are found to be economically and statistically significant determinants of capital structure. Our results suggest that marginal tax rates affect the debt policies of Spanish listed companies, and the existence of non-debt tax shields constitutes an alternative to the use of debt as a tax shelter. Consistent with theoretical expectations, there is a stronger relation between debt and taxation in less levered firms. Finally, we empirically estimate the impact of the new thin-capitalization rule put forth by the Spanish government in 2012 on the financing behaviour of Spanish listed companies. Our empirical evidence supports the existence of a tax reform effect, where companies affected by interest deductibility limitations reduce their leverage more than companies that are not affected.","[Clemente-Almendros, Jose A.] EDEM Escuela Empresarios, Dept Empresa, Marina Real Juan Carlos 1,Muelle Aduana S-N, Valencia 46024, Spain; [Sogorb-Mira, Francisco] Univ CEU Cardenal Herrera, Dept Econo & Empresa, Plaza Reyes Catolicos 19, Elche 03204, Alicante, Spain",Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera,"Sogorb-Mira, F (通讯作者)，Univ CEU Cardenal Herrera, Dept Econo & Empresa, Plaza Reyes Catolicos 19, Elche 03204, Alicante, Spain.",joclal@edem.es; fsogorb@uch.ceu.es,"Sogorb Mira, Francisco/F-1604-2017; Clemente-Almendros, José Antonio/E-6403-2019","Sogorb Mira, Francisco/0000-0002-8467-9270; Clemente-Almendros, José Antonio/0000-0002-8934-471X",Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2015-67035P],Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness,"Francisco Sogorb-Mira gratefully acknowledges financial support from Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness Research Grant ECO2015-67035P.

We estimate a vector autoregressive (VAR) model to analyse the effects of a monetary policy shock on real output, and we also use a threshold VAR model to investigate asymmetric effects of contractionary and expansionary policies. The empirical results suggest that a contractionary monetary policy results in a fall in the supply of loans together with an increase in the spread between the lending and deposit rate. To the extent that some borrowers are dependent on bank loans for credit, the reduced supply of loans amplifies the effects of monetary policy on output associated with the traditional interest rate channel.

We conduct a laboratory experiment in which a provider gives a favor to a recipient, who can then only return the favor to an anonymous third party beneficiary. We find that when the recipient's behavior is observable by the provider - e.g., there exists social image concern - the recipient's repayment increases by 25%. To investigate the possible channels of the effect, in our design the provider has the option to send a costly request to the recipient, asking for a favorable treatment of the beneficiary, in addition to varying degrees of social connection between the provider and the beneficiary. We show that the increase in repayment under social image concern is largely attributable to the recipient's increasing desire to meet the provider's request. On the other hand, the providers are more likely to send the request when they can observe the repayment. These results suggest that the concern for social image not only affects the amount of favor transmitted, but also has interesting and important interactions with other underlying motives.

This makes it easier for firms to create in their advertising a desire to belong to the group identified with a product. We explore this kind of advertising in a monopoly model. The firm has an incentive to target this kind of advertising to the most lucrative segment of a particular social grouping and while advertising does create value for the consumer, it leads to an outcome where less output is sold at a higher price in a narrower or more segmented market than in the standard monopoly model. As a result even though consumers value the identification effect they are worse off. This is because the firm uses advertising to exploit a form of price discrimination and appropriate more surplus.

To investigate the extent to which this procurement tradeoff affects processors' cost-minimizing decisions, we apply the model to switchgrass ethanol production in U.S. crop reporting districts.

We find no evidence of technical efficiency changes due to the RGGI regime in the RGGI area. In the same area, relatively less efficient coal plants exited the market and slightly more efficient natural gas plants entered, compared to the incumbent plants. In addition, some evidence of a spillover effect is found.

The underlying distributional and efficiency determinants of profitability are considered in the Marxian analytical framework. For the period of 1995-2007 leading to the Great Recession, our estimates indicate a trend towards convergence of national profit rates largely driven by the convergence of profitability in developing and transition economies. During this period, the level of profit rates in all groups of countries experienced growth with the global capital-weighted rate of profit increasing by approximately 50%. The main contributor to this growth in all groups of countries was the increase in average productivity of capital, measured by output-capital ratio. In developed and transition economies, the increase in profit shares of national income and the decline in the relative price of capital goods also contributed to profitability growth. In the same period for developing countries, profit shares and relative prices were relatively stable.","[Chou, Nan-Ting; Izyumov, Alexei; Vahaly, John] Univ Louisville, Louisville, KY 40292 USA",University of Louisville,"Vahaly, J (通讯作者)，Univ Louisville, Dept Econ, Coll Business, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.",John.Vahaly@louisville.edu,"IZYUMOV, ALEXEI/AAL-6340-2021","IZYUMOV, ALEXEI/0000-0002-1750-2790",,,,,60,5,6,2,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Cross-sectional estimates show a negative association between landownership concentration and enrollment rates. Fixed-effects panel estimates indicate that regions with an initially stronger landownership concentration exhibit increasing enrollment rates. This relationship is not driven by differences in the supply of schooling. We argue that the implementation of agricultural reforms including the stepwise abolition of serfdom is an important driver of the change in enrollment. The results are consistent with the interpretation that emancipation from labor coercion increased the private demand for education. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

As a consequence, a trade-off between adaptational flexibility and the prevention of distributional conflicts emerges. In a recent paper, Fehr et al. (2011) analyzed a buyer-seller-relationship with incomplete contracts and ex ante uncertainty regarding the sellers' cost level to test these effects. We re-run their experiment and introduce another treatment with exogenously determined contract types. Like FHZ we find some evidence for reference point effects in both treatments. However, uncooperative shading behavior in our treatments differs substantially from that described in FHZ. Furthermore, it makes a significant difference whether contract types are determined by buyers or determined exogenously. We explain this by introducing two further effects, a reciprocity effect and a signaling effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose, we construct a quality-based heterogeneous firm trade model to incorporate the formation of currency unions and the ensuing elimination of exchange rate volatility. Our main hypothesis is that a common currency enables low-quality (low marginal cost) firms to commence exporting to the common currency's member countries, which causes the average export price to fall. We empirically test this hypothesis for the euro and the eurozone using Harmonized System 8-digit traded product data for European Union countries.","[Ito, Tadashi] Japan External Trade Org, Inst Dev Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Okubo, Toshihiro] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo 108, Japan",Keio University,"Ito, T (通讯作者)，Japan External Trade Org, Inst Dev Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",,,,"Japan Society for Promotion of Science KAKENHI [26285058]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26220503, 25780169, 15H03348, 26285058] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for Promotion of Science KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors are grateful for useful comments from three anonymous referees, editor, Kozo Kiyota, Ryo Nakajima, Masahito Kobayashi, among others, at the economics seminar at the Yokohama National University.

Our model captures the two-sided market interaction between consumers and retailers that can generate multiple equilibria. Limited commitment yields an endogenous debt limit that depends on monetary policy. Money and credit coexist for a range of parameters, and bargaining related hold-up problems can lead to inefficiencies in the adoption of monitoring technologies. Changes in monetary policy generate multiplier effects in the credit market due to complementarities between consumer borrowing and the adoption of credit by merchants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, data limitations make it challenging to evaluate competing claims about the state of Chinese housing markets. This paper brings new data and analysis to the study of supply and demand conditions in nearly three dozen major cities. We first document the most accurate measures of land values, construction costs, and overall house prices. We then create and investigate a number of supply and demand metrics to see if price growth reasonably can be interpreted as reflecting local market fundamentals. Key results include the following: (1) Real house price growth has been high, averaging 10% per annum since 2006. However, there is substantial heterogeneity across markets, ranging from 2.8% (Jinan) to 19.8% (Beijing). House price growth is driven by rising land values, not by construction costs. Real land values have risen by 14.4% per annum on average. In Beijing, the increase has been by a remarkable 27.5% per year (or by 1036%) since 2004. (2) There is variation about the strong positive trend in house price and land value growth. Land values fell by nearly one-third at the beginning of the global financial crisis, but more than fully recovered amidst the 2009-2010 Chinese stimulus. More recent growth has been much more modest, with some markets beginning to decline. Quantities of land sales by local governments to private residential developers have dropped sharply since 2013. The most recent data show transactions volumes down by half or more. This should lead to a reduced supply of new housing units in coming years. (3) Market-level analysis of short- and longer-run changes in supply demand balances finds important variation across markets. In the major East region markets of Beijing, Hangzhou, Shanghai and Shenzhen which have experienced very high rates of real price growth, we estimate that the growth in households demanding housing units has outpaced new construction since the turn of the century. However, there are thirteen large markets, primarily in the interior of the country, in which new housing production has outpaced household growth by at least 30% and another eleven in which it did so by at least 10%. Regression results show that a one standard deviation increase in local market housing inventory is associated with a 0.45 standard deviation lower rate of real house price growth the following year. (4) There are no official data on residential vacancy rates in China, but some researchers have reported very high figures (17%+). We develop a new series at the provincial level which yields a much lower vacancy rate on average, but it has been rising from 5.2% in 2009 to 7.8% in 2014. (5) The risk of housing even in markets such as Beijing which show no evidence of oversupply, is best evidenced by price-to-rent ratios. They are well above 50 in the capital city. Poterba's (1984) user cost model suggests these levels can be justified only if owners have sufficiently high expectations of future capital gains. Even a modest one percentage point drop in expected appreciation (or increase in interest rates) would result in a drop in prices of about one-third, absent an offsetting increase in rents.

First, we find that gasoline and diesel demand are both price inelastic in the short- run, but the income elasticity for the former is inelastic and elastic for the latter. There is evidence of a shift in the long-run price and income elasticities after the eighties, We find that these elasticities differ between diesel and gasoline. We show that government decision to withdraw fuel subsidies will increase the energy efficiency gap in the diesel sector more than the gasoline sector. Using the Structural Cointegration VAR, we also show that government intervention in pricing of petroleum products in the road sector seems to be politically and not economically driven. Further, shocks are more persistent for diesel than gasoline. Last, road diesel and gasoline consumption are expected to increase but slow down between 2020 and 2030 with a possible dieselization of the economy. These results have important implications for government fuel tax policy and investment commitment in the road sector. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Surprisingly, there is practically no firm-level research contrasting the two sectors in this respect. To fill this gap, the authors aim at identifying for the two sectors the determinants of a firm's propensity to engage in exports or FDI as well as the factors determining a firm's FDI strategy in terms of business functions. They find that an OLI-based model is well suited for explaining the propensity to go international as well as the differences between specific forms of FDI in terms of business functions both for manufacturing and services.

In a randomized controlled trial with residential households, we use advanced metering and information technologies to test how different messages about household energy use impact the dynamics of conservation behavior down to the appliance level. Our results, based on 374million panel observations of kilowatt-hour (kWh) electricity consumption for 118 households over 9 months, show that differences in behavioral responses due to message framing become more significant over time. We find that a health-based frame, in which households consider the human health effects of their marginal electricity use, induced persistent energy savings behavior of 8-10% over 100 days; whereas a more traditional cost savings frame, drove sharp attenuation of treatment effects after 2 weeks with no significant savings versus control after 7 weeks.

The model uses a large, rich data set which allows for precise estimates of labour supply elasticities for several subgroups. We use an advanced tax benefit calculator to calculate households' budget constraints accurately. Both the large, rich data set and the advanced tax benefit calculator enable us to perform more accurate policy predictions. Simulations show that labour supply elasticities differ among subgroups. Labour supply elasticities for men in couples are low but labour supply elasticities are much higher for cohabiting/married women. Furthermore, elasticities are relatively high for individuals with a lower education and/or non-Western background. Policy simulations provide two important insights. First, an introduction of either a pure flat tax, or an income-neutral flat tax, decreases aggregate labour supply. Second, an EITC for working parents is more effective in stimulating aggregate labour supply than an EITC for all workers or an overall reduction in marginal tax rates.","[de Boer, H.

In many applications it might be desirable to decompose electricity consumption into unpredictable and deterministic (or highly predictable) component. We want to find out whether forecasting works better if we model electricity load independently for each hour or if we model in the first step the average daily consumption and in a second step we model for each hour deviation from this average. We therefore compare two simple, yet flexible models for hourly electricity consumption in Germany. Both models use temperature, industrial production, hours of daylight and dummies for days of the week and month of the year as explanatory variables. We find that the first model, despite being simpler, forecasts hourly electricity demand more precisely. This indicates that hourly electricity consumption represents various goods, and should be modelled separately for each hour. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This approach is original, in that it imports the methodology of clinical trials for application in development economics. This paper examines the analogy between J-PAL's field experiments in development economics and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in medicine. RCTs and randomized field experiments are commonly treated as identical, but such treatment neglects some of the major distinguishing features that make each experiment specifically apt for use in its respective field. The central claim of this paper is that the analogy between medicine and development economics is incomplete because the central dimensions of RCTs are not simply different but altogether lacking in J-PAL's approach. This weakens both the political and the theoretical power of such experiments in development economics.","[Favereau, Judith] Univ Helsinki, Acad Finland Ctr Excellence Philosophy Social Sci, TINT, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; Research Council of Finland,"Favereau, J (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Acad Finland Ctr Excellence Philosophy Social Sci, TINT, Helsinki, Finland.",judith.favereau@helsinki.fi,,,,,,,88,10,10,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

Separate accounting always generates more profitable output and conditional labor demand distortions from tax differentials while either method can generate a more profitable income-shifting distortion. Both low-cost and high-cost firms can prefer separate accounting while medium-cost firms prefer formula apportionment. With symmetric countries, a firm's preferred method generates greater tax revenues in the country with the lower tax rate. With asymmetric countries, a firm's preferred method need no longer generate greater tax revenues in the lower-tax-rate country due to the fact that countries and firms now value tax base distortions differently. With this misalignment of preferences, some firms can choose the preferred method of both countries at fixed tax rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The monotonicity constraints specify a complete order on the players, which has to be respected by the shares in the surplus the players obtain in any bargaining outcome. A player higher in the order should not receive a lower share of the surplus. We analyze the resulting subgame perfect equilibria in stationary strategies and show that they are characterized by the simpler notion of bargaining equilibrium. Bargaining equilibria are shown to be unique and to have the property that players ranked strictly higher obtain strictly higher shares in the surplus. The key question is whether the bargaining advantage of a higher-ranked player persists when the probability of breakdown of bargaining tends to zero. We argue that such is not the case by showing that bargaining equilibria have a unique limit equal to an equal division of the surplus. It then follows that the limit also coincides with the Nash bargaining solution for this problem.","[Herings, P.

The paper estimates key parameters using maximum likelihood and shows that the habit persistence improves the explanatory power of the model over the business cycle, irrespective of habit formation way. If the distortions associated with external habit are not completely eliminated by the fiscal policy, then the remaining external habit entails a gap between the private marginal rate of substitution between consumption and labor and the social marginal rate of substitution, generating an endogenous trade-off between the stabilization of welfare-relevant output gap and inflation. Under this circumstance, discretion, partially taking into account the trade-off between output gap and inflation, can be better than a strict inflation targeting rule in welfare dimension if the fiscal authority does not implement any tax policy to eliminate the distortions associated with external habit. The monetary policy to deal with distortions associated with external habit is less effective in the ratio external habit model than in the difference habit model, resulting in a higher the inflation rate in the ratio external habit model than the inflation rate in the difference habit. model.","[Jung, Yongseung] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Jung, Y (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",jungys@khu.ac.kr,"Jung, Yongseung/AAI-1058-2020",,National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A3A2044637],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,"This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2014S1A3A2044637).

The theory addresses an economic situation with structural ignorance, where states of the world are not naturally given nor simply formulated for a decision-maker. Under this theory, consumers make decisions based on subjective evaluations of previous purchases for similar goods. Our empirical analysis is concerned with viewing decisions on getsuku, the Japanese TV dramas broadcast at 9 pm Monday by the Fuji Television Network. The regularity of the schedule and the long-sustaining popularity of the program enable us to easily collect consumer data. Then, we conduct a web survey of individual audiences on subjective evaluations of previously watched dramas. For our empirical analysis, we utilize a simple linear model of the case-based model that allows the incorporation of flexible inference techniques. Our results demonstrate better performance of the case-based models than models based on traditional expected utility theory regarding both statistical model selection and one-step-ahead prediction. We also reveal that the successful performance of the case-based model in our analysis depends on the availability of individual subjective evaluations and that it is difficult to replace the individual-specific information using demographic information and aggregate data.","[Sugawara, Shinya] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Tokyo, Japan; [Kinjo, Keita] Okinawa Int Univ, Dept Econ, Ginowan, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Sugawara, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Tokyo, Japan.",sugawara_shinya@ci.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Sugawara, Shinya/0000-0002-5149-3197; Kinjo, Keita/0000-0001-5907-3501","Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture and Technology JST CREST [25780272, 15K17070, 25885021]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K17070, 25780272, 25885021, 16K17203] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture and Technology JST CREST; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture and Technology (Grant/Award Number: 'Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientist (B) No. 25780272', 'Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientist (B) No. 15K17070', 'Research Activity start-up No. 25885021') JST CREST.",,41,7,9,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

The present study extends the existing literature concentrating on the degree of underpricing over a 3-month period lasting from the listing date to the 3-month anniversary showing significant evidence of IPO underpricing. The analyses support the investors' sentiment and underwriters' prestige hypothesis but not ex-ante uncertainty. The EBA technique has been used to examine fifteen explanatory variables of IPO underpricing. The study finds that the aftermarket risk level of the IPO, the oversubscription ratio, the offer price, the return on assets, post issue promoters' holding and size of the firm are six robust determinants of IPO underpricing.","[Mumtaz, Muhammad Zubair; Ahmed, Ather Maqsood] NUST, Sch Social Sci & Humanities, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Mumtaz, Muhammad Zubair] Sect H-12, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Smith, Zachary A.] St Leo Univ, St Leo, FL USA",National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan; Saint Leo University,"Mumtaz, MZ (通讯作者)，Sect H-12, Islamabad, Pakistan.",zubair@s3h.nust.edu.pk; zacharyasmith@gmail.com; ather.ahmed@s3h.nust.edu.pk,"Mumtaz, Muhammad Zubair/AAA-8292-2020","Mumtaz, Muhammad Zubair/0000-0003-0319-2282",,,,,56,15,15,0,14,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0718-5286,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

How such a conflict should be dealt with? This paper defends the thesis articulated in the following points: (1) Different metrics are linked to different objectives and values. To use only one measurement unit (on the grounds of the so-called commensurability principle) for incorporating a plurality of dimensions, objectives and values, implies reductionism necessarily. (2) Point (1) can be proven as a matter of formal logic by drawing on the work of Geach about moral philosophy. This theoretical demonstration is an original contribution of this article. Moreover, here the distinction between predicative and attributive adjectives is formalised and definitions are provided. Predicative adjectives are further distinguished into the new categories of absolute and relative ones. The new concepts of set commensurability and rod commensurability are introduced too. (3) Weak comparability of values, which is grounded on incommensurability, is proposed as the main methodological foundation of well-being evaluation. Incommensurability does not imply incomparability; on the contrary incommensurability is the only possible way to compare societal options under a plurality of policy objectives. Weak comparability can be implemented by using multicriteria evaluation, which is a formal framework for applied consequentialism under incommensurability.","[Munda, Giuseppe] Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Unit DDG Econometr & Appl Stat 01, TP 361,Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Munda, G (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Unit DDG Econometr & Appl Stat 01, TP 361,Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.",giuseppe.munda@jrc.ec.europa.eu,,,Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona [2014 SGR 591],Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona,"This article builds on previous work carried out for the JRC's Centre for Research on Education and Lifelong Learning (CRELL), in the framework of the project KNOW (Human Capital for Prosperity and Sustainable Growth in Europe).

Results feature in climate policy discussion on emissions reduction responsibilities; yet studies show that outcomes produced by each database differ. This paper compares the emissions associated with value chains from Eora, EXIOBASE, GTAP and WIOD. Structural path analysis identifies the largest paths in each database and the differences in common paths are calculated. For the top 100 value chain paths that contain the largest difference, structural path decomposition is used to identify the contribution each part of the value chain makes towards the difference. The results identify and quantify key flows that are the cause of difference in the databases. From these, we can conclude that key MRIO database construction decisions, such as using the residence or territorial principle for emissions allocation and whether energy spends are reallocated based on physical data, are the major causes of differences.","[Owen, Anne; Barrett, John] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Wood, Richard] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ind Ecol Programme, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway; [Evans, Andrew] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Leeds,"Owen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",a.owen@leeds.ac.uk,"Wood, Richard/E-4111-2015","Wood, Richard/0000-0002-7906-3324; Owen, Anne/0000-0002-3872-9900; Barrett, John/0000-0002-4285-6849","UK Energy Research Centre; UK Research Councils under EPSRC [EP/L024756/1]; RCUK [EP/N022645/1]; EPSRC [EP/N022645/1, EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/N022645/1, EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: researchfish",UK Energy Research Centre; UK Research Councils under EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); RCUK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"AO's time was supported by the research programme of the UK Energy Research Centre, supported by the UK Research Councils under [EPSRC award EP/L024756/1] and the RCUK Energy Program's funding for the Centre for Industrial Energy, Materials and Products [grant reference EP/N022645/1].",,43,62,63,6,83,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Our test for predictability is based on a recently developed flexible generalised least squares estimator, which most importantly accommodates the endogeneity of CPI, its persistency and any heteroskedasticity in the model. We find limited evidence that CPI predicts gold price returns in in-sample tests; however, out-of sample tests reveal relatively strong evidence that CPI predicts gold returns. These results are robust to different forecasting horizons. On the whole, we discover reasonable evidence that consumer prices predict gold price returns. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We focussed on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Correlation between the size of the enterprise, awareness, commitment and the number of used CSR activities is evaluated. The paper follows the involvement of SMEs in specific activities within the social, economic and environmental pillars and suggests possibilities for further development of the National Action Plan (NAP) for SMEs. The results of the statistical analysis show that engagement of organizations in the CSR activities growths with the size of the organization. Only 30% of micro and small enterprises in the Czech Republic know and make use of the CSR concept comprehensively and are active in all three pillars of CSR. Approximately 30% are involved in only one pillar - mostly in the economic one. 30% do not apply the CSR concept within their business at all. SMEs are not sufficiently engaged in activities primarily in the environmental pillar and activities aiming towards outside the organization.","[Skypalova, Renata; Kucerova, Renata; Blaskova, Veronika] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Skypalová, R (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Brno, Czech Republic.",skypalova.renata@gmail.com; renata.kucerova@mendelu.cz; veronika.blaskova@mendelu.cz,"Kucerova, Renata/Q-3377-2016; Blašková, Veronika/Q-3858-2016","Blašková, Veronika/0000-0002-5944-1164; Kucerova, Renata/0000-0002-9203-1423",,,,,37,8,9,3,32,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Using a basic model, we explain and reconcile selected findings in the literature. We numerically show that a lower tax rate on capital income is the best candidate for obtaining a dynamic Laffer effect-here defined as an improvement in the long-run budget balance of the government. Moreover, ignoring the stock of initial debt and changes in labor supply lead to an overestimation and underestimation of the effect, respectively. Finally, we show that when lower taxes on factor income are financed by higher taxes on consumption, there exists a wide array of combinations for which there is an improvement in both the long-run government budget balance and lifetime welfare. These combinations, however, differ in their implications for labor supply and immediate welfare effects.","[van Oudheusden, Peter] Tilburg Univ, CentER, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [van Oudheusden, Peter] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [van Oudheusden, Peter] World Bank, Finance & Private Sect, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Tilburg University; Tilburg University; The World Bank,"van Oudheusden, P (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, CentER, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.;van Oudheusden, P (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.;van Oudheusden, P (通讯作者)，World Bank, Finance & Private Sect, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",p.vanoudheusden@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,5,5,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Given that the mean household monthly water bill of GHC10.82, the results indicate that there is demand for water quality improvement, and private sector engagement is likely to provide these services.

We study, by way of an experiment with between-subjects and within-subjects features, to what extent social preferences are consistent or context dependent. We find that participants' giving amount in D games, and the amount they destroy in JoD games, depends on the choice set. While the choice set strongly affects participants' giving decisions, its effect on participants' destruction decisions is much weaker. We observe inconsistent choices (giving in D games and destroying in JoD games) for about one in five subjects but also find this mixed-motive preference dramatically reduces when the choice sets of standard D and JoD games are enlarged. Most of our participants are selfish although they also tend to make choices that increase social welfare when given the opportunity.

This study suggests that outsourcing of accounting tasks increases the corporate tax reporting quality.","[Hoglund, H.; Sundvik, D.] Hanken Sch Econ, Vaasa, Finland",Hanken School of Economics,"Sundvik, D (通讯作者)，Hanken Sch Econ, Vaasa, Finland.",dennis.sundvik@hanken.fi,"Sundvik, Dennis/AAO-6475-2020","Sundvik, Dennis/0000-0001-5838-1799",,,,,8,4,7,0,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The level of inefficiency matches distinct phases of both the Bank of Canada's operations as well as phases of the 2007-8 financial crisis.

In the aftermath of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine that broke out early 2014, the Russian ruble lost 50% of its value against the US dollar. The impact of the conflict on Russia may have been amplified by sanctions imposed by Western countries. However, as Russia is heavily dependent on natural resource exports, another factor behind the deterioration could be the sharp decline in oil prices starting in summer 2014. Using high-frequency data on nominal exchange and interest rates, oil prices, actual and unanticipated sanctions, we provide evidence on forces underlying the ruble exchange rate. The analysis is based on cointegrated VAR models, where fundamental long-run relationships are implicitly embedded. The results indicate that the bulk of the depreciation can be related to the decline of oil prices. In addition, unanticipated sanctions matter for the conditional volatility of the variables involved. Journal of Comparative Economics 44 (2) (2016) 295-308.

In many instances risk is measured by the standard deviation of the asset returns. For portfolio managers who are trading cross different assets and countries, the exercice could be tricky as price limits could vary from a country to another. When price limits are imposed, the observed prices are truncated and the equilibrium prices are unobservable. This adds a bias to the estimation of standard deviation and hence the volatility. In this paper, we tackle this issue of biasness by proposing a methodology that correct this bias in order to get more efficient risk estimates. Two approaches are proposed. The first one is based on stochastic volatility models and the second one on options pricing. We perform a step by step numerical application that displays a clear bias coming from price limits.","[Errais, Eymen] Univ Tunis El Manar, LAREQUAD, FSEGT, Tunis, Tunisia; [Bahri, Dhikra] Univ Tunis El Manar, Ecole Natl Ingn Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia; [Errais, Eymen] Univ Tunis El Manar, Lab Rech Econ Quantitat Dveloppement LAREQUAD, BP 248,El Manar 2, Tunis 2092, Tunisia; [Errais, Eymen] Univ Tunis El Manar, FSEGT, BP 248,El Manar 2, Tunis 2092, Tunisia; [Bahri, Dhikra] Ecole Natl Ingn Tunis, BP 37, Tunis 1002, Tunisia",Universite de Tunis-El-Manar; Universite de Tunis-El-Manar; Ecole Nationale d'Ingenieurs de Tunis (ENIT); Universite de Tunis-El-Manar; Universite de Tunis-El-Manar; Universite de Tunis-El-Manar; Ecole Nationale d'Ingenieurs de Tunis (ENIT),"Errais, E (通讯作者)，Univ Tunis El Manar, LAREQUAD, FSEGT, Tunis, Tunisia.;Errais, E (通讯作者)，Univ Tunis El Manar, Lab Rech Econ Quantitat Dveloppement LAREQUAD, BP 248,El Manar 2, Tunis 2092, Tunisia.;Errais, E (通讯作者)，Univ Tunis El Manar, FSEGT, BP 248,El Manar 2, Tunis 2092, Tunisia.",,,,,,,,50,1,1,0,1,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

The model suggests a three-phase of terrorist operations: (i) the terrorist group attack setting; (ii) the terrorist group attack behavior; and (iii) the post-effect of the terrorist group attack. The model introduces five alternative risk indicators for the estimation of terrorist attacks: (i) the maximum level of terrorist group attack targets (phi'); (ii) terrorist group attack destruction (-pi); (iii) economic terrorist wear (W); (iv) economic desgrowth (-delta); and (v) the multidimensional graphical sub-strategic national security sector analysis.

This essay argues that the existence of varieties of capitalism does not rule out the need for, or possibility of, specification or definition of that type. Accordingly, 'capitalism' is still a viable term. The critique of 'essentialism' is also countered, after clarifying its meaning. In particular, a suitably defined 'essentialism' does not imply some kind of ontological or explanatory reductionism-'economic' or otherwise. But while adopting what are basically Aristotelian arguments about essences, we need to reject Aristotle's auxiliary notion that variety generally results from temporary deviations from a representative type or trend. Furthermore, capitalism is a historically specific and relatively recent system: we need to develop a classificatory definition of that system that demarcates it from other past or possible social formations.","[Hodgson, Geoffrey M.] Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Hodgson, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",g.m.hodgson@herts.ac.uk,"Hodgson, Geoffrey/AAQ-8246-2021",,,,,,116,13,13,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The results of a firm survey are used to examine, for the case of Cambodia, how less developed countries can participate in global value chains by specialising in a niche segment of the value chain. The survey results, which focus on the location choices of Cambodian firms that have mother factories in Thailand, show that the border region has advantages for access to suppliers and markets, while there are disadvantages for recruiting and retaining workers. Metropolitan areas, on the other hand, have advantages in the pooling of human resources, expatriates' living conditions, and access to government services, while inland transport costs are a burden for firms located in metropolitan areas.

Starting with cohort 1937, Germany introduced permanent pension deductions for early retirement. This study examines the profitability of pension contributions against the background of this reform for cohorts 1935-1945. Internal rates of return (IRR) are used to measure the profitability. For men, the IRR declines from 2.4% to 1.2% and for women from 5.2% to 3.7%. The results suggest that the majority of the trend, about 75-80%, is caused by increased pension contributions and not by the reform.","[Luethen, Holger] Free Univ Berlin, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Luethen, Holger] DIW Berlin, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Lüthen, H (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.;Lüthen, H (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",holger.luethen@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,39,12,13,2,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

Around the same time, at business cycle frequencies the correlation between inflation and money growth changed markedly, turning from positive to negative. Distinguishing the periods pre- and post 1994, we estimate a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with money for the euro area. The model accounts for the salient facts. We then perform several counterfactual exercises to assess the drivers of these phenomena. The moderation of real variables was essentially due to relatively smaller shocks to investment, wage markups and preferences. The apparent lack of evidence for the quantity theory of money in the short run and the changes in the volatility of nominal variables resulted primarily from a more anti-inflationary and gradual monetary policy.

Using data from the ECLS-K and a proxy variable model that addresses the problem of measuring school quality, we show that significant effects of teaching and resource quality can be detected from student-level data. We find a significant, positive relationship between school quality and student achievement if school characteristics such as class size and teachers' schooling are treated as noisy measures of school quality. However, this effect is not detected when using models which do not account for measurement error in school quality.

J,"Chandra, P",,,,"Chandra, Piyush",,,Impact of temporary trade barriers: Evidence from China,CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,China; Temporary trade barriers; Trade deflection; Trade depression,PANEL-DATA; GMM,"With a decrease in tariffs around the world, temporary trade barriers (TTBs) have increased dramatically to take their place. These TTBs are usually in the form of antidumping duties, countervailing duties and global safeguards. Recently, an increasing number of these TTBs have been targeted towards China. In this paper, I explore the impact of the US temporary trade barriers (TTBs) on Chinese exports. Using detailed product level data for the period 2002-2008, I find robust evidence of trade deflection i.e. the US trade barriers against China led to an increase in the growth of Chinese exports to other countries. However, I do not find any evidence of trade depression. The results are robust to a wide variety of specification and robustness tests. While I do not find any difference in the impact of TTBs across developed and developing countries, there is considerable heterogeneity in response to TTBs depending on the type of products involved. Specifically, I find that, while the US TTBs on non-steel products lead to an increase in Chinese exports of those products to third markets, there is a significant chilling effect in case of steel. Finally, most of the trade-deflection seems to be along the intensive margins i,e. an increase in exports to the existing third country markets rather than exports to new markets. If anything, the US TTBs on China seem to decrease Chinese exports to newer and more volatile markets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Extending the multi-market framework of Chowdhry and Nanda (1992), we build a two-period model, considering the situation when some investors receive information in the initial period while others receive it in the later period. We show that at equilibrium, the later informed investors would strategically behave as noise traders by randomly injecting trading orders in the initial period even if possessing no information. Although the later informed investors would suffer expected losses in the initial period, such a manipulative strategy harms pricing efficiency and maintains their information advantage when receiving information in the later period. Applying this research to examine the effect of cross listing on market efficiency, we show an inconsistent result to that of Chowdhry and Nanda (1992), who argue that cross listing improves market efficiency. Specifically, our result suggests that cross-listing would accompany market manipulation, which disturbs information transmission across markets and reduces market efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This tax aversion is large in magnitude: when we decompose the productivity decrease that arises from taxation, we estimate that 40% is due to the lower net wage and the remaining 60% to tax aversion. This tax aversion affects labor supply more on the extensive margin (working less) than on the intensive margin (being less productive while working). The aversion is equally strong whether tax revenue goes to the U.S. government or back to the experimenter (a laboratory tax).

By making investment options more valuable, an increase in volatility encourages the creation of new investment options. I find the response of the economy to a volatility shock depends on how investment opportunities are obtained. If potential entrants are allowed to invest in new idiosyncratic technologies, thereby acquiring options for further investment, the volatility shock increases overall investment and results in an economic boom. On the other hand, if such an investment in option creation is precluded and investment opportunities are exogenously given, the volatility shock decreases aggregate investment.

Based on a comprehensive set of 270 RTAs and a large panel data set over the period of 1960-2007, the regression results show that RTAs promote growth for non-WTO members, while their growth effect is weaker and often insignificantly different from zero for WTO members.

We compare estimates of capital services based on an endogenous (ex post) rate of return with ones based on a hybrid method which allows for ex ante risk: firms' expectations may not be satisfied. Contrary to expectation, we find that capital intensity (capital services per hour worked) rose during the Great Recession even though labour productivity fell.

Investors cannot a priori distinguish between more or less talented entrepreneurs. Net-worth allows talented entrepreneurs to self-invest and avoid being pooled with less talented entrepreneurs in the credit market. Increasing net-worth boosts innovation even when financed through higher profit taxes. Taxing consumption effectively raises net-worth and subsidizes profits simultaneously. Sufficiently taxing consumption implements the social optimum free of adverse selection. If forced to tax consumption less, the government implements a second best allocation with adverse selection when boosting net-worth enough to avoid adverse selection requires taxing profit's excessively.

Although the 10 countries of this study share the same currency (and thus a single nominal exchange rate with the US), cross-country discrepancies of exports' reactions to exchange rate changes are evident. Moreover, I find that exchange rate changes influence exports asymmetrically in the long run. Euro appreciations are harmful to a lesser extent than Euro depreciations are beneficial for European agri-food exports. The magnitude of this effect is country-specific and varies considerably between individual exporting countries. Exported quantities are less affected by exchange rate fluctuations than export values, which is in line with local currency price stabilization strategies of the exporters. This finding is interpreted as a sign of an incomplete exchange rate pass-through due to strategic (asymmetric) markup adjustments by firms with heterogeneous productivity. Besides that, the outcomes suggest that nonprice competition might be in play in some cases.","[Fedoseeva, Svetlana] Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, D-35390 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Fedoseeva, S (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, D-35390 Giessen, Germany.",svetlana.fedoseeva@zeu.uni-giessen.de,,"Fedoseeva, Svetlana/0000-0001-7345-3009",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [HE 1419/12-1],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Work on this article is based on the project 'What Explains Agricultural Trade of the EU and Germany?

The rise in housing prices has coincided with a rise in household debt, sparking debate about both the presence of financial imbalances in the Swedish economy and the macroeconomic effects that a correction of these imbalances would have. In this paper, we conduct a quantitative assessment of the macroeconomic effects of a considerable decline in housing prices using a Bayesian VAR model. Results show that a 20% drop in housing prices would lead to a recession-like impact on household consumption and unemployment. The impact would be even greater if falling housing prices coincided with a global economic downturn. This information should be useful to policymakers. If a fall in housing prices were to materialize, more expansionary stabilization policies would be motivated in order to dampen the effects on the real economy. (C) 2016 Society for Policy Modeling.

The Government's decision to phase-out nuclear energy exacerbates Switzerland's climate change mitigation goals. Response to this challenge requires systemic changes to the energy system, which is generally a long-term, uncertain and systemic process, affected by technology choices across the entire energy system. A comprehensive Swiss TIMES Energy system Model (STEM) with high temporal detail has been developed for the analysis of plausible low-carbon energy pathways focusing on uncertainties related to policy (climate change mitigation and acceptability of new centralised electricity generation) and international fuel prices. Increasing electrification of end-uses is seen across the scenarios, resulting in continuous growth in electricity demands. The electrification of heating and e-mobility substitute direct use of fossil fuels in end-use sectors and contribute to a significant carbon dioxide emission (CO2) reduction. Centralised gas power plants and renewables become key source of electricity supply. Given the phaseout of nuclear generation, clear policy signals are required to ensure capacity is built to achieve a low-carbon energy system. At the same time, it is also essential to ensure consistency between the electricity sector and end-use energy policies. For the long-term carbon reduction target, some non-cost-effective conservation measures are important early in the period because they are available only at the time of building renovation.

Rather than focusing on models built on the basis of isolated, rational, optimizing agents, we should recognize that much simpler individuals following basic rules can collectively generate complex behavior. We have lessons to learn from studying the behavior of social insects for example. Noisy systems of interactive agents can generate aggregate phenomena such as sudden changes in the state of an economy or market, with no external shock. I give two examples of simple models of financial markets to illustrate this but would argue more generally that such models are indispensible if we are to understand aggregate economic phenomena.","[Kirman, Alan] Aix Marseille Univ, GREQAM, Marseille, France; [Kirman, Alan] EHESS, Paris, France",Aix-Marseille Universite,"Kirman, A (通讯作者)，721 Chemin St Marc, F-13410 Lambesc, France.",alan.kirman@univ-amu.fr,,,JSPS-ANR [ANR-11-FRJA-0002]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-11-FRJA-0002] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),JSPS-ANR(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"I would like to thank the editor and two referees for their help.

In consequence, more productive firms are more likely to match and the market is more efficient than the prediction of an alternative model where search is random. The main results of the experiment are that average firms offer wages that are close to or a little lower than the theoretical predictions but highly variable and workers apply more often to high offers but not to the extent predicted.

We develop a theory of endogenous bracketing, where people set goals to tackle self-control problems. Goals induce reference points that make substandard performance painful. Evaluating goals in a broadly bracketed mental account insulates an individual from exogenous risk of failure; but because decisions or risks in different tasks become substitutes there are incentives to deviate from goals that are absent under narrow bracketing.

In this paper we estimate Markov switching Taylor rules for three CEE economies: the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, all being inflation targeters. For the robustness purposes we estimate several different specifications of the Taylor rule: backward-and forward-looking, with inflation and inflation gap as explaining variables. As the analyzed CEE countries are small open economies additional variables are included to the standard Taylor rule: foreign interest rate and exchange rate. We find that two regimes of monetary policy may be distinguished: passive and active regime. The passive regime, which seems dominant, is characterized by strong smoothing of the interest rate path and little response to inflation and output gap developments. In the active regime the smoothing parameter decreases and the reaction to inflation and/ or output gap is stronger.","[Mackiewicz-Lyziak, Joanna] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Ul Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Mackiewicz-Lyziak, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Ul Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland.",jmackiewicz@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Mackiewicz-Łyziak, Joanna/ABA-4673-2020","Mackiewicz-Łyziak, Joanna/0000-0002-4545-8221",National Science Centre [DEC-2012/07/B/HS4/00318],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)",The author gratefully acknowledges the financial support of the National Science Centre under decision no.

This first study on a developing country also incorporates food security in a latent class framework to compute a new multidimensional deprivation index. It was found that chronic poverty and not transient poverty has a detrimental effect on multidimensional deprivation and thus current poverty alleviation programs should potentially be tailored according to these poverty types to effectively combat multidimensional deprivation. The finding that 20% of non-poor are most deprived with 85% of this group living in urban Vietnam also points to the need for a new form of targeted policy. (C) 2016 Society for Policy Modeling.

Yet there is a lack of clarity on how to measure progress towards UHC. We propose a 'mashup' index that captures both aspects of UHC: that everyone-irrespective of their ability-to-pay-gets the health services they need; and that nobody suffers undue financial hardship as a result of receiving care. We break service coverage into prevention and treatment, and financial protection into impoverishment and catastrophic spending; we use nationally representative household survey data to adjust population averages to capture inequalities between the poor and better off; we allow non-linear trade-offs between and within the two dimensions of the UHC index; and we express all indicators such that scores run from 0 to 100, and higher scores are better. In a sample of 24 countries for which we have detailed information on UHC-inspired reforms, we find a cluster of high-performing countries with UHC scores of between 79 and 84 (Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, and South Africa) and a cluster of low-performing countries with UHC scores in the range 35-57 (Ethiopia, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam). We find that countries have mostly improved their UHC scores between the earliest and latest years for which we have data-by about 5 points on average. However, the improvement has come from increases in receipt of key health interventions, not from reductions in the incidence of out-of-pocket payments on welfare.","[Wagstaff, Adam] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Cotlear, Daniel; Eozenou, Patrick Hoang-Vu] World Bank, Hlth Nutr & Populat Global Practice, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Buisman, Leander R.] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",The World Bank; The World Bank; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Wagstaff, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Cotlear, D; Eozenou, PHV (通讯作者)，World Bank, Hlth Nutr & Populat Global Practice, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Buisman, LR (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",awagstaff@worldbank.org; dcotlear@worldbank.org; peozenou@worldbank.org; buisman@bmg.eur.nl,"Wagstaff, Adam/A-7667-2009; Buisman, Leander/E-2151-2013","Wagstaff, Adam/0000-0003-4442-5070; Buisman, Leander/0000-0001-6767-4614",,,,,110,47,50,1,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

In the strategic Nash-equilibrium policy, governments trade-off welfare gains from protectionism and those that are due to spillovers from foreign exporters. The equilibrium degree of protectionism is decreasing in the strength of the spillover.

In China, the rising child education expenditure and the subsequent financial burden on families have attracted much research and policy attention in the recent years. Using 2007 and 2011 data from the Urban Household Education Surveys, our empirical study provides new evidence on the education expenditure level, ratio of expenditure to household income, and inequality in this expenditure. We also elucidate changes in China's household education expenditure and explore factors associated with such changes. From the analysis, we obtain the following findings. First, education expenditure incurred outside the school significantly contributes to increasing household education expenditure. Second, compulsory education programs are effective in curbing in-school education expenditure; however, it does not prevent the rapidly increasing education investment outside school. Third, education expenditure disproportionally increases with family income. In other words, a larger share of the income earned by lower income families is spent on children's education, compared to higher income families. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In China, institutional legacies continue to privilege the migration of worldng-age individuals who often leave children and elders behind in the rural areas. Up to now, the literature has treated children and elders analogously, labeling each group as left-behind. We argue that analysis of elder stayers needs to be more nuanced, distinguishing among differing groups of elders. Of these groups, those living alone without any adult children in the village are most at risk, while those living with other non-migrant adult children are much less affected by migration. Another group of elders, clearly affected by migration, are those caring for their grandchildren while the children's parents have migrated. Members of this latter group need to be distinguished from those living alone as they are dissimilar in many fundamental ways (age, working status, marital status) and face a very different set of challenges from those left behind (perhaps frail) and alone.

Differences in welfare benefit receipt diminish or disappear altogether after controlling for differences in characteristics of the two groups. The largest part of this is explained by differences in benefit take-up rather than benefit levels conditional on benefit receipt. The characteristics contributing most to native-immigrant welfare wedges in contributory benefits are differences in age. For non-contributory benefits, differences in household size and composition are most important. Overall results thus suggest a limited capability of selective immigration policies to reduce welfare benefit receipt among immigrants.","[Huber, Peter] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Huber, Peter] Mendel Univ Brno, Brno Fac Business & Econ, WIFO, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Oberdabernig, Doris A.] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Hallerstr 6, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",Mendel University in Brno; University of Bern,"Oberdabernig, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Hallerstr 6, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",huber@wifo.ac.at; doris.oberdabernig@wti.org,,"Huber, Peter/0000-0001-6263-6395; Oberdabernig, Doris/0000-0002-9913-3844","European Community's Seventh Framework Programme [290647]; NCCR Trade Regulation, University Bern","European Community's Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)); NCCR Trade Regulation, University Bern","We thank Wilfried Altzinger, Eddy Bekkers, Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma, Octavio Fernandez-Amador, Joseph Francois, Tom Horvath, Sona Kalantaryan, Thomas Leoni, Douglas Nelson, Klaus Nowotny, Wolf Reuter, Michael Pfaffermayr, Rupert Sausgruber, and the participants of a www.foreurope workshop in Mannheim as well as three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

The school finance reforms that began in the early 1970s and accelerated in the 1980s caused dramatic changes to the structure of K-12 education spending in the United States. To study the effect of these school finance reform-induced changes in public school spending on long-run adult outcomes, we link school spending and school finance reform data to detailed, nationally representative data on children born between 1955 and 1985 and followed through 2011. We use the timing of the passage of court-mandated reforms and their associated type of funding formula change as exogenous shifters of school spending, and we compare the adult outcomes of cohorts that were differentially exposed to school finance reforms, depending on place and year of birth. Event study and instrumental variable models reveal that a 10% increase in per pupil spending each year for all 12 years of public school leads to 0.31 more completed years of education, about 7% higher wages, and a 3.2 percentage point reduction in the annual incidence of adult poverty; effects are much more pronounced for children from low-income families. Exogenous spending increases were associated with notable improvements in measured school inputs, including reductions in student-to-teacher ratios, increases in teacher salaries, and longer school years.","[Jackson, C.

The model combines the discrete choice approach from agent-based modelling, where all capital is mobile, with the evolutionary finance framework where all growth is endogenous. Our results show that, if investors exhibit recency bias in evaluating portfolio managers' performance, even a small amount of freely flowing capital has a huge impact on the market dynamics and the survival of noise traders.

We use a self-constructed database based on World Council of Credit Unions data for the years 1990-2011 of cooperatives in 55 developing countries. Our empirical results are threefold. First, financial cooperatives tend to reach more members in countries where the commercial banking sector is weak. This validates their role as a banking market failure solution. Second, in the process of commercial bank expansion, financial cooperatives run the risk of being crowded out. Third, the relationship is actually complex, since financial cooperatives seem to benefit from some kind of bank presence, especially as far as savings mobilization is concerned.","[Perilleux, Anais] Catholic Univ Louvain, Fac Econ, IRES, CIRTES, Pl Montesquieu 3, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Perilleux, Anais] CERMi, Pl Montesquieu 3, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Vanroose, Annabel] Vrije Univ Brussel, Univ Libre Bruxelles, Ctr European Res Microfinance CERMi, Dept Appl Econ APEC, Av Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [D'Espallier, Bert] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, CERMi, Warmoesberg 26, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; KU Leuven,"Périlleux, A (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Fac Econ, IRES, CIRTES, Pl Montesquieu 3, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.;Périlleux, A (通讯作者)，CERMi, Pl Montesquieu 3, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.;Vanroose, A (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Univ Libre Bruxelles, Ctr European Res Microfinance CERMi, Dept Appl Econ APEC, Av Roosevelt 50, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.;D'Espallier, B (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, CERMi, Warmoesberg 26, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",anais.perilleux@uclouvain.be; avroose@ulb.ac.be; Bert.DEspallier@kuleuven.be,,"PERILLEUX, ANAIS/0000-0001-8586-8906; D'Espallier, Bert/0000-0001-7567-2520",Belgian Science Policy Office; AXA Research Fund; National Bank of Belgium,Belgian Science Policy Office(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund); National Bank of Belgium,"Anais Perilleux: Universite Catholique de Louvain (UCL), Faculty of Economics, IRES, CIRTES and CERMi, AXA Fellowship, Place Montesquieu, 3, 1348 Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, E-mail: anais.perilleux@uclouvain.be, 0032.473.53.39.24.

Oil exporters typically ignore below-ground assets when allocating these funds, and ignore above-ground assets when extracting oil. We present a unified stylized framework for considering both. Subsoil oil should alter a fund's portfolio through additional leverage and hedging. First-best spending should be a share of total wealth, and any unhedgeable volatility must be managed by precautionary savings. If oil prices are pro-cyclical, oil should be extracted faster than the Hotelling rule to generate a risk premium on oil wealth. Finally, we discuss how our analysis could improve the management of Norway's fund in practice. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In May 2014, the European Commission changed its specification of the NAIRU for several countries and lowered its NAIRU estimates - in the case of Spain from 26.6% to 20.7% for 2015. To test the dependence of the new NAIRU on unemployment versus structural factors, we run counterfactual simulations applying 1SD shocks to actual unemployment and to the structural variable - real unit labour costs. We find that the NAIRU in its new specification is still largely determined by actual unemployment.

High dimensionality brings challenges as well as new insights into the advancement of econometric theory. Because of their ability to effectively summarize information in large data sets, factor models have been increasingly used in economics and finance. The factors, estimated from the high-dimensional data, can, for example, help improve forecasting, provide efficient instruments, control for nonlinear unobserved heterogeneity, and capture cross-sectional dependence. This article reviews the theory on estimation and statistical inference of large factor models.

As a result, in near future EU countries will have to adopt much stricter long term fiscal policy that will be necessary for deleveraging process. In this context the aim of the research is to check whether one can find non-Keynesian effects of fiscal consolidations in Eurozone countries in last decade. If the answer is positive, then could these non-Keynesian effects be significant developing factor. The third scientific question concentrates on the ways the fiscal consolidations were implemented and the potential influence of consolidations strategies on short term growth. The research is based on European Commission and Eurostat fiscal and macroeconomic data for the years 1995-2013. The econometric dynamic panel model based on the concept of conditional convergence was applied. As a complementary method qualitative analysis of cases of significant contractions was used with the concentration on the differences between expansionary and conventional Keynesian cases of fiscal contractions. The research gives some arguments for existence of fiscal transitions channels leading to non-Keynesian effects of fiscal policy, which in the same time can be a factor of conditional convergence.","[Balcerzak, Adam P.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econ, Torun, Poland; [Pietrzak, Michal Bernard] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econometr & Stat, Torun, Poland; [Rogalska, Elzbieta] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Dept Microecon, Olsztyn, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Nicolaus Copernicus University; University of Warmia & Mazury,"Balcerzak, AP (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econ, Torun, Poland.",apb@umk.pl; michal.pietrzak@umk.pl; e.rogalska@interia.pl,"Balcerzak, Adam/D-7224-2016; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/I-4919-2014; Rogalska, Elżbieta/AAB-7586-2020","Balcerzak, Adam/0000-0003-0352-1373; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/0000-0002-9263-4478; Rogalska, Elżbieta/0000-0003-4995-5791",,,,,42,24,24,0,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-22596-8,,,,2016,,,,,,,483,496,,10.1007/978-3-319-22596-8_35,0.0,,,14,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ0HR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000416839900035,0

One is a baseline separable model (Gall, 2008) and the other assumes non-separable household preferences between consumption and money (Benchimol & Fourgans, 2012). We test both models by using rolling window Bayesian estimations over the last decade (2001-2013). The results of the presented dynamic analysis show that the sensitivity of output with respect to money shocks increased during the Dot-corn, Intifada, and Subprime crises. The role of monetary policy increased during these crises, especially with regard to inflation, even though the effectiveness of conventional monetary policy decreased during the Subprime crisis. In addition, the non separable model including money provides lower forecast errors than the baseline separable model without money, while the influence of money on output fluctuations can be seen as a good predictive indicator of bank and debt risks. By impacting and monitoring households' money holdings, policy makers could improve their forecasts and crisis management through models considering monetary aggregates.

In this article, I show that these interventions against FGC, rather than leading to the abandonment of the practice, can have unintended and potentially harmful effects on the way FGC is performed. Using DHS data from Senegal, I find that girls born in a year and a region where the law against FGC has been legally enforced are cut almost one year earlier. No significant effect of the law is found on the prevalence of FGC. Using a unique dataset from the region of Kolda in Senegal, I find a decreasing trend in age at cutting after the year of the introduction of the law sanctioning FGC. In both cases, I interpret the decrease in age as the result of a process of de-ritualisation and individualisation of FGC due to the push towards the secrecy of the practice.","[Camilotti, Giulia] Univ Namur, Ctr Res Econ Dev, Namur, Belgium",University of Namur,"Camilotti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Namur, Ctr Res Econ Dev, Namur, Belgium.",giulia.camilotti@unamur.be,,,European Union [290752]; FNRS (Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique),European Union(European Union (EU)); FNRS (Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS),"This project has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no. 290752.

High intensity conflict is particularly destructive of state capacity. In countries experiencing low intensity wars, other institutional factors may matter more than war.

In particular, it compares first-best agreements that require full co-operation by all players and second-best agreements that require only a minimum contribution level rather than full co-operation. The results show that when there is no punishment opportunity, second-best agreements work better than first-best agreements because they are more likely to be formed and kept. First-best agreements form at the beginning of the game, but non-compliant behaviour by some players causes co-operation to collapse. This result is reversed when there is a punishment opportunity. In this case, first-best agreements work better than second-best agreements as they allow groups to establish a common behavioural standard, deter violations, and achieve very high levels of co-operation.","[Dannenberg, Astrid] Univ Kassel, Environm & Behav Econ, D-34127 Kassel, Germany; [Dannenberg, Astrid] Univ Gothenburg, Environm Econ, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",Universitat Kassel; University of Gothenburg,"Dannenberg, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Environm & Behav Econ, D-34127 Kassel, Germany.;Dannenberg, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Environm Econ, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",dannenberg@uni-kassel.de,,,"Swedish Research Council Formas (COMMONS, the program Human Cooperation to Manage Natural Resources)","Swedish Research Council Formas (COMMONS, the program Human Cooperation to Manage Natural Resources)","Swedish Research Council Formas (COMMONS, the program Human Cooperation to Manage Natural Resources).",,23,7,8,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The quantitative comparative assessment of the results of those reforms are expressed through different indexes developed by different organizations. We have tried to develop theoretic and methodological points that and create an integral index that will include as many indexes as possible that reveal the comparative effectiveness of reforms in various areas. The methodological approach of our assessment is based on two parameters: 1. the change of the score of the country by different indexes for two periods of time, 2. the change of the rank of the country by different indexes for two periods of time.

Considering that the current economic growth of Croatia was based on traditional, old economy, indicating that the application of information communication technology is falling behind developed countries, Foreign direct investments, in generally, increased dramatically in the last few years, but the investments are not distributed equally and developing countries, such as Croatia, face difficulties in attracting foreign investors. A research is conducted on the cause link between the foreign investments in information technology sector and two variables - GDP growth and export. By conducting scientifically-based analysis this paper proves that investments in the information communication technology sector contribute positively to the growth of GDP and export. The hypotheses that are confirmed are also compared to scientific research of previous authors for different European Union countries. Except for unquestionable positive effects, the paper summarizes possible negative effects of foreign direct investments in information technology sector presenting results of mostly foreign researches. In conclusion the paper suggests that the foreign investments are the main key for development of information communication technology sector making it important precondition for achieving better competitiveness. Methods used in this paper are methods of compilation, statistical methods, descriptive method of analysis and methods of time series. The aim of this paper is to examine, analyze and define to which extent foreign direct investments (FDI) in information communication technology (ICT), affect economic growth of Croatia.","[Dordevic, Suzana; Buljat, Maja] Univ Appl Sci Baltazar Zapresic, Vladimira Novaka 23, Zapresic 10290, Croatia",,"Dordevic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Baltazar Zapresic, Vladimira Novaka 23, Zapresic 10290, Croatia.",suzana.djordjevic@bak.hr; maja.buljat@bak.hr,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,163,169,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600015,0

The funding sources for these interventions come mostly from structures of EU. The EU therefore calls for rigorous analyses, especially counterfactual evaluations, of the effectiveness of these interventions. There exist many globally accepted counterfactual methods for evaluation. The paper deals with analysis of selected methods in the field of their applicability, restrictions and assumptions of their use. We focused on the most commonly used counterfactual methods such as propensity score matching with exact matching technique and with nearest neighbor matching, difference in difference method and exact matching method. All these ex-post methods evaluate the intervention as a whole. The main principle of counterfactual methods is to compare the results of employability and sustainability of supported jobseekers with eventuality that would have happened if the intervention has not been granted. This comparison is made by matching the jobseekers that have been supported by the intervention with the individuals that have not obtained the grant based on their individual characteristics and characteristics of their living environment. The result of the evaluation is whether the evaluated intervention provides the desired effect or not.","[Durica, Marek] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Durica, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",marek.durica@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Durica, Marek/P-7170-2015","Durica, Marek/0000-0002-2118-166X",[Vega 1/0806/14],,This paper is an output of the science project Vega 1/0806/14 Kalkulacia SCR na krytie rizik nezivotneho poistenia v sulade s potrebami praxe.,,17,1,1,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,399,407,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800050,0

The genius of the work comes from the sophisticated tools, previously thought to be the product of the twentieth century, he utilized to analyse the market. These tools included the market failures of externalities and asymmetric information; government failures due to unintended consequences of public policies; and a proposal for regulating the market designed to alleviate these failings.

It is present everywhere, all over the world, in every aspect of social, technological and economic development. The most known examples of cooperation are strategic alliances, fusions, clusters, business networks and many other groups in which two or more different companies or individuals are present. The base for the right working of cooperation is management. Cooperation management not only handles, coordinates and support the creation of relationships in global dynamic market, but also evaluates these relations. On base of this, companies can make better decision regarding the future local and global interaction in the form of cooperation. One way how to evaluate these relations is by using prediction models. By using these models companies are able to calculate whether the cooperation would be appropriate and whether it would bring an added value the synergetic effect which is a phenomenon which would be not achieved without the mutual cooperation of two independent companies. In this paper the theoretical background of cooperation in business environment is discussed. After, indicators as well as quantitative approaches which are helpful in this procedure are presented. Finally, we suggest possible particular implementations how prediction models could be used in forming cooperation process.","[Holubcik, Martin] Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Dept Management Theories, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01001, Slovakia; [Falat, Lukas] Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Dept Macro & Microecon, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01001, Slovakia",University of Zilina; University of Zilina,"Falát, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Dept Macro & Microecon, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01001, Slovakia.",martin.holubcik@fri.uniza.sk; lukas.falat@fri.uniza.sk,"Falat, Lukas/GXM-8404-2022; Holubčík, Martin/AAE-9480-2021","Falat, Lukas/0000-0002-2597-7059; Holubčík, Martin/0000-0002-5200-2441",Project Slovak Scientific Grant [VEGA 1/0942/14]; Slovak Scientific Grant [VEGA 1/0621/14],Project Slovak Scientific Grant; Slovak Scientific Grant,This paper is an output of the science project Slovak Scientific Grant VEGA 1/0942/14: Dynamic modelling and soft techniques in prediction of economic variables; and Slovak Scientific Grant VEGA 1/0621/14: Marketing management in cooperative environment Proposal of strategic cooperation management implementation model.,,19,3,3,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,670,+,,,,,,3,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800083,0

In this article, on the basis of keyword searches in newspaper articles we construct several versions of the so-called Recession-word Index (RWI) for Germany and Switzerland and exploit its use for forecasting. Our main findings are the following. First, we show that augmenting benchmark autoregressive models with the RWI leads to improvement in accuracy of one-step-ahead forecasts of GDP growth compared with those obtained by benchmark models. Second, the accuracy of out-of-sample forecasts obtained with models augmented with the RWI is comparable to that of models augmented with established economic indicators, such as the Ifo Business Climate Index and the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment for Germany, and the KOF Economic Barometer and the Purchasing Managers Index in manufacturing for Switzerland. Our results are robust to changes in estimation/forecast samples, the use of rolling versus expanding estimation windows and the inclusion of a web-based recession indicator from Google Trends. As our indices are timely and simple to construct, they could be replicated in countries or regions where no reliable economic indicators exist or their provision is very costly.","[Iselin, David; Siliverstovs, Boriss] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Iselin, D (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland.",iselin@kof.ethz.ch,"Siliverstovs, Boriss/T-2405-2019",,,,,,30,9,9,2,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The media dataset includes articles about 42 listed financial companies that were published in three major securities newspapers from 2004 through 2013. A multidimensional perspective analysis is chosen to capture both the amount and content sentiment of media coverage. Specifically, the quantity model is built to investigate the impact of article amount on capital flow, while the quality model aims to capture the difference in media impact between positive news and negative news. In order to control the unobserved heterogeneity of firms, fixed effects model is employed. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that media coverage can significantly influence the capital flow decisions of investors; this holds for both the quantity aspect and the quality aspect. The quantity model shows that after controlling for risk factors such as size and book-to-market ratio, more capital flow will be allocated to the high-return stocks with high media coverage. The quality model finds that stocks with positive media coverage will be allocated more capital flow than those with negative media coverage, given an identical stock return. Furthermore, a simple but effective identification strategy is constructed to explore the mechanism behind this media coverage and capital flow relationship. Our results suggest that the information view does not offer sufficient explanation power; instead media coverage tends to be more about attention-grabbing than conveying information.","[Jiang, Yang; Ma, Weizhong; Yan, Xiangbin] Harbin Inst Technol, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Yan, XB (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",jiangyanghit@126.com; mawz@hit.edu.cn; xbyan@hit.edu.cn,"Yan, xiangbin/AAF-8402-2019; Jiang, Yang/O-6259-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71171067, 71531013]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors thank the editor and anonymous reviewers for valuable comments and suggestions.

Bridging the gap between the research economy and commercial economy (Valley of Death) remains one of the key concerns of the mature and institutionalised innovation ecosystems. However, many of the emerging innovation ecosystems still suffer from underdeveloped institutional frameworks and fragmented ties of actors, which is a more pronounced challenge than Valley of Death. It is important to take into consideration the specific needs of different innovation ecosystems in the context of the current EU innovation and regional policies (recently synergised under smart specialization). The development of sustainable innovation ecosystem requires a different mentality than the traditional institutional-regulatory approach adopted in the context of national innovation systems. It means the search for delicate balance between the supply-side and demand-side interventions, public and private, openness and ownership, long-term and short-term perspectives, quality of elements and their relationships, adequate policy actions and smooth functioning of the invisible hand. The emerging innovation ecosystems need to complement their entrepreneurial profiles with stronger institutional frameworks and innovation support mechanisms, whereas the mature institutionalised innovation ecosystems should not over-rely on institutional, supply-side solutions, but strengthen the entrepreneurial culture that is even more critical to innovation success.","[Jucevicius, Giedrius] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Daukanto St 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Juceviciene, Rita; Gaidelys, Vaidas] Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino St 50, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Kalman, Aniko] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Muegyetem 3, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary",Vytautas Magnus University; Kaunas University of Technology; Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Jucevicius, G (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Daukanto St 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania.",giedrius.jucevicius@vdu.lt; rita.juceviciene@ktu.lt; vaidas.gaidelys@ktu.lt; kalman.a@eik.bme.hu,"Jucevicius, Giedrius/HPI-3903-2023; Kalman, Aniko/B-1903-2013","Kalman, Aniko/0000-0002-0225-7921",Research Council of Lithuania [MIP-15601],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),The paper was prepared with the support of the Research Council of Lithuania under the research project Enabling the self-organization in contemporary innovation ecosystems: perspective of latecomer economy (MIP-15601).,,40,19,23,4,114,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We extend the nonmonetary overlapping-generations model of Gertler and present a small synthesis model that combines the setup of Gertler with a New Keynesian structure, implying that the short-run dynamics related to monetary policy can be compared with that of the standard New Keynesian model. In sum, the model offers a New Keynesian platform that can be used to characterize the response of macroeconomic variables to demographic shocks, similarly to the responses to technology or monetary policy shocks. We offer such characterizations for flexible and sticky price equilibria. Empirically, we calibrate the model to demographic developments projected for the euro area. The main finding is that the projected slowdown in population growth and the increase in longevity contribute slowly over time to a decline in the equilibrium interest rate.","[Kara, Engin] Univ Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England; [von Thadden, Leopold] European Cent Bank, Xian, Peoples R China; [von Thadden, Leopold] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Mainz, Germany",University of Bristol; European Central Bank; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Kara, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, 8 Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England.",engin.kara@bristol.ac.uk,,,,,,,32,25,26,3,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

In this paper, we provide quantitative equilibrium solutions to the model based on our parameter estimates, and compare them with a social planner's solution. We find that the socially optimal growth rate is double that of the market equilibrium growth rate when firm differences in the ability to create productive products are highly persistent as a consequence of the business stealing externality present in the model. The welfare loss of the decentralized economy relative to that of the planner is equivalent to a 21% tax on the planner consumption path. The planner's solution differs from the decentralized economy in that it discourages innovation by low ability innovators as well as entry. We introduce two mechanisms that temper the strength of the negative externality: Transitory firm types and the possibility of buyouts. We show that both sharply reduce the inefficiency due to innovation by low ability innovators. But with caveats: If firm types are completely transitory, then the notion of firm heterogeneity is for practical purposes lost. Buyouts improve efficiency, but the efficiency gain depends significantly on the strength of the innovator's ability to extract rents from incumbents through the buyout. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Already in 2012, cluster became a regional and now networks more than a hundred manufacturers of food, drinks and handicrafts; providers of tourist services, as well as public institutions from five Slavonian counties. The results of the primary research conducted in February 2015 showed that one-third of surveyed cluster members thought that it was most appropriate to implement networking in the tourism sector at the regional level, and that the current cluster activities partially justified the expectations of the members. Assuming that the reason for this lies in the fact that, when it comes to marketing activities of cluster, it acted only in the promotion, the Cluster Assembly, held in January 2016, decided to intensify the activities of cluster in the field of creating a product, distribution (sales), pricing policies and internal processes and to examine the opinion of the members of the cluster with respect to those activities. For this purpose, a new primary research was conducted in order to conceive whether cluster members have been satisfied with the existing model of networking; then, in which activities, when it comes to promotion, internal marketing and sales, they intend to participate; whether they support the concept of creating a unique tourism products under the umbrella brand of the cluster, and the concept of removing price adding to the breakthrough in the tourist market, and what they thing about the idea of selling products (and services) of the cluster memebers through the so-called visitor centers. The aim of the work will be to get the results on the basis of which it will be possible to improve cluster activities in all the key elements of the marketing mix.","[Loncaric, Biljana] Tourist Board Slavonski Brod, Victory Sq 28-1, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia",,"Loncaric, B (通讯作者)，Tourist Board Slavonski Brod, Victory Sq 28-1, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia.",info@tzgsb.hr,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,931,942,,,,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600093,0

A panel regression estimation model is used to identify the determinants of dividend policy within Malaysian firms. These determinants are then examined across eight different industries - Technology, Industrial, Consumer Noncyclical, Basic Material, Communication, Consumer Cyclical, Diversified and Energy - to investigate possible divergences in the determinants of dividend payouts in the context of an emerging market. Empirical findings show that firm size, leverage position, and profitability are significantly and inversely related to the dividend policy of firms in Malaysia. However, the industry-specific determinants of dividend policy display a number of variances that could plausibly be used as an indication of the selection of stocks in specific industries by potential investors. The results indicate that agency cost is positively related to dividend policy for the Basic Material industry. In addition, size and leverage play an important role in determining dividend payout for firms in the Technology and Consumer Noncyclical industries. For the Industrial sector, the size and profitability significantly affect the dividend policy of firms. However, the results failed to display any significant results for the Energy and Consumer Cyclical industries.","[Mahdzan, Nurul Shahnaz; Zainudin, Rozaimah] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Shahri, Nikoo Karimi] Univ Malaya, Grad Sch Business, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya,"Mahdzan, NS (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",n_shahnaz@um.edu.my,"ZAINUDIN, ROZAIMAH/B-9626-2010; Mahdzan, Nurul Shahnaz/B-9441-2010; Mahdzan, Nurul Shahnaz/GQO-8871-2022; Mahdzan, Nurul Shahnaz/M-9161-2019; ZAINUDIN, ROZAIMAH/GQA-9048-2022; zainudin, rozaimah/AAA-4984-2021","ZAINUDIN, ROZAIMAH/0000-0002-9929-8753; Mahdzan, Nurul Shahnaz/0000-0003-4700-9654; Mahdzan, Nurul Shahnaz/0000-0003-4700-9654; Mahdzan, Nurul Shahnaz/0000-0003-4700-9654; ZAINUDIN, ROZAIMAH/0000-0002-9929-8753; zainudin, rozaimah/0000-0002-9929-8753",University of Malaya Research Grant (UMRG) particularly the Equitable Society Research Cluster [RP015D-13SBS],University of Malaya Research Grant (UMRG) particularly the Equitable Society Research Cluster,This work was supported by the University of Malaya Research Grant (UMRG) particularly the Equitable Society Research Cluster under grant no.

It interprets the debate as a renewed confrontation between the two different classical methodological paths of research in GEE, the Paretian and the Walrasian ones. What emerges from this examination is a picture of different approaches and theories in competition, in particular on the issue of the relationship between theory and the real world.

The country's leaders chose socialist democracy philosophy for the country with a commanding role for the government. A regime of bureaucratic controls involving licenses and permits was established to govern economic activity. The economy was closed from the outside world and industries were directed to focus on import substitution. The rate of growth in GDP was quite low until the end of the 1980s. Triggered by an economic crisis in 1991, the government liberalized the economy and started a process of aligning with the global economy. In the last 25 years since liberalization, the Indian economy has made rapid strides and is now one of the fastest growing countries in the world. However much needs to be done to make India an advanced and globally competitive country.

The results show that the convergence algorithm has rejected the null hypothesis of convergence for all countries in most of the sectors. Also, we found evidence that the productivity clusters for total economy and other sectors are very different in terms of number and countries. Additionally, even if the productivity gaps in the region have been reduced, we still notice significant disparities between countries. The clustering algorithm shows countries which have a high productivity growth in some sectors and a low productivity growth in others. This reveals the prevalence of idiosyncratic factors in productivity determinants.

Capital imports per se do not affect the skill premium; in contrast, their composition does. While imports of R&D-intensive capital equipment raise the skill premium, imports of less innovative equipment lower it. We estimate that R&D-intensive capital is complementary to skilled workers, whereas less innovative capital equipment is complementary to unskilled labor-which explains the composition effect. This mechanism has substantial explanatory power. Variation in tariffs, freight costs and overall barriers to trade, over time and across types of capital, favors imports of skill-complementary capital over other types. We calculate that reductions in barriers to trade increase inequality substantially in developing countries through the composition channel. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We employ recently developed composite indicators of systemic stress (CISS for the Euro Area and NFCI for the US), which reflect financial conditions from different financial sectors. The results from a time-varying Bayesian vector autoregression with stochastic volatility indicate that the degree of transmission depends significantly on the time and on the level of stress. The analysis reveals that Romania responds negatively, similarly to the developed economies, to the financial systemic stress as regards the real economy, but differently as regards the monetary policy. Finally, the results emphasize that financial interconnectedness with the Euro Area is more important than that with the US.","[Saman, Corina] Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania",,"Saman, C (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania.",csaman@ipe.ro,"Saman, Corina/AAC-7452-2020","Saman, Corina/0000-0002-5855-7771","Ministry of National Education, CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-II-ID-PCE-2012-4-0631]","Ministry of National Education, CNCS - UEFISCDI","This work was supported by a grant of Ministry of National Education, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-ID-PCE-2012-4-0631.",,23,6,6,0,1,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

It is assumed that claims held on intermediaries cannot be fully enforced such that intermediation is subject to intermediary equity requirements. It is shown that competitive equilibria are not constrained efficient whenever the aggregate amount of intermediary equity in the economy is low enough to limit production. Specifically, a constrained social planner can achieve a Pareto improvement by creating long-term rents for intermediaries, which immediately reduces intermediary equity requirements. The constrained-efficient allocation can be implemented by a positive tax on future intermediary activity.","[Schroth, Josef] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada",Bank of Canada,"Schroth, J (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, 234 Laurier Ave West, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",jschroth@bankofcanada.ca,,"Schroth, Josef/0000-0001-7740-7018","University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Dissertation Year Fellowship","University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Dissertation Year Fellowship","Bank of Canada, 234 Laurier Avenue West, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0G9, Canada (e-mail: jschroth@bankofcanada. ca).

Our analysis is not restricted to tourism-related FDI such as hotels and restaurants, as in the literature, but covers general FDI in the framework of FDI dynamics, because tourism-FDI interactions are not in reality restricted to typical tourism-related FDI. The analysis results reveal that enhanced inbound foreign tourism exhibits spillovers of inward FDI beyond tourism-related sectors. Hence, although policies related to FDI promotion and tourism enhancement are often planned, executed, and evaluated independently under different government jurisdictions, coordination is recommended, because these policies interact with each other in efforts to attain economic development goals.

We found significant variation in costs and impacts across coastal provinces, with some provinces such as Newfoundland and Labrador experiencing only marginal costs/impacts, and others such as British Columbia experiencing costs as high as $21 billion in welfare over the period. Coastal adaptation investments were supported on economics grounds. Overall, this study provides the first (and preliminary) provincial economic impact estimates of climate-induced SLR and storm surge, as well as adaptation investments, in Canada. Additional research is needed to refine the analysis in order to produce reliable estimates that can be used to guide coastal adaptation policies in Canada.","[Withey, P.] St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Econ, Antigonish, NS B2G 1C0, Canada; [Lantz, V.

Recently, there has been a great proliferation of works aggregating sustainability criteria by using diverse multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. A number of review papers summarising these techniques have been published. During the past few years, new approaches for hybrid MCDM (HMCDM) methods have been developed, but they have not yet been completely reviewed. This article aims to fill this gap and to summarise publications related to the application of HMCDM. The current study is limited solely to papers available in the Thomson Reuters Web of Science Core Collection database. The main findings report that HMCDM methods have been increasingly applied for supporting decisions in different domains of sustainability. The most frequently used methods emphasise the advantages of hybrid approaches over individual methods, and we conclude that they can assist decision-makers in handling information such as stakeholders' preferences, interconnected or contradictory criteria, and uncertain environments. The main contribution of this work is identifying hybrid approaches as improvements for decision-making related to sustainability issues, while also promoting future application of the approaches.","[Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras; Antucheviciene, Jurgita; Turskis, Zenonas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Govindan, Kannan] Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Sustainable Engn Operat Management, Dept Technol & Innovat, Odense, Denmark",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; University of Southern Denmark,"Zavadskas, EK (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Vilnius, Lithuania.",edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt,"Turskis, Zenonas/H-3035-2018; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Antucheviciene, Jurgita/W-6112-2018; Govindan, Kannan/M-5996-2017; Turskis, Zenonas/AAA-9159-2021","Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X; Antucheviciene, Jurgita/0000-0002-1734-3216; Govindan, Kannan/0000-0002-6204-1196; Turskis, Zenonas/0000-0002-5835-9388",,,,,219,185,189,4,73,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

This paper extends the literature by examining what hedge-ratio estimation method yields the most effective hedging performance of REIT futures. We include a wide range of commonly used methods and apply them to all four global markets which have developed REIT index futures (i.e., Australia, Europe, Japan & the U.S.). By adopting an out-of-sample analytical framework, our results show that there exist multiple methods in each market that can be considered best performers and the mix of best performers varies across markets. Furthermore, our results suggest that constant hedge-ratio methods are not necessarily inferior to their time-varying counterparts, and that a more complicated GARCH model does not necessarily lead to better performance than a more parsimonious one. Finally, only DCC and BEKK are found to rank consistently among the best performers across all four markets when we examine collectively the results using different out-of-sample periods. However, this does not mean that hedgers will always want to use them. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this chapter, with the use of simulations, fourteen aggregation procedures with different degrees of expert evaluation inaccuracies and for different sizes of decision problems are examined. Among the researched procedures there were: classical ones, based on column sums and a eigenvector of a matrix; ones based on the method of least squares using error minimization; as well as the method of a data envelope. As a result, procedures are indicated which aggregate a decision-maker's assessment in the most precise manner and which find solutions closest to a reference.","[Ziemba, Pawel] Jacob Paradyz Univ Appl Sci Gorzow Wielkopolski, Dept Technol, Teatralna 25, PL-66400 Gorzow Wielkopolski, Poland; [Watrobski, Jaroslaw; Jankowski, Jaroslaw; Piwowarski, Mateusz] West Pomeranian Univ Technol Szczecin, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Syst Engn, Zolnierska 49, PL-71210 Szczecin, Poland",West Pomeranian University of Technology,"Ziemba, P (通讯作者)，Jacob Paradyz Univ Appl Sci Gorzow Wielkopolski, Dept Technol, Teatralna 25, PL-66400 Gorzow Wielkopolski, Poland.",pziemba@pwsz.pl; jwatrobski@wi.zut.edu.pl; jjankowski.pl@gmail.com; mpiwowarski@wi.zut.edu.pl,"Wątróbski, Jarosław/ABI-7844-2020; Piwowarski, Mateusz/AFN-4625-2022; Ziemba, Paweł/O-7279-2018","Wątróbski, Jarosław/0000-0002-4415-9414; Piwowarski, Mateusz/0000-0003-2541-1909; Ziemba, Paweł/0000-0002-4414-8547",,,,,66,19,19,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-28419-4; 978-3-319-28417-0,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,227,243,,10.1007/978-3-319-28419-4_15,0.0,,,17,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF9OA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385789700015,0

While quantitative studies have sort to confirm these links using econometric proxies, few empirical accounts have shown how these proxies, or indeed the institutions they seek to represent actually influenced economic growth. This study helps fill that gap by testing whether evidence in Zambia's post-colonial history supports a proposed econometric link between its institutional quality and its slow economic growth. Support for this link is found in foreign investors' interpretation of declining institutional constraint on Zambia's President as the potential for increased policy volatility, and as such an economic inducement to delay critical investment to Zambia's capital constrained economy. These findings add weight to the institutional argument in general, as well as present one concrete example in history of a mechanism through which institutional quality affected economic growth.","[Barton, Stuart John] Univ Cambridge, Corpus Christi Coll, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Barton, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Corpus Christi Coll, Cambridge, England.",sjb279@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

In scenarios when the investors are more similar with respect to their expected consumption shares, return volatilities can nevertheless be higher than in cases when they are very different.

The evolution of this literature has largely consisted of attempts to solve the problems and answer the criticisms arising from earlier studies. One of the most common criticisms is that previous work concentrates on the bivariate relationship, energy consumption-economic growth. Many authors try to overcome this critique using control variables. However, the choice of these variables has been ad hoc, made according to the subjective economic rationale of the authors. Our contribution to this literature is to apply a robust probabilistic model to select the explanatory variables from a large set of potential candidates in the case of the US from 1949 to 2010, not only for an aggregate analysis but also for a sector analysis. The results highlight the critical role of public spending and energy intensity in the explanation of growth. Furthermore, since the study reveals different explanatory variables for each sector, it indicates the importance of policy decisions specifically aimed at different sectors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines the flip side of political correctness as analyzed in Morris (2001) to shed some light on the elusive notion of political incorrectness and elucidate its equilibrium and welfare properties. We show that there are circumstances in which unbiased experts deliberately take a politically incorrect stance out of reputational concerns and identify key elements which give rise to this perverse reputational incentive. The results suggest that political incorrectness cannot necessarily be viewed as a sign of blunt honesty when informed experts have long-term reputational concerns. We also examine the welfare consequences of political incorrectness and argue that this form of information manipulation can be beneficial under some conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier BM.

This paper explores whether inequity aversion then leads to greater public goods spending. Using both theory and a laboratory experiment we show inequity aversion generally decreases inequity within a coalition by limiting proposer power. However, this does not always mean greater public goods contributions because the types of proposals passed change in equilibrium. In addition, the experiment investigates the theoretical prediction that increasing players' relative preference for pork can increase public goods contributions. We show that while average public goods contributions remain unchanged, there is evidence at the individual level that subjects hold out for higher public goods contributions as predicted.

When input-output transactions tables are available and are given at factor cost, as in India, modifications based on such tables can give a rough approximation to market price estimates of sectoral shares. After such adjustments, making India's relative GDP shares comparable with those of other LDC's, and also controlling for China-influence, we have assessed the Indian sectoral structure in the context of the current international experience.

Although the coalition steps up its mitigation effort in the transition from autarky to trade, world emissions rise and thus constitute a 'green paradox of trade liberalization.'

We characterize the rules satisfying three wellknown invariance axioms: consistency, composition up, and claims truncation invariance. They are priority-augmented versions of the standard weighted constrained equal awards rules, also known as weighted gains methods (Moulin, 2000): individuals are sorted into priority classes; the resource is distributed among the individuals in the first priority class using a weighted constrained equal awards rule; if some of the resource is left over, then it is distributed among the individuals in the second priority class, again using a weighted constrained equal awards rule; the distribution carries on in this way until the resource is exhausted. Our characterization extends to a generalized version of the claims problem where there are multiple divisible and indivisible resources and individuals have claims on each of these.

This study examines both the elasticity of driving with respect to changing gasoline prices and heterogeneity in this elasticity by geography, the fuel economy of the vehicle, and the age of the vehicle. We use detailed annual vehicle-level emissions inspection test data from Pennsylvania that include odometer readings, inspection zip codes, and extensive vehicle characteristics. We estimate a short-run gasoline price elasticity of driving demand of -0.10, and find substantial heterogeneity in this responsiveness. The elasticity is largely driven by low fuel economy vehicles, as well as vehicles between 3 and 7 years old. Our findings help reconcile some of the recent literature and provide guidance on the magnitude of the direct rebound effect from light duty vehicle energy efficiency policies. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper explains its causes from the perspective of behavioral finance. The results are as follows: first, Chinese commercial banks' operational risk loss events show an upward trend, then downward trend beginning in 2003 and currently an upward trend again; second, through the empirical analysis, this paper simulates the extreme value distribution function, finds the optimal threshold, and calculates the VaR and ES of the operational risk of Chinese commercial banks and compare them at different confidence levels; and third, in view of behavioral finance theory, overconfidence and loss aversion contribute to high internal fraud incidence.

We find that the deployment of broadband in 1997-2011 promoted rural employment and wage growth in service industries. Goods industries were not impacted.

Models are often compared with each other, in an attempt to analyze which model is best or fits reality better. Instead, I suggest that these international trade models can often be blended to take account of finite changes when, as a country develops, the appropriate model to be used changes as the pattern of production changes. Trade allows countries to produce fewer commodities than it consumes, and which commodities are selected to be produced may change as the economy grows in the size of its endowment bundle and/or technology changes. At issue is not only the question of which commodities are produced, but also how many commodities are produced, especially with reference to the number of productive factors.","[Jones, Ronald W.] Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Jones, RW (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",ronald.jones@rochester.edu,,,JSPS [23000001]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23000001] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This paper is presented at the May 2015 IEFS Japan meeting, celebrating Fumio Dei's contribution to the IEFS Japan.

Displaced farmers compete for a very limited number ofjobs on the investment farm and spillovers to the remaining local farmers are rare. In the second scenario, where the investor plants cash crops, potential spillovers through contract farming are larger and production is more labor-intensive and hence provides better employment prospects.

Discussions aiming at the role of human resource in educational communities are progressing in past years. From the mobility of human resource in an organization, retaining human assets or reducing the mobility to the lowest are considered as the professional commitment of human resource and the direction for efforts. A new viewpoint about the role of human resource reveals that the role of human resource is to change social capital into the driving force of competitive advantages of an organization. It might affect the presentation of different roles of human resource in various corporate characteristics. For this reason, the effects of high-tech corporate characteristics on social capital and role of human resource management are discussed in this study. Aiming at Kunshan High-tech Industrial Development Zone, the management and the employees in the manufacturers are distributed 1000 copies of questionnaires, and 683 valid copies are retrieved, with the retrieval rate 68%. The research results show 1. significantly positive effects of social capital on the role of human resource, 2. remarkably positive effects of corporate characteristics on social capital, and 3. notably positive effects of corporate characteristics on the role of human resource.

It works not through an increase in disposable income but through moderation of deflation. Thus, countries that have lapsed into long-run stagnation should expand government spending that directly creates employment in order to reduce the deflationary gap. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

For the first two time consistent models, we identify the well-posedness conditions and derive the semi-analytical optimal policies. For the third time inconsistent model, we assume that the investor is aware of the time inconsistency but is unable to commit to his initial plan of action. Then, we reformulate the model into an intrapersonal game model and derive the semi-analytical subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (time consistent) policy under well-posedness condition. All the three policies take a piece-wise linear feedback form. Our analysis of the three models not only partially explains the well documented phenomena of non-participation puzzle and horizon effect, but also extends the two fund separation theorem into multi-period S-shaped utility setting and pushes forward the study on time inconsistency issue incurred by probability weighting.

The main findings of this research are as follows. First, there is a general ethnic bias against ethnic minority firms in receiving trade credit Second, ethnic minority firms are less eager than Han firms to build interfirm trust with their business partners by offering trade credit, which is partly due to their financing constraints. Third, ethnic minority firms have less trust of other ethnic minority firms in offering trade credit Fourth, these trade credit practices by ethnic minority firms tend to be more pronounced in those surviving after 2005.

First, we build a financial stress index to identify the starting dates of systemic financial crises for each country in the panel. Second, early warning indicators for the assessment and prediction of systemic risk are selected in a two-step approach; we find relevant prediction horizons for each indicator by a univariate logit model followed by the application of Bayesian model averaging to identify the most useful indicators. Finally, we observe the performance of the constructed EWS over both horizons on the Czech data and find that the model over the long horizon outperforms the EWS over the short horizon. For both horizons, out-of-sample probability estimates do not deviate substantially from their in-sample estimates, indicating a good out-of-sample performance for the Czech Republic.

However, the improved robustness of financial markets, as captured by the development of security markets, improvement in the quality of banking supervision, and removal of stringent restrictions on interest rates and international capital, has a negative and lagged effect.

Nevertheless, few studies have analysed the relationship between physical attractiveness and sporting performance. To the best of our knowledge this study is the first to investigate the relationship between physical attractiveness of professional (female tennis players and their sporting success in terms of prize money earned and probabilities of winning. Moreover, we can determine further factors which have a significant influence on the prize money earned and the likelihood to win a tennis match. Therefore, we investigate professional female tennis players, which were ranked in the top 100 of the tennis world ranking in one selected week in 2011. OLS regressions demonstrate a significant positive relationship between physical attractiveness and sporting success in terms of prize money for the years 2012 and 2013 as well as for the whole career. Further significant drivers are the BMI and its square, the number of played tournaments and the career duration. Furthermore, the study examines whether the probability of winning an individual tennis match is influenced by physical attractiveness. The logit model used shows that the larger the difference in physical attractiveness, the higher the probability of winning for the more attractive tennis player in individual matches. Moreover, difference in world ranking place and difference in the number of years as a professional tennis player have a significant impact on the winning probability.","[Bakkenbuell, Linn-Brit; Kiefer, Stephanie] Univ Munster, Inst Org Econ, D-48151 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Bakkenbüll, LB (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Inst Org Econ, Scharnhorststr 100, D-48151 Munster, Germany.",Linn-Brit.Bakkenbuell@uni-muenster.de; Stephanie.Kiefer@uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,49,9,10,1,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2015,68,4,,,,,443,458,,10.1111/kykl.12090,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CT8TW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363090400001,0

The immediate impact of a risk-off shock is an increase in net private inflows to Switzerland, mostly driven by a reduction in Swiss residents' net purchases of foreign debt securities and reduced foreign exposure by Swiss banks. Given that the bulk of capital movements related to risk-off episodes is driven by decisions of Swiss residents, capital flow management policies that discriminate based on the residency of the investor (capital controls) are not likely to be effective at reducing the impact of risk-off episodes. However, prudential policies that limit leveraging or foreign exposure by Swiss banks may diminish the volatility of capital flows during risk-off episodes.","Int Monetary Fund & Itau Unibanco, Washington, DC 20431 USA",,"de Carvalho, I (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund & Itau Unibanco, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",idecarvalhofilho@gmail.com,,"de Carvalho Filho, Irineu/0000-0002-5118-1433",,,,,28,4,4,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

In contrast, major international surveys show less than a third of internal migrants as motivated by employment reasons. Using Swedish panel data for the years 2001-2009, this paper addresses this disconnect by examining the full distribution of migrant income changes. Results from initial CEM matching and quantile regression suggest that large returns to internal migration are mostly captured by the higher educated, those initially low in the income distribution and those heading into the largest metropolitan regions. Much if not most of migration outcomes are however a wash and indeed often negative in terms of pay-off. This suggests models of average outcomes as insufficient in addressing human capital motivated migration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Comparing final educational achievements for 18 Latin American countries, this paper finds that measures of the persistence in educational achievements across generations, such as beta-and partial correlation coefficients, are high. This persistence is correlated with high returns to education, relatively low progressivity in public investments in education, and inequality of opportunity. An index of inequality of opportunity (including dimensions beyond an individual's control such as race, gender and parental income background) is estimated at around 40 %, which is high by international standards. The paper also explores country differences in intergenerational mobility. While in Costa Rica, circumstances explain below 15 % of the observed variance in education, in Chile, they amount to almost half the explained variance. The findings imply that there is room for targeted redistributive policies that improve intergenerational mobility.","[Daude, Christian; Robano, Virginia] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Daude, C (通讯作者)，Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Paris, France.",christian.daude@oecd.org,,,,,,,37,15,19,1,17,CENTRO INVESTIGACION & DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS-CIDE,CIUDAD DE MEXICO,"CARR MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, SANTA FE, ALTAVISTA, CIUDAD DE MEXICO, ALVARO OBREGON, MEXICO",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

Interestingly, though the concept of rules is now part of most game theorists' tool box, none of them has explicitly entertained the important distinction between regulative rules and constitutive rules. This distinction, which finds its roots in Ludwig Wittgenstein's profound discussion of language games', is at the core of modern philosophy of social sciences. This article asks whether game theory can account for constitutive rules. I distinguish between three game-theoretic accounts of rules: the rules-as-behavioral-regularities account, the rules-as-normative-expectations account, and the rules-as-correlated-devices account. I show that only the latter two are able to make sense of constitutive rules by giving up any pure individualistic understanding of game theory.","[Hedoin, Cyril] Univ Reims, REGARDS Res Ctr, F-51096 Reims, France",Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne,"Hédoin, C (通讯作者)，Univ Reims, REGARDS Res Ctr, 57B,Rue Pierre Taittinger, F-51096 Reims, France.",cyril.hedoin@univ-reims.fr,"Hédoin, Cyril/AAL-8244-2021","Hédoin, Cyril/0000-0002-5358-7111",,,,,42,5,8,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

Our findings show that at most one-third of our firms systematically over- or underpredict their production growth one-quarter ahead. Our findings further show that larger and exporting firms tend to have more realistic expectations, while firms with higher leverage are more prone to expectations that are biased towards optimism.

Lewis (1954) and Rostow (1956) argue that the pace of industrialization is limited by the rate of capital formation which in turn is limited by the savings rate of workers close to subsistence. We argue that access to capital goods in the world market can be quantitatively important in speeding up the transition. We develop a parsimonious open-economy model where traditional and modern technologies coexist (a dual economy in the sense of Lewis 1954). We show that a decline in the world price of capital goods in an open economy increases the rate of capital formation and speeds up the pace of industrialization relative to a closed economy that lacks access to cheaper capital goods. In the long run, the investment rate in the open economy is twice as high as in the closed economy and the per capita income is 23% higher.

We put explicit emphasis on the construction of networks and examine the dynamic formation of networks whose evolution across time periods is stochastic. Time series of networks are studied that describe processes of network formation where links may appear or disappear at any period. Moreover, convergence to an efficient network is not necessarily prescribed. Transitions from one network to another are random and ruled by a stochastic process, typically a Markov chain. We propose the link-based scenario allocation rule for such dynamic random network formation processes and provide its axiomatic characterization. By considering a monotone game and a particular (natural) network formation process, we recover the link-based flexible network allocation rule of Jackson (Games Econ Behav 51:128-154, 2005a).","[Caulier, Jean-Francois] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Grabisch, Michel] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Rusinowska, Agnieszka] CNRS, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics; Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Grabisch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",jean-francois.caulier@univ-paris1.fr; michel.grabisch@univ-paris1.fr; agnieszka.rusinowska@univ-paris1.fr,"Rusinowska, Agnieszka/KCL-5447-2024","Rusinowska, Agnieszka/0000-0003-3803-9907",project DynaMITE - National Agency for Research (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) [ANR-13-BSH1-0010-01]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-13-BSH1-0010] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),project DynaMITE - National Agency for Research (Agence Nationale de la Recherche)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This research is supported by the project DynaMITE (ANR-13-BSH1-0010-01), funded by National Agency for Research (Agence Nationale de la Recherche).

This phenomenon, which we label task juggling, has been overlooked by economists. We study the work schedules of some judges in Italy documenting that they do juggle tasks and that juggling causally lowers their productivity substantially. To measure the size of this effect, we show that although all these judges receive the same workload, those who juggle more trials at once instead of working sequentially on few of them at each unit of time, take longer to complete their portfolios of cases. Task juggling seems to have no adverse effect on the quality of the judges' decisions, as measured by the percent of decisions appealed. To identify these causal effects we estimate models with judge fixed effects and we exploit the lottery assigning cases to judges. We discuss whether task juggling can be viewed as inefficient, and provide a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the social cost of longer trials due to task juggling.","[Coviello, Decio] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ichino, Andrea] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy; [Ichino, Andrea] Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Persico, Nicola] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; European University Institute; University of Bologna; Northwestern University,"Coviello, D (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",decio.coviello@hec.ca; andrea.ichino@eui.eu; nicola@nicolapersico.com,"Persico, Nicola/KCX-9451-2024","Persico, Nicola/0000-0002-2023-1637; ICHINO, ANDREA/0000-0001-8218-180X",MIUR PRIN project [2009MAATFS_001],"MIUR PRIN project(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN))","We would like to thank seminar participants at the Bank of Italy, the CEPR Public Policy meeting 2010, the NBER Summer Institute 2009, NBER Organizational Economics Workshop 2013 in Stanford, the WPEG 2009 conference, Bocconi University, European University Institute, LSE, MIT, Oxford, Royal Holloway, Timbergen Institute, Universities of Bologna, Bonn, Southampton, UPF, and Utrecht.

In our preferred specification, we find that the worker death rate for connected companies is two to three times that of unconnected firms (depending on the sample employed), a pattern that holds for within-firm estimations. The connections-mortality relationship is attenuated in provinces where safety regulators' promotion is contingent on meeting safety targets. In the absence of fatalities, connected firms receive fewer reports of major violations for safety compliance, whereas in years of fatal accidents the rate of reported violations is identical. Moreover, fatal accidents produce negative returns at connected companies and are associated with the subsequent departure of well-connected executives. These results provide suggestive evidence that connections enable firms to avoid (potentially costly) compliance measures, rather than using connections to avoid regulatory response after accidents occur. Our findings emphasize the social costs of political connections, and suggest that appropriate regulatory incentives may be useful in mitigating these costs.","[Fisman, Raymond] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Wang, Yongxiang] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",Columbia University; University of Southern California,"Fisman, R (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,"Wang, Yongxiang/HGB-4562-2022",,China National Science Foundation [71472180]; Australian Research Council [DP150102339],China National Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank the associate editor, three anonymous referees, Kent Daniel, Harry DeAngelo, Wouter Dessein, David Hirshleifer, Harrison Hong, Emir Kamenica, John Matsusaka, Kevin Murphy, Jay Ritter, Amit Seru, Rene Stulz, Wei Xiong, and Jiang Wang, as well as seminar participants at a number of institutions for insightful comments; Eric Hardy, Jane Zhao, Jun Xiao, and Rong Xu provided excellent RA support.

However, little is known about the impact of institutional quality on offshoring. This lack of knowledge is surprising, given that offshoring has become an important part of many firms' internationalization strategies. This study uses detailed firm-level data for the 1997-2005 period to examine the relationship between institutional quality in 113 source countries and offshoring by Swedish firms. The results suggest that weak institutions are negatively related to offshoring in general and to the offshoring of R&D- and relationship specificity-intensive inputs in particular. An analysis of learning effects suggests that the impact of weak institutions on the offshoring of relationship specificity-intensive inputs vanishes when firms return to countries from which they have previous market experience. Our results are robust to the use of various measures of institutional quality.","[Heyman, Fredrik] Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Heyman, Fredrik] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden; [Tingvall, Patrik Gustavsson] Ratio Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Tingvall, Patrik Gustavsson] Sodertorn Univ, Stockholm, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Lund University; Sodertorn University,"Heyman, F (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",fredrik.heyman@ifn.se; patrik.tingvall@ratio.se,,,Swedish Research Council; Swedish Research Council for Health and Working Life and Welfare (Forte); Torsten Soderbergs Research Foundation,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Research Council for Health and Working Life and Welfare (Forte)(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)); Torsten Soderbergs Research Foundation,Fredrik Heyman gratefully acknowledges the financial support from the Swedish Research Council and the Swedish Research Council for Health and Working Life and Welfare (Forte).

We add to the literature on Catholic schooling by examining its effect on long-term wages in Australia, independent of effects on academic achievement. Using panel data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics Australia (HILDA) survey and fixed effects estimation, we find that during the prime-age of a career, wages for Catholic school graduates progress with labor market experience at a greater rate, on average, than wages for public school graduates. Importantly, we find no evidence to suggest that these benefits are peculiar to Catholic schooling, with similar benefits estimated for graduates of independent private schools. These findings suggest that private schooling may be important in not only fostering higher academic achievement but also in better preparing students for a working life.","[Jha, Nikhil; Polidano, Cain] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Polidano, C (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",cainp@unimelb.edu.au,"Polidano, Cain/H-7358-2015","Polidano, Cain/0000-0002-2239-6080; Jha, Nikhil/0000-0001-5615-7312","Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS); Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Melbourne","Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS)(Australian Government); Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Melbourne","This paper uses unit record data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey.

An initial experiment finds that psychological ownership is greater when an investment choice is incongruent with a nonconsciously-activated financial goal. Consistent with the notion that psychological ownership engenders self-enhancement motivation, ownership is also positively associated with word-of-mouth intentions. However, two additional experiments show that these effects are attenuated when an investor's decision process focuses on deciding in the right way (versus focusing on making the best choice). Findings across all studies support an integrative perspective on theories of psychological ownership and regulatory engagement When individuals overcome personal resistance by choosing an option that is incongruent with a nonconscious goal, they experience greater feelings of engagement, which in turn lead to enhanced feelings of psychological ownership of the chosen option and greater word-of-mouth intentions.

The optimal policy constrained permanently by the Maastricht criteria is characterized by reduced variability of the nominal exchange rate, CPI inflation, and the nominal interest rate and by lower optimal targets for CPI inflation and nominal interest rate. This policy results in higher variability and nonzero means for both PPI inflation and output gap, thus leading to additional, but small, welfare costs compared with the unconstrained policy.","[Lipinska, Anna] Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Lipinska, A (通讯作者)，Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, Div Monetary Affairs, 20th St & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",anna.lipinska@frb.gov,,,,,,,63,4,4,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Trading with preferred counterparts is associated with more favorable rates for both lenders and borrowers, and carries larger trading volumes. The results point to a peer monitoring role of relationship lending, which contributes, at a time of financial distress, to a smooth liquidity redistribution among banks.

Evidence from a German car magazine,APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,car magazines; test scores; demand,FUND FLOWS; MEDIA BIAS; CRITICS,"A wide range of media provide information on many products based on reviews or expert opinions. A natural question is, whether these reviews and expert opinions have any effect on sales. A small but growing literature in economics and marketing science deals with this issue, by testing the relevance of such product information for goods such as financial instruments, wine, books and movies. However, most of these products have in common that quality is very difficult to measure. It is always also a matter of taste whether these products can be seen as high- or low-quality goods. Based on a unique data set, we test whether test scores published in a major German car magazine have significant impact on registrations of new cars in Germany. We find that test scores for certain cars have statistically significant impact on the number of new cars sold by several leading manufacturers on the German car market.","[Dewenter, Ralf] Univ Hamburg, Ind Econ, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany; [Heimeshoff, Ulrich] Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany",University of Hamburg; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Heimeshoff, U (通讯作者)，Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",heimeshoff@dice.hhu.de,,,,,,,19,3,4,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Since different decision-makers have unequal importance in decision-making, a series of studies focused on finding a set of appropriate weights for experts participating in a decision problem. In this paper, the problem of weight determination among decision-makers is investigated by extending an algorithm taken from the technique for order preference by similarity-to-ideal solution. In this case, a pair of most compromising and least compromising solutions is derived from individual judgments of decision-makers and then, these solutions are applied as the bases for determining the magnitude of individual alignment with the group opinion by using a closeness coefficient approach. Determining the weights of decision-makers, the group decision-making problem is then solved. Application of the proposed method is illustrated by a numerical example for the selection of a maintenance strategy.","[Razavi Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein] Khatam Inst Higher Educ, Dept Management, Tehran, Iran; [Mahdiraji, Hannan Amoozad] Univ Tehran, Fac Management, Tehran, Iran; [Hashemi, Shide Sadat] Allameh Tabatabaei Univ, Fac Management, Tehran, Iran; [Turskis, Zenonas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Tehran; Allameh Tabataba'i University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Turskis, Z (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",zenonas.turskis@vgtu.lt,"Turskis, Zenonas/AAA-9159-2021; Mahdiraji, Hannan Amoozad/AAT-9996-2020; Turskis, Zenonas/H-3035-2018; Hajiagha, Seyed Hossein Razavi/ABE-8871-2020","Turskis, Zenonas/0000-0002-5835-9388; Mahdiraji, Hannan Amoozad/0000-0002-8382-6603;",,,,,54,20,21,2,26,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Costs of certification, sunk in order to achieve credibility, play a key role in producing an oligopolistic market, leading to high prices that form a barrier for consumers in the South. To lower the cost, certification is better achieved by a single independent body which can be financed either by end consumers, through a fee, or by public subsidies. The paper identifies the conditions under which each funding mechanism is most efficient, taking into account the government's budget constraint. The theoretical analysis is motivated with reference to agricultural seed certification. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We provide structural estimates of the parameters of the model using new experimental data, which allow us to track individual behavior, cognitive reflection abilities, and accuracy of price forecasts. Based on the model's predictions for individual behavior we identify different types of traders in the data. We find that fundamental traders and speculators have higher terminal wealth and perform better on a cognitive reflection test and price forecasting than noise traders. More importantly, we find that all three types of traders are important to understand the mechanics of bubbles and crashes. In the initial period, fundamental traders buy from noise traders. Next, speculators buy from fundamental traders during the boom. Finally, speculators generate the crash by selling to noise traders. Our model predicts smaller bubbles if the cash and asset endowments are higher, keeping the cash-to-asset ratio constant. Our theory has predictive power as we confirm this prediction with additional out-of-sample data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

(2007); (c) the determinants of the magnification of productivity differences between the comparative advantage and comparative disadvantage sector. We get the following results. (1) The magnification of productivity differences in the Heckscher-Ohlin model does not hold for trade cost reductions from all levels of trade costs. (2) The scarce factor of production does not unambiguously gain from trade liberalization in the Heckscher-Ohlin model, especially for larger differences in relative factor abundance. (1) and (2) differ from Bernard et al. (2007). (3) Also in the specific factor model both magnification and demagnification are possible and the scarce production factor can both gain and lose with trade liberalization.

Data Envelopment Analysis techniques and directional distance functions are employed to compute Luenberger productivity indicators for the change in environmental performance and its determinants, namely, environmental technical change resulting from eco-innovation and catching-up with best available environmental technologies. Eight air pollutants account for the environmental contaminants from transport activities, and these are aggregated into three main categories of environmental pressures, namely, global warming, tropospheric ozone formation and acidification potentials. Furthermore, performance evaluation is based on how these specific environmental pressures are managed. Our principal findings show that there has been a noticeable improvement in environmental performance since the 1990s, primarily as a result of eco-innovations; moreover, this improvement has been markedly greater in low- and middle-income economies, bolstered, in this case, by both environmental technical progress and catching-up. These results reveal the need for policy measures aimed at encouraging catching-up with best available technologies, particularly in more developed countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper combines stratification economics with identity economics to address complications that the phenomenon of intersectionality-people having multiple social group identities-creates for stratification economics. It distinguishes two types of social identities recognised by social psychologists, categorical and relational social identities, and uses this distinction to explain how individuals' personal identities, understood as ordered sets of social identities, can be seen to be both socially and self-constructed. Individuals order and rank their categorical social identities according to weights they assign to them in interactive social settings in which their role-based relational social identities combine different categorical social identities. Research in social psychology in the stigma identity-threat literature is then reviewed to distinguish two opposed ways in which individuals respond to others' stigmatisation of their social groups in interactive settings. The paper argues that the ways in which individuals respond to stigma reflect social group power relationships and the scarcity logic of individualist social ontologies and tend to reinforce social stratification.","[Davis, John B.] Marquette Univ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Davis, John B.] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",Marquette University; University of Amsterdam,"Davis, JB (通讯作者)，Marquette Univ, Dept Econ, POB 1881, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",john.davis@mu.edu,,,,,,,38,31,33,5,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

However, the strength of such 'framing effects' varies between studies, and some studies fail to find any effect at all. A long line of research has argued that the presence and size of framing effects depend to a large extent on whether people use higher or lower-level mental decision making processes (or heuristics). A similarly important line of research in social psychology and economics suggests that higher-level mental processes such as self-control draw upon a limited pool of mental resources that can be exhausted. This study links these two lines of research and investigates whether depleting people's mental resources (or 'willpower') affects the degree to which they are susceptible to framing effects. In three separate experiments we depleted participants' willpower using the commonly used Stroop task method, and subsequently made them take part in a series of tasks, including a framed prisoner's dilemma, an attraction effect task and an anchoring effect task. However, though we find strong evidence of a framing effect in all three tasks, the strength of these effects is not affected by induced changes in the level of willpower depletion.

However, Middle East and North African (MENA) countries lagged in adopting such reforms. Even after introducing telecom reforms in MENA region beginning in 1995, not all countries became better off in terms of various performance indicators. Therefore, this paper empirically assesses the effects of regulation, privatization and liberalization reforms, as well as their simultaneous presences, on the sector performance in the telecommunication sector using a sample of 17 MENA countries for the period 1995-2010. We assume that different reforms are affected by institutional, political and economic determinants with respect to the level of democracy, the legal origin, the natural resources rents per country and the year of independence from colonization. We use IV-2SLS (Instrumental Variable Two-Stage Least Squares) estimation to analyze the effect of different reforms on telecom performance in terms of access, productivity and affordability in the fixed and the mobile sector. We find that privatization of the main incumbent operator and fixed-line market liberalization affect the sector performance negatively in terms of fixed access and affordability. Moreover, we find that the simultaneous presence of an independent regulator and a privatized incumbent helps to eliminate drawbacks on the sector performance resulting from privatization.

As such, it may be considered a contribution to the effort called for in the EU's 2006 Energy Services Directive (ESD) to develop a harmonized calculation model. Although this study does not estimate the realized savings from individual policy measures, it does provide estimates of realized energy savings for energy efficiency policy measures in aggregate. Using fixed effects panel models, the annual cumulative savings in 2011 of combined household and manufacturing sector electricity and natural gas usage attributed to EU energy efficiency policies since 2000 is estimated to be 1136 PJ; the savings attributed to energy efficiency policies since 2006 is estimated to be 807 PJ, or the equivalent of 5.6% of 2011 EU energy consumption.

How Changes in the Characteristics of Borrowers and in the Institutions They Attended Contributed to Rising Loan Defaults,BROOKINGS PAPERS ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HIGHER-EDUCATION; PUBLIC SUBSIDIES; COLLEGES; SCHOOL,"This paper examines the rise in student loan default and delinquency. It draws on a unique set of administrative data on federal student borrowing matched to earnings records from de-identified tax records. Most of the increase in default is associated with borrowers at for-profit schools, 2-year institutions, and certain other nonselective institutions. Historically, students at these institutions have constituted a small share of all student borrowers. These nontraditional borrowers have largely come from lower-income families, attended institutions with relatively weak educational outcomes, faced poor labor market outcomes after leaving school, and defaulted at high rates. In contrast, default rates have remained low among borrowers who attended most 4-year public and nonprofit private institutions and among graduate school borrowers who collectively represent the vast majority of the federal loan portfolio despite the severe recession and these borrowers' relatively high loan balances. The higher earnings, low rates of unemployment, and greater family resources of this latter category of borrowers appear to have helped them avoid adverse loan outcomes even during times of hardship. Decomposition analysis indicates that changes in the characteristics of borrowers and the institutions they attended are associated with much of the doubling in default rates between 2000 and 2011, with changes in the type of schools attended, debt burdens, and labor market outcomes explaining the largest share.","[Looney, Adam] US Dept Treasury, Washington, DC USA; [Yannelis, Constantine] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA",United States Department of the Treasury; New York University,"Looney, A (通讯作者)，US Dept Treasury, Washington, DC USA.",,,"Looney, Adam/0000-0002-9628-5789",Alexander S.

Our study contributes to the literature by using both the 30-day and the 90-day bank accepted bill (BAB) rates to disentangle the unexpected surprise component of monetary policy changes from overall cash rate target changes in the Australian money market, and by concurrently modelling the effects of monetary surprises and other key macroeconomic announcements in Australia. The empirical results suggest that the 30-day BAB rate is the best proxy for the expected monetary policy actions. We find that the effect of monetary surprises on the volatility of the 3- and 10-year bond future instruments is significant and persistent. We have also documented a strong monetary policy effect on the mean returns of the exchange rate futures, indicating that unexpected monetary policy adjustments have a significant impact on the level of the exchange rate movements rather than on the volatility of the FX futures market.","[Lu, Xinsheng; Qu, Ling] Univ Jinan, Jinan 200022, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Ying] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Jinan; University of Melbourne,"Qu, L (通讯作者)，Univ Jinan, Sch Econ, Ctr Globalizat & Multinat Operat, Jinan 200022, Shandong, Peoples R China.",se_luxs@ujn.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71173088],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We are thankful for the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71173088).

Proxy variables suggest significant deterrence of abuses, but half of the decline in donations can be explained by the increased cost of running a foundation.

There is no evidence to support non-Keynesian effects of fiscal policy in Thailand. Unwarranted fears of unsustainable public debt and ultra-conservative fiscal policy has cost the country a lost opportunity for achieving high growth. After the military coups in 2006 and 2014, the Thai economy experienced the lowest economic growth among ASEAN countries. The budget spent on economic services was diverted into defense, increases in public sector's wages, and income transfer payments. The opportunistic political budget model predicts higher fiscal spending by incumbent democratic governments before an election to gain votes.

Results show that ISR has a limited (and imprecisely estimated) impact on entry and actual competition. However, controlling for actual competition, ISR authorization causes an average reduction in prices of 32.7%. Markets with relatively high carrier surplus experience an additional reduction in the price by 0.4 percentage points, and prices are 3.4 percentage points lower in markets with relatively high private line capacity.

Because the unobserved determinants of schooling achievement often also influence private tutoring expenditure, the OLS estimate cannot provide a consistent estimate. This paper adopts a heteroskedasticity-based identification strategy proposed by Lewbel (2012) to handle this problem. These estimation results show that, on average, private tutoring expenditure has small but statistically significant effect on the mathematics test score of primary school students, but has no statistically significant effect on the Chinese test score. A 1000 yuan increase in private tutoring expenditure (i.e. 54% of a standard deviation) raises the primary school students' mathematics test score by 1.07 percentage point (i.e. 15% of a standard deviation). The instrumental variable quantile regression combining with Lewbel IV suggests that private tutoring is more likely to improve student achievement at the bottom end of test score distribution. When moving upward to the top end, the effect becomes smaller and even negative although not significant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In these economies, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan have increased the shares of high-skill and technology-intensive exports (usually finished goods) while Japan has highly concentrated on medium-skill and technology-intensive exports (mainly intermediate goods). ROK has shifted its exports from finished to intermediate goods following Japan. Panel dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) with heterogeneous time trends was applied to trade data during the period 1995-2011. Our estimation results revealed that exports with high skill and technology intensity are more sensitive to real exchange rates in China and Taiwan, while exports with medium skill and technology intensity are very sensitive to exchange rate changes except for China. These results are consistent with the current roles of those economies in the regional production networks.","Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Asia Pacific Studies, Tokyo, Japan",Waseda University,"Kato, A (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Asia Pacific Studies, Tokyo, Japan.",akato@aoni.waseda.jp,,,Waseda University [2012A-921],Waseda University,This paper is a part of the outcome of research performed under a Waseda University Grant for Special Research Projects (Project number 2012A-921).,,15,2,2,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Building on the Fiscal Theory of Price Level (FTPL) and the Fiscal Theory of Sovereign Risk (FTSR), this paper differs in its baseline assumption about the monetary policy objective, which is neither to rule out defaults regardless of inflation costs (as in FTPL), nor to follow inflation targeting regardless of associated sovereign risk (as in FTSR). Instead, we study the case in which the central bank controls the risky interest rate to minimize the probability of default while ruling out large inflation hikes. We show that this policy regime can mitigate default risks only when the central bank is expected to allow sufficient increases in inflation. When agents believe that the central bank's tolerance toward inflation hikes has increased, equilibrium risk premium goes down, suggesting that information concerning changes in the central bank's preferences over inflation directly impacts default risks.

When spouses share consumption equally, separate property or prenuptial agreements can reduce distortions and increase equity.

To generate these measures,! extend the empirical strategy of Manning (2003) and estimate the labor supply elasticity facing each private non-farm firm in the U.S. While a link between monopsony power and earnings has traditionally been assumed, I provide the first direct evidence of the positive relationship between a firm's labor supply elasticity and the earnings of its workers. I also contrast the dynamic model strategy with the more traditional use of concentration ratios to measure a firm's labor market power. In addition, I provide several alternative measures of labor market power which account for potential threats to identification such as endogenous mobility. Finally, I construct a counterfactual earnings distribution which allows the effects of firm market power to vary across the earnings distribution. I estimate the average labor supply elasticity to the firm to be 1.08, however my findings suggest that there is significant variability in the distribution of firm market power across U.S. firms, and that dynamic monopsony models are superior to the use of concentration ratios in evaluating a firm's labor market power. I find that a one-unit increase in the labor supply elasticity to the firm is associated with earnings gains of between 5 and 16%. While nontrivial, these estimates imply that firms do not fully exercise their labor market power over their workers. Furthermore, I find that the negative earnings impact of a firm's market power is strongest in the lower half of the earnings distribution, and that a one standard deviation increase in the labor supply elasticity to the firm reduces the variance of the earnings distribution by 9%.

So, our findings show that not only RC is issued to strengthen the soundness and the stability of the international banking system and to diminish an existing source of competitive inequality among international banks, but also to provide useful information to investors for their economic decisions.","[Mechelli, Alessandro] Univ Tuscia, Dept Econ & Management, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Cimini, Riccardo; Mazzocchetti, Francesca] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Business Govt & Philosophy Studies, I-00133 Rome, Italy",Tuscia University; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Cimini, R (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Business Govt & Philosophy Studies, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",riccardo.cimini@uniroma2.it,"MECHELLI, Alessandro/AAD-8194-2020; , Riccardo/AAA-9388-2020","MECHELLI, Alessandro/0000-0001-8367-0840; , Riccardo/0000-0001-5056-1322",,,,,10,0,0,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This belief led to the articulation of strategies to alleviate this problem which developed under the assumption that policy-making in developing countries can be best understood as a problem of prediction. The causal structures that characterize developing contexts, however, render this framing inadequate. I propose to understand policy-making in developing contexts as a planning process. In this new framework, the relevance of several kinds of evidence is highlighted and the role of causal effects refocused. Interestingly, also the concern for the external validity of causal effects seems now less forceful than the critics of RCTs suggest.","Erasmus Univ, Dept Philosophy, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Ruzzene, A (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Philosophy, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",ruzzene@fwb.eur.nl,,,,,,,10,3,3,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

Existing evidence on the results achieved by this reform in terms of reduction of out-of-pocket medical expenditures is still mixed and contradictory, and very little is known about the impact of these measures on the consumption and saving behavior of the Chinese population. To shed more light on this issue we use data collected in 1995 and 2002 by the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP). Contrary to previous evidence, our findings suggest that the effects of the reform have been more articulated and heterogeneous. In fact, we find that once properly accounting for income distribution and unobserved heterogeneity (potentially induced by health status), out-of-pocket medical expenses and saving rate are affected by the reform in a differentiated way. In particular, we find that out-of-pocket expenses decrease only for high income individuals with good health status and the saving rate increases only for low income individuals with good health status. This result is actually worrisome, as it suggests that the public health coverage after the reform provides financial protection only to individuals that are relatively better off (with good health status and/or high income).

Using survey data collected from 1754 new vehicle buying households in Canada in 2013, we segment respondents using two approaches that prove to be complementary. Preference-based segments were constructed using latent-class analysis of discrete choice experiment data. Potential PEV buyers were split into a PEV-enthusiast segment (8% of the sample) with extremely high valuation of PEVs and a broader PHEV-oriented segment (25%) that expressed moderately positive valuation of PHEVs. Preference-based segments also varied by respondents' valuation of specific attributes such as fuel savings. Our second approach constructed lifestyle-based segments using cluster analysis on a subset of potential early PEV buyers (33% of the total sample). The six lifestyle-based clusters varied in engagement in environment- and technology-oriented lifestyles, environmental concern and openness to change. Overall preferences were fairly similar across the dusters, though apparent motivations varied substantially by cluster as indicated by their differing engagement in lifestyles and environmental concern. Taken together, both approaches suggest that PHEVs are the most likely PEV to have broad market appeal and that car buyers have high degrees of heterogeneity in both preferences and motivations.

To understand how this might be an economic and political equilibrium we combine models of collective wage bargaining, creative job destruction, and welfare spending. The two-tier system of wage bargaining provides microeconomic efficiency and wage compression. Combined with a vintage approach to the process of creative destruction we show how wage compression fuels investments, enhances average productivity and increases the mean wage by allocating more of the work force to the most modern activities. Finally, we show how the political support of welfare spending is fueled by both a higher mean wage and a lower wage dispersion.

I provide a constructive proof of existence of equilibrium, characterize the price function, and provide sufficient conditions for uniqueness within the class of equilibria with continuous price functions, which are met by both the Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) models and the Hellwig (1980) models with a continuum of investors. My solution approach does not rely on the typical conjecture and verify method, and I exhibit a number of non-normal examples in which asset prices can be characterized explicitly and in a closed form. The results presented here open up a broad class of models for applied work. To illustrate the usefulness of generalizing the standard model, I show that in settings with non-normally distributed pay-offs, shocks to fundamentals may be amplified purely due to learning effects, price drifts can arise naturally, and the disagreement-return relation depends in a novel way on return skewness.","Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Breon-Drish, B (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,,,,,73,34,42,2,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

This paper proposes a positive theory for judicial torture. It is shown that torture reflects the magistrate's attempt to balance type I and type II errors in the decision-making, by forcing the guilty to confess with a higher probability than the innocent, and thereby decreases the type I error at the cost of the type II error. Moreover, there is a non-monotonic relationship between the superiority of torture and the informativeness of investigation: when investigation is relatively uninformative, an improvement in technology used in the investigation actually lends an advantage to torture so that torture is even more attractive to the magistrates; however, when technological progress reaches a certain threshold, the advantage of torture is weakened, so that a judicial system based on torture becomes inferior to one based on evidence.

Because administrative costs are incurred with every shipment, exporters have to decide how to break up total trade into individual shipments. Consumers value frequent shipments, because they enable them to consume close to their preferred dates. Hence per-shipment costs create a welfare loss. We derive a gravity equation in our model and show that administrative costs can be expressed as bilateral ad-valorem trade costs. We estimate the ad-valorem equivalent in Spanish shipment-level export data and find it to be large. A 50% reduction in per-shipment costs is equivalent to a 9 percentage point reduction in tariffs. Our model and estimates help explain why policy makers emphasize trade facilitation and why trade within customs unions is larger than trade within free trade areas. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Salvadori (1999) builds a model with transferable non-jointly utilized machines whose efficiency paths are independent of the sectors in which the machines are used. He shows that the neat properties of the non-transferable single machine model still hold. In an earlier paper, Salvadori (1988a) builds another model with non-transferable jointly utilized machines.

Before 2005, only political connections significantly positively influenced the market share of investment banks. After 2005, the effect of political connections declined, while a low evaluation standard on IPO candidates and low underwriting fees now also significantly enhance market share. We explain these findings by the pro-competitive, yet partial changes that were introduced in the regulatory framework for IPOs, thereby emphasizing the need for a delicate policy coordination in marketization reforms.

In pursuing these two objectives, I hope to draw out the originality and significance of Shackle's economics with a particular emphasis on what he adds to process conceptions developed within other heterodox traditions such as institutional and evolutionary economics.

The analysis is primarily based on the concept of foreign value added in exports, which is suitable to assess the pervasiveness of GVC. The paper uses the World Input-Output Database and covers the period 2000-2011, giving also some information on the sectoral dimension of production linkages. The paper concludes that GVC are important for the euro area as whole and there has been a rebound since the trade collapse in 2009.

This article uses highly disaggregated retail price data for twenty-four narrowly defined products collected at the district level in four Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries (Botswana, Malawi, South Africa and Zambia) to assess the extent to which product prices are integrated within and between these countries. We find evidence of large and persistent absolute deviations from the law of one price both within and between each of the four countries. Price dispersion is found to be higher between SADC countries than within the individual countries. On average, absolute price deviations between country pairs are smaller for countries adjacent to each other and for countries that share common membership in the Southern African Customs Union. Simple econometric estimates show that absolute price deviations between district pairs in the region increase the further apart the districts are from each other and are higher in the case of districts separated by a national border. Overall, we find no clear evidence that product markets in the SADC region have become more integrated between 2006 and 2009 (although product prices between the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa countries did become more integrated over this period), despite the liberalisation of tariffs under the SADC Protocol on Trade. Trade liberalisation alone appears not to be sufficient in generating greater product market integration within the region.","[Balchin, Neil; Edwards, Lawrence; Sundaram, Asha] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Balchin, N (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa.",neilgbalchin@hotmail.com,"Sundaram, Asha/S-2694-2019","Sundaram, Asha/0000-0003-1864-8019; Edwards, Lawrence/0000-0002-2039-8920",Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA); South Africa's National Research Foundation (NRF); John Davidson Educational Trust,Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA); South Africa's National Research Foundation (NRF)(National Research Foundation - South Africa); John Davidson Educational Trust,"We are grateful to Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA), South Africa's National Research Foundation (NRF) and the John Davidson Educational Trust for funding.

Our data and research strategy allow us to build on models of political business cycles and targeted distribution in two important ways. First, we demonstrate that by manipulating the flow of critical inputs into economic activity like electricity, elected leaders can influence economic outcomes even in contexts where they have constrained fiscal capacity. Second, we identify the effect of elections on electricity provision by focusing on special elections held for exogenous reasons. Our results show that state governments induce substantive increases in electricity service to constituencies that hold special elections. Manipulation of the power supply is stronger in contested constituencies and during special elections held in states where the government commands only a small majority.

The worker judges a transaction fairer to the extent that his or her own gain is more nearly equal to the firm's gain. The worker calculates both players' gains relative to what they would have gained from the reference transaction, which is the transaction that the worker most recently personally experienced. The model explains several empirical regularities: rent sharing, persistence of a worker's entry wage at a firm, insensitivity of an incumbent worker's wage to market conditions, and, if the worker is loss averse and the reference wage is nominal, downward nominal wage rigidity. The model also makes a number of novel predictions. Whether the equilibrium is efficient depends on which notion of efficiency is used in the presence of the worker's fairness concern, and which is appropriate to use partly depends on whether loss aversion is treated as legitimate for normative purposes.","[Benjamin, Daniel J.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Benjamin, Daniel J.] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Benjamin, Daniel J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Cornell University; University of Southern California; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Benjamin, DJ (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,,,"Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School; Harvard University Economics Department; Chiles Foundation; Federal Reserve Bank of Boston; Institute for Quantitative Social Science; Harvard's Center for Justice, Welfare, and Economics; National Institute of Aging [T32-AG00186]; Institute for Humane Studies; National Science Foundation","Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School; Harvard University Economics Department; Chiles Foundation; Federal Reserve Bank of Boston; Institute for Quantitative Social Science; Harvard's Center for Justice, Welfare, and Economics; National Institute of Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Institute for Humane Studies; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","I am grateful to Philippe Aghion, Attila Ambrus, Antonia Atanassova, Gary Becker, Lynn Benjamin, James Choi, Steve Coate, Noam Elkies, Constanca Esteves-Sorenson, Erik Eyster, John Friedman, Roland Fryer, Drew Fudenberg, Alexander Gelber, Ed Glaeser, Jerry Green, Oliver Hart, Ori Heffetz, Holger Herz, Ben Ho, Daniel Hojman, Richard Holden, Caroline Hoxby, Erzo Luttmer, Lisa Kahn, Lauren Kaiser, Emir Kamenica, Lawrence Katz, Miles Kimball, Nobuhiro Kiyotaki, Fuhito Kojima, Ilyana Kuziemko, David Laibson, Sendhil Mullainathan, Karthik Muralidharan, Emi Nakamura, Ted O'Donoghue, Masao Ogaki, Emily Oster, Stefan Penczynski, Herakles Polemarchakis, Giacomo Ponzetto, Alex Rees-Jones, Josh Schwartzstein, Jesse Shapiro, Andrei Shleifer, Joel Sobel, Jon Steinsson, Dmitry Taubinsky, Jeremy Tobacman, Stephen Weinberg, Richard Zeckhauser, and especially Edward Glaeser, David Laibson, Matthew Rabin and Andrei Shleifer, as well as seminar participants at Harvard University, Cornell University, the University of Maryland and the SAET Normative Economics Satellite Conference for valuable comments and advice.

A short-cut method which we term the Steady Growth Model (SGM) can produce plausible capital stock estimates provided certain conditions are met. Starting with a database covering 146 countries we conclude that the SGM can legitimately be used to calculate capital stocks for 53 of them. The 53 include equal numbers of high-income and low-income countries. The SGM requires only data on gross fixed capital formation for the base year, information about past growth rates of real GFCF, and assumptions about rates of depreciation. Despite its apparent simplicity, we show that our SGM stock estimates compare well with official stock estimates generated by the PIM. Other tests on capital-output ratios and capital-stocks per head confirm the plausibility of stock estimates generated by SGM.","[Blades, Derek] OCED, Econ Stat, Pisa, Italy; [Blades, Derek] OCED, Natl Accounts, Pisa, Italy",,"Blades, D (通讯作者)，OCED, Econ Stat, Pisa, Italy.",,,,,,,,31,3,3,2,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

In particular, we use quarterly data on the log of real exchange rates, export/import ratio and relative (US) income for the time period 1996q1-2011q4, and employ techniques based on the concept of long memory or long-range dependence. Specifically, we use fractional integration and cointegration methods, which are more general than standard approaches based exclusively on integer degrees of differentiation. The results indicate that there exists a well-defined, cointegrating relationship linking the balance of payments to the real exchange rate and relative income, and that the ML condition is satisfied in the long run, although the convergence process is relatively slow. They also imply that a moderate depreciation of the Kenyan shilling may have a stabilising influence on the balance of trade through the current account without the need for high interest rates.","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] Brunel Univ, West London UB8 3PH, England; [Gil-Alana, Luis Alberiko] Univ Navarra, Navarra Ctr Int Dev, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain; [Mudida, Robert] Strathmore Univ, Nairobi, Kenya",Brunel University; University of Navarra; Strathmore University,"Caporale, GM (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, West London UB8 3PH, England.",Guglielmo-Maria.Caporale@brunel.ac.uk,"Mudida, Robert/AAV-4898-2020","Mudida, Robert/0000-0002-9728-9255",,,,,58,5,6,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

In this paper we try to identify various contributions to shed light on this phenomenon, notably Schumpeter's notion of technological bursts and Minsky's notion of a super-cycle where 'stability breeds instability' to the point of systemic crisis. A more comprehensive and methodologically innovative approach to the periodization of capitalism is the French Regulation School. This heterodox approach has reframed the story of long waves in terms of period-specific 'accumulation regimes' and 'modes of (self-)regulation.' Here systemic crises, like the ones we experienced in 1873-1879,1929-1939,1973-1982 or 2007-2011, play the role of regime-transforming adjustments in the institutional make-up of the wage relation, forms of competition, state intervention, and money and banking, as well as international context. We apply the Regulationist approach to finance-led capitalism, the latest long-wave accumulation regime emerging around 1982 to find itself confronted with its own systemic crisis starting in 2007. How will that crisis, one of the most profound structural crises to date, change our economic system?","Hofstra Univ, New York, NY 11549 USA",Hofstra University,"Guttmann, R (通讯作者)，Hofstra Univ, New York, NY 11549 USA.",,,,,,,,63,3,3,0,10,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Consumer search provides a monopoly manufacturer with an additional incentive to increase its price, worsening the double marginalization problem and lowering the manufacturer's profits. Nevertheless, manufacturers in more competitive wholesale markets may not have an incentive to reveal their prices to consumers.

This policy invariably targets consumer price inflation, which is only one of many available price level indices (such as prices of new investments and house prices). As there is no stable relationship between these price levels, and as differences in developments between the different price levels might induce destabilizing behavior, there is no reason why low and stable consumer price inflation should guarantee monetary and financial stability. Following John Maynard Keynes, a low and stable increase of average nominal wages might do a better job. As price levels are designed to estimate the purchasing power of spending power and as income, and spending power are used to not just consume or invest but also to pay down many kinds of (gross) debt, it is advisable to use a joint definition of monetary and financial stability, which combines stable purchasing power of monetary income with a stable ability of households and companies to pay off debts.","[Knibbe, Merijn] Hgsk Van Hall Larenstein, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Knibbe, Merijn] NAHI, Groningen, Netherlands; [Knibbe, Merijn] Fryske Akad, Leeuwarden, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Fryske Akademy (FA-KNAW),"Knibbe, M (通讯作者)，Hgsk Van Hall Larenstein, Wageningen, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,55,1,1,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

First, music piracy decreases music sales by 24% to 42%. Second, music piracy contributes 12% to iPod sales. Finally, counterfactual experiments show that, if music were free, the increase in Apple's profits from iPod can more than compensate the loss of musicians.

We find strong evidence on both in-sample and out-of-sample predictability. Based on this evidence, we forecast carbon spot returns using both carbon forward returns and a constant.

On the contrary, this article proposes a post Keynesian approach of the SBS that focuses on the banks' key role of creating money ex nihilo, highlighted by Schumpeter, Keynes, and their followers, such as Minsky. The hypothesis argued here is that on the threshold of the twenty-first century a new phase of money manager capitalism emerged, in which many money managers along with other nonbanking financial institutions became members of the SBS as they took part in credit risk withdrawals from banks' balance sheets. This was done through financial innovations (securitization and credit derivatives) that allowed banks to remove these risks from their balance sheets and, in turn, to grant increasing amounts of credit. Yet, by globally multiplying and redistributing the risks present in the system to a variety of financial institutions, they were responsible for the transformation of a classic credit crunch (wherein the sum of potential losses corresponding to loans with low collateral is known), into a systemic financial crisis in the international arena.","[Prates, Daniela M.] State Univ Campinas IE UNICAMP, Inst Econ, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Prates, Daniela M.] Brazilian Natl Council Sci & Technol Dev CNPq, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Farhi, Maryse] IE UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, Brazil",,"Prates, DM (通讯作者)，State Univ Campinas IE UNICAMP, Inst Econ, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",,"Prates, Daniela/JPK-9750-2023",,,,,,33,2,3,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Arguing on the basis of theoretical models, some authors maintain that growth is even a systemic requirement of capitalist economies. Thus the latter remain only stable as long as they grow. From an empirical point of view, phases of negative growth (recessions) often go hand in hand with economically and socially detrimental side effects, which policymakers seek to avoid at virtually all costs. This is why a stagnant or even degrowing economy is also anathema to policymakers and arguably to the public at large. Concomitantly, economic research has focused mainly on the drivers of growth rather than the conditions under which stagnant economies can exist. The present paper seeks to contribute to the analysis of stagnant economies by investigating the interrelationship of zero growth and technological progress in the context of a Kaleckian growth model. The analysis starts by showing that a Kaleckian model allows zero growth if depreciation is taken into account and if animal spirits are somewhat (but not too) pessimistic. Combining these conditions with technological progress and wage bargaining, further analysis then indicates that in a profit-driven economy, the overall stability of the system is no longer guaranteed if zero growth is actively imposed, leading to a downward spiral, while in a wage-driven economy, stability can be induced under conditions of zero growth and technological progress but it may not be guaranteed for positive growth.","Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21020 Ispra, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Rosenbaum, E (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21020 Ispra, Italy.",,,,,,,,38,11,11,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Findings regarding the effects caused by a product portfolio with high technological content are mixed. Depending on the performance measure applied, the results show evidence of adverse outcomes for sales, U-shaped effects for participation in technology alliancing and inverted U-shaped results for patenting.

Therefore, the relation between post-tax inequality and economic growth is different from that between pre-tax inequality and economic growth.

J,"Thimann, C",,,,"Thimann, Christian",,,The Microeconomic Dimensions of the Eurozone Crisis and Why European Politics Cannot Solve Them,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,STRUCTURAL REFORMS; CREDIT,"The academic and policy debate about the crisis in Europe's single currency area is usually dominated by macroeconomic and public sector considerations. The microeconomic dimensions of the crisis and the private sector issues typically get much less attention. However, it is the private sector hiring choices of domestic and foreign firms that will ultimately be decisive. This paper argues there are two main problems holding back private sector employment creation in the stressed eurozone countries. First, there is a persistent competitiveness problem in some of the eurozone countries due to high labor costs relative to underlying productivity. Second, widespread structural barriers make job creation in these countries far more arduous than in many other advanced economies, and even more arduous than in some key emerging economies and formerly planned economies. Structural barriers to private sector development are particularly widespread in the areas of labor market functioning, goods market functioning, and government regulation. Evidence from the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index and the World Bank's Doing Business dataset confirms the immense size and persistence of these barriers, despite improvements in some countries in recent years. The paper also presents a novel explanation for the difficulty of structural reforms in the eurozone, tracing the challenge to the current trend to Europeanize and politicize economic reform discussions in national policy fields where Europe is not a legitimate actor and the European political level is not effective.","[Thimann, Christian] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Thimann, Christian] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",Paris School of Economics; European Central Bank,,christian.thimann@psemail.eu,,,,,,,42,14,17,0,10,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The framework is used to quantify the impact of a state-level renewable portfolio standard (RPS) achieved predominately with solar generation. We perform the analysis using Arizona's RPS as a case study over the period 2012-2035. We find if Arizona implements its RPS when supplying future electricity demand, there will be an increase in electricity rates (relative to a business-as-usual scenario of reliance on gas-fired generation). Extending the current regime of tax credits greatly reduces this increase, at the taxpayers' expense. We find that by 2025 Arizona's RPS will implicitly abate carbon dioxide emissions at a cost between $58 and $82 per metric ton, and by 2035 abatement costs are between $22 and $69 per metric ton (depending on the future evolution of nature gas prices). The RPS always leads to a negative impact on social welfare under low gas prices, but after 2029 the welfare impact is positive under high gas prices. In contrast, phasing out Arizona's existing coal-fired generation always has positive welfare impacts. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We also provide a practical approach to computing welfare gains that does not rely on land prices. We develop a location choice model that incorporates missing land markets and allows for congestion in local land. Using this model, we construct welfare bounds as a function of the income and population effects of the new electricity infrastructure. A novel prediction from the model is that migration elasticities and congestion effects are especially large when land markets are missing. We empirically estimate these welfare bounds for rural electrification in South Africa, and show that congestion externalities from program-induced migration reduced local welfare gains by about 40%.

This condition shows that the generic equilibrium of the standard all-pay auction is robust to the introduction of small identity-dependent externalities. In general, however, the presence of identity-dependent externalities invalidates well-established qualitative results concerning the set of equilibria of the first-price all-pay auction with complete information. With identity-dependent externalities, equilibria are generally not payoff equivalent, and identical players may earn different payoffs in equilibrium. These observations show that Siegel's (Econometrica 77(1), 71-92, 2009) results characterizing the set of equilibrium payoffs in all-pay contests, including the all-pay auction as a special case, do not extend to environments with identity-dependent externalities. We further compare the all-pay auction with identity-dependent externalities to the first-price winner-pay auction with identity-dependent externalities. We demonstrate that the equilibrium payoffs of the all-pay auction and the undominated strategy equilibrium payoffs of the winner-pay auction (Funk in Int J Game Theory 25(1), 51-64, 1996) cannot be ranked unambiguously in the presence of identity-dependent externalities by providing examples of environments where equilibrium payoffs in the all-pay auction dominate those of the undominated strategy equilibria in the winner-pay auction and vice versa.","[Klose, Bettina] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kovenock, Dan] Chapman Univ, Orange, CA 92866 USA",University of Zurich; Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Kovenock, D (通讯作者)，Chapman Univ, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",bettina.klose@econ.uzh.ch; kovenock@chapman.edu,"Kovenock, Dan/Q-3767-2019","Klose, Bettina/0000-0002-7058-043X",European Research Council (ERC) [ESEI-249433]; Swiss National Science Foundation [SNSF 100014 135257]; Social Science Research Center Berlin (WZB); Max Planck Institute for Tax Law and Public Finance in Munich,European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Social Science Research Center Berlin (WZB); Max Planck Institute for Tax Law and Public Finance in Munich,"We have benefited from helpful conversations with Kai Konrad, Wolfgang Leininger, Benny Moldovanu, and Ron Siegel and the comments of two anonymous referees and seminar participants at Chapman University, CORE (Universite Catholique de Louvain), Erasmus University Rotterdam, the Max Planck Institute for Tax Law and Public Finance, Mississippi State University, Purdue University, the University of Bonn, the University of California at Riverside, the University of York, and the University of Zurich.

We find that they do not export to more countries, but they export to more distant destinations than low-end ones. We also show that in contrast to low-end exporters, distance has almost no effect on high-end variety export(er)s. Because of this lower sensitivity to distance at the micro-level, specializing in the production of high-end varieties has implications for the geography of aggregate exports. Specializing in high-end varieties allows for a greater geographic diversification of aggregate exports - in particular when demand arises from both neighboring and distant countries.

Between 2006 and 2007, consumption inequality may have decreased, and over 2007 to 2009, consumption inequality was flat. Over the entire period of 1997 to 2009, consumption inequality increased moderately. The Gini coefficient for individual-level consumption inequality followed a similar pattern, though the changes were smaller in magnitude.

When these conditions are violated, the optimal mechanism contains a mixture of second and third degree price discrimination, where the former is implemented via sale of lotteries. We interpret such randomization in terms of the probability of negotiation breakdown in a bargaining protocol whose sequential equilibrium implements the optimal mechanism.","[Sher, Itai] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Vohra, Rakesh] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Vohra, Rakesh] Univ Penn, Dept Elect & Syst Engn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania,"Sher, I (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",itaisher@gmail.com; rvohra@sas.upenn.edu,,,University of Minnesota,University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System),"A previous version of this paper circulated under the title Optimal selling mechanisms on incentive graphs.

This paper develops a model of endogenous growth with a particular focus on the role of public expenditure in structural changes. We consider the dynamics of a multi-sector economy that allows for differences among sectors in the output elasticity of public expenditure, and demonstrate that there exists a unique balanced growth path that is locally saddle-path stable. Along the balanced growth path, the endogenous growth of public expenditure and its disproportionate effect on different sectors result in changes in the relative prices of goods, which, in turn, cause structural changes represented by a reallocation of resources across sectors. Quantitatively, the faster the economic growth triggered by the policy, the greater the changes in the reallocation of labor.","Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Quantitat Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, LF (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Quantitat Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zlfzjg@gmail.com,,"Zhang, Lifeng/0000-0002-8705-6247",National Social Science Foundation of China [12BJL018]; NSFC [71172223],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"I thank Yucong Ru, Jingkui Li and Sun Guang-Zhen, seminar participants at several places, two referees of this journal, and the chief editor for their comments.

In this way, funds have contributed to the generation of regional GDP and reduced unemployment during these years, causing that levels exceed 75% with respect to average GDP per capita in the European Union. So, Andalusia will not be considered as one of the Objective 1 priority areas for European Regional Policy. With the changes in the region and the threat of an expected withdrawal of funds, this article proposes an analysis to explain the meaning of this withdrawal of European Funds in Andalusia in the period 2014-2020. With this aim, we develop a Dynamic Applied General Equilibrium Model that will assess the effects of the loss of this funding on the main regional economic indicators and under different simulation scenarios. The model will analyse the effect of economic policy actions on the economy, satisfying the requirements of welfare and technological feasibility when given some restrictions on available resources.","[Cardenete Flores, M.

Through numerical simulations, we obtain policy implications regarding ESOs' incentivizing efficiency. For the first time, we demonstrate that, unlike under block exercise, subjective prices under continuous partial exercise may be higher than objective ones.

The firm may, therefore, profit from paying above-market wages and from hiring what might appear to be an inefficiently large number of workers. And because unions may overcome free-rider problems of uncoordinated political effort, a firm may favor unionization, or be less opposed to unionization than it would otherwise be.

We introduce a climate cooperation model with endogenous R&D investments where countries protect their international competitiveness via border carbon adjustments (BCA). BCA raises the scope for cooperation and leads to a non-trivial relation between countries' prior R&D investments and participation in the coalition. We find that early investments in R&D render free-riding more attractive. Therefore, with delayed cooperation on emission abatement and ex-ante R&D investments, the outcome is often characterized by high participation but inefficiently low technology investments and abatement.

This paper provides evidence of this substitution in the context of food consumption over transitory and permanent income fluctuations in Mexico. Household time investments drive a wedge between consumption and expenditure, amplifying measured expenditure volatility. Volatility decompositions for Mexico and the United States suggest that the extent of bias in expenditure-based measures induced by changes in marketization is relatively larger in the Mexican setting.

Using the Multinational Time Use Study, we find that a better perception of own health is associated with less time devoted to sleep, personal care, and non-market work, for both men and women, and with less time in leisure for men, while it is associated with more time in market work for both men and women. We also find that the relationship with activities is very similar across countries, and that market work has a relationship of substitution with sleep, personal care, non-market work, and leisure, with mixed evidence for the rest of the uses of time. These findings are consistent with prior results regarding health, market work, and leisure in the US. However, in contrast to the large positive correlation between health and home production in the US, we find a large negative correlation between these activities in the six European countries analyzed. This study represents a first step in understanding cross-country differences in the relationship between health status and time devoted to a range of activities, in contrast with other analyses that have mainly focused only on market work. A better understanding of these cross-country differences may help to identify the effects of public policies on individual uses of time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In three studies, we explore unethical favors arising from such simultaneous cyclic networks where everyone decides simultaneously whether to misrepresent key information for their principals. Study 1 and 2 found that participants in such networks were more likely to lie than they would if they worked for themselves. This increased deception may be driven by the anticipation that their lies will be indirectly reciprocated. Indeed, Study 3 found that deception decreased when the chain of delegations was broken (i.e., A represents B and B represents C). Moreover, self-report measures suggested that increased deception in simultaneous cyclic network was indeed due to anticipated indirect reciprocity. Thus, although reciprocity fosters trust and cooperation it can also create an interlocked circle of deception. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Diverging from the literature in this field, I introduce a methodology that is independent of any specific form of utility function. My theoretical analysis indicates that investment opportunities and consumption growth cause price disparities between the domestic and foreign shares of cross-listed firms. First, I show that stocks are overpriced in the local market if and only if other domestic investment opportunities are riskier and have a lower expected return than those available in foreign markets. Second, I show that domestic shares are overpriced if and only if the aggregate consumption or consumption growth in the domestic economy is smaller than that in the foreign economy. Approaches in this paper can not only explain H-share discount but also any other cross-listed price disparity. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Exploiting a large data set of replications of Holt and Laury (2002), we find no evidence that the likelihood of reporting about gender differences is affected by obtaining results in line or against the consensus. Two variables significantly increase the probability of describing results along a gender dimension: the share of women among the authors and the fact that the study focuses directly on risk preferences.

However, a general result of the literature is that the B-S effect can only explain part of the excess inflation observed in European catching-up countries. One feature of these studies is their neglect of the role of the exchange rate regime in affecting price convergence. In this paper, instead, we argue that the choice of the exchange rate regime may affect nominal convergence. To show this, we first model the regime choice and, in a second stage, estimate a B-S type of regression for each regime. Our results show that, for countries that pegged to or adopted the euro, the effect of an increase in dual productivity growth (the difference in productivity growth between the traded and non-traded sectors) on the dual inflation differential is twice as large as that in flexible countries. We conclude that, in catching-up countries, too early adoption of the euro may foster excess inflation, beyond what would be implied by B-S convergence only. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The results suggest that this extensive margin of bank lending can dampen and even overturn the standard liquidity effect of monetary contractions. When the liquidity effect is overturned, a monetary contraction results in an increase in output.

Using nonlinear threshold models, we show that finding a negative nonlinear relationship between the public debt-to-GDP ratio and economic growth is extremely difficult and sensitive to modelling choices and data coverage. In the very rare cases when nonlinearity a la Reinhart and Rogoff can be detected, the negative nonlinear correlation kicks in at very low levels of public debt (between 20% and 60% of GDP).

Payment imbalances between the North and the South have contributed to the accumulation of large stock of foreign debt, while flows of foreign capital ceased to finance productive investments which might have contributed to debt repayments-preferring instead to finance consumption and a housing bubble. The dynamic interplay between current account imbalances and the accumulation of debt reveals that, once the system is driven into disequilibrium by a real exchange rate misalignment, the longer a payments imbalance persists the harder the eventual adjustment will be. Capital reversals, by shifting portfolio balances, lead the system toward instability, sovereign default, and the collapse of the exchange rate regime. Replacing private with public creditors may temporarily help us to stay away from the point where the system breaks down. But this is only a temporary expedient because the underlying imbalances need continued and escalating financing until equilibrium is restored by other means. One permanent solution is the ECB's official monetary transactions program, if the potential expansions to the central bank's balance sheet can be tolerated. (C) 2015 Society for Policy Modeling.

J,"Koning, P; Lindeboom, M",,,,"Koning, Pierre; Lindeboom, Maarten",,,The Rise and Fall of Disability Insurance Enrollment in the Netherlands,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"As recently as 15 years ago, the high level of Disability Insurance (DI) enrollment was considered to be one of the major social and economic problems of the Netherlands; indeed, the Netherlands was characterized as the country with the most out-of-control disability program of OECD countries. But since about 2002, the Netherlands has seen a spectacular decline in its Disability Insurance enrollment rate. Radical reforms to the Dutch DI system were implemented over the period 1996 to 2006. We cluster these reforms in three broad categories: 1) reducing the incentives of employers to move workers to disability; 2) increased gatekeeping; and 3) tightening disability eligibility criteria while enhancing worker incentives. The reforms appear to have been very effective. Since 2002, yearly DI inflow rates dropped from 1.5 percent in 2001 to about 0.5 percent of the insured population in 2012. We argue that particularly the interaction of employer incentives and formal employer obligations has contributed to the substantial decrease in DI inflow. On the downside, however, it seems workers with bad health have sorted into temporary employment-without employers bearing the financial responsibility of their benefit costs.","[Koning, Pierre] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Labor Market & Welf State, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Lindeboom, Maarten] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Koning, Pierre; Lindeboom, Maarten] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Koning, Pierre; Lindeboom, Maarten] IZA Inst Study Labor, Bonn, Germany",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Koning, P (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Labor Market & Welf State, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",p.w.c.koning@vu.nl; m.lindeboom@vu.nl,,"Koning, Pierre/0000-0002-8808-9497",,,,,25,33,36,0,5,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Tax policy has been the most important instrument at its disposal to meet these objectives. A dynamic computable general equilibrium model, with endogenous labour supply, is constructed and linked to a microsimulation model in order to assess the poverty and inequality implications of interventions associated with tax changes. Tax change scenarios are experimented with under a fiscally consolidated framework, i.e., full recovery of tax reductions and exemptions. Three main conclusions are reached. First, higher direct tax progression is unlikely, but there is room for changes in the tax mix towards indirect taxation to achieve greater efficiency, poverty and inequality reduction. Second, the implication for economic growth from tax policy changes is limited. Third, raising VAT and redistributing the proceeds back to poor and extremely poor households generates pro-poor outcomes. This latter finding has important implications for tax policy, as it addresses resistance to higher consumption taxes that is fuelled by arguments that VAT increases raise the tax incidence on the poor. This is completely reversed in the proposal by directly recycling the VAT revenues raised to poor households.","[Mabugu, Ramos E.] Financial & Fiscal Commiss, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Mabugu, Ramos E.] Univ Stellenbosch, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Fofana, Ismael] Int Food Policy Res Inst, West & Cent Africa Off, Dakar, Senegal; [Chitiga-Mabugu, Margaret R.] Univ Pretoria, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Sch Publ Management & Adm, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",Stellenbosch University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Pretoria,"Mabugu, RE (通讯作者)，Financial & Fiscal Commiss, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",ramosm@ffc.co.za,"Mabugu, Ramos Emmanuel/HPF-8840-2023; Chitiga-Mabugu, Margaret/AAN-8275-2021","Mabugu, Ramos Emmanuel/0000-0001-8405-3051; Chitiga-Mabugu, Margaret/0000-0001-9894-0452",African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),The authors are grateful to the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) for providing financial support for the preparation and presentation of this article.,,37,3,4,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The equitable tax system is defined by the three axioms given by Kakwani and Lambert in 1998 and, as they suggest, inequity is evaluated by the negative influences on the redistributive effect of the tax associated with axiom violations. Measuring the extent of axiom violations among households belonging to different groups, we improve the Kakwani and Lambert analysis, which is able to detect only the existence of overall inequities. We propose a method that allows for evaluation of the contribution of each group to the overall inequity. Moreover, the adopted method enables disentangling the directions of violations. The obtained results allow us to judge how axiom violations discriminate among groups in their reciprocal relationships. An application to the 2010 Italian income tax reveals that inequities disproportionately penalize the household typologies. More precisely, unfairness affects households with children more severely than the other household groups.","[Monti, Maria Giovanna; Vernizzi, Achille] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Pellegrino, Simone] Univ Torino, Dept Econ & Stat, I-10134 Turin, Italy",University of Milan; University of Turin,"Pellegrino, S (通讯作者)，Univ Torino, Dept Econ & Stat, Corso Unione Soviet 218 Bis, I-10134 Turin, Italy.",simone.pellegrino@unito.it,"vernizzi, achille/K-4518-2017","vernizzi, achille/0000-0002-1641-5003",,,,,25,12,12,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

To rule out unobserved factors correlated with income as the basis of attraction, we randomly assigned income levels to 360 artificial profiles and recorded the incomes of nearly 4000 visits to full versions of these profiles from search engine results, which displayed abbreviated versions. We found that men of all income levels visited our female profiles of different income levels at roughly equal rates. In contrast, women of all income levels visited our male profiles with higher incomes at higher rates. Surprisingly, these higher rates increased with the women's own incomes and even jumped discontinuously when the male profiles' incomes went above that of the women's own. Our male profiles with the highest level of income received 10 times more visits than the lowest. This gender difference in ex-ante preferences for mate income could help explain marriage and spousal income patterns found in prior empirical studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We find a sizeable overall GWG of 19 log percentage points, which is explained by a large wage premium for men outside academia compared to women and men in academia. The GWG in academia is small in comparison. Whilst the GWG outside academia is very high six months after graduation and remains largely unaltered, the GWG inside academia doubles in the following three years. The Oaxaca decomposition suggests that for this relatively homogeneous group the GWG cannot be explained by differences in endowments (university and employment characteristics).

To make profits from the REC market in addition to reduced energy costs, more and more home and business owners choose to install solar panels. Recently, third-party financing has become a common practice in solar panel investments. We discuss optimal timing for the host to potentially buy back the solar panels after being installed for a period of time and how to incorporate the optimal timing into a power purchase agreement between the host and the third-party developer. Because the REC price is a major source of uncertainty and also due to the ACP capping the REC price, we first propose a REC price forecasting model that specifically considers the ACP values. Then by a modified real option structure, we model the buyback contract as a real option and solve it with an approximate dynamic program based Monte Carlo simulation method. We find that as the ACP value increases, the value of the buyback option also increases under optimal timing. The method used does not only apply to solar projects but also to other distributed renewable projects that are third-party financed, such as wind generations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The focus of autonomy-enhancing paternalism is on helping individuals to become better decision-makers, rather than on helping them by making better decisions for them. Autonomy-enhancing paternalism acknowledges that behavioral interventions can change the strength of decision-making anomalies over time, and favors those interventions that improve, rather than reduce, individuals' ability to make good and unbiased decisions. By this it prevents manipulation of the individual by the soft paternalist, accounts for the heterogeneity of individuals, and counteracts slippery slope arguments by decreasing the probability of future paternalistic interventions. Moreover, autonomy-enhancing paternalism can be defended based on both liberal values and welfare considerations.","[Binder, Martin] Bard Coll, D-13156 Berlin, Germany; [Binder, Martin] Max Planck Inst Econ, Evolutionary Econ Grp, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Lades, Leonhard K.] Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Behav Sci Ctr, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",Max Planck Society; University of Stirling,"Binder, M (通讯作者)，Bard Coll, Platanenstr 24, D-13156 Berlin, Germany.",m.binder@berlin.bard.edu; l.k.lades@stir.ac.uk,"Binder, Martin/AAF-6448-2020","Binder, Martin/0000-0002-5053-3804; Lades, Leonhard/0000-0002-3114-0781",,,,,66,21,26,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2015,68,1,,,,,3,27,,10.1111/kykl.12071,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AY6YY,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347709700002,0

We study how individuals update their beliefs about the probability of being audited, both before and after audits are permanently withdrawn. We find that when individuals have initially experienced systematic audits, they decrease both their beliefs and their contributions almost immediately after audits are withdrawn. In contrast, when audits were initially less frequent and more irregular, they maintain high beliefs and continue cooperating long after audits have been withdrawn. This identifies the compliance effect of irregularity and uncertainty due to learning difficulties. By increasing both the frequency of audits and the severity of sanctions, we also identify an educative effect of frequent and high sanctions on further cooperation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

When the contract is signed, parties are uncertain about the operating cost. The firm can increase the likelihood of facing a low cost by exerting some noncontractible effort while building the facility. Once the facility is in place, the firm learns the marginal cost and begins to operate. We characterize the contract which stipulates the efficient allocation. We study the financial structure and duration that secure its enforcement. To this end, we take into account that break-up of the partnership occasions a replacement cost for the government and an expropriation cost for the firm and its lender. Furthermore, both these costs are higher the earlier the contract is terminated. Enforcement is achieved as follows. The firm is instructed to invest some intermediate amount of own and borrowed funds. Under the aegis of a third party that can commit, the government provides guarantees to the lender, conditional on continuation of the partnership. Duration may be shortened, though not to the point where the initial effort of the firm is uncompensated.","[Danau, Daniel] Univ Caen Basse Normandie, Ctr Rech Econ & Management, F-14000 Caen, France; [Vinella, Annalisa] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Metodi Matemat, I-70124 Bari, Italy",Universite de Caen Normandie; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Danau, D (通讯作者)，Univ Caen Basse Normandie, Ctr Rech Econ & Management, 19 Rue Claude Bloch, F-14000 Caen, France.",daniel.danau@unicaen.fr; annalisa.vinella@uniba.it,,"Vinella, Annalisa/0000-0002-2602-3089",,,,,30,10,11,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

According to this expected inflation channel, government spending drives up expected inflation, which in turn, reduces the real interest rate and leads to an increase in private consumption. This paper examines whether the channel was important in the post-WWII U.S., with particular attention to the 2009 Recovery Act period. First, we show that a model calibrated to have a large output multiplier requires a large response of expected inflation to a government spending shock. Next, we show that this large response is inconsistent with structural vector autoregression evidence from the Federal Reserve's passive policy period (1959-1979). Then, we study expected inflation measures during the Recovery Act period in conjunction with a panel of professional forecaster surveys, a cross-country comparison of bond yields and fiscal policy news announcements. We show that the expected inflation response was too small to engender a large output multiplier. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Prices reflect the objective features of the paintings and of the sale, and they reveal a substantial death effect, with upward jumps in the years after the death of the artists. Both the hedonic and repeated sale price indexes show a declining pattern for the price of paintings (relative to the cost of living) starting with the French Revolution. On this basis, we analyze the emerging role and market power of art dealers and employ network theory to study whether they created rings to manipulate the outcome of the auctions for their profits.

When both public-private and private-private contracts are incomplete, the profit-sharing rules are key to regulate private partners' incentives. In failing to consider the role of imperfect bundling, the scope for PPPs may be overrated (or underrated) if the social benefits of infrastructure quality are large (or small) as compared to the social cost of operation efficiency. Also, it may be optimal for the government to restrict the admissible governance of private consortia.","Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Greco, L (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",luciano.greco@unipd.it,,"GRECO, LUCIANO GIOVANNI/0000-0002-3010-6522",,,,,14,22,25,3,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

To take account of sample selection bias associated with it, we have applied treatment-effects model. It is found that log per capita consumption or log mean per capita expenditure significantly increased as a result of access to the rural non-farm employment in both Vietnam and India - which is consistent with its poverty reducing role of accessing - with the aggregate effect larger in Vietnam than in India. Access to the rural non-farm employment significantly reduces vulnerability too in both countries, implying that diversification of household activities into non-farm sector would reduce such risks. When we disaggregate non-farm sector employment by its type, we find that poverty and vulnerability reducing effects are much larger for sales, professionals, and clerks than for unskilled or manual employment in both countries. However, because even unskilled or manual non-farm employment significantly reduces poverty and vulnerability in India and poverty in some years in Vietnam, this has considerable policy significance as the rural poor do not have easy access to skilled non-farm employment.

Using a sequential-Nash-bargaining model we examine a scenario where a buyer can purchase N identical properties from N queued sellers. We examine the scenario with respect to two bargaining processes, (i) where each contingent price must be agreed upon by buyer and seller, (ii) where the buyer has an additional option to execute a transaction at a predetermined price for a fee. Using the first mechanism, theory predicts, given equal bargaining weights, that sellers who are later in the queue will receive lower prices. Using the second mechanism, theory predicts that prices should be equal when sellers have equal bargaining weight. We experimentally test these predictions and find evidence that welfare is maximized in both treatments, and that price predictions in the second protocol align with the theory.

However, there is an increasing trend of movies being imported from non-US countries. This study extends the one-way flow model of media products to examine whether there has been an increase in the diversity of movie imports in recent years and to explain how this has been influenced by changes in cultural taste over time. Regression analyses of movies imported from 1999 to 2009 confirm the economic theory of one-way media flow that considers both market size and cultural discount. In addition, changes in the Australian population composition and increased exposure to foreign culture are found to influence the diversity in movie imports. The analysis indicates that cultural taste can change through repeated exposure and consumption. Through a longer-term investigation of how cultural tastes form and change over time, we can establish a more nuanced model of international trade in cultural products.","Univ Canberra, Fac Arts & Design, Bruce, ACT, Australia",University of Canberra,"Park, S (通讯作者)，Univ Canberra, Fac Arts & Design, Bruce, ACT, Australia.",sora.park@canberra.edu.au,"Park, Sora/H-3296-2013","Park, Sora/0000-0003-3082-314X",,,,,44,12,14,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Among the multiple aims of the TPP, we focus on one specific channel of welfare gain the TPP eradicates the tariffs among the member countries. We construct a multi-country trade model where import tariffs generate negative externality across the countries through firm-delocation a la Ossa (2011). We find that the overall welfare impact from joining the TPP is critically dependent on China's presence in the TPP. To be specific, when Korea joins the TPP without China, overall welfare impact is slightly negative; however when China subsequently joins the TPP, Korea experiences a net welfare gain. In the counter-factual scenario where neither Korea nor China joins the TPP, but there is a bilateral free-trade agreement between the two countries, Korea gains the most in terms of welfare. The policy implication of this paper is that the Korean government should cautiously compare the cost of joining the TPP with its potential benefits that are not related to tariff reduction in nature (such as strengthened diplomatic relations with the TPP membership countries).","[Roh, Jae-whak] Hansung Univ, Dept Int Trade, Seoul, South Korea; [Kwon, O-hyun] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Econ, Madison, WI USA",Hansung University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Roh, JW (通讯作者)，Hansung Univ, Dept Int Trade, Seoul, South Korea.",,"Kwon, Oh-Hyun/V-8085-2019; Fan, Sicong/E-3591-2015","Kwon, Oh-Hyun/0000-0002-7614-0451;",Hansung University,Hansung University,This research is sponsored by Hansung University.,,17,0,0,0,23,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

A major focus of the paper is to consider the possibility group heterogeneity and non-linearity. Having estimated the model for all of the countries in the panel and finding that military burden has a negative effect on growth in the short and long run, the panel is broken down into various groupings based upon a range of potentially relevant factors, and the robustness of the results is evaluated. The factors considered are different levels of income, conflict experience, natural resources abundance, openness and aid. The estimates for the different groups are remarkably consistent with those for the whole panel, providing strong support for the argument that military spending has adverse effects on growth. There are, however, some intriguing results that suggest that for certain types of countries military spending has no significant effect on growth.","[Dunne, J.

This article empirically estimates India's long-and short-term demand relations for crude oil, diesel and petrol (gasoline) using the ARDL and ECM cointegration procedures and then uses them to project demand for these products up to 2025 under various scenarios of GDP growth and oil prices. Our projections show that over 2012 to 2025, demand is likely to increase by about 74% for crude oil, 117% for diesel and 136% for petrol - the annual growth rates being about 4.3% for crude oil, 6.1% for diesel and 6.8% for petrol (gasoline). This article suggests that India needs to (1) take measures to improve efficiency in the use of petroleum products; (2) try to enhance supplies such as through production sharing agreements by Indian oil companies with other countries and (3) increase the use of nuclear, hydro, solar and other alternative energy sources, as Western European countries have done.","Reserve Bank India, RBI Unit, Inst Econ Growth, Delhi, India",Reserve Bank of India,"Agrawal, P (通讯作者)，Reserve Bank India, RBI Unit, Inst Econ Growth, Delhi, India.",pradeep@iegindia.org,,,,,,,19,9,9,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Based on the Accounting Equation, we use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to estimate variable returns of scale efficiency scores and to conclude on specific characteristics that efficient companies have, for example, on capital structure. Our results from the DEA application show a high degree of inefficiency. We found that SMEs on the islands are more efficient than those on the mainland and that SMEs in the cities are the least efficient. Size seems to be important, more so on the islands and on the mainland than in the cities. We conclude that companies should act more conservatively in terms of operating cost when the first signs of a recession appear. In addition, during a recession period, companies that have evidences that their operations will continue positively should strengthen their operations by raising more own capital. Finally, our study clarifies four issues: the efficiency of retail companies in a period of growth and a period of recession, focusing on SMEs that operate in different regions, connecting Accounting Equation and DEA and adding acid ratio as an output in our model.","[Balios, Dimitris; Eriotis, Nikolaos; Fragoudaki, Alexandra; Giokas, Dimitrios] Univ Athens, Dept Econ, Athens 10559, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Balios, D (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Dept Econ, Athens 10559, Greece.",dbalios@econ.uoa.gr,"Eriotis, Nikolaos/AAD-6327-2020; Balios, Dimitris/AAL-7707-2021; GIOKAS, DIMITRIS/AAL-6627-2021","Balios, Dimitris/0000-0002-0130-9320;",Special Account for Research Grants (SARG) of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens [70/3/11696],Special Account for Research Grants (SARG) of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens,This work was supported by Special Account for Research Grants (SARG) of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens [70/3/11696].,,45,17,22,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Military conscription with educational exemptions and the Vietnam War increased male PhDs in the USA, but, as expected, had no effect for US females or in Canada. This suggests that the war and draft effect for US males were not reflecting other unmeasured North American effects. Government expenditures on research and development enhanced the PhD production, especially for males and in the physical sciences. The cyclical indicator, the adult male unemployment rate, has a weak positive effect for males in both the USA and Canada, suggesting that during the post-WW II period, the positive effect on graduate-level education of the reduced opportunity cost of time due to a recession was stronger than the negative wealth effect of the recession.

Recent innovative studies have shown that households form their expectations by observing professionals' forecasts albeit imperfectly. Such inattentive behavior has been used to explain inflation dynamics. The purpose of the present paper is to provide further microfoundations to the sticky information expectations model by incorporating social learning between households. Here, social learning is modeled through spatial local interactions: households learn from their neighbors as they form their expectations. We show the convergence of households' expectations depends on the rate of absorbing the professional's forecasts and the interaction rate with neighbors but also on the spatial variability of the cross-section expectation distribution. The analysis also distinguishes between active and passive households as the latter do not have access to the professional's forecast or prefer to learn from others, such as the active households. We show that the social interactions between active and passive households can lead to non-monotonic convergence. Finally, while our model with active agents is able to match only the mean inflation expectation of the Michigan survey, our model with active and passive agents is able to replicate both the first and the second moments of the inflation expectations observed in the survey.","[Easaw, Joshy] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Econ Sect, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales; [Mossay, Pascal] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England",Cardiff University; Newcastle University - UK,"Easaw, J (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Econ Sect, Aberconway Bldg,Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.",EasawJ1@cardiff.ac.uk,,,,,,,21,2,2,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

(2013), to a formal econometric test to identify public debt thresholds endogenously. We show that the nonlinear relation between debt and growth is not robust. Taken with a pinch of salt, our results suggest, however, that a negative association between central government debt and growth may set in at debt levels as low as 20% of GDP. Further (and greater) thresholds may exist, but their magnitude is uncertain. For general government debt, the threshold is considerably higher at about 50%. Country-specific estimates reveal a large amount of cross-country heterogeneity. For some countries including the United States, a nonlinear negative link can be detected at about 30% of GDP. For others, no nonlinearities can be established. Our results are a formal econometric confirmation that the 90% public debt threshold is not in the Reinhart-Rogoff data. But our results also seem to suggest that public debt be associated with poor economic performance at fairly moderate public debt levels. The absence of threshold effects or low estimated thresholds may not preclude the emergence of further threshold effects, especially as public debt levels are rising to unprecedentedly high levels.","[Egert, Balazs] OECD, Dept Econ, Paris, France; [Egert, Balazs] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre Def, EconomiX, Nanterre, France; [Egert, Balazs] IPAG, Paris, France; [Egert, Balazs] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris Nanterre; Ifo Institut,"Egert, B (通讯作者)，OECD, Dept Econ, Paris, France.",balazs.egert@oecd.org,,,,,,,6,32,38,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

When the Taylor rule path was computed using revised data and the deflator for the GDP, we found a notable impact on key housing market variables, supporting Taylor's critique of the Fed policy. However, the bulk of our evidence suggests that the policy as it would have been conducted under our real-time Taylor rules would not have had any significant impact on the housing market variables.

First, the switch from a cross-sectional to a dynamic panel data framework enables the estimated rate of conditional convergence to be higher, more accurate and more appropriate for realistic and theoretical expectations. Second, the spatial Durbin model (SDM) is a general form of simplified model that considers spatial error correlation, and its likelihood ratio test for the theoretical model of 'learning by doing' effect provides further evidence. Finally, statistical tests find that spatial correlation not only occurs in each variable, but also appears in the error term. Thus, the SDM does not exist in the assumptions associated with the spatial error, which are not necessarily correct.","[Lu, Shengrong; Wang, Yanwu] Xiamen Univ, Ctr Macroecon Res, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,"Wang, YW (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Ctr Macroecon Res, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",wywu@xmu.edu.cn,,,,,,,24,5,6,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To achieve a balanced economy, more money should be invested in the real sector to appropriately reduce the rate of savings leakage; the financial sector should move from scale expansion to service efficiency improvements to increase its marginal contribution to the economy and to enhance capital efficiency; the real sector should improve technological innovation and speed up the adaptive adjustment in climate-sensitive industries to move from economic growth to advanced development.","[Lu, Wencong; Huang, Jianfeng] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Musshoff, Oliver] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",Zhejiang University; University of Gottingen,"Huang, JF (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",hjfjack@zju.edu.cn,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021; Huang, Jianfeng/AAF-7433-2020","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Huang, Jianfeng/0000-0002-7369-7182",Robert-Bosch-Stiftung [32.5.8003.0093.0],Robert-Bosch-Stiftung,The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Robert-Bosch-Stiftung [No. 32.5.8003.0093.0].,,23,4,4,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The macroeconomic environment undoubtedly has the impact on banks' performance results. This research analyzes the impact of the country's economic downturn on banks' loan portfolio profitability. The Lithuanian economic downturn in 2009-2010 negatively affected the banks' debtors abilities to repay their debts increasing the proportion of non-performing loans (NPLs) and reducing the banks' loan portfolio. Also the changes in the interbank interest rates and credit margins had the impact on the banks' interest income and expenses. The statistical analysis techniques allowed to characterize the dependence between macroeconomic indicators and the bank's loan portfolio profitability. Afterwards the factorial regression model was developed to predict the Lithuanian commercial banks' loan portfolio to GDP ratio according to the country's macroeconomic indicators. To assess the consistent patterns of loan portfolio profitability that are typical for the banking systems, the macroeconomic and banks' data of other EU countries was analyzed. Because the proportion of non-performing loans in banks is one of the main factors of their loan portfolio profitability, the association rules network was developed to visualize the dependence between NPLs and macroeconomic indicators. The analysis results affirmed the high sensitivity of NPLs ratio to the economic downturn in the EU countries with the imperfect macroeconomic indicators. It follows that banks in these countries assessing the credit risk of loan applicants must consider the possible changes in the macroeconomy, because they have the significant impact on banks' loan portfolio profitability in future periods.","Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Mileris, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",ricardas.mileris@ktu.lt,,,,,,,31,2,2,2,22,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Pricing patterns mostly conform to these patterns. Most price changes are positive, and inflation is strongly correlated with average magnitude, but not the frequency, of price changes. Prices are affected negatively by the productivity shock and positively by the output gap. Lagged real interest rate has a negative effect on prices, unless human subjects choose the interest rate, or firms sell perfect substitutes in the output market. There is inertia in price setting, firms integrate wage increases into their prices, and there is evidence of adaptive behavior in price-setting in our laboratory economy.

Thus, MAS has to be appropriately developed and organized. The paper aims to explore the role of MAS in the decisionmaking process and its changes from the perspective of the economy that shifted from transition towards market-oriented economy. The study was performed on the sample of medium-sized and large Slovenian companies. The methodology comprises an interpretation of responses to the questionnaire, which was distributed in 1995, 2001, 2006, and 2011. The analysis of the data shows changes in the role of MAS over time and indicates the characteristics of MAS during transition and post-transition periods. The role of MAS was assessed by analyzing the frequency of reporting, content, and scope of MAS information for top and middle management. The results show that in times of crisis Slovenian management did not use MAS information more frequently, as suggested by the theory. The results indicate that MAS was not that developed during the transition period in comparison to traditionally developed market economies, while during the post-transition period, especially in the period of crisis, improvements are notable. Based on the results, the authors provide some recommendations for further improvement of MAS in the analyzed companies. The study is designed to make a contribution to management accounting literature from the perspective of a transition economy.","[Odar, Marjan; Kavcic, Slavka] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Jerman, Mateja] Univ Primorska, Koper 6000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; University of Primorska,"Odar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",marjan.odar@si-revizija.si; slavka.kavcic@ef.uni-lj.si; mateja.jerman@fm-kp.si,,,,,,,30,6,16,0,33,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Firstly, international tax competition and voter hostility makes the increasing of tax rates difficult. This is compounded by tax evasion and avoidance. Secondly, in the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2008, many governments face an unsustainable debt to GDP ratio. Finally, there are increasing pressures on public spending from an increasingly elderly population. Given this, expansionary fiscal policy now has limited applicability in many countries. In part to fill the (temporary?) gap left by fiscal policy, a new tool of macroeconomic management has emerged quantitative easing (QE). The view that QE is being used as a tool to boost the economy in a manner similar to expansionary fiscal policy is a controversial one. It is controversial in part because conventional economic theory indicates that increasing the money supply will lead to inflation. It is also controversial because relatively few view QE in this way. In this paper, we discuss the current view of QE as a tool of 'balance sheet operations'. We then turn to the quantity theory of money which suggests that expanding the money supply will lead to inflation. Finally we will turn to the use of QE as a tool of macroeconomic policy, similar to expansionary fiscal policy, looking at its use, its potential, its dangers and limitations.","[Orviska, Marta] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia; [Hudson, John] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",Matej Bel University; University of Bath,"Orviská, M (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",marta.orviska@umb.sk; J.R.Hudson@bath.ac.uk,"Orviska, Marta/U-5000-2019",,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,NEWTON ACAD AS,PRAHA 1,"POLITICKYCH VEZNU 10, PRAHA 1, 110 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87325-05-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,62,73,,,,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF3UF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380582800005,0

The VAT was introduced in Slovakia within the reform of the taxation system as of January 1, 1993, and along with the excise duties replaced the previously applied turnover tax and import tax. The VAT Act in Slovakia provides for two rates of taxation, i.e. the standard one at 20 % and the reduced one at 10 %. Like other taxes, VAT is subject to risks arising from tax errors and evasions that reduce the scope of the declared, accounted for and collected tax. Estimation of VAT losses is an important tool for their detection and prevention as well as for collection of the right sums of VAT in the right time (European Commission, 2015). Comparative international evidence suggests the conclusion that the collection efficiency of VAT in the Slovak Republic is at very low level.","[Slahor, L'udomir; Bartekova, Maria] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Slahor, L (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia.",ludomir.slahor@fm.uniba.sk; maria.bartekova@st.fm.uniba.sk,"Kmety Bartekova, Maria/AAW-5743-2021",,,,,,16,3,3,0,2,NEWTON COLL AS,PRAHA 1,"POLITICKYCH VEZNU 10, PRAHA 1, 110 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87325-05-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,118,126,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF3UF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380582800010,0

Two questions are posed in this article. The first is whether previous use experience of a resource (Sene nature reserve) similar to that being valuated (future nature reserves) and located in the same geographical area (Gulf of Morbihan) impacts on WTP. The second is whether accounting for the endogeneity of direct experience matters in the estimation of WTP. We find that respondents who have not experienced the Sene nature reserve provide value estimates that are statistically comparable to that of respondents who have experienced it. Our assumption is that respondents have acquired sufficient and adequate experience of future nature reserves from the questionnaire that experience obtained by experiencing the Sene nature reserve was not necessary for making a valid value formulation. Hence, aggregation of WTP estimates to obtain a total valuation of the future nature reserves is reasonable over the full target population. In addition, our results show that direct experience is endogenously determined; but controlling for the endogeneity has a marginal effect on WTP estimates.","ULCO, TVES, F-59140 Dunkerque, France",Universite du Littoral-Cote-d'Opale,"Voltaire, L (通讯作者)，ULCO, TVES, 21 Quai Citadelle, F-59140 Dunkerque, France.",louinord.voltaire@univ-littoral.fr,,,,,,,37,4,4,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In contrast, the main result is that public information can always be replicated if in addition to cheap talk, the players have access to undifferentiated tokens that can be freely transferred among neighbors (which bear some resemblance to certain models of fiat money).

Financial integration is divided into four stages: financial autarky, two-country integration, center-periphery integration and global integration. Two effects from financial integration emerge: diversification effects and financial terms of trade effects. Results show that financial integration between the center and a new periphery in center-periphery integration generates welfare losses for the peripheral country already integrated and welfare gains for the central country. Allowing for financial integration between peripheries in global integration leads the welfare in the center to deteriorate.

Different assumptions of New Keynesian and Real Business Cycle theory are tested. The results demonstrate that a non-technology shock is more important in explaining business cycles in post-transition countries, although a technology shock is not trivial. The technology shock cannot replicate basic business cycle facts observed in the data: it produces a low or negative correlation between employment and GDP, and a strong negative correlation between labour productivity and employment. Technology and non-technology GDP components are analysed in the transition and post-transition period.

We focus on career start since we expect that temporary contracts and their inherent economic uncertainty imply a path dependence that might have spill-over effects on other domains of life. Our empirical analysis is based on rich data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, which provides comprehensive information about individuals' labour market history as well as about their fertility. Our main results are the following. Women (i) tend to postpone first birth due to fixed-term employment at labour market entry and (ii) reduce the number of children in the first 10 years after graduation. These associations are strongest in the subsample of native women with at least vocational training. (iii) In contrast, we find no significant correlations for men.

Using a reform of the parental leave scheme in Denmark that increased the number of weeks of leave with full benefit compensation, we estimate the effect of the length of maternity leave on a range of health indicators including hospital admissions for both mother, child and siblings and the probability of the mother receiving antidepressants. The reform increased the average post-birth maternity leave by 32 days. We find some evidence that the increase in the length of paid maternity leave matters for maternal and sibling health outcomes, but only very limited evidence for the child health outcomes. This is in line with the existing evidence that tends to find limited effects of maternity leave on children's educational and labor market outcomes. Our results suggest that any beneficial effects of increasing the length of paid maternity leave are greater for low-resource families. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

An instrumental variable approach using two institutional changes is applied to address the endogeneity of education in income equations for various subsamples. To investigate the impact of education on income inequality between ethnic minorities and Han, we introduce an interaction term between the ethnic minority status and years of education. Our results suggest that there exists significant income inequality to the disadvantage of ethnic minorities for the full, female, and urban samples, and depending on the instrument also for the rural sample. Nevertheless, our results for these samples show specific returns to education for ethnic minorities, which implies that a portion of the income gap can be overcome with additional education. We find that in general one additional year of education will increase earned incomes of ethnic minorities by 26.3-28% and in particular by 13.5-14A% for women from an ethnic minority group, by 10.4-14% for ethnic minorities with urban household registration, and by 10.8% for ethnic minorities with rural household registration. However, we cannot obtain conclusive results for the male sample due to weak instruments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Inoguchi, M",,,,"Inoguchi, Masahiro",,,NONPERFORMING LOANS AND PURCHASE OF LOANS BY PUBLIC ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANIES IN MALAYSIA AND THAILAND,PACIFIC ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PANEL-DATA; BANKS,"This paper explores the factors which eliminated the nonperforming loan (NPL) problem in Malaysia and Thailand following the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The number of NPL, which expanded in the aftermath of the crisis, has since declined in most South-East Asian countries. Although previous studies have explored the causes of the increase in NPL numbers, few have analysed the factors that contributed to the reduction in their number in Asia. In Malaysia and Thailand, authorities put in place several measures to manage NPL. As a vehicle to acquire NPL from banks, Malaysia established the Pengurusan Danaharta Nasional Berhad (Danaharta) in 1998, while Thailand established the Thai Asset Management Corporation (TAMC) in 2001. We analyse whether the characteristic features of banks, improvements in macroeconomic conditions, and facilities for purchasing loans caused a reduction in the number of NPL in Malaysia and Thailand. The results suggest that selling loans to a public asset management company was effective in reducing the number of NPL in Thailand. While macroeconomic conditions influenced the decline in NPL ratios in Thailand, in Malaysia, well performing commercial banks and large commercial and investment banks generally had smaller NPL ratios throughout and following the crisis.","[Inoguchi, Masahiro] Ritsumeikan Univ, 2-150 Iwakura Cho, Ibaraki, Osaka 5678570, Japan",Ritsumeikan University,"Inoguchi, M (通讯作者)，Ritsumeikan Univ, 2-150 Iwakura Cho, Ibaraki, Osaka 5678570, Japan.",inoguchi@fc.ritsumei.ac.jp,,"Inoguchi, Masahiro/0000-0003-3661-682X","JSPS KAKENHI Grant [21730267]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21730267, 16K03759] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI Grant(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author gratefully acknowledges helpful comments and suggestions by Jenny Corbett, John Tang, Timo Henckel, Shigeyuki Abe, Fumiharu Mieno, Daiji Kawaguchi, Hiroshi Gunji, Junji Yano, an anonymous referee, seminar participants at Doshisha University, Hitotsubashi University and the Australian National University, and delegates at the meeting of the Japan Society of Monetary Economics.

We estimate an event-history model using data from the British National Child Development Study (NCDS), where accidents causing a unscheduled hospitalization are the measure for unanticipated health shocks. Our results show that experiencing such a health shock substantially increases the likelihood of the onset of a disability, while it does not have direct effects on employment at later ages. This finding is used to simulate the causal effects of the onset of a disability on later employment outcomes. These simulations show that about two-third of the association between disability and employment can be explained by the causal effect of the onset of a disability on employment. The remaining one-third is selection. For men and lower-educated workers the association is mainly explained by the causal effect, while for women selection is more important. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Uncertainty takes the form of a noisy component in a firm's initial signal about job productivity. Greater uncertainty dampens job creation by increasing the risk of making the costly mistake of investing in jobs that will turn out to be unprofitable. Thus, uncertainty shocks can cause labor market downturns: lower vacancy rates, lower job-finding rates, and higher unemployment.

We then show that if the eco-industry is skilled labor intensive relative to the polluting final goods industry, while a subsidy for purchasing environmental goods decreases the unemployment rate of unskilled labor, it may increase total emissions. In contrast, the emission tax and the subsidy to eco-industry firms worsen the unemployment rate, though both policies decrease total emissions. Hence, if the emission tax is set equal to the marginal environmental damage, and either a downstream or upstream subsidy is used to mitigate unskilled unemployment, the optimal subsidy to purchase the goods is positive whereas the optimal subsidy to the eco-industry is negative, i.e., a tax on the eco-industry.","[Sugiyama, Yasuyuki] Fukui Prefectural Univ, Eiheiji Town, Fukui, Japan; [Saito, Muneyuki] Nara Prefectural Univ, Nara, Japan",Fukui Prefectural University; Nara Medical University,"Sugiyama, Y (通讯作者)，Fukui Prefectural Univ, Fac Econ, 4-1-1 Matsuoka Kenjojima, Eiheiji Town, Fukui 9101195, Japan.",sugiyama@fpu.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15 K03440, 23730246, 24730217]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24730217, 23730246] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are deeply indebted to Kenzo Abe, Naoto Jinji, Yoshifumi Okawa, Morihiro Yomogida, conference and Kansai Branch workshop participants of the Japan Society of International Economics (JSIE), joint workshop participants of Nagoya International Economic Study Group (NIESG) and Institute of Developing Economies, Japan External Trade Organization (IDE-JETRO), and seminar participants of Kyoto University and Gangneung-Wonju National University for their helpful comments and discussions.

In particular, countries with longer histories of state-level political institutions experience less macroeconomic volatility in post-war periods. Robustness checks reveal that the effect of this historical variable on volatility remains significant and substantial after controlling for a host of structural variables investigated in previous studies.

Consequently, the main role of climate policies is to balance between mitigation efforts, aimed at delaying (or even preventing) the occurrence of such events, and adaptation actions, aimed at minimizing the damage inflicted upon occurrence. The former affects the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere; the latter determines the impact of loss once the event occurs. This work examines the tradeoffs associated with these two types of policy measures by characterizing the optimal mitigation adaptation mix in the-long run. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We further incorporate a superior monetary measure, the aggregation-theoretic Divisia monetary aggregate. Our paper confirms the efficacy of the Kim and Roubini (J Monet Econ 45(3):561-586, 2000) contemporaneous restriction, customized for the Indian economy, especially when compared with recursive structure, which is damaged by the price puzzle and the exchange rate puzzle. The importance of incorporating correctly measured money into the exchange rate model is illustrated, when we compare models with no-money, simple-sum monetary measures, and Divisia monetary measures. Our results are confirmed in terms of impulse response, variance decomposition analysis, and out-of-sample forecasting. In addition, we do a flip-flop variance decomposition analysis, finding two important phenomena in the Indian economy: (i) the existence of a weak link between the nominal-policy variable and real-economic activity, and (ii) the use of inflation-targeting as a primary goal of the Indian monetary authority. These two main results are robust, holding across different time period, dissimilar monetary aggregates, and diverse exogenous model designs.","[Barnett, William A.; Bhadury, Soumya Suvra] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Barnett, William A.] Ctr Financial Stabil, New York, NY 10036 USA; [Ghosh, Taniya] Reserve Bank India, IGIDR, Bombay, Maharashtra, India",University of Kansas; Reserve Bank of India,"Barnett, WA (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.;Barnett, WA (通讯作者)，Ctr Financial Stabil, New York, NY 10036 USA.",barnett@ku.edu,"Barnett, William/GWU-7996-2022",,,,,,38,7,8,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

A conservative payment scheme is to pay for the outcome from every decision made. An alternative approach is to pay for the outcome of only a subset of the choices made, with the amount at stake for this choice multiplied to compensate for the decreased likelihood of that choice's outcome being drawn for payoff. This pay one approach can help to avoid wealth effects, hedging, and bankruptcy considerations. A third method is to pay only a subset of the participants for their choices, thereby minimizing transactions costs. While the evidence on differences across payment methods is mixed, overall it suggests that paying for only a subset of periods or individuals is at least as effective as the pay all approach and can well be more effective.

Applying causal treatment effect analysis based on matching and a diff-in-diff approach combined with a qualitative case study of Swedish innovation subsidy programs, we test whether such subsidies have positive effects on firm performance. Our results indicate a lack of positive performance effects in the long run for the majority of firms, albeit there are positive short-run effects on human capital investments and also positive short-term productivity effects for the smallest firms. These findings are interpreted from a robust political economy perspective that reveals that the problems of acquiring correct information and designing appropriate incentives are so complex that the absence of significant positive long-run effects on firm performance for the majority of firms is not surprising.","[Gustafsson, Anders; Stephan, Andreas; Hallman, Alice; Karlsson, Nils] Ratio Inst, Box 3203, S-10364 Stockholm, Sweden; [Gustafsson, Anders; Stephan, Andreas] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Hallman, Alice] Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",Jonkoping University; Stockholm School of Economics,"Gustafsson, A (通讯作者)，Ratio Inst, Box 3203, S-10364 Stockholm, Sweden.;Gustafsson, A (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden.",anders.gustafsson@ratio.se,"Stephan, Andreas/KBR-0958-2024","Stephan, Andreas/0000-0001-5776-9396; Karna, Anders/0000-0002-9173-8347",,,,,93,17,19,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2016,43,4,,,SI,,729,756,,10.1007/s10663-016-9350-6,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,EA1SI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386371800004,0

It identifies the peer effects of social networks by using a unique and detailed dataset derived from the author's field survey in a rural village in a post Soviet Central Asian country.

The empirical results suggest that peer effects positively influence household decisions to emigrate, whereas network position does not. It is suggested the existence of intense social networks, which can be sources of spillover effects, might increase migration from the village society.

Head Start draws roughly a third of its participants from competing preschool programs, many of which receive public funds. We show that accounting for the fiscal impacts of such program substitution pushes estimates of Head Start's benefit-cost ratio well above one under a wide range of assumptions on the structure of the market for preschool services and the dollar value of test score gains. To parse the program's test score impacts relative to home care and competing preschools, we selection-correct test scores in each care environment using excluded interactions between experimental assignments and household characteristics. We find that Head Start generates larger test score gains for children who would not otherwise attend preschool and for children who are less likely to participate in the program.","[Kline, Patrick] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kline, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,Berkeley Center for Equitable Growth,Berkeley Center for Equitable Growth,"We thank Danny Yagan, James Heckman, Nathan Hendren, Magne Mogstad, Jesse Rothstein, Melissa Tartari, and seminar participants at UC Berkeley, the University of Chicago, Arizona State University, Harvard University, Stanford University, the NBER Public Economics Spring 2015 Meetings, Columbia University, UC San Diego, Princeton University, the NBER Labor Studies Summer Institute 2015 Meetings, Uppsala University, MIT, Vanderbilt University, and four anonymous referees for helpful comments.

In light of the unresolved tensions resulting from changed macroeconomic conditions, the emergence of new social risks as well as from the consequences of the Great Recession and its aftershocks, more adjustments are needed. The present paper investigates the current outlook on welfare state change, retracing its socio-economic drivers and the salient steps that were undertaken to reform welfare states in the last decades. Since the outbreak of the crisis, calls to adopt a social investment perspective on welfare state reform intensified, both in the academic field and at the EU policy-level. Ample space is therefore devoted to the discussion of this perspective, its conceptual basis, and implementation. For a number of reasons, social investment seems the most appropriate approach to frame the objectives that contemporary welfare states have to pursue and to devise a consistent set of policies. The objections which have been moved against the social investment perspective have however to be taken seriously. Moreover, current developments indicate diverging trends across EU Member States, with lack of progress in those countries which are most in need of a social investment strategy. To become an effective policy paradigm, the social investment perspective thus needs a stronger anchoring within the EU architecture and more co-ordinated commitment from Member States.","[Leoni, Thomas] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,"Leoni, T (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",Thomas.Leoni@wifo.ac.at,"Leoni, Thomas/ABG-8725-2020","Leoni, Thomas/0000-0001-6300-5536",European Community [290647],European Community,"This research has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2007-2013 under Grant agreement no. 290647.

The main implication is that world demand places the dominant constraint to which individual country growth adjusts. I discuss this implication and argue that tests of the BPCG model have essentially been tests of the hypothesis that trade is balanced over the long run; a plausible hypothesis but one that need not hold mainly through responses to world demand (as transmitted via income elasticities). I then discuss the role of relative prices and investment, point out logical inadequacies in the traditional BPCG framework and suggest an alternative theoretical framework to investigate its robustness. Our theoretical and empirical explorations suggest that traditional tests of the BPCG model may be misleading. Including investment as a proxy for the capacity to export and addressing endogeneity issues, for example, noticeably weakens the influence of world demand. The evidence presented contributes to reconciling evidence supporting the BPCG hypothesis with recent work that consistently finds an important role for the level of the real exchange rate and investment, independently of world demand.","[Razmi, Arslan] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Razmi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, 814 Thompson Hall,200 Hicks Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",arazmi@econs.umass.edu,,,,,,,40,36,38,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Simulation results show that the formation of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) between ASEAN and the Plus-6 economies (the People's Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea in East Asia; and the other three economies of Australia, India, and New Zealand) could increase bilateral trade between the Lao PDR and ASEAN+6 by US$1 billion, and ASEAN+3 by US$981 million.

An inheritance is not subject to laws in the U.S. governing division of marital property at divorce, because it is not acquired with income earned during marriage. Hence it plays the role of a distribution factor in the intrahousehold allocation of resources, increasing bargaining power of the recipient. Controlling for inheritance expectations, we interpret the receipt of an inheritance as a shock to wealth. Our results indicate that receiving an inheritance reduces LFP of the recipient by four percentage points, comparable in magnitude to the effect of a self-reported decline in health. However, an inheritance has little or no effect on LFP of the spouse. These estimates are inconsistent with a dynamic, collective model of the household in which spouses have the ability to commit to an ex ante efficient allocation.

The data generally support the central hypothesis that higher levels of diversity within a county are associated with enhanced employment stability across all counties as well as subsets of metro and nonmetro counties.

It derives demand functions from a discrete choice model, and interest rates from an imperfect competition model, in both cases with differentiated products. These functions are estimated using panel data with 23 credit limit segments and 18 issuing banks between June 2011 and June 2015. The results indicate that there is imperfect competition with differentiated products, and that cards are closer substitutes when they belong to similar segments. Also, they reveal that interest rates respond to costs, although they also reflect supra-competitive margins. The analysis associates market power with the age of the account, which suggests possible information asymmetries and/or switching costs. In general, lower credit limits have higher rates, but also higher costs and lower margins. The results also contribute to assess potential effects of mergers between issuing banks. Finally, the paper presents some policy recommendations based on this evidence.","[Estrada Gonzalez, Ernesto] IFT, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",,"González, EE (通讯作者)，IFT, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",eestrada62@gmail.com,,,,,,,45,1,1,1,14,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

In contrast to the existing literature that uses data collected at lower frequencies, I find that the estimated relationship between daily consumer confidence and daily spending is weak.

The ACA dependent coverage mandate allows young adults to remain on their parents' health insurance plans until their 26th birthday. Using the Survey of Income and Program Participation data, I find that the ACA mandate reduced precautionary savings for households with both parental employer-sponsored health insurance and dependent children aged 19-25 years.

We find that judicial error undermines cooperation and that the effects of type I and II errors are symmetric. To investigate their relative (dis-)like for error, we let subjects choose what type of error to prevent. We find that subjects prefer type II over type I errors.

Creating and destroying jobs is costly and workers are paid a share of the value of the marginal worker. The model predicts that employment and labor costs react differently to transitory shocks and permanent shocks. Quantitative evaluation of the model on a panel of French firms shows the model's performance. Modest adjustment costs are needed to reproduce observed job reallocation and inaction rates. Removing adjustment costs leads to productivity gains of 1% at the steady state. These gains are 50% larger in an economy with only transitory shocks and an order of magnitude lower in an economy with only permanent shocks. Bargaining dampens the reallocation of labor across firms,. leading to larger efficiency losses from adjustment costs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Traded quantities respond only weakly to a 30 percent reduction in the average nominal tariff rate. Trade flow data combined with primary data on firm behavior and bribe payments suggest that corruption is a potential explanation for the observed low elasticities. In contexts of pervasive corruption, even small bribes can significantly reduce tariffs, making tariff liberalization schemes less likely to affect the extensive and the intensive margins of firms' import behavior. The tariff liberalization scheme is, however, still associated with improved incentives to accurately report quantities of imported goods, and with a significant reduction in bribe transfers from importers to public officials.","[Sequeira, Sandra] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Sequeira, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",S.Sequeira@lse.ac.uk,,,International Growth Center (IGC); World Bank; International Finance Corporation (IFC); STICERD's Young Researcher Award at LSE,International Growth Center (IGC); World Bank(The World Bank India); International Finance Corporation (IFC); STICERD's Young Researcher Award at LSE,"The author thanks Alberto da Cruz, Diogo Wahnon, Novella Maugeri, and Guo Xu for superb assistance with the data.

It describes the context in which he made contributions relevant to two extremes of the game theory spectrum. At one extreme, he made an experimental study of whether laboratory subjects learn to use Von Neumann's minimax theory in games of pure conflict. At the other extreme, he invented a theory of empathetic identification that lies at the root of an approach to making interpersonal comparisons needed for the study of games in which cooperation is central rather than conflict. These pieces of work are peripheral to his major interests, but they nevertheless illustrate how it is possible to be an academic success without conceding anything to current academic fashion.","[Binmore, Ken] Univ Bristol, Dept Philosophy, Cotham House, Bristol BS6 6JL, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Binmore, K (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Dept Philosophy, Cotham House, Bristol BS6 6JL, Avon, England.",k.binmore@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

We investigate cross-sectional survey data collected over the period from 2002 to 2010. Our findings indicate that higher intentions for emigration are indeed linked to the typical individual and household conditions: the young, educated and low-family income respondents report the highest intentions to emigrate. In addition, the post-conflict environment characterised by economic and political instability, as well as by conflict and post-conflict related migration, increases these intentions further, both independently and in different combinations. Although determinants such as employment status, household income and perception of economic development are relevant, their effect is of second-order importance. This contradicts the conventional thinking that economic factors are the main driving forces of emigration intentions. We provide evidence that the conflict and post-conflict related migration experiences, and the political situation, may surpass individual and societal economic influences in importance.","[Efendic, Adnan] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Business & Econ, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo,"Efendic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sarajevo, Sch Business & Econ, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",adnan.efendic@efsa.unsa.ba,"Efendic, Adnan/AAE-4740-2019","Efendic, Adnan/0000-0003-0241-0938",Federal Office for Migration (FOM); Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC),Federal Office for Migration (FOM); Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC),The author acknowledges funding by the Federal Office for Migration (FOM) and Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) during the initial stages of this research.,,46,26,29,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,SEP,2016,28,3,,,,,335,352,,10.1080/14631377.2016.1166800,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DT2HI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000381301000004,0

We develop the theoretical derivation and illustrate it with a revealed preference case study of mode choice. Policy indicators such as time elasticity and value of time are discussed. The results are compared with a logit model and with an Integrated Choice and Latent Variable (ICLV) model. Results show that endogeneity is present in the case study and that the proposed variation of the MIS method is practical and able to account for it.

This problem has led to a methodological recommendation that emphasizes the accurate estimation of intermediate trade flows. This paper argues for a qualification of the consensus view: when simulating input-output (IO) tables, analysts need also to consider spillover effects driven by wage and consumption flows. In particular, for metropolitan economies, capturing wage and consumption flows is essential to obtain accurate Type II multipliers. This is demonstrated by constructing an interregional IO table that captures the interdependence between a city and its commuter belt, nested within the wider regional economy.","[Hermannsson, Kristinn] Univ Glasgow, Sch Educ, St Andrews Bldg,11 Eldon St, Glasgow G3 6NH, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Hermannsson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Sch Educ, St Andrews Bldg,11 Eldon St, Glasgow G3 6NH, Lanark, Scotland.",Kristinn.hermannsson@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Hermannsson, Kristinn/0000-0001-9957-3914",,,,,39,16,16,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

We show that these comparisons, as well as measures of horizontal equity and progressivity, can fail to capture an important aspect: that a substantial proportion of the poor are made poorer (or non-poor made poor) by the tax and transfer system. We illustrate with data from seventeen developing countries: in fifteen, the fiscal system is poverty-reducing and progressive, but in ten of these at least one-quarter of the poor pay more in taxes than they receive in transfers. We call this fiscal impoverishment, and axiomatically derive a measure of its extent. An analogous measure of fiscal gains of the poor is also derived, and we show that changes in the poverty gap can be decomposed into our axiomatic measures of fiscal impoverishment and gains.

Our motivations are twofold. First, although the literature largely assesses the decreasing pattern in the volatilities along the price curve in commodity markets, it has not extensively tested the presence of such a dynamic feature in electricity prices. Second, the analysis of a non-storable commodity enriches the literature on the behavior of commodity prices. Indeed, it has been sometimes asserted that the Samuelson effect results from the presence of inventories. We examine the four most important electricity futures markets worldwide for the period from 2008 to 2014: the German, Nordic, Australian, and US markets. We also use the American crude oil market as a benchmark for a storable commodity negotiated on a mature futures market. Our analysis has two steps: i) in addition to the traditional tests, we propose and test a new empirical implication of the Samuelson effect: price shocks should spread from the physical market to the paper market, and not the reverse; ii) based on the concept of indirect storability, we investigate the link between the Samuelson effect and the storability of the commodity. We find evidence of a Samuelson effect in all of the electricity markets and show that storage is not a necessary condition for such an effect to appear. These results should be taken into account for the understanding of the dynamic behavior of commodity prices, for the valuation of electricity assets, and for hedging operations.

We use a unique data set on loan officers and their loan portfolios from China's largest NGO microfinance institution to test whether officers' personal characteristics affect the size and quality of their loans. We study a period in which the institution shifted from reliance on government donations and subsidies to commercial sources of funding. Imposing more commercial incentives on loan officers could affect how they balance potentially competing objectives to serve the poor and pursue profitability. We find that loan officers who were formerly farmers or worked in local government were better able to maintain lending to poorer borrowers, without incurring substantially lower repayment rates on their loans. In short, it appears that the career backgrounds of loan officers did play a role in preventing mission drift. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The model is estimated using the Bayesian method for the Chinese economy over the period 1998-2013. The empirical results show that the central bank of China actually adopts a nonlinear Taylor rule and pursues an inflation target zone of [1%, 5%] rather than sticking to a rigid target. Further results from impulse responses and welfare comparisons suggest that economic stabilization is an important motive in the conduct of monetary policy in China and the adoption of a nonlinear rule seems to serve this goal better than the traditional linear rule.

Preferential policies refers to the autonomy and deregulation given to Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and Open Cities, allowing them to experiment with market policies and reforms, as the country moves from a state-controlled economy towards a market-oriented economy. While the effect of these policies on economic growth is extensively documented, their relationship with income inequality remains undetermined. Subgroup decompositions of income inequality, using the China Household Income Project's urban datasets of over 6000 households and 20,000 individuals from of up to 70 cities from 12 provinces, were used to identify income inequality gaps between cities with and without preferential policies. The results reveal that while income inequality increased in urban China from 1988 to 2007, the change was lower for cities awarded preferential policies across regions. Furthermore, the decompositions by region indicate that cities receiving preferential policy treatment had higher income growth but a lesser increase in income inequality than cities without preferential policies in each region. Finally, cities receiving preferential policies were able to increase the share of income of the poorest 40% of households while reducing the share of the richest 10%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies in psychology have found that involuntary autobiographical memories are common in everyday life. This paper builds on these two strands in the literature by expanding the discounted utility model to include the utility of involuntary memories of past consumption. Optimal control theory is used to develop a continuous-time optimal consumption model that takes into account the fact that consumption may generate involuntary memories that arrive at random times. The model is used in an in-depth analysis of optimal consumption with memories. It is shown that memories shift consumption to earlier times. This effect gets weaker as the time horizon gets longer, and it vanishes entirely when the time horizon is infinite.","[Miles, Stan; Smoczynski, Peter] Thompson Rivers Univ, Kamloops, BC V2C 5N3, Canada",,"Miles, S (通讯作者)，Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Econ, Kamloops, BC V2C 5N3, Canada.",stanmiles@tru.ca,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

The indeterminacy arises from an ambiguity in the SDF between the externality and individual consumption. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A drop in private sector confidence can drive the economy into a liquidity trap without any change in fundamentals. I show, in the context of a standard New Keynesian model, that it is possible to design Ricardian fiscal spending rules that insulate the economy from such expectations driven liquidity traps. In the case of price adjustment costs, desirable fiscal rules ensure that a drop in confidence does not lead to a decline in real marginal costs. In the case of nominal wage adjustment costs, desirable fiscal spending rules ensure that a drop in confidence does not lead to a decline in the ratio of the marginal rate of substitution between private consumption and hours worked relative to the real wage rate.

In these settings, the complementarities in preferences are small compared with the size of the market. We exploit this to design mechanisms satisfying constrained efficiency and asymptotic strategy-proofness. We introduce two mechanisms, one for cardinal and the other for ordinal preferences. When agents do not want bundles of size larger than k, these mechanisms over-allocate each good by at most k - 1 units, ex-post.

Our analysis focuses on a period characterized by large fluctuations in the Canadian dollar, providing an opportunity to quantify both intensive and extensive margin responses in retail industries to real exchange rate shocks and to examine how those responses differ across firms, locations, and sub-industries. Our results indicate that a real Canadian currency appreciation significantly reduces a retailer's sales, employment, and profits. The strength of this negative effect is decreasing in the distance of a retailer from the US-Canada border. We do not find evidence of a strong relationship between real exchange rate movements and the number of operating firms nor the probability of firm survival. These findings are consistent with the view that a real Canadian dollar appreciation increases cross-border shopping by Canadians, resulting in a negative demand shock for Canadian retailers, and the dominant response by firms to such a shock is through the intensive margin.","[Lapham, Beverly] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Baggs, Jen] Univ Victoria, Gustavson Sch Business, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; [Beaulieu, Eugene] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Fung, Loretta] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan",Queens University - Canada; University of Victoria; University of Calgary; National Tsing Hua University,"Baggs, J (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Gustavson Sch Business, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",jenbaggs@uvic.ca; beaulieu@ucalgary.ca; phfung@mx.nthu.edu.tw; laphamb@econ.queensu.ca,,,SSHRC Standard Research Grant program; Statistics Canada Post-Doctoral Program; National Tsing Hua University,SSHRC Standard Research Grant program(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Statistics Canada Post-Doctoral Program; National Tsing Hua University,"The contents of this paper have been subject to vetting and pass the Disclosure Rules & Regulations set forth by Statistics Canada.

As the deployment of wind-powered generation expands on electricity networks across Europe, the impacts of the NAO on the electricity system will be amplified. This study assesses the impact of the NAO, via wind-power generation, on the electricity market considering thermal generation costs, wholesale electricity prices and wind generation subsidies. A Monte Carlo approach is used to model NAO phases and generate hourly wind speed time-series data, electricity demand and fuel input data. A least-cost unit commitment and economic dispatch model is used to simulate an island electricity system, modelled on the all-island Irish electricity system. The impact of the NAO obviously depends on the level of wind capacity within an electricity system.

I argue that a taste for collective responsibility was adaptive in preindustrial societies that were exposed to high levels of agricultural risk, and that these attitudes continue to influence contemporary social norms and economic outcomes. The link between agricultural risk and collective responsibility is formalized in a model of optimal parental socialization effort. Empirically, I find a robust negative correlation between rainfall variation, a measure of exogenous agricultural risk, and a measure of individual responsibility. Using rainfall variation as an instrument, I find that individual responsibility has a large positive effect on economic development. The relationships between rainfall variation, individual responsibility and economic development are robust to the inclusion of variables related to climate and agricultural and institutional development.","[Davis, Lewis] Union Coll, Dept Econ, 807 Union St, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA",Union College,"Davis, L (通讯作者)，Union Coll, Dept Econ, 807 Union St, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA.",davisl@union.edu,,,Faculty Resource Network at NYU,Faculty Resource Network at NYU,"Department of Economics Union College 807 Union Street Schenectady NY 12308 davisl@union.edu 518-388-8395.

Using several unique measures of progressivity over the 1981-2005 period for a large panel of countries, we find that progressivity reduces inequality in observed income, but has a significantly smaller impact on actual inequality, approximated by consumption-based Ginis. An empirical comparative analysis shows that the differential effect on observed versus actual inequality is much larger in countries with weaker legal institutions. We also find that structural progressivity has a greater equalizing effect in environments that support pro-poor redistribution. Substantial differences in inequality response to changes in top versus bottom rates are also uncovered.","[Duncan, Denvil] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, SPEA 375F,1315 East 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47403 USA; [Peter, Klara Sabirianova] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Econ, 107 Gardner Hall,CB 3305, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Peter, Klara Sabirianova] CEPR, Bonn, Germany; [Peter, Klara Sabirianova] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Duncan, D (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, SPEA 375F,1315 East 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47403 USA.",duncande@indiana.edu; kpeter@unc.edu,,"Duncan, Denvil/0000-0001-7554-5548",,,,,54,22,26,3,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Differences between the genders in the relationship between beliefs and actions provides evidence that men experience a greater psychological cost as a result of social sanctions. Controlling for beliefs and gender differences in sensitivity to beliefs we find that males are, in many instances, more likely to offer bribes, while females are less likely to conform to a norm of bribe-giving.

Using MGARCH-DCC and Wavelet Coherence analyses, our findings reveal that correlations between commodity markets and the Dow Jones Islamic Market World Index are time-varying and highly volatile throughout the January 1999-April 2015 period. A substantial and persistent increase was observed in the return correlations between commodities and Islamic equity at the onset of the 2008 financial crisis. However, trends in the recent two years suggest that this association is heading towards its pre-crisis levels, offering again diversification benefits for Islamic equity holders. These benefits vary across different commodities in various time scales. Overall, gold, natural gas, soft commodities, grains and livestock are better portfolio diversifiers than oil and other metals. Relative to medium-to-long term investors, short-term investors (less than 32 days horizon) gained better diversification benefits in most commodities during bullish, bearish and market recovery periods. These findings have implications for investors who are heterogeneous in risk tolerance and time preference as Well as for policymakers who are concerned with market stability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We develop an integrated, multi-country model that accounts for the interactions between the labor market, fiscal, and market size effects of migration, as well as for trade relations between countries. The model is calibrated to match the economic and demographic characteristics of the 34 OECD countries and the rest of the world, as well as trade flows between them in the year 2010. We show that recent migration flows have been beneficial for 69% of the non-migrant OECD population, and for 83% of non-migrant citizens of the 22 richest OECD countries. Winners are mainly residing in traditional immigration countries; their gains are substantial and are essentially due to the entry of immigrants from non-OECD countries. Although labor market and fiscal effects are non-negligible in some countries, the greatest source of gain comes from the market size effect, i.e. the change in the variety of goods available to consumers.

This paper provides estimates of city-level industrial CO2 emissions and their growth rates for all 287 Chinese prefecture-level and above cities during the years 1998-2009. We decompose the CO2 emission changes into scale, composition and technique effects. The decomposition results show that these three effects differ significantly across the three tiers of cities in China. The scale effect contributes to rising CO2 emissions, while the technique effect leads to declining CO2 emissions in all cities. The composition effect leads to increasing CO2 emissions in the third-tier cities, while it reduces CO2 emissions in the first and second-tier cities, due to the relocation of energy-intensive industries from the latter to the former type of cities. Based on these decomposition results, we identify the separate channels through which the inflow of FDI and the environmental regulations affect city-level CO2 emissions. The decomposition framework in our paper can help policy makers and scholars to better understand Chinese cities' trade-offs between economic growth and environmental goals.","[Auffhammer, Maximilian] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA; [Auffhammer, Maximilian] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Sun, Weizeng] Jinan Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Weizeng] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jianfeng] Fudan Univ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Siqi] Tsinghua Univ, Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; Jinan University; Tsinghua University; Fudan University; Tsinghua University,"Zheng, SQ (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",zhengsiqi@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Wu, Jianfeng/AAJ-4130-2020","Wu, Jianfeng/0000-0003-4042-6105","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273154, 71322307, 71533004, 71573054]; National Social Science Foundation of China [13AZD082]; Tsinghua University's Research Center for Green Economy and Sustainable Development",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Tsinghua University's Research Center for Green Economy and Sustainable Development,"We deeply appreciate anonymous referees for their insightful comments.

The notion is that the effects of increases in uncertainty should not be symmetrical with the effects of decreases in uncertainty. Nonlinear estimation allows us to answer several interesting questions left unanswered by a linear model. For a number of important macroeconomic variables, we show that (i) a positive shock to uncertainty has a greater effect than a negative shock and (ii) the effect of the uncertainty shock is highly dependent on the state of the economy. Hence, the usual linear estimates for the consequences of uncertainty are underestimated in circumstances such as the recent financial crisis.","[Jones, Paul M.] Pepperdine Univ, Malibu, CA 90265 USA; [Enders, Walter] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",Pepperdine University; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Enders, W (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",wenders@culverhouse.ua.edu,,,,,,,24,25,27,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

According to this point of view, the authors rely on the geometrical model of the Mobius strip used in electromagnetism, which analyzes the movements of the electrons that produce energy. They use a similar model in a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) context to devise a new cost-benefit model in order to take into account three positive effects on the efficiency of a socially responsible company: 1) cooperation among stakeholders in the same sector; 2) cooperation among similar stakeholders in different sectors; and 3) the stakeholders' loyalty toward the company. By applying this model to a firm's decision problem the authors find that investing in CSR activities is always convenient, depending on the number of sectors, the stakeholders' sensitivity to these investments and the decay rate to alienation. Their work suggests a new method of analysis which should be developed not only at a theoretical level, but also at an empirical level.","[Solferino, Nazaria] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; [Solferino, Viviana] Univ Calabria, I-87030 Commenda Di Rende, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Calabria,"Solferino, N (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.",nazaria.solferino@uniroma2.it,"Solferino, Viviana/AAU-7510-2020",,,,,,27,0,0,0,14,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,JUN 20,2016,10,,,,,,,,201615,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2016-15,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DP7IX,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378673500001,0

While this may raise a number of concerns in terms of possible harm to consumers, this article only focuses on one question: whether national roaming, rather than making it more likely that consumers in partial not-spots may be able make and receive calls, may achieve the very opposite outcome. This is because, under national roaming, and depending on the level of the charge, operators may have the incentive to withdraw their network coverage and roam instead.

Each government has strong preferences over local spending and taxation but suffers only part of the costs of union-wide inflation and higher interest rates, creating a tendency towards excessive debt. Motivated by the evident failure of fiscal rules to restrain debt in the European context, this article analyzes an alternative fiscal regime in which the control of sovereign debt issuance is delegated to an independent authority, while public spending decisions remain decentralized. Using a symmetric perfect-foresight model, we compare the long-run policy biases affecting a typical country across different institutional arrangements. Establishing an independent fiscal authority tends to reduce debt via three distinct channels: first, the debt aversion induced by its mandate; second, its greater patience, compared to an elected institution; and third, the internalization of common pool problems, if the authority is established at the union-wide level. Furthermore, we show that fiscal delegation is more effective in restraining debt, and more informationally efficient, than the establishment of a federal government which would centralize fiscal decisions.","[Basso, Henrique S.; Costain, James] Banco Espana, Calle Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain",Banco de Espana,"Basso, HS (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Calle Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain.",henrique.basso@bde.es; james.costain@bde.es,,,,,,,55,3,3,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

Second, social institutions restrict performativity. Third, I emphasize the necessity that a theory to be self-fulfilling.

While changes in the rate of capital utilization ensure the short-run equilibrium, in the medium run the real exchange rate must adjust to stabilize the labor market and the external sector. Interestingly, these variables define a trilemma in which it is not possible for workers to have their desired wage share, for firms to have their desired profit share in output and for the economy to have a stable deficit in current account to GDP ratio at the same time. Structural change allows for a way out of the trilemma as it makes possible a higher wage share for a given profit share with external equilibrium. The corollary is that distribution and high employment cannot be sustained solely by conventional fiscal and monetary policies: they also require industrial and technological policies that redefine the structural parameters of the system, as a form of reconciling conflicting claims with external equilibrium.

Using data from the Programme for International Student Assessment for around 185000 students in 31 countries, different estimation models are compared. The results indicate that a highly differentiated system is best for performance when schools always consider prior performance when deciding on student acceptance. In systems with a few tracks, there is no such impact. Equality of opportunity is best provided for in a system with many tracks when schools always consider prior performance.","[Korthals, R.

In this environment, changes in investor sentiment or market expectations can give rise to credit bubbles, that is, expansions in credit that are backed not by expectations of future profits (i.e., fundamental collateral), but instead by expectations of future credit (i.e., bubbly collateral). Credit bubbles raise the availability of credit for entrepreneurs: this is the crowding-in effect. However, entrepreneurs must also use some of this credit to cancel past credit: this is the crowding-out effect. There is an optimal bubble size that trades off these two effects and maximizes long-run output and consumption. The equilibrium bubble size depends on investor sentiment, however, and it typically does not coincide with the optimal bubble size. This provides a new rationale for macroprudential policy. A credit management agency (CMA) can replicate the optimal bubble by taxing credit when the equilibrium bubble is too high and subsidizing credit when the equilibrium bubble is too low. This leaning-against-the-wind policy maximizes output and consumption. Moreover, the same conditions that make this policy desirable guarantee that a CMA has the resources to implement it.","[Martin, Alberto; Ventura, Jaume] Univ Pompeu Fabra, CREI, Barcelona, Spain; [Martin, Alberto; Ventura, Jaume] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain",Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI); Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics,"Martin, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, CREI, Barcelona, Spain.;Martin, A (通讯作者)，Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain.",amartin@crei.cat; jventura@crei.cat,"Ventura, Jaume/F-7874-2013; Martin, Alberto/F-8933-2016","Ventura, Jaume/0000-0001-5566-9615; Martin, Alberto/0000-0002-3149-8409","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2011-23197]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2009SGR1157, 2014SGR830 AGAUR]; Barcelona GSE Research Network; ERC [FP7-615651, FP7-249588-ABEP]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Barcelona GSE Research Network; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)),"A previous version of this paper was circulated under the title Bubbly Collateral and Economic Activity.

The results imply that choosing hawkish (dovish) regime is optimal if and only if the benefit-cost ratio of the dispute is sufficiently high (low). If hawkish tone is going to give a player upper hand in a dispute, then choosing a more aggressive tone does not increase his payoff. However, choosing a more dovish tone increases a player's payoff whenever dovish regime is optimal.","[Ozyurt, Selcuk] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, 1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ozyurt, Selcuk] Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey",Harvard University; Sabanci University,"Özyurt, S (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, 1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Özyurt, S (通讯作者)，Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey.",ozyurt@sabanciuniv.edu,"Ozyurt, Selcuk/AAF-8431-2020","Ozyurt, Selcuk/0000-0002-3326-5238",Marie Curie International Reintegration Grant within the European Community Framework Programme [256486],Marie Curie International Reintegration Grant within the European Community Framework Programme,This research was supported by the Marie Curie International Reintegration Grant (#256486) within the European Community Framework Programme.,,31,0,1,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

It aims to examine whether changes in municipal spending get affected by the electoral cycle. The analysis has proven that expenditures of municipalities of the Czech Republic are influenced by the political cycle. However, the political business cycle has at the level of municipalities (compared to the macroeconomic level) its peculiarities. These arise mainly from limited options of municipal politicians to use economic instruments to win electoral votes in elections. To receive electoral votes, municipal politicians use mainly public investments and projects that are at the level of municipalities so apparent that they may influence voters in their electoral decision-making. Prior to elections, expenditures on investments significantly increase for all municipal size groups. For municipal size groups of over 50,000 residents, however, they are (per capita) higher compared to smaller municipal size groups.This may be explained by the fact that these municipalities have higher disposable resources (higher per capita own budgetary revenues, higher potential to acquire resources to co-finance municipal projects and broader portfolio of debt financing). Expenditures on transfers do not significantly change prior to municipal elections. We interpret this finding in a way that politicians prefer such investment projects that are visible. Transfers are used to pay for certain current expenses for which municipalities may (in accordance with the established rules) apply through grants.","[Placek, Michal; Pucek, Milan; Ochrana, Frantisek] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Prague, Czech Republic; [Krapek, Milan] Private Coll Econ Studies, Znojmo, Czech Republic; [Matejova, Lenka] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Masaryk University Brno,"Placek, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Prague, Czech Republic.",michalplacek@seznam.cz; milan.pucek@seznam.cz; ochrana@fsv.cuni.cz; krapek@svse.cz; 175001@mail.muni.cz,"Ochrana, Frantisek/E-9765-2018; Křápek, Milan/AAF-2639-2020; Pucek, Milan Jan/F-3478-2012","Křápek, Milan/0000-0002-6049-8248;","Science of a Society, Politics and Media within Challenges of the Time by Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague [P-17]","Science of a Society, Politics and Media within Challenges of the Time by Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague","This article is a result of the Project P-17 Science of a Society, Politics and Media within Challenges of the Time by Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague.",,25,14,14,3,15,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Stylized facts about a growing US-EU productivity gap are confirmed for Germany, particularly showing no substantially economy-wide ICT effects for German sectors. Tracing the effect from ICT during 1991-2005, this study takes a different view by expanding the value-added concept to gross output including different types of intermediate inputs. The findings suggest that imported intermediate inputs played a more dominating role in Germany, particularly imported non-ICT and ICT materials. In the US, main drivers were domestically-produced non-ICT services and ICT materials, even though imported ICT materials were on the upraise post 1995. Moreover, German TFP growth experienced increasing returns to scale from domestically-produced ICT materials, while US TFP growth originated from imported ICT materials. It will be argued that these different productivity effects stem from different functions of ICT in the production process, which originated in the ICT-production sectors and were passed on to downstream sectors.

A consumer's valuation for product quality consists of an intrinsic valuation affected by a private state signal (type) and a gain-loss valuation that depends on deviations of purchased quality from a reference point. Following Koszegi and Rabin (2006), we consider lossaverse buyers who evaluate gains and losses in terms of changes in the consumption valuation, but in our model each buyer evaluates consumption outcomes relative to his own state-contingent reference quality level. We capture the process by which reference qualities are formed via a reference consumption plan, and use a generalization of the Mirrlees representation of the indirect utility to fully characterize optimal contracts for loss-averse consumers. We find that, depending on the reference plan, optimal price discrimination may exhibit (i) downward distortions beyond the standard downward distortions due to screening, (ii) efficiency gains relative to second-best contracts without loss aversion, and (iii) upward distortions above first-best quality levels without loss aversion. We consider ex ante and ex post consistent contracts in which quality offers by the firm coincide, in expectations or at every state realization, respectively, with the reference quality levels. We find the firm's unique preferred ex ante and ex post consistent contract menu and specify conditions under which, for the second case, it also constitutes the consumers' preferred menu.","[Carbajal, Juan Carlos] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Ely, Jeffrey C.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of New South Wales Sydney; Northwestern University,"Carbajal, JC (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.;Ely, JC (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",jc.carbajal@unsw.edu.au; jeffely@northwestern.edu,,,Australian Research Council; National Science Foundation,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This paper was previously circulated as Optimal Contracts for Loss-Averse Consumers.

Ex ante contracts in these auctions often fail to specify all of the potential construction contingencies, and consequently, changes in scope are necessary after construction begins. Using Vermont road construction contract data, this study finds evidence that there is a statistically significant difference in costs of firms between auctions with and without extra work adjustments. Substantial adaptation costs are responsible for the higher procurement outlays in incomplete contract. I also find that bidders inflate their bids to incorporate risk premiums in incomplete contracts; however, my estimates suggest that this bidding behaviour does not affect their profit margins.","[Jung, Hojin] Univ Minnesota, Econ & Management, Morris, MN 56267 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Morris,"Jung, HJ (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Econ & Management, Morris, MN 56267 USA.",hjjung@morris.umn.edu,,,Vermont Agency of Transportation [SPR722],Vermont Agency of Transportation,"I am indebted to staff at the Vermont Agency of Transportation for providing useful information.

We employ a generalized gravity model that controls for an extended set of trade theory and policy variables. The gravity model is estimated using the robust panel data techniques that includes times effects, besides country-specific effects. The various econometric specifications of the gravity equation, on the whole dataset of 29 economies, yield positive and significant impact (to be around 14 %) of the euro currency adoption on bilateral trade flows. Next, euro effect on bilateral trade and exports on a smaller dataset is estimated. The estimated results suggest that bilateral trade and exports increase by 20.81 and 18.57 %, respectively, when both the countries belong to the Eurozone. This effect is larger than the one obtained when only one of the two trading partners uses the euro as its currency. In addition, the validity of the assumptions of Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) theory are checked for the countries under study. The estimated results reject the H-O theory in favor of Modern Trade theories. However, the low value of the coefficient on respective variable suggests that, over the period, the type of trade among these countries has transited from inter-industry trade to horizontal intra-industry trade. This suggests that these developed European economies are on the path of economic convergence via intra-industry trade.","[Kunroo, Mohd Hussain] Northcap Univ, Sch Management, Gurgaon 122017, India; [Sofi, Irfan Ahmad] Indian Inst Technol, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Indore 453331, Madhya Pradesh, India; [Kunroo, Mohd Hussain; Azad, Naushad Ali] Jamia Millia Islamia, Dept Econ, New Delhi 110025, India",The Northcap University; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Indore; Jamia Millia Islamia,"Kunroo, MH (通讯作者)，Northcap Univ, Sch Management, Gurgaon 122017, India.;Kunroo, MH (通讯作者)，Jamia Millia Islamia, Dept Econ, New Delhi 110025, India.",mhkunroo@gmail.com,,,"Ministry of Minority Affairs, Government of India","Ministry of Minority Affairs, Government of India","The authors are very grateful to Ministry of Minority Affairs, Government of India, for funding this research work.

Results show an increase over time in emissions in the baseline scenarios due, largely, to higher penetration of natural gas and coal. Climate policy scenarios, however, indicate that such a pathway can be avoided. While taxes up to 32 US$/tCO(2)e do not significantly reduce emissions, higher taxes (from 50 LIES/tCO(2)e in 2020 to 1621.13$/tCO(2)e in 2050) induce average emission reductions around 60% when compared to the baseline. Emission constraint scenarios yield even lower reductions in most models. Emission reductions are mostly due to lower energy consumption, increased penetration of renewable energy (especially biomass and wind) and of carbon capture and storage technologies for fossil and/or biomass fuels. This paper also provides a discussion of specific issues related to mitigation alternatives in Brazil. The range of mitigation options resulting from the model runs generally falls within the limits found for specific energy sources in the country, although infrastructure investments and technology improvements are needed for the projected mitigation scenarios to achieve actual feasibility.

Our ADECO reveals the in-sample significant asymmetric effect in oil stock correlations. To evaluate out-of-sample performance, we consider a portfolio with petroleum futures and stocks in which the weights are determined by forecasts of covariance matrix. We find that ADECO provides portfolios with better performances than existing popular DECO, DCC and ADCC models in the minimum-variance framework. Moreover, energy price risk can be better hedged by stocks in oil-exporting countries than stocks in oil-importing countries. Our findings are further demonstrated to be robust to the change of futures maturity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

One of the areas in which the national accounts-household surveys debate is key is the measurement of developing world poverty. We propose a data-driven method to assess the relative quality of GDP per capita and survey means by comparing them to the evolution of satellite-recorded nighttime lights. Our main assumption, which is robust to a variety of specification checks, is that the measurement error in nighttime lights is unrelated to the measurement errors in either national accounts or survey means. We obtain estimates of weights on national accounts and survey means in an optimal proxy for true income; these weights are very large for national accounts and very modest for survey means. We conclusively reject the null hypothesis that the optimal weight on surveys is greater than the optimal weight on national accounts, and we generally fail to reject the null hypothesis that the optimal weight on surveys is zero. Additionally, we provide evidence that national accounts are good indicators of desirable outcomes for the poor (such as longer life expectancy, better education and access to safe water), and we show that surveys appear to perform worse in developing countries that are richer and that are growing faster. Therefore, we interpret our results as providing support for estimates of world poverty that are based on national accounts.","[Pinkovskiy, Maxim] Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA; Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York; Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Pinkovskiy, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, New York, NY 10045 USA.",,,,,,,,53,108,120,4,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

We obtain that the competition can take different forms depending on the number of traders, trading rounds and the noise in the information. When the number of traders is small and the number of trading rounds is large, traders may trade very aggressively at the opening and at the end of the trading day with lower trading intensity in between. Hence, we can explain volume patterns by the nature of the competition between traders rather than by pattern in the level of liquidity. We find that the noise in the signal may be beneficial for traders when the competition is strong as it gives them a monopolistic position on their private information. The amount of noise maximizing the trader's expected profit increases with the number of trading rounds as well as the number of traders. This implies that the value of information is closely related to the market where that information is subsequently being used. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Putnam argues that associations instill in their members habits of cooperation, solidarity and public spiritedness. Olson emphasizes the tendency of groups to pursue private interests and lobby for preferential policies. We carry out the first field experiment involving a sample of members of different association types from different age groups and education levels, as well as a demographically comparable sample of non-members. This enables us to examine the differential patterns of behavior followed by members of Putnam-type and Olson-type associations. Coherently with both the Putnam's and Olson's view, we find that members of Putnam-type (Olson-type) associations display more (no more) generalized trust than non-members. However, when we examine trustworthy behavior we find the opposite pattern, with members of Olson-type (Putnam-type) associations more (no more) trustworthy than non-members. No systematic effect for the intensity of participation in associations emerges. We analyze the issue of self-selection through a structural equation model. This supports the view that membership has a significant effect on prosociality. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Using comprehensive matched employer-employee data covering the entire workforce in one large metropolitan labour market combined with unique survey data linked to administrative records, we provide evidence that workers earn higher wages and are less inclined to leave their firms if they have obtained their job through a referral. These effects are particularly strong at the beginning of the employment relationship and decline with tenure in the firm, suggesting that firms and workers learn about workers' productivity over time.

This paper investigates how African countries and other LMICs deal with this complex and changing aid landscape and explores how government fiscal behaviors and private agent anticipations regarding aid flows are affected. We used several measures of fiscal behaviors and we were not able to confirm empirically the fear of traditional donors about a macroeconomic disaster that would follow emerging donors aid allocation. Moreover, the results indicate that economies receiving additional aid flows from China enhance their fiscal response to aid through an increased domestic economy aid absorption rate.

Our research shows that despite the financial turmoil, CEE countries demonstrate the existence of a long-term relationship between revenues and expenditures and they have statistically relevant parameters of the fiscal reaction function. This indicates that the public finances in CEE countries are sustainable despite the crisis.

We consider the effects of a land reform on demographic growth by a family-optimization model where relative per capita wealth generates social status and welfare. We show that tenant farming is the major obstacle to escaping the Malthusian trap with high fertility and low productivity. A land reform provides peasants with higher returns for their investments, inducing them to increase their productivity and status rather than their family size. Consequently, the population growth rate slows down, but the productivity of land increases.","[Lehmijoki, Ulla; Palokangas, Tapio] Univ Helsinki, HECER, POB 17,Arkadiankatu 7, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Lehmijoki, Ulla; Palokangas, Tapio] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Palokangas, Tapio] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria",University of Helsinki; IZA Institute Labor Economics; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Palokangas, T (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, HECER, POB 17,Arkadiankatu 7, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.;Palokangas, T (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Palokangas, T (通讯作者)，Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Schlosspl 1, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",ulla.lehmijoki@helsinki.fi; tapio.palokangas@helsinki.fi,,"Palokangas, Tapio/0000-0002-5367-8849",International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Open access funding provided by International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA).

We use a three-period overlapping-generations (OLG) model to show that the human capital transfer plays a remarkable role in determining the parent-to-offspring investment in human capital and the intergenerational elasticity of income. We then estimate a simultaneous equations model (SEM) using the 1989-2009 China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data to verify our theoretical predictions. The results show that (i) human capital, measured by health and education, is directly transmitted from one generation to the next, reflecting the parent-induced inequality of development opportunities among offspring in China; (ii) the estimated intergenerational income elasticity increases from 0.429 to 0.481 when the direct transfer of human capital is accounted for, suggesting that omitting this mechanism would overestimate China's income mobility. Our findings provide policy implications on strengthening human capital investments among the disadvantaged groups, reinforcing reforms that promote equality of opportunity, and improving the efficiency of labor markets in China.

Our model assesses both the impacts on total incomes (and its distribution) and expenditures caused by price increases in response to higher labour costs. For all ethnic groups, results show that minimum wages lead to a reduction in poverty. Poverty reduction is mainly explained by an increase in total income rather than a shift in income distribution. Among the ethnic groups, poverty for ethnic Indians is reduced the most by increases in minimum wages compared to that of the Malays and Chinese. The differences in poverty reduction can be explained by the limitation of minimum wages to promote wages of informal workers among the Malays and Chinese. Therefore, minimum wages could be more effective as a poverty reduction tool if informal workers are covered in the scope. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Saari, M.

Inefficiency in both investment and default is caused due to time inconsistency, if we view the time-consistent benchmark as efficient. Compared to the standard trade-off theory in corporate finance, we clarify that debt financing under time-inconsistent preferences brings a new trade-off between the alleviation effect on investment inefficiency and the aggravation effect on default inefficiency. The impact of time-inconsistent preferences depends on the entrepreneurs' belief regarding their future time-inconsistent behavior (i.e., sophisticated or naive). Concretely, we find that naive entrepreneurs always choose higher leverages, while sophisticated ones are more likely to choose lower leverages, compared to the time-consistent benchmark. Therefore, time inconsistency can explain the observed leverage puzzle (i.e., why firms choose different leverages even with similar fundamentals). Moreover, we demonstrate that time-inconsistent preferences delay investment and hasten default, due to the interaction among the three effects: option value effect, payoff value effect, and leverage effect. In particular, naive entrepreneurs invest later and default earlier than sophisticated ones, leading to a shorter operating period. These results support the empirical findings in entrepreneurial finance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We point to a long list of institutional and economic changes, at national and international levels, as the potential factors that might have led to this new pattern. In addition to confirming the remarkable persistence shown by the Spanish inflation, the PANIC (panel analysis of non-stationarity in idiosyncratic and common components) analysis we undertake identifies a higher importance of the common component of the series in the second period studied. Besides inflation, we draw attention to a battery of economic and labor variables, mostly through regional data, and we conclude that they tend to converge as well, particularly in the case of our second period of analysis. There are several theoretical avenues whereby the geographic convergence of these variables and the observed inflation convergence could be related. We also relate the common factor in inflation obtained to some potential explanatory variables. Moreover, a relevant additional analysis, which is only feasible for the second period, is implemented by focusing on the weightings attributed to the different groups of goods and services that make up the Consumer Price Index. The outcome we obtain is straightforward: the shopping basket across Spanish provinces has tended to become more homogeneous. In summary, a variety of changes, which we regard as having increased essentially since the late 70s, with the intensification of the Spanish integration in the core of European Union, among other factors, have brought about a regime shift in inflation behavior. The Spanish experience may offer lessons for other economies that follow similar paths, for instance Latin American countries.","[Garcia-Cintado, Alejandro C.; Romero-Avila, Diego; Usabiaga, Carlos] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Carretera Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Usabiaga, C (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo de Olavide, Carretera Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",cusaiba@upo.es,"Garcia-Cintado, Alejandro Cayetano/ABT-6325-2022; Romero-Ávila, Diego/K-4359-2017; Usabiaga, Carlos/AAI-8911-2020","Garcia-Cintado, Alejandro Cayetano/0000-0003-1060-0256; Usabiaga, Carlos/0000-0002-1519-9070","Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology [ECO2009-13357]; Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2012-35430]; Andalusian Council of Innovation and Science under Excellence Project [SEJ-4546, PAI SEJ-513]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Andalusian Council of Innovation and Science under Excellence Project,"The authors are particularly indebted to the Editors and the anonymous referees of this Journal for valuable comments and suggestions that led to a substantial improvement of the original manuscript.

Some parameters of the model are estimated and others are calibrated to match life cycle employment and asset profiles, and Social Security claiming decisions. Simulation results indicate that defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution (DC) pensions on average crowd out household wealth by $0.09 and $0.37 per dollar of pension wealth, respectively, while crowd out by Social Security is $0.56. The magnitude of crowd out is sensitive to model specification, with more restrictive versions of the model (e.g., no employment decision, no bequest motive, no uncertainty) generally resulting in larger simulated crowd out. A welfare analysis implies that DB pensions and Social Security are not valued by households. The longevity insurance provided by such plans is offset by a high degree of impatience and, for Social Security, low benefits relative to taxes paid. A typical DC pension is valued at about one quarter of its expected present discounted value.","[Blau, David M.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Blau, David M.] IZA, Chino, CA 91710 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Blau, DM (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;Blau, DM (通讯作者)，IZA, Chino, CA 91710 USA.",blau.12@osu.edu,,,"National Institute on Aging [R01-AG02199, NIA U01AG009740]",National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"Financial support from Grant R01-AG02199 from the National Institute on Aging is gratefully acknowledged.

We begin by unveiling a new empirical regularity: using a unique dataset that allows us to study the dynamics of firms' exports and foreign direct investments (FDI) in individual destinations, we show that most firms serve a market via exports before investing there. To rationalize this pattern, we describe a model in which firms are uncertain about their profitability in a foreign market and may experiment via exports before engaging in FDI. In line with this idea, we show that the probability that a firm starts investing in a foreign country increases with its export experience in that country. In more uncertain destinations, firms delay FDI entry, experimenting longer with exports before establishing foreign affiliates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This survey uses recent advances in organizational economics to illuminate organizational failures along these two dimensions. We combine reviews of the literature with simple models and case discussions. Specifically, we consider failures related to short-termism and the allocation of authority, both of which are instances of multitasking problems; communication failures in the presence of both soft and hard information due to incentive misalignments; resistance to change due to vested interests and rigid cultures; and failures related to the allocation of talent and miscommunication due to bounded rationality. We find that the organizational economics literature provides parsimonious explanations for a large range of economically significant failures.","[Garicano, Luis] LSE, London, England; [Garicano, Luis; Rayo, Luis] CEPR, London, England; [Rayo, Luis] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Garicano, L (通讯作者)，LSE, London, England.;Garicano, L (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",,"Rayo, Luis/KCZ-3509-2024","Rayo, Luis/0000-0003-4429-7398",,,,,234,32,41,3,68,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

For this purpose, we view individuals jointly engaging in productive processes a team as endowed with individual and privately held information on the joint production process. Once each team member decides on whether or not to share his private information truthfully, he chooses which effort to exert in the joint production process. This effort, however, is not contractible: only the realized output (or profit) of the team can be observed. Our central question is whether or not incentives can be provided to a team in this environment such that team members communicate their private information and exert efficient productive efforts on the basis of this communication.

The pricing of weather derivatives is challenging since the underlying is not tradable and thus classical arbitrage approaches have to be used with caution. In typical pricing approaches all information available to the market is assumed to be incorporated in the underlying and thus forward-looking information about non-tradable assets such as meteorological forecasts is often ignored. In this article, we analyze a new pricing methodology for temperature derivatives that accounts for forward-looking information. More precisely, we provide an empirical back-up for the theoretical framework of so-called consistent factor models for temperature forecast curves introduced previously in the literature and put this pricing approach into practice. First, we perform a thorough statistical analysis of meteorological forecast curve data. Second, based on this analysis we propose a specific consistent two-factor model, derive explicit temperature derivative prices, and calibrate the market price of risk (MPR). The power of the model is demonstrated against alternative pricing models. This confirms that at least parts of the irregularity of the MPR observed in earlier studies are not due to irregular risk perception but rather due to information misspecification.

J,"Heilmann, K",,,,"Heilmann, Kilian",,,Does political conflict hurt trade? Evidence from consumer boycotts,JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Consumer boycotts; International trade; International political economy; Economic diplomacy,,"I estimate the impact of international conflict on bilateral trade relations using several incidents of politically motivated boycotts: The boycott of Danish goods by Muslim countries following the Muhammad Comic Crisis in 2005/2006, the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods in response to the Senkaku/Diaoyu Island conflict in 2012, the boycott of French products in the US over the Iraq War in 2003, and Turkey's boycott of Israel over the Gaza conflict in 2014. The results from difference-in-differences regressions and the synthetic control group method show that boycotts can have strong negative effects on bilateral trade in both goods and services. I estimate an average one-year trade disruption of 18.8% in the case of Denmark, 2.7% for Japan, and 1.7% for French imports, where in the latter two cases this effect is only short term. For all boycott instances, this is only a minor share of overall exports of the boycotted country over the same period. For the Iraq and Gaza conflicts, there is a reciprocal negative effect on the boycotted countries' imports from the boycotter. Product-level results are in line with intuition: Boycotts are most effective for consumer goods, especially highly-branded signature export goods such as Japanese cars, while having at most a temporary effect on intermediates and capital goods. An event study on Japanese stock market returns suggests that the Chinese boycott depressed stock values of explicitly boycotted Japanese firms only temporarily. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Two distinct factors complicate productivity measurement. (1) When production increases, factor inputs typically increase as well. Productivity growth is therefore typically less variable than output growth, meaning that measurement errors will tend to be relatively more important. (2) Revisions to published estimates of production and factor inputs tend to be less highly correlated than the published estimates themselves. This further increases the impact of data revisions on published productivity estimates. To assess the extent of these problems in practice, we detail the importance of historical revisions to the most commonly-used measures of US aggregate productivity growth, expanding on previous empirical work by Aruoba (2008) and Anderson and Kliesen (2006). We find that such revisions have contributed substantially to policymakers' forecast errors for US productivity growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Jacobs, Jan P. A.

Using the Granger causality, impulse response function and variance decomposition, the short run dynamics are examined. The outcome of the Granger causality test indicates that there is unilateral causality, which runs from domestic bank assets to FBP at the 10% level. Moreover, I also find feedback causality between FBP and CREDIT at the 5% level. By employing impulse response functions, my findings reveal that rising foreign bank assets in Turkey tend to increase domestic bank assets and credit availability in short run, and vice versa.

Predictive analysis shows that the model can only slightly better explain the large deviation from trend during the crisis relative to a model without financial frictions. Specifically, the risk premium shock, which is a shock to the external finance premium of the entrepreneurs' leverage, explains the largest part of the investment downfall during the crisis. However, the 'balance sheet' channel of financial frictions in the model, which structurally links balance sheet conditions of financial intermediaries and nonfinancial borrowers to their borrowing rates, is estimated to be weak. We examine alternative prior specifications for how the financial frictions enter the model and continue to find a limited role for these frictions. Rolling-window estimation provides evidence for substantial time variation in parameters governing financial frictions. We conclude that the well-known financial frictions studied in this paper are not able to explain the financial crisis in a linearized and estimated model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

International experience suggests that, without structural and quantitative reforms, simply freeing interest rates can result in major financial stress. Before China's central bank can completely relinquish implicit or explicit guidance for commercial banks' interest rate determination, it needs to accomplish two tasks: improvement of commercial banks' pricing capability as well as the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Both tasks require significant reform measures to be initiated, such as enforcing market discipline, forming a new monetary policy framework, developing money and capital markets, abandoning quantitative restrictions on credit and reforming the financial regulatory system.","[Tan, Yuyan; Ji, Yang; Huang, Yiping] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Tan, YY (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",yuyan.tan11@gmail.com; jiyangpku@163.com; yhuang@nsd.pku.edu.cn,"Huang, Yi-Ping/GQZ-6811-2022",,,,,,41,17,18,4,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2016,24,2,,,,,1,22,,10.1111/cwe.12148,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DH7VH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373001400001,0

To address the puzzle, I construct a two-sided market model and show that card demand externalities between large-ticket and small-ticket transactions rationalize card networks' pricing response.

Conventional wisdom suggests that fluctuations in household wealth have driven major swings in economic activity both in the United States and abroad. This paper considers the so-called consumption wealth effects. There is an extensive existing literature on wealth effects that has yielded some insights. For example, research has documented the relationship between aggregate household wealth and aggregate consumption over time, and a large number of household-level studies suggest that wealth effects are larger for households facing credit constraints. However, there are also many unresolved issues regarding the influence of household wealth on consumption. We review the most important of these issues and argue that there is a need for much more research in these areas as well as better data sources for conducting such analysis.","[Cooper, Daniel] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA 02210 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston,"Cooper, D (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Boston, MA 02210 USA.",daniel.cooper@bos.frb.org,,"Dynan, Karen/0000-0001-5504-4025",,,,,67,40,43,3,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Based on the money in the utility function approach, a vector error correction model is specified to investigate the relationship between money and inflation in times of policy shifts. A well defined equation for money demand is obtained. The results indicate that the evolution of M3 is still in line with money demand. In the long run, inflation is affected by asset prices and detrended output. Our results show that the Lucas critique can be refuted in case of euro area money demand for the period of quantitative easing.

It also makes empirically successful signature predictions regarding the link between exchange rates and telltale signs of disaster risk in currency options.","[Farhi, Emmanuel] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",Harvard University; New York University,"Farhi, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017; Gabaix, Xavier/B-8227-2008",,NSF [SES-0820517],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),We thank the NSF (SES-0820517) for support.,,55,168,191,2,63,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Our results highlight two countervailing market distortions. First, emissions regulation exacerbates distortions associated with the exercise of market power in the domestic cement market. Second, emissions leakage in trade-exposed markets offsets domestic emissions reductions. Taken together, these forces can result in social welfare losses under policy regimes that fully internalize the emissions externality. Market-based policies that incorporate design features to mitigate the exercise of market power and emissions leakage deliver welfare gains when damages from carbon emissions are high.","[Fowlie, Meredith] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Fowlie, Meredith; Reguant, Mar; Ryan, Stephen P.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Reguant, Mar] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Ryan, Stephen P.] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; Northwestern University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Fowlie, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Fowlie, M (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Reguant, Mar/0000-0001-8877-5780",,,,,46,113,155,9,120,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

This industry is heavily infrastructure based and is therefore saddled with fixed assets-in-place or illiquid assets. This exposes the industry to what is termed as illiquidity risk', and hence, investors in this industry should be compensated for bearing this risk with an appropriate return premium (i.e. extra return). In this study, we provide evidence as to whether illiquidity risk indeed significantly affects returns in this industry. We examine the case of all 76 firms that compose the five major global water indices. After controlling for other factors that impact on returns, our results suggest that asset illiquidity is positively associated with stock returns. Specifically, water firms with a larger proportion of illiquid assets-in-place are observed to have greater stock returns than those with a smaller proportion of illiquid assets. Our results have important implications for the financing of water-related projects particularly those which involve the participation of investors from the private sector.","[Jin, Yizheng; Li, Bin; Roca, Eduardo; Wong, Victor] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Roca, E (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",E.Roca@griffith.edu.au,"Roca, Eduardo/JEO-3020-2023",,,,,,41,8,9,2,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Entrants learn from incumbent firms, and the diffusion technology is such that learning depends not on the frontier technology, but on the entire distribution of productivity. By shifting the productivity distribution upward, selection causes technology diffusion, and in equilibrium this dynamic selection process leads to endogenous growth without scale effects. On the balanced growth path, the productivity distribution is a traveling wave with a lower bound that increases over time. The free entry condition implies trade liberalization must increase the dynamic selection rate to offset the profits from new export opportunities. Consequently, trade integration raises long-run growth. Dynamic selection is a new source of gains from trade not found when firms are homogeneous. Calibrating the model implies dynamic selection approximately triples the gains from trade compared to heterogeneous firm economies with static steady states.","[Sampson, Thomas] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Sampson, T (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,,"European Union [613504]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1, ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI",European Union(European Union (EU)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This project has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development, and demonstration under grant agreement number 613504.",,65,67,84,5,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Over the past year, the Chinese government has announced new policy directives to deepen economic reform, to protect the environment, and to limit fossil energy use in China. To evaluate how new policy directives could affect energy and climate change outcomes, we simulate two levels of policy effort-a continued effort scenario that extends current policies beyond 2020 and an accelerated effort scenario that reflects newly announced policies-on the evolution of China's energy and economic system over the next several decades. We perform simulations using the China in-Global Energy Model, C-GEM, a bespoke recursive-dynamic computable general equilibrium model with global coverage and detailed calibration of China's economy and future trends. Importantly, we find that both levels of policy effort would bend down the CO2 emissions trajectory before 2050 without undermining economic development. Specifically, in the accelerated effort scenario, we find that coal use peaks around 2020, and CO2 emissions level off around 2030 at 10 bmt, without undermining continued economic growth consistent with China reaching the status of a well-off society by 2050.

It examines differential revenue capacity and the extent to which national transfer programmes mitigate fiscal disparity.","[Ermasova, Natalia] Governors State Univ, University Pk, IL USA; [Mikesell, John] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN USA",Governors State University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Ermasova, N (通讯作者)，Governors State Univ, University Pk, IL USA.",nermasova@govst.edu,,"Ermasova, Natalia/0000-0001-9813-483X",,,,,32,11,11,2,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JAN 2,2016,28,1,,,,,1,15,,10.1080/14631377.2015.1084726,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DF4SC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371339600001,0

As cause-related marketing (CRM) becomes more prevalent, companies will need to be more effective and efficient in launching cause-related marketing campaigns. Simply having a cause-related marketing campaign was once sufficient to distinguish a company; increasing competitiveness in this arena means that campaigns have to be more distinctive and pertinent to successfully gain a position against competitors. While numerous studies have identified factors that influence consumer intention to purchase cause-related products, just a few of them have examined moderating influences. Therefore, this study sought to identify factors that moderated the influence of personal characteristics on the intention to purchase cause-related products. Data were obtained via online surveys from 393 English speaking Lithuanian students. Linear regression and moderating impact analysis were used in order to test seven hypotheses. Results confirmed that altruism, materialism and individualism have positive direct relationships with the intention to purchase cause-related products; product type and guilt did not have a moderating effect on those relationships, but cause involvement is an important moderator. These findings contribute to the theory of cause-related marketing by identifying moderators as being a specific type of personal characteristic (e.g., cause-involvement) and ruling out others (e.g., guilt), or product type. Furthermore, these findings provide insights to marketing managers for planning and positioning cause-related marketing campaigns by showing what factors amplify the effects of altruism, materialism and individualism in this context.","[Adomaviciute, Karina] Vilnius Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Mkt, Sauletekio Al 9, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Bzikadze, Goga] Vilnius Univ, Sauletekio Al 9, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Urbonavicius, Sigitas] Vilnius Univ, Fac Econ, Social Sci Management, Sauletekio Al 9, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Urbonavicius, Sigitas] Vilnius Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Sauletekio Al 9, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Cherian, Joseph] St Xavier Univ, Graham Sch Management, Mkt, 3700 W 103rd St, Chicago, IL 60655 USA",Vilnius University; Vilnius University; Vilnius University; Vilnius University,"Adomaviciute, K (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Mkt, Sauletekio Al 9, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania.",karina.adomaviciute@gmail.com; goga.bzikadze@yahoo.com; cherian@sxu.edu; sigitas.urbonavicius@ef.vu.lt,"Adomaviciūtė, Karina/AGW-8754-2022; Urbonavicius, Sigitas/AAJ-5474-2020; Adomaviciute, Karina/AAF-6173-2019","Urbonavicius, Sigitas/0000-0003-4176-2573; Adomaviciute, Karina/0000-0002-5963-1355",,,,,43,11,11,3,45,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Empirical applications of the developed EDM are performed for evaluating the influences of Korea-Chile FTA on the grape industry in Korea. Design/methodology/approach - Supply and demand equations together with profit function of individual farmers are converted into log-differential forms that compose the EDM. The cost function of grape producers is estimated for deriving the parameters that are required in applying the developed EDM. Findings - The share of profit within revenue and the elasticity of cost with respect to quantity in the cost function play key roles in assessing the change in farmers' profit. The empirical assessment of the effects of Korea-Chile FTA indicates that this FTA has little impact on the Korean grape market and grape producers in Korea. Originality/value - Usefulness of the existing EDM has been limited in evaluating the impacts of exogenous shocks on the individual farmer level. This paper fills this gap by developing an EDM that assesses the impacts of tariff reduction on farm-level profit.,"[Ahn, Byeong-Il] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Im, Jeong-Bin] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Im, JB (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Seoul, South Korea.",jeongbin@snu.ac.kr,,"Ahn, Byeong-il/0000-0002-3504-2898",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [2014S1A3A2044459],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),This work was partially supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (2014S1A3A2044459).,,19,1,2,1,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

It was assumed that HRM is subjected to increased accommodation processes during economic turbulence. Interpretive schemas regarding HRM of three selected manufacturers in the automotive industry and of three financial institutions from Slovenia were studied. Over a three-year period, 31 interviews with their management, HRM, and union representatives were conducted. In addition, content analysis of annual reports was made. The results have shown that the current crisis has not yet been a factor of diminished roles and meaning of HRM. While the manufacturing companies are considerably homogeneous in their scope of adjustments to the crisis, the financial companies considerably differ from each other regarding their scope of activities and are going through schema change. Factors, discovered in this study, add to the knowledge framework of successful HRM change and explain levels of social responsibility towards employees working in the companies.","[Arzensek, Ana] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper, Slovenia; [Lesnik, Kristijan Musek] Univ Primorska, Fac Math Nat Sci & Informat Technol, Koper, Slovenia",University of Primorska; University of Primorska,"Arzensek, A (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper, Slovenia.",ana.arzensek@fm-kp.si,"Arzenšek, Ana/HSH-3979-2023; Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022","Arzenšek, Ana/0000-0002-2487-3135;",,,,,46,6,6,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

A worker's probability of future employment depends on whether she has been deviant as well as on the availability of jobs. Using a two period model we show that the net impact on deviant behavior to changes in unemployment can go either way depending upon the nature of the equilibrium. Two kinds of equilibria are possible. In one, a non-deviant's probability of being employed increases as expected market conditions improve which lowers the incentive to be a deviant. In contrast, in the other kind of equilibrium, the deviant's probability of being employed increases when market conditions improve which increases the incentive to be a deviant. In either case, there is a setup cost to deviant behavior and the attractiveness of incurring that increases with an increase in expected probability of future employment which unambiguously increases the incentive to be deviant. In the first kind of equilibrium, the two effects counteract each other, while in the second they reinforce each other. Finally, we characterize conditions under which an increase in optimism, i.e. a reduction in the probability of facing a recession unambiguously increases deviant behavior.","[Bandyopadhyay, Siddhartha] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Bagchi, Aniruddha] Kennesaw State Univ, Coles Coll Business, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA",University of Birmingham; University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University,"Bandyopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",abagchi@kennesaw.edu; s.bandyopadhyay@bham.ac.uk,"Bagchi, Aniruddha/A-8641-2009","Bagchi, Aniruddha/0000-0002-7553-4053",,,,,36,2,3,3,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

One answer may lie in the large empirical literature indicating that negative messages are more effective than positive messages in getting individuals to do many things, including voting and purchasing goods. Few contributions to this literature, however, gather data from a field environment with messages whose tone has been validated. We conduct field experiments in two elections for local office which test the effect of confirmed negative and positive letters sent to candidates' partisans on two measurable activities: donating to the candidate and turning out to vote. We find that message tone increases partisan support in ways that may help explain the persistence of negative campaigning. Negative messages are no better than positive messages at earning the candidates donations, but negative messages yield significantly higher rates of voter turnout among the candidates' partisans relative to positive messages. Positive messages, however, are not neutral relative to no message. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

They also feel more positive than negative emotions. Thriving people activate their personal resources such as curiosity, openness and positive attitudes all of which increase their vitality. Although more effort is needed to deal with cultural diversity in the globalized workplace, those individuals are motivated for long learning, which facilitates their occupational and personal development.

We show that businesses contribute on average more than 50% of national saving around the world. Using this unique dataset, we find evidence of partial piercing of the corporate veil: a $ 1 increase in business saving gives rise to a decrease of approximately $ 0.40 in household saving-thereby raising private saving by as much as $ 0.60. We also find that a $ 1 increase in business saving increases private investment by as much as $ 0.20 in countries where limited financing is a binding constraint on firms' investment.

Instead, the extent to which technology adoption in developing countries favors skilled workers depends on a number of factors. Free trade induces technology that favors skilled workers in skill-abundant developing countries and that favors unskilled workers in skill-scarce developing countries, and therefore amplifies the predicted wage effects of trade liberalization. Developing countries experience technical change that is skill-biased when imported skill-biased technologies become relatively cheaper. Increased skill supply further biases technical change in favor of skilled labor. These features aid our understanding of the observed rises in inequality within developing countries, the absence of a significant downward effect of expanded educational attainment on skill premia, and the differential effects of trade liberalization on inequality.","[Behar, Alberto] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Behar, A (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",abehar@imf.org,,,,,,,58,11,11,2,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The article upholds the thesis of the emergence, since the subprime crisis, of a new model qualified as tacit low-degree independence: central banks have, of their own volition, given up some of their de facto independence, helping governments to contain the rise in national debt But while keeping a step ahead of pressure from governments, they have lost the control of money supply.

The effectiveness of an institution is the process of determining how successfully the institution is in achieving its mission. To achieve a higher level of effectiveness, it is important to properly define the mission and the outcomes. If the concept of institutional effectiveness is applied on higher education institutions, it is important to decide what is important, to define the outcomes, to monitor them and to use the results to achieve a more effective activity. This paper presents a proposal for defining the goals of higher education which must serve for the achievement of social and economic progress. In addition to that, a process, comprising 7 stages, is proposed for defining and evaluating the outcomes with the aim of achieving more effective operation of higher education institutions.","[Blecich, Andrea Arbula] Fac Econ Rijeka, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Blecich, AA (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Rijeka, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",aarbula@efri.hr,,,,,,,13,3,3,1,6,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,368,376,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600036,0

We find that: 1) as the economies grow, the empirically observed income elasticities of demand are better represented by our setting than by a pure Stone-Geary approach, 2) historical simulations in general perform better in developed regions than in developing regions, and 3) simulation results are more sensitive to GDP growth than energy and non-energy substitution elasticities and autonomous energy efficiency improvement.

Purpose of this article is to introduce an empirical model of Customer Solutions Management that has been created based on the long term experience in machine building sector within the EU. The experience is documented by qualitative case study research performed in five European companies involved in supply chain within the machine building sector - from component production through distribution to machine building. Selected companies represent size range from large corporation to micro business. The research was performed in the period from 2012 to 2015 by observations and in-depth interviews with all level managers in all researched companies. Prior to the qualitative research, secondary data research in publications in order to analyze the sector in complexity was performed as well. The research proves the increasing demand for individualized product solutions from customers. Results of the research were used to create empirical model of Customer Solutions Management - business concept covering identification, development, production and delivery of customized product solutions to customers.","[Chlebovsky, Vit] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Business Management, Kolejni 4, CZ-61200 Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Chlebovsky, V (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Business Management, Kolejni 4, CZ-61200 Brno, Czech Republic.",chlebovsky@fbm.vutbr.cz,,"Chlebovsky, Vit/0000-0002-0710-3825",,,,,43,0,0,0,7,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

It is still conventional wisdom that unilateral action does not pay off for individual countries due to free-riding incentives for other countries. Does this conclusion change if damage can be reduced by adaptation measures? This article considers adaptation as an explicit decision variable and frames unilateral action as Stackelberg game with two countries. The sequence of play is determined endogenously. We show that the Stackelberg leader reduces adaptation expenditures and emissions if the follower's damage function has a specific convexity property where adaptation leads to strategic complements. Then, no country has an incentive to deviate from the sequence of play. Unilateral action in adaptation or in emissions leads to a strict Pareto improvement compared to the non-co-operative Nash solution. There are lower total emissions and less adaptation.","[Eisenack, Klaus; Kaehler, Leonhard] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Eisenack, K (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.",klaus.eisenack@uni-oldenburg.de,,,Ev.

An econometric model regarding the factors affecting the economic growth was created. The present study has used the quarterly data between the years 1998Q1 and 2015Q3. Databases are provided by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey and Turkish Statistical Institute. Data analysis was performed with software package Eviews 8. The data analysis including the unit root test was conducted in the Augmented Dickey - Fuller (ADF) and Phillips - Perron (PP) methods and Granger causality test. In this study, unit root tests were carried out primarily in order to examine the stability of the series, and simple regression model was estimated as a result of the unit root tests. In the present study, the relationships were between variables in the determination of the model were estimated with ordinary least squares (OLS). In accordance with the results of the empirical analyses in Turkey, there is a causality relationship between non-performing loans and domestic credit volume of the Turkish banking sector. Granger causality tests show that these relationships are bivious. Non-Performing Loans, gross domestic product (GDP) at constant prices, public sector expenditure at constant prices (PS) and private sector expenditure at constant prices (PSE), domestic credit volume (CV), total loan interest income (I) are the most significant sub-items of the economic growth.

Growing continuously from the 1950's, airline transportation is extremely important in promoting the country's economy. At first years, air services took a place in people's life as fast, safe and regular but privileged transportation because of high costs. Recently, dizzying improvement in features such as comfort, speed of transport and security with economical prices transformed airline transportation as a mass Because of its intensive use of infrastructures, the transport sector is an important component of the economy and a common tool used for development. This is even more so in a global economy where economic opportunities have been increasingly related to the mobility of people, goods and information. High quality transport infrastructure is a prerequisite for sustained economic growth and for maintaining competitiveness in a developed economy. In this context, measurement of the expectations and satisfaction of flight passengers has an important role in determining the factors affecting the passenger experience. In this study, unlike the former studies in the literature, flight service quality will be evaluated through criteria of the most respected airline passenger satisfaction programs compared with a scale to measure the degree of passenger satisfaction. Desired analysis will be applied in order to determine the factors affecting the passenger experience to offer solutions for the prescribed quality.","[Ergun, Ozgur] Kocaeli Univ Turkey, Izmit, Turkey; [Capuk, Serap] Turkish Airlines Turkey, Istanbul, Turkey",Kocaeli University; Turkish Aeronautical Association; Turkish Airlines,"Ergun, O (通讯作者)，Kocaeli Univ Turkey, Izmit, Turkey.",oerg@msn.com; serapcapuk01@hotmail.com,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,561,568,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100059,0

This paper develops a model of sovereign debt and default with endogenous participation rates in bailout programs. Conditionality enters as a constraint on fiscal policy. In the model, the insurance character of bailouts generates incentives for debt accumulation. Quantitative results suggest that bailouts prevent sovereign defaults in the short-run but may come at a cost of a greater default probability in the long-run. Increasing the intensity of conditionality lowers the bailout participation rate and generates a hump-shaped pattern of sovereign default risk. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This suggests that natural market forces protect inventors so that formal protections are not necessary. Using firm-level data, this study provides the first empirical evidence on the relationship between knowledge tradeability and the choice of IPR protection methods. Consistent with recent theoretical results, we find that firms engaged in licensing agreements are more likely to use secrecy than patents and that the largest R&D investors tend to use secrecy more than patents. Also, large firms, or manufacturing firms of any size are more likely to use patents, whilst firms that obtain information from internal and non-market sources are more inclined to use secrecy.","[Goy, Frederique; Wang, Changtao] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Wang, CT (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",changtaowang@hotmail.com,,,,,,,29,3,3,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Naive portfolio selection contrasts to the many sophisticated portfolio selection rules that are optimal with respect to a specific portfolio allocation objective and which often perform well in sample. However, some recent research finds that many of these 'optimal' portfolio allocation mechanisms perform no better than naive diversification in out-of-sample data. This paper extends this line of inquiry by comparing the out-of-sample performance of naive portfolio selection to several recently developed shortfall-minimizing portfolio selection methods.

We find that enhanced competition reduces liquidity creation, a finding we observe under different specifications, including alternative measures of liquidity creation. We explain this finding in terms of the impact of increased bank competition on the financial fragility of banks, which leads banks to reduce their lending and deposit activities.

However, the economic outcome is still debatable due to the implications on economic efficiency, fiscal policy and et cetera. As two main oil producer countries in ASEAN 5, both Malaysia and Indonesia had allocated 5% of energy subsidy (% of GDP) averagely throughout the period of 1990-2014. This paper is intended to study the impact of energy subsidy on economic production in Malaysia and Indonesia by employing a dynamic panel data analysis. Our finding suggests that the energy subsidy affects the growth output positively in the long run. We conclude that energy subsidy is significant to promote economic growth in both countries. The absence of energy subsidy will bring harm to the economic growth. However, if a reduction of energy subsidy is essential to improve efficiency and fiscal pressure, we suggest the policymaker to implement some offsetting policies to cushion the economy from any shocks.","[Husaini, Dzul Hadzwan; Kueh, Jerome] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Econ & Business, Kota Samarahan, Malaysia; [Lean, Hooi Hooi] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Social Sci, Econ Program, George Town, Malaysia",University of Malaysia Sarawak; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Husaini, DH (通讯作者)，Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Econ & Business, Kota Samarahan, Malaysia.",hdhadzwan@unimas.my,"Kueh, Jerome/T-1092-2018; Lean, Hooi Hooi/A-5754-2010; Husaini, Dzul hadzwan/AAQ-6656-2020","Lean, Hooi Hooi/0000-0002-6847-0274; Husaini, Dzul hadzwan/0000-0002-5704-9978",Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia [RACE/e(2)/1249/2015(05)]; Universiti Sains Malaysia [1001/PSOSIAL/AUPRM00536],"Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia(Ministry of Education, Malaysia); Universiti Sains Malaysia(Universiti Sains Malaysia)",We are thankful to the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for providing fund for this study under RACE/e(2)/1249/2015(05).

First, in line with previous literature, we find that the estimated threshold is substantially higher for developing countries compared to that of developed countries. However, we further show that the inflation threshold in developing economies falls when we consider reduced groups that exceed certain levels of institutional quality. We also find that the cost of inflation increases with the quality of institutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The focus is on analysing the FX volatilities in three developing economies (the Brazilian real (BRL), the Indian rupee (INR) and the Russian ruble (RUB)) against the US dollar (USD). The empirical exercise utilizes two time-series models, mixed data sampling (MIDAS) and GARCH. The analysis indicates that for both developed and developing economies the predictive power of MIDAS and that of GARCH is comparable. Further on in this article, we will ascertain whether the relationship between realized and implied volatility is fundamentally different in the case of developing economies from that among developed economies. Thus, we compare the pairs USD/BRL, USD/INR and USD/RUB against EURO/USD and USD/Japanese yen to determine the information content and predictive power of implied volatilities. Plots of the MIDAS coefficients show that the volatility is more persistent in developing economies than in developed economies.","[Iliescu, Nicoleta] Iona Coll, Econ Dept, New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA",Iona College,"Iliescu, N (通讯作者)，Iona Coll, Econ Dept, New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA.",niliescu@iona.edu,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The new data show that the share of mortgages on banks' balance sheets doubled in the course of the twentieth century, driven by a sharp rise of mortgage lending to households. Household debt to asset ratios have risen substantially in many countries. Financial stability risks have been increasingly linked to real estate lending booms, which are typically followed by deeper recessions and slower recoveries. Housing finance has come to play a central role in the modern macroeconomy.","[Jorda, Oscar] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA; Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Bonn; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Jordà, O (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA.",,,,Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); Volkswagen Foundation; HKIMR,Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen); HKIMR,"The views expressed herein are solely the responsibility of the authors and should not be interpreted as reflecting the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
