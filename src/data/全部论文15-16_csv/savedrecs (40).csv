Investment in electricity, water supply, roads and telecommunications have played a significant role in economic growth in developed countries, and also in developing countries. The lag in infrastructure development, especially road infrastructure can not be. explained only by the lack of capital to support the development and financing of infrastructure, but the reason is the lack of government strategy in the insufficient care for the lost opportunities and priorities that imposes development infrastructure in internal and international relations. Sponsored by the lack of domestic sources could be offset by foreign borrowing, providing funds through co-financing by private investors or by issuing concessions for certain priority infrastructure projects. Infrastructure development in the country enables timely, efficient, and a functioning use of public good from the old economic entities and the population, improving the volume, quality and availability to the users of public goods, and at the same time provides the necessary prerequisites for successful realization of commitments set policies for general social and economic development of the country. The role and importance of developing public infrastructure, in terms of economic development is significant and multiple. Infrastructure development affects directly and indirectly on economic development, manifesting by improving communication links, timely access to information, timely and quality supply of needed energy and water, affecting the improvement of competitiveness, the economy, the profitability of domestic economy etc.","[Aziri, Elmi] Southeast Europian Univ Tetovo, Fac Publ Adm & Polit Sci, Tetovo, Macedonia",,"Aziri, E (通讯作者)，Southeast Europian Univ Tetovo, Fac Publ Adm & Polit Sci, Tetovo, Macedonia.",,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,67,72,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200009,0

In this paper, a new extension of the crisp COPRAS method has been proposed This extension is developed in the context of single value neutrosophic sets. The information processing flow has been proposed for the solution of the multicriteria decision-making problems. The proposed approach consists of the following steps: neutrosophication, solution of MCDM by the operations of the neutrosophic sets, de-neutrosophication. For the execution of the de-neutrosophication step a new version of the score function is proposed. The solution of the practical example of the selection of location for a liquefied natural gas terminal has been provided to illustrate correctness and the effectiveness of the proposed technique.","[Bausys, Romualdas; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras; Kaklauskas, Arturas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Bausys, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania.",romualdas.bausys@vgtu.lt; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt; arturas.kaklauskas@vgtu.lt,"Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Bausys, Romualdas/AAT-6277-2021; Kaklauskas, Artūras/AAC-4058-2019","Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X; Bausys, Romualdas/0000-0002-6284-0406; Kaklauskas, Arturas/0000-0001-9800-9158",,,,,25,68,68,0,21,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The literature on the determinants of successful fiscal consolidations generally favours spending-based over revenue-based adjustments and in particular, the empirical literature favours cuts in primary current spending rather than on capital goods. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the extent at which fiscal measures adopted in Romania after the economic crisis have managed to achieve different results in terms of economic growth and fiscal fundamentals.

The formulation is motivated by a Keynesian principle of weak aggregate demand. The basic idea is that the rise of unemployment causes the fall of aggregate demand for final goods.

The model is econometrically estimated for the Eurozone and it is shown that the described mechanism gives rise to the multiplicity of the equilibrium rate of unemployment. Factors influencing the position of the equilibrium points are studied and economic implications are made from this analysis.","[Cizek, Ondrej] Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Cízek, O (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,4,1,1,0,0,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,109,114,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900019,0

Once they are filled with valuable data they might become a marketable product. However, there is a legal problem with using and spreading the information encompassed in any database. This paper examines a database as an object of one's intellectual property. The aim is to identify the issues arising from legal representation of its definition, protection, and commercial exploitation in business and university environment. In this paper we primarily focus on Slovak market, however, we can say that these problems are also occurring abroad. By the definition of the Copyright Act no. 618/2003 Coll. as amended and according to our practical experience we identified three basic issues associated with a database which we see as an object of one's Intellectual Property. The first issue is that according to law, a database is considered as company's know-how but the basic conditions for being know-how are not fulfilled, mainly the sufficient protection of a database. The second issue is that in some cases the simple data collection (e.g. a list of names) cannot be regarded as a database because its content and creation do not meet the essential conditions for its protection under the Copyright Act. The third issue is that a database is closely linked to a database system and what one is regarding as quality, marketable and valuable a database is, in fact, advanced and specialized software used for its creation. These three issues emphasized in our paper are common in enterprises, universities, and scientific or research institutions. Universities, scientific or research institutions need to challenge another serious problem - to prove that they are really makers of a particular database (especially in case of contractual research, cooperation agreements and projects) because according to law - the maker of a database is the natural person or legal entity, at the suggestion, account and responsibility of who a database was made. The ambition of this paper is not only to point out these problems but also to provide basic suggestions on how to eliminate them. As we are from university environment, the emphasis is put on scrupulous definition and protection of a database in this environment. Furthermore, we provide comparison of possibilities of commercial database development and exploitation on the marketplace in case of business or university owner. All these issues need to be reconsidered when determining the value of a database for the purpose of its sale. However, this is another very important topic which needs to be further analyzed. In order to verify our recommendations, further empirical studies will be needed.","[Corejova, Andrea; Jarosova, Jana] Univ Zilina, Ctr Technol Transfer, Univ Sci Pk,Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Corejova, Andrea] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina; University of Zilina,"Corejová, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Ctr Technol Transfer, Univ Sci Pk,Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",andrea.corejova@uvp.uniza.sk; jana.jarosova@uvp.uniza.sk,"Čorejová, Andrea/AAE-7550-2021",,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,104,113,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800011,0

In this procurement system, timber users (i.e., winners) are responsible for harvesting the entire stands and for reselling undesirable timber species to others. In order to improve the limits of this system, this paper proposes a sustainable auction system, referred to as time-based timber combinatorial auction. In this approach, time is not part of the definition of the goods for sale. It is used to valuate the good for sale with respect to their expected delivery period. Therefore, this system aims to simultaneously allocate multiple goods, or products in mixed forest stand, to multiple winners, and address the coordination of timber deliveries to their winners. The proposed timber combinatorial auction provides an open access allocation of timber, based on its intrinsic economic value, while allowing the Ministry of natural resources to exercise high standard for environmentally friendly forest operations. From a logistic point of view, a sensitive analysis is conducted in order to compare the proposed time-based combinatorial auction with a combinatorial auction with no delivery coordination. Both models are compared according to bidders' and seller's time flexibility. Experimental results illustrate the impact (i.e., cost) of delivery coordination on total revenue due to loss of value when time preference is not fully satisfied. This cost evaluation can then be used as an upper bound of the cost of coordination, when delivery coordination must be manually negotiated among multi-stakeholders. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A qualitative marketing research based on semi-structured in-depth interviews was conducted, aiming to determine the stage of adoption of CRM technological solutions and customer retention strategies in the Romanian banking industry. According to research objectives and results, most banks in the Romanian market have implemented CRM solutions in order to streamline processes within marketing, sales and customer service departments. Furthermore, bank management show a relatively high global satisfaction on CRM adoption, which mainly concerns CRM impact on customer retention rates and cross selling volumes, and to a lower extent the implementation costs of CRM systems. However, retention plans are not always and systematically included in banking policies, while retention rates are frequently measured only by using the gross customer retention indicator, without clear focus on customer value assessment in terms of sales and profits. These lead to the conclusion that retention benefits are not entirely exploited in order to drive optimal value for business and customers.","[Filip, Alina; Vranceanu, Diana Maria; Georgescu, Bogdan; Marinescu, Daniela Elena] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Filip, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",filip.alina@gmail.com; dvranceanu@yahoo.com; georgescubogdanmk@gmail.com; daniela.marinescu@csie.ase.ro,"Vranceanu, Diana/L-3115-2019; Filip, Alina/AAR-8642-2021","Vranceanu, Diana/0000-0002-5547-7493; Filip, Alina/0000-0002-4753-9244","European Social Fund, through the Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/138907]","European Social Fund, through the Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development","This paper was co-financed from the European Social Fund, through the Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project number POSDRU/159/1.5/S/138907 Excellence in scientific interdisciplinary research, doctoral and postdoctoral, in the economic, social and medical fields - EXCELIS, coordinator The Bucharest University of Economic Studies.",,14,0,0,0,6,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2457-483X,,,PROC BASIQ,,,2015,,,,,,,226,233,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK2IL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000432877200029,0

The cointegration analyses in this study show that there are no general trends among the historical timber REIT stock prices and the S&P 500 index.

This study examines the extent to which fathers' evaluation of their wealth in relation to their wives' influences fathers' willingness to participate in childcare, a domain traditionally gender ascribed to wives. Data were gathered from a mothers' survey and a fathers' survey, each with a sample of 200, conducted in a rural and an urban district in Uganda in 2008. The study compares mean scores for perception and practice indices across three wealth categories: wife is wealthier than husband, husband is wealthier than wife, and shared or equal wealth. Data show that fathers are more likely to engage in childcare when husbands and wives share or have equal wealth than when there are wealth differences between spouses. The results suggest that policy should focus on raising women's economic endowment as well as public education that encourages progressive perceptions of gender roles.","[Nkwake, Apollo M.] Tulane Univ, Disaster Resilience Leadership Acad, 1555 Poydras St,716, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA",Tulane University,"Nkwake, AM (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Disaster Resilience Leadership Acad, 1555 Poydras St,716, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",nkwake@gmail.com,"Nkwake, Apollo M/M-1333-2013",,,,,,58,4,6,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Based on a survey of 1,203 workers who were dismissed after their manufacturing plants closed down, we analyse the determinants of re-employment, the sector of re-employment and the change in wages. Two years after displacement, a majority of workers were back in employment: 69% were re-employed, 17% unemployed and 11% retired. Amongst re-employed workers, two thirds found a job in manufacturing and one third in services. Contrary to a common belief, low-end services are not the collecting vessel of redundant industrial workers. Displaced workers aged 55 and older seem particularly vulnerable after a plant closes down: over 30% were long-term unemployed, and those older workers who found a new job suffered disproportionate wage losses. Advanced age-and not low education-appears as the primary handicap after mass redundancy.","[Oesch, Daniel; Baumann, Isabel] Univ Lausanne, Life Course & Inequal Res Ctr LINES, Swiss Natl Ctr Competence Res LIVES, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Oesch, D (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Life Course & Inequal Res Ctr LINES, Swiss Natl Ctr Competence Res LIVES, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",daniel.oesch@unil.ch,"Baumann, Isabel/AAI-7679-2020; Daniel, Oesch/C-2243-2016","Daniel, Oesch/0000-0003-1704-853X",Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO); Swiss National Science Foundation,Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This research was financially supported by the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and carried out within the National Centre of Competence in Research 'LIVES-overcoming vulnerability: life course perspectives', financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

Ambition of this paper is to show trends in development of beer industry in Slovakia, which leads to establish new microbreweries. Paper is focused on the importance of beer contribution to the economy of Slovakia. Increasing of beer leads to higher value added, helps to make more opportunity for jobs and leads to higher government revenues. Slovak brewing industry has changed in last decades. Market is characterized by higher concentration as a result of globalisation. More than 80% of consumption in Slovakia comes from 2 large international companies - Heineken Slovakia (owned by Heineken Corporation) and Pivovary Topvar (owned by SAB Corporation). Microbreweries cover only about 4% of the total market share. Beer consumption was on level 94 litres per capita (annually) in 2002 but strongly has fallen to the level 73 in 2011. In years 2012 and 2013 small increasing was achieved to level 75 litres. New innovative methods and formulas (like Radlers, no-alcoholic beers, premium beers) helped to stop decreasing of beer production. Beer production could have positive impact on economic development of the country. Value added was on level 222 millions Euros in 2012 and increased by 16.2% compared to year 2010 because of higher total volume of production. In total, the employment impact from the production and sale of beer in Slovakia was 19612 jobs in 2012 what is 6.5% increasing compared to year 2010. Results are based on data of The Brewers of Europe and Slovak Beer and Malt Association. To recognize more motives for establishing microbreweries the interviews were held with founders of Slovak microbreweries.","[Savov, Radovan; Lancaric, Drahoslav] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Toth, Marin] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Pokrivcak, Jan] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Savov, R (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",radovan.savov@uniag.sk; marian.toth@uniag.sk; drahoslav.lancaric@uniag.sk; jpokrivcak@yahoo.com,"Pokrivcak, Jan/O-4941-2014; Lancaric, Drahoslav/AAD-8710-2019; Tóth, Marián/AAD-8706-2019",,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,969,976,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800093,0

Financial performance and assessing the level of concentration of companies with this profile are important in assessing the competitiveness of the industry.","[Stanciu, Silvius] Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati, Romania; [Stanciu, Silvius; Rizea, Raluca; Ilie, Anca Gabriela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Dunarea De Jos University Galati; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Stanciu, S (通讯作者)，Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati, Romania.",sstanciu@ugal.ro; r.rizea@gmail.com; ancaionescu2003@yahoo.com,"STANCIU, SILVIUS/R-8246-2017","STANCIU, SILVIUS/0000-0001-7697-0968","European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development, project POSDRU [159/1.5/S/138907]","European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development, project POSDRU","This paper was co-financed from the European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project POSDRU number /159/1.5/S/138907 Excellence in scientific interdisciplinary research, doctoral and postdoctoral school, in the economic, social and medical fields-EXCELIS, coordinator The Bucharest University of Economic Studies.",,14,0,0,0,0,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2457-483X,,,PROC BASIQ,,,2015,,,,,,,408,415,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK2IL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000432877200050,0

HD is topical for countries that are on the transition way to the knowledge economy. Knowledge economy presumes high HD and development of the human capital potential; thus, people from developing countries that strive for knowledge-based economy tend to have higher education and be the white-collar workers usually in urban areas. Several issues on rural areas can be connected to low human and education development there, i.e. emigration of rural population, problems of young people Not in Education, Employment, or Training (NEETs), stagnation in rural development and lack of specialists demanded in rural areas etc. The aim of this research is to evaluate role of education in HD in terms of knowledge economy transition in rural areas of the Baltic States for the last years based on available data. The authors review topical scientific literature, interpret Knowledge Index, Knowledge Economy Index and HD Index, data on education. In addition, the authors have observed and interpreted statistical data on rural and urban population, its employment. It can be concluded that Estonia and Lithuania have greater potential for successful transition to a knowledge-based economy. In the rural employment and development context, it is important to form a shared system between the rural plans and strategies and educational institutions. The hypothesis to test in further studies is - education as a HD's element has a high influence on rural development in general.","[Starineca, Olga; Voronchuk, Inesa] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Starineca, O (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,8,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-190-6,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2015,,40.0,,,,,186,195,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BD3PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360010100019,0

Moreover, conducted analysis revealed that reliability concept should be considered on many research fields that go beyond traditional accounting theory. The paper contributes into theory and practice of accounting by depiction of recent theoretical developments of 'fairness', 'reliability' and 'true and fair view' concepts, which undoubtedly play the central role in explaining accounting measurement and financial information communication.

These treatments produce residues that can be used to generate renewable energy and displace fossil fuels. The choice modeling method is employed to examine the marginal willingness of Montanans' to pay (MWTP) for woody biomass energy produced from treatments in their public forests. The survey instrument elicited social preferences for important co-benefits and costs of woody biomass energy generation in Montana, namely the extent of healthy forests, the number of large wildfires, and local air quality. Positive and statistically significant MWTP is found for woody biomass energy generation, forest health and air quality. MWTP to avoid large wildfires is statistically insignificant. However, MW FP for woody biomass energy diminishes quickly, revealing that Montanans do not support public forestland management that produces more than double the current level of woody biomass harvested for energy generation. These findings can be used by policy makers and public land managers to estimate the social benefits of utilizing residues from public forest restoration or fuel treatment programs to generate energy.

Other countries like Britain with its Research Excellence Framework also have similar metrics. While much analysis and publicity is devoted to the rankings of the quality of research, there has been very little focus on how this ranked research has then gone on to make a public policy impact. In the case of the economics discipline, there has been little exploration of the relationship between publication in a high-ranked journal and contribution to an analysis of Australia's most pressing economic issues. This article investigates the extent to which articles in the Diamond list of journals from 2001 to 2010 addressed Australian economic issues. Our results indicate that articles on current policy issues accounted for a very modest fraction of total Diamond list journal articles. One possible explanation for this finding, which is investigated further, is the correlation between an economics department's Excellence in Research Australia ranking and the number of staff who obtained their doctorates from an overseas university. Such a correlation has implications for the status afforded to economics research with a specific national focus.","[Doraisami, Anita; Millmow, Alex] Federat Univ Australia, Mt Helen, Vic, Australia",Federation University Australia,"Doraisami, A (通讯作者)，Federat Univ Australia, Federat Business Sch, Univ Dr, Ballarat, Vic 3350, Australia.",a.doraisami@federation.edu.au,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Evidence on socio-economic subgroups is sparse. We investigate whether a downturn at college graduation affects subsequent fertility. Using data from the German National Educational Panel Study covering a more than 40-years observation period, we find that a recession at graduation affects female but not male fertility timing. A downturn at graduation increases the transition rate to first pregnancy among female graduates significantly. This effect is driven by females older than 24 years at graduation and is strongest in the first years after graduation and then decreases over time. We also find a downturn to decrease the probability of holding a degree-adequate job in the first years after graduation. These findings suggest that female graduates take advantage of decreased opportunity costs in a recession. We do not find an effect of a downturn at graduation on completed fertility.

Market outcome measures such as social surplus and price variability are improved by the use of a price collar (auction reserve price and soft price cap). Comparable performance enhancements are not observed with the implementation of a quantity collar that adjusts auction quantities in response to privately held inventories of unused allowances. In some specifications, the quantity collar performed worse than no stabilization policy at all. The experiment implemented a specific set of structural elements, and extrapolation to other settings should be done with caution. Nevertheless, an examination of the observed behavioral patterns and deviations from optimal behavior suggests that a price collar has an important (although perhaps not exclusive) role to play in constructing an effective market stability policy.

Many papers within the stated preferences literature have tested this assumption, and have found mixed results. Individuals may become more sure of their preferences as they repeat a valuation task or purchase decision; they may also learn more about prices and quantities of substitutes or complements over time, or about other relevant characteristics of both the good being valued, and alternatives in their choice sets. In this paper, we test for the stability of preferences and willingness to pay for attributes of forest management both within one survey and between two different moments of time. The within survey test compares a set of responses from individuals over the sequence of the first 12 and the second 12 choices in a stated preference survey. The between two different moments of time test compares responses from the same people over a period of 6 months. Non-parametric analysis reveals little clear trending in choices across these sets, although a higher consistency for status quo choices than for enhanced environmental management choices is apparent. Overall, we reject the strictest test of the equivalence of WTP distributions between choice sets. However, we also find that respondents' mean willingness to pay is fairly stable both within survey and between moments of time. Such differences as emerge are mainly driven by the changes in variances of WTP and by imperfect correlations of individual-specific WTP between choice sets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It provides the EU with leverage through imposing a price penalty on any tender for an EU procurement which is originating in a country that does not offer the EU 'reciprocity' in access to its procurement markets. After introducing the 2016 International Procurement Instrument (IPI) Amended Proposal, the article examines the legal framework of the Amended Proposal with reference to its evolution from the European Commission's original 2012 proposed regulation. The analysis then turns to the concept of reciprocity, which serves as the justificatory basis of the Commission's proposal before assessing the 2016 Amended Proposal's compatibility with the EU's commitments under the World Trade Organization (WTO), including most notably the World Trade Organization's Government Procurement Agreement (WTO GPA), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM). This assessment concludes by questioning the compatibility of this proposed regulation with the EU's obligations under the WTO as well as the objectives of the EU procurement rules, underpinned by Treaty principles.","[Dawar, Kamala] Univ Sussex, Int Commercial Law, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Dawar, K (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Int Commercial Law, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",k.dawar@sussex.ac.uk,,"dawar, kamala/0000-0002-4069-7135",,,,,10,3,3,0,9,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Various 'green energy programs' are being adopted by many governments. To the extent that governmental support is indispensable for the initiation and maintenance of these green energy programs, the SCM Agreement is directly implicated in this regard. Unfortunately, the agreement does not include any exceptions to these programs, even if the exceptions are undertaken due to the growing concerns of the global community. Under such circumstances, a practical solution should be found from within the existing framework, and be derived from an interpretation of the present SCM Agreement based on current jurisprudence. The collective jurisprudence of the WTO arguably stands for the proposition that certain renewable energy programs constitute 'general infrastructure' projects of a state, and thus are excluded from the financial contributions by the government under Article 1.1(a)(1)(iii) of the SCM Agreement.","[Lee, Jaemin] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Law, Law, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Law, Law, Seoul, South Korea.",jaemin@snu.ac.kr,,,,,,,32,5,7,1,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2016,15,4.0,,,,,613,644,,10.1017/S1474745616000276,0.0,,,32,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,DY8BD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385352300004,0

The analysis utilizes survey data from a stated-choice experiment involving backcountiy visitors who responded to questions about hypothetical wildfire burn scenarios. Benefits of landscape preservation are derived using a Kuhn-Tucker (KT) demand system. Model results suggest that recreationists are attracted to sites with recent wildfires that can be viewed up-close. For example, recreational welfare estimates increased for sites that were partially affected by different types of wildfires, with the greatest gains being observed for the most recent wildfires. Per person mean seasonal willingness-to-pay varied from a low of $10 to a high of $48, for total gains ranging from $62,223 to $635,286. However, wildfires that cause trail closures create welfare losses. Seasonal losses per person for complete closure of particular sites range from $3 to $221, for total losses ranging from $29,600 to $2.9 million.

Methods: Medicinal products with completed benefit assessments during an assessment period of 3.5 years were considered. PAMs extracted from European Public Assessment Reports (EPARs) were compared with data requests issued by the G-BA in the context of conditional appraisals. Results: Twenty conditional appraisals (19 products) and 34 EPARs containing PAMs (33 products) were identified. Data categories (efficacy, safety, etc.), data types (type of study required to address the request) and clarity of requests were determined. Conditional appraisals disproportionately focused on oncology products (13/19 products with conditional appraisals vs. 14/33 products with PAMs). No clear rationale for the G-BA issuing conditional appraisals could be identified in public sources. Both EMA and G-BA requested mainly efficacy and safety data (44/54 and 23/35 categories requested, respectively); however, 28/35 G-BA data requirements went beyond requests made by the EMA. Almost half of the G-BA requests (9/20), but no PAMs, were unclear, and no methodological guidance for fulfilling the data requirements was provided by the G-BA. Conclusions: Better alignment between data requests from regulatory authorities and health technology assessment bodies is strongly recommended.","[Ruof, Joerg; Staab, Thomas] Roche Pharma AG, Emil Barrell Str 1, D-79639 Grenzach Wyhlen, Germany; [Ruof, Joerg; Schwartz, Friedrich Wilhelm] Med Sch Hanover, Hannover, Germany; [Dintsios, Charalabos-Markos] Heinrich Heine Univ, Hlth Serv Res & Hlth Econ, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Schroeter, Jakob] Baden Wurttemberg Cooperat State Univ, Lorrach, Germany",Roche Holding; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Ruof, J (通讯作者)，Roche Pharma AG, Emil Barrell Str 1, D-79639 Grenzach Wyhlen, Germany.;Ruof, J (通讯作者)，Med Sch Hanover, Hannover, Germany.",joerg.ruof@bluewin.ch,,"Dintsios, Charalabos-Markos/0000-0003-3469-092X",Roche Pharma AG,Roche Pharma AG(Roche Holding),"Medical writing services were provided by nspm ltd, Meggen, Switzerland, with financial support from Roche Pharma AG.",,28,7,7,0,3,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

The analysis-which includes pooled two-stage least-squares (2SLS), panel data analysis, system generalized method-of-moments (GMM) estimator and an instrumental variable (IV) approach-finds that, in contrast to the prevailing view, there is no universal positive relationship between average city size and economic growth and that the results vary between high-income and developing countries. In high-income countries, there is consistent evidence of a positive albeit decreasing link between city size and economic growth. In contrast, the relationship does not hold for developing countries, for which most of the coefficients display insignificant results or point towards a negative connection between both factors.","[Frick, Susanne A.; Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Frick, SA (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.a.frick@lse.ac.uk; a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856; Frick, Susanne A./0009-0007-0885-7331",European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)/ERC [269868],European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)/ERC(European Research Council (ERC)),"The authors are grateful to the Editors and the anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions to earlier versions of the article.

The case studies signify phases of evolution of the slow living concept starting from the traditional representation (Model A), through the hybrid (Model B), to a more contemporary model (Model C). Based on the novel SLOW LIFE analysis, the study found that contrary to expectations the latest high-tech model of sustainable community in Masdar City failed to generate the same level of social cohesion and enjoyable living experience as evidenced in older, more established communities (Damanhur, and Toarps Ekoby). The study highlights the pivotal role of slow living concepts in the transitional period of the 21st century, moving towards the next ideational phase, according to Sorokin's pendulum theory of social change. Further, the T-Cycle analysis revealed a converging trend in the shifting dialectical relationship between mainstream Western society and sustainable communities. The findings of this study indicate that evolution of the slow living concept in the context of sustainable communities followed broader trends in society moving towards a more technologically oriented model.

Following a history of the establishment of the Productivity Commission and its predecessor agencies, it argues that the concepts of third-party independence and third-party endorsement are important for understanding the role of the Productivity Commission. A review of the politics of industrial relations reform leads into the central analysis of the political economy of the Productivity Commission's 2015 inquiry into the Australian workplace relations framework. The concepts of third-party independence and endorsement are applied in analysing some of the inquiry's key recommendations. The conclusion discusses several difficulties in the political economy of the Productivity Commission and its relationships to government and, indeed, to evidence, when the latter contradicted its mainly liberal market stance.","[Peetz, David] Griffith Univ, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Peetz, D (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Employment Relat & Human Resources, Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",d.peetz@griffith.edu.au,,,,,,,57,5,5,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Two years later it was modified into REDD +. Since then, numerous sub-national initiatives have implemented REDD + or REDD +-like mechanisms. Now, shortly before the COP (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Conference of the Parties) in Paris 2015 it is timely and necessary to analyze insights and to draw upon lessons learned. This study reviews multi-national REDD+ studies by applying qualitative content analysis using the UNFCCC Warsaw Framework for categorization. Experiences with the implementation of core REDD+ topics like institutional responsibility and results-based financing are mostly not encouraging. Monitoring systems require further development, and guidance for jurisdictional approaches is lacking. Experiences with reference levels, permanence and leakage have hardly been reported. More general topics like stakeholder participation, tenure clarification and biodiversity co-benefits are in turn more advanced. But these are not necessarily effects of REDD+ components in the projects. The projects obviously offer a platform to advance classical development issues. We conclude that financial signals from the upcoming COP in Paris are essential to encourage further development and implementation. This supports conclusions in accordance with the UNFCCC session in Bonn 2015 stating that methodologies are now complete and implementation must begin. Additional conclusions are drawn for specific topics of the Warsaw Framework. Authors claim that REDD+ should stimulate and support transformational change.

Globalization is changing this situation where countries may have to choose between 'more' or 'better' jobs. The multilateral framework of the World 'Trade Organization (WTO) can only have an indirect impact. But Regional Ride Agreements (RTA) and International Investment Agreements (IIA) are emerging as a new way of gradually enhancing the impact of certain labour standards. In addition, unilateral measures both by governments and importers driven by social and environmental consumer preferences and pressure groups increasingly shape the international regulatory framework for national employment policies. Even small, locally operating enterprises risk marginalization and market exclusion by ignoring these developments. 'The long-term influence of this new 'network approach' on employment-related policies, including job location, gender issues, social coherence and migration remains to be seen. Nonetheless, the still flimsy evidence gathered here seems to indicate that this new, international framework might increase sustainable employment where and when supporting measures, including through unilateral preferences and even sanctions, form a 'cocktail' which export-oriented industries and their suppliers will find palatable.","[Haeberli, Christian] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Häberli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",christian.haeberli@wti.org,"Häberli, Christian/I-8170-2019","Häberli, Christian/0000-0003-0414-6851",,,,,36,1,1,2,5,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

We analyze data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, the College Board, the National Student Clearinghouse, and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System to estimate the impact of improved academic match on students' predicted net price and bachelor's completion probabilities. The results indicate that undermatching low-income students across the distribution of academic ability would experience a substantial boost in bachelor's degree completion probability - 13.5% points, on average - if they attended a college that better matched their academic credentials. Given this average effect and the number of undermatched low-income students who are minimally treated under our simulation, we predict that an additional 3500 low-income students per cohort would complete a bachelor's degree. We find that moving all undermatched low-income students into safety colleges would not overly burden this set of institutions, which, on average, would only need to increase the size of first year cohorts by less than 1%. Moreover, such colleges would experience no change in average SAT scores and overall graduation rates. One estimate of the financial impact on colleges is substantial (i.e., on average, $6.5 M-7.5 M annually per cohort per institution that has a simulated net gain in enrollment) if institutions cover full tuition and fees for these additional low-income students.

We assess whether it actually does this using regression discontinuity on the income cutoffs that govern eligibility. Although many eligible households take the maximum, we find no evidence that it affects attending college, attending full-time, attending four-year college, the resources experienced, the amount paid, or student loans. Our analysis suggests that the deduction's inefficacy may be due to salience, timing, and the method of receipt. We argue that the deduction might increase college-going if it were modified in simple ways that would not increase potential costs but would make it more likely to relax liquidity constraints and be perceived as a price change (which it is) as opposed to an income change. We find that households who would be just above a cut-off manage their incomes to fall slightly below it. Such income management generates bias due to reverse causality. We choose optimal doughnut-holes that trade-off bias and statistical power. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, the findings provide additional support for the home bias phenomena, in which investors prefer to invest in familiar stocks.","[Liao, Tsai-Ling] Natl Formosa Univ, Dept Business Adm, Yunlin, Taiwan; [Sung, Hao-Chang] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Int Ctr Financial Res, 99 Zi Yang Rd, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Sung, Hao-Chang; Yu, Min-Teh] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan",National Formosa University; Jiangxi Normal University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Sung, HC (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Normal Univ, Int Ctr Financial Res, 99 Zi Yang Rd, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",hcsung0205@gmail.com,"Sung, Hao-Chang/ABP-4794-2022; Yu, Min-Teh/ABB-7718-2021","Sung, Hao-Chang/0000-0002-0437-9754; Yu, Min-Teh/0000-0003-4686-1327",,,,,48,4,4,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

As the country faces a severe financial crisis, the need to investigate the extent of such payments, their incidence and their impact on household income is pressing. Methods A survey of 2,741 persons from across the country was conducted between December 2011 and February 2012. The sample was defined via a multistage selection process using a quota for municipality of residence, sex and age. The maximum error margin was 2.41 % with a confidence interval of 95 %. Results The survey reports under-the-table payments for approximately 32.4 % of public hospital admissions. Private clinics, which display the bulk of out-of-pocket payments, naturally display the lowest under-the-table payments. The highest percentage of under-the-table payments in the private sector appears at visits to private practitioners and dentists (36 %). Informal payments are most frequently made upon request, prior to service provision, to facilitate access to care and to reduce waiting times, and at a much lower percentage, to post-service provision, and out of gratitude. Conclusions This survey reveals that, due to severe financial pressure, there is a growing unwillingness of citizens to pay informally and an increasing demand for these payments as a prerequisite for access to services or to redeem services provided. This hidden'' financial burden of at least 27 % impacts negatively on the living conditions of households and is not reported as purchasing ability or cost of living.","[Souliotis, Kyriakos] Univ Peloponnese, Fac Social & Polit Sci, Corinth, Greece; [Souliotis, Kyriakos; Golna, Christina; Tountas, Yannis] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Sch Med, Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Athens 11528, Greece; [Siskou, Olga; Kaitelidou, Daphne; Liaropoulos, Lycourgos] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Ctr Hlth Serv Management & Evaluat, 123 Papadiamantopoulou Str, Athens 11527, Greece",University of Peloponnese; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Athens Medical School; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Souliotis, K (通讯作者)，Univ Peloponnese, Fac Social & Polit Sci, Corinth, Greece.",soulioti@hol.gr; olsiskou@nurs.uoa.gr,"Kaitelidou, Dafni/AAA-2599-2020; SOULIOTIS, KYRIAKOS/AAM-3164-2021","SOULIOTIS, KYRIAKOS/0000-0003-1624-9444; Kaitelidou, Daphne/0000-0002-4881-3567",,,,,39,41,45,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We find that state mandates did not result in increased rates of cancer screening. However, coverage of preventive care, whether mandated or not, moves the cost of care from the consumer's out-of-pocket expense to the premium, resulting in a cross-subsidy of users of the service by non-users. While some cross-subsidies are intentional, others may be unintentional. We find that users of cancer screening have higher levels of income and education, while non-users tend to be racial minorities, lack a usual source of care, and live in communities with fewer physicians per capita. These results suggest that coverage of preventive care may transfer resources from more advantaged individuals to less advantaged individuals.","[Xu, Wendy Yi] Ohio State Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Serv Management & Policy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Dowd, Bryan; Abraham, Jean] Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Minneapolis, MN USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Xu, WY (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Serv Management & Policy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",xu.1636@osu.edu,,,,,,,51,4,7,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Since these schemes have been introduced recently and are continuously evolving, it is important to evaluate their effectiveness in the enhancement of health care utilization and reduction of out-of-pocket expenses for potential policy suggestions. Objective: To investigate how the National Health Insurance Schemes (NHIS) in Ghana affects the utilization of maternal health care services and medical out-of-pocket expenses. Methods: We used nationally-representative household data from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS). We analyzed the 2014 GDHS focusing on four outcome variables, i.e. antenatal check up, delivery in a health facility, delivery assisted by a trained person and out-of-pocket expenditure. We estimated probit and bivariate probit models to take into account the issue of self selection into the health insurance schemes. Results: The results suggest that, also taking into account the issue of self selection into the health insurance schemes, the NHIS enrollment positively affects the probability of formal antenatal check-ups before delivery, the probability of delivery in an institution and the probability of being assisted during delivery by a trained person. On the contrary, we find that, once the issue of self-selection is taken into account, the NHIS enrollment does not have a significant effect on out-of-pocket expenditure at the extensive margin. Conclusion: Since a greater utilization of health-care services has a strong positive effect on the current and future health status of women and their children, the health-care authorities in Ghana should make every effort to extend this coverage. In particular, since the results of the first step of the bivariate probit regressions suggest that the educational attainment of women is a strong determinant of enrollment, and those with low education and unable to read are less likely to enroll, information on the NHIS should be disseminated in ways that reach those with little or no education. Moreover, the availability of government health facilities in a region is associated with higher likelihood of enrollment in the NHIS. Accordingly, extending geographical access is an important strategy for expanding NHIS membership and improving access to health-care.","[Brugiavini, Agar; Pace, Noemi] Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Pace, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ca Foscari Venice, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",n.pace@unive.it,"Brugiavini, Agar/B-4988-2011",,,,,,29,52,58,1,9,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

The financial repression tax (as a share of GDP) is similar to OECD economies, in spite of higher debt ratios in the latter. The financial repression tax rate is higher in years of exchange controls and legislated interest rate ceilings. We document a link between domestic disequilibrium and a weakening of the net foreign asset position via private capital flight.

The super-innovative method of genetic algorithm is used to solve these problems since they are classified into NP-Hard problems. Encoding of this genetic algorithm is based on priority-centered encoding. In this method, the network nodes are developed according to their priority. Some types of problems are posed that are solved by means of genetic algorithm and mathematic programming problem solving software (LINGO) and then the results are compared. Moreover, this algorithm is shown to give acceptable answers and is therefore suitable for solving the problems in three-phase multi-product supply chain network. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The status quo of the presentation of fruit at the participating university canteens is analyzed, recommendations are given and interventions such as posters, an increased offer of fresh fruit desserts and a change in position of fruit bowls to the checkout area are being implemented by the canteen staff afterwards in order to increase fruit sales. Sales data from the checkout system is used to compare the sales of fruit and other desserts in relation to the daily amount of visitors. This pre- post comparison takes place during a four-week intervention period in 2014 and a four-week control period in 2013, as well as a second control period four weeks before the intervention period (control period 2014). While the amount of sold fruit options in relation to the number of overall visitors shall increase, the number of other dessert options in relation to the number of overall visitors should decrease. The experiment results show an increase in fruit sales and a decrease in sales of other desserts at eight out of eleven participating university canteens during the intervention period 2014 compared to the control period 2013. Comparing the intervention period 2014 to the control period 2014, the same result holds for seven out of eleven canteens. This study shows how small and cheap changes in fruit presentation and advertisement can improve fruit consumption and lower the consumption of less healthy dessert options.","[Bender, A.; Brandenburg, K. -W.; Reincke, K.; Bokelmann, W.] Humboldt Univ, Thaer Inst, Fac Life Sci, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Bender, A (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Thaer Inst, Fac Life Sci, Berlin, Germany.",,,,,,,,7,2,2,1,18,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62611-11-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2016,1132,,,,,,25,30,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1132.4,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7DM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391238400004,0

The evaluations in both areas are determined using a special model, which takes into consideration the position of the academic staff member and the performance standard that was set for this given position. A fuzzy rule base is then used to obtain the overall evaluation. An important feature of the described system is the use of the linguistic fuzzy modeling - the evaluations are presented in a verbal and also in a graphical form. Moreover, the evaluation results are provided on different levels of aggregation - from a brief overview to the detailed list of all activities performed by the particular academic staff member. The supervisors (e.g. heads of the department, or dean) are therefore given a powerful tool, which gives them the required information on their subordinates' performances in a comprehendible way, thus enabling them to make qualified decisions.

In specialty coffee, micro roasters have brought about Direct Trade coffee as a way of organising an alternative around new tastes and qualities through ongoing and 'direct' relations to farmers and cooperatives. But Direct Trade also involves exporters. We ask, how do exporters and roasters work together in these new coffee relations, and what do they work on? We observe and participate in a situation where Colombian coffee exporters visit Danish roasters. They tour the roasting facilities and taste a number of coffees. Often, the term power is used to analyse such value chain interactions, but we argue that the term coordination better opens up these interactions for exploration and analysis. What emerges is a coordination of quality. Through touring and tasting, issues emerge and differences are laid out. We learn that quality is a continuous achievement. There is friction between the ways in which the roasters and exporters do quality, but these are not done away with through power. They are made known and discussable through the work of coordination. The activity of tasting quality is a coordination device that allows for bringing out differences in how quality is done in practice. Coffee, in this event, is not a fixed object, but shifts as issues of quality are brought up in tasting. This suggests a decentering of the object on the issue of quality.","[Holland, Emil; Kjeldsen, Chris] Aarhus Univ, Dept Agroecol, Tjele, Denmark; [Kerndrup, Soren] Aalborg Univ, Dept Dev & Planning, Aalborg, Denmark",Aarhus University; Aalborg University,"Holland, E (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Agroecol, Tjele, Denmark.",emilholland@agro.au.dk,,"Kjeldsen, Chris/0000-0002-3100-8705",,,,,29,14,15,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

'Communications in Monetary Policy.' Speech presented at the Society of American Business Editors and Writers 50th Anniversary Conference, Washington, DC, April 4) recently noted, play a decisive role. Drawing on my field research in five central banks - the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Bundesbank, the Bank of England, the Riksbank, and the European Central Bank - I address how this regime, which I term a 'public currency', works in theory and practice and what is at stake in its regulation and management. At the heart of this regime is a far-reaching premise: the public must be broadly recruited to collaborate with central banks in achieving the ends of monetary policy, namely 'stable prices and confidence in the currency'. I further argue that monetary policy is now being aligned overtly with public interests, interests that are not fully or necessarily reducible to the prerogatives of finance or the interests of financial markets.","[Holmes, Douglas R.] SUNY Binghamton, Anthropol, Binghamton, NY USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Holmes, DR (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Anthropol, Binghamton, NY USA.",,,,,,,,76,5,5,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

At the same time it is precisely part of the nucleus of human rights to protect the individual from heteronomy, respectively from abuse of power by a collective. In other words, human rights protect all the powerless from the powerful. Human beings enjoy human rights as individuals, independent of any collective. However, human rights struggle also with the particular interests of states and non-state actors. Furthermore, from a human rights perspective, there is a necessity to respect the autonomy of an individual in order to remain coherent with the core concept of human rights. This necessity to respect the autonomy of an individual goes as far as that human rights themselves need a moral justification because autonomy entails knowing why one's freedom should be restricted by somebody or something. Therefore the questions arise if and how this aspect could be combined with the above-mentioned argumentation that the end would justify the means, and if and how nudging could be justified. In the following paper these issues will be addressed and it will be attempted to develop a solution to the question as to what extent the state should protect human beings from themselves.","[Kirchschlaeger, Peter G.] Univ Lucerne, Yale Univ, Fac Theol, Frohburgstr, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland",University of Lucerne,"Kirchschlaeger, PG (通讯作者)，Univ Lucerne, Yale Univ, Fac Theol, Frohburgstr, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland.",peter.kirchschlaeger@unilu.ch,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,978-3-319-29562-6; 978-3-319-29560-2,ECON ANAL LAW EUR,,,2016,,,,,,,59,67,,10.1007/978-3-319-29562-6_5,0.0,,,9,Economics; Ethics; Law; Sociology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Sociology,BG6NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390674500006,0

To provide specific implications, Kang et al. (2015) model with respect to Balanced Scorecard technique is conceptually extended. Theoretical foundation of the moderating, mediating, and their major distinctions along with appropriate statistical tests applicable to each situation are also provided. The model is also extended to analyzing interaction effects of Mediated-Moderation and Moderated-Mediation designs and their testing. The article concludes that: 1) the nature of complex business problems will be more transparently captured by considering moderating and mediating variables, 2) without specifying moderating and mediating variables, business models are incomplete and therefore are not able to solve real business obstacles. Lack of inclusion of moderating and mediating effects is one viable reason which indicates why most business models do not function in real practice, 3) moderating and mediating variables are widening the scope of the prevalent business theories, and 4) moderating and moderating variables makes it possible to respond to the inquiries regarding when how and why a particular relationship exists between the independent and dependent variables. Hence, this study posits great impacts in future correlational and experimental studies in business. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The article helps to understand the relations between these internal structures and offers insights how to approach different segments of young people in order to promote positive attitude towards immigration.","[Vokounova, Dana; Kopanicova, Janka] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dept Mkt, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Vokounová, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dept Mkt, Bratislava, Slovakia.",vokoun@euba.sk; jkopanicova@gmail.com,"Kopanicova, Janka/AAC-9447-2021; Kopanicova, Janka/ABD-7049-2021",,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2145-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,347,355,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BG7GX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391263100032,0

A structural break test detected several breaks, including the Fukushima disaster, and successfully eliminated the impact of the other shocks identified in our analysis. A system of demand equation models, which take into account the structural breaks, indicated that the spills had a significantly negative impact on the demand for cod. Our results suggest that the amount of radiation detected in cod products negatively affected Japanese demand for cod and positively affected demand for pollock, but did not affect their prices. In addition, we found that consumers' current concerns about radioactive spills positively affect cod and pollock markets. We concluded that radioactive spills harm the markets, but the impact is negligible.","[Wakamatsu, Hiroki; Miyata, Tsutomu] Fisheries Res Agcy, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 2368648, Japan",Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA),"Wakamatsu, H (通讯作者)，Fisheries Res Agcy, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, 2-12-4 Fukuura, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 2368648, Japan.",hwakamatsu@affrc.go.jp; tmiyata@affrc.go.jp,,,,,,,47,14,15,3,27,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

In the article have been used desk research analysis and analysis of statistical data on the number of cases referred to administrative courts and common courts and the number of cases referred to mediation. The results of the study confirm that mediation is much cheaper and cost-efficient compared to the dispute resolved by a court. Although mediation often provides a speedy resolution to a specific dispute, the level of use of mediation both in administrative and common courts is low. The number of cases referred to mediation does not exceed even 1% of all cases considered by the Polish courts. It becomes apparent that mediation is not utilized as much as traditional adjudicative processes.","[Wojcicka, Ewa] Jan Dlugosz Univ Czestochowa, Inst Law Adm & Management, Zbierskiego 2-4, PL-42200 Czestochowa, Poland",Jan Dlugosz University,"Wójcicka, E (通讯作者)，Jan Dlugosz Univ Czestochowa, Inst Law Adm & Management, Zbierskiego 2-4, PL-42200 Czestochowa, Poland.",e.wojcicka@ajd.czest.pl,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,2,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

We sought to gauge the public's acceptance levels of different reforestation strategies, and explore which factors seem to be associated with people's willingness to accept different forms of human and technological intervention in forest management. To do so, a public survey was administered in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada to assess acceptance of different forest adaptation strategies that could be employed to adapt to a changing climate, and explore variables identified from the literature as potentially affecting public decisions on biotechnology and assisted migration. A logistic regression was used to determine the degree to which variables identified in the literature are associated with levels of acceptance of different forest management strategies. What emerged was an explanatory model that can be used as a starting point to further engage the public in a discussion over appropriate and acceptable technologies and policies to help forests adapt to a changing climate.

The state imposes a minimum guaranteed return for investments and requires that companies hold assets as reserves to cover that guarantee. This requirement generates a herding behavior among companies. We simulate scenarios for pension fund administrators that deviate from the norm in their investment strategies.

For each publication, information on several core metrics was gathered, for example: (i) year of publication, (ii) number of authors, (iii) author affiliation, (iv) gender and role, (v) journal title, (vi) citation count and (vii) keywords. Temporal and spatial trends were analysed to detect periods of heightened activity and geographical focus. Using a systematic and comprehensive approach we identified 85 papers published in peer-reviewed journals between 1935 and 2014. Research output during WWII and 1990 onwards corresponds with the implementation of provincial policy and programs initiated for conservation, economic development, and to resolve social unrest. Notably, most papers analysed originated from social science research, particularly geography, and not forestry or the biophysical sciences presenting a clear disciplinary gap. Findings portray the temporal, spatial, and thematic evolution of community forestry research and policy in Canada. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In the twentieth century, commons in some of these countries experienced the process of abolishing traditional management institutions and nationalising their property. During the transitional period in the 1990s, one third of former agrarian commons were re-established and restituted in Slovenia. In this paper, we evaluate the response of three different types of agrarian commons (forest, pasture and agriculture commons) from three different landscapes (Alps, Pannonia and Mediterranean) in the context of the legal framework in which the commons were restituted. We use the upgraded version of Ostrom's design principles to evaluate the ability of the legal framework to enable the robustness of these historical institutions. It is not the first time that governments misunderstood commons and tried to impose rules which are not common to the commons. In the case of Slovenian agrarian commons, we found that the legal framework is too rigid for re-established agrarian commons and thus affects their efficiency in resource governance. Without changes in the legal framework, the present situation can lead to the decay of these historical institutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, based on a wide range of other medical indicators, such favorable responses appear to paint an overly rosy picture of true health. The hypothesis here is that these middle responses have been, in some sense, inflated. That is, for whatever reason, a significant number of responders inaccurately report into these categories. Our results do indeed suggest that such inflation is present in these categories.

It argues that sexual harassment is fostered both by coercive labour conditions within global value chains and by existing hierarchical gender relations. The research finds that harassment is widespread, that many lack a vocabulary to describe or discuss this, and that female casual and temporary workers are most likely to be targeted. Action research coupled with organisation of workers, however, has been effective in giving voice' to those suffering harassment: this is a first step in a feminist labour mobilisation and policy formulation. Procedures against sexual harassment are beginning to be formulated: a key concern is implementation. Addressing sexual harassment is central in ensuring the security of working people, particularly the most marginalised.","[Jacobs, Susie] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester M15 6LL, Lancs, England; [Brahic, Benedicte] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Sociol, Manchester M15 6LL, Lancs, England; [Olaiya, Marta Medusa] Women Working Worldwide, Manchester, Lancs, England",Manchester Metropolitan University; Manchester Metropolitan University,"Jacobs, S (通讯作者)，Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Sociol, Manton Bldg,Rosamund St West,,Oxford Rd, Manchester M15 6LL, Lancs, England.",s.jacobs@mmu.ac.uk,,"Brahic, Benedicte/0000-0001-9678-8928; Jacobs, Susie (Susan)/0000-0002-5435-3421","HIVOS (Humanistisch Instituut voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking): International Humanist Institute for Cooperation with Developing Countries, the Hague, the Netherlands","HIVOS (Humanistisch Instituut voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking): International Humanist Institute for Cooperation with Developing Countries, the Hague, the Netherlands","HIVOS (Humanistisch Instituut voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking): International Humanist Institute for Cooperation with Developing Countries, the Hague, the Netherlands.",,56,14,15,0,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

We examine the role of bidder CEOs' hubris over merger synergies on cost stickiness in the rapidly growing Korean market. Bidder CEOs who overestimate the merged firm's growth retain more underutilized-capacity when sales decrease than do CEOs of stand-alone firms. Optimistic bidder CEOs induce greater cost stickiness through strong and irrational self-beliefs than do optimistic nonbidder CEOs. Given the learning and self-attribution effect, optimistic bidder CEOs who experience more successful operating synergies induce stickier costs than less successful CEOs with simply optimistic views.

All of these aspects were considered and applied to teak plantations in Colombia, an emergent economy where high forest productivity, low opportunity cost of land, and decreased financial/economic risk have substantially contributed to promote forest investments. The von Bertalanffy non-linear mixed effect model was used to estimate forest yields using data collected from 31 permanent sample plots, measured over a 17 year period. A stochastic version of LEV along with other financial criteria was calculated by using a computer algorithm and Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, probabilities obtained from stochastic financial calculations were used in logistic models to estimate probabilities of success for a forest plantation project, a measure of risk assessment, after changing land prices. Results suggest that the potential forest productivity (i.e., the biological asymptote) ranges from 93 to 372 m(3) ha(-1). The mean annual increment is 27.8m(3) ha(-1) year(-1), which is attained 6 years after the forest plantation is established. Profitability analyses for teak plantations in Colombia suggest a LEV of US$7000 ha(-1). The risk analyses indicate negligible financial risk for forestlands whose prices are lower than US$2000 ha(-1). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, there have been some spectacular fisheries collapses.With a growing world population, the need for increased food supply from fish is clear. It must come from aquaculture, which has expanded despite stagnating production of fish meal. It is argued that fish meal production is no threat to wild fish stocks, nor does it come at the expense of fewer fish available for direct human consumption.Non-market valuation of fish as wildlife is criticized as having a built-in preservation bias.

There is a significant difference in maths test scores in favour of boys, similar to that previously observed in developed countries. This difference cannot be explained by gender differences in school quality, home environment, or within-school gender discrimination in access to schooling inputs. However, the gender gap varies widely with characteristics of the regions in which the pupils live, and these regional characteristics are more predictive of the gender gap than parental education and school characteristics, including teacher gender. At the cross-country level, differences in fertility rates account for nearly half the variation in the gender gap, and this relationship is not due to the correlation between fertility and GDP.

Although numerous studies have documented positive socioeconomic impacts for seaweed farming, factors such as diseases and distance to export markets have led to an uneven development of the industry. Using standard budgeting techniques, this study adapted production and market data from a FAO-led global review of seaweed farming to develop comparative enterprise budgets for eight farming systems in six countries (Indonesia, the Philippines, Tanzania, India, Solomon Islands, and Mexico). Although the basic technology package is the same across countries, the study revealed large differences in the economic performance of systems due to wide variations in farm prices and the scale of operations. Although seaweed farming is a suitable activity for small-scale producers, a minimum of 2,000m of cultures lines are still necessary to ensure adequate economic returns. Greater farming plots may be needed if farm prices are well below the average farm prices paid in Indonesia and the Philippines.

Bringing together the literatures on political alienation, redistribution preferences and insider-outsider politics, we identify three mechanisms by which labour market disadvantages influence voting behaviour. Disadvantages can increase support for redistribution, reduce internal political efficacy or lower external political efficacy. This translates into support for pro-redistribution parties, vote abstention or support for protest parties. Using the Dutch LISS survey, we observe a twin effect of increased support for redistribution and decreased external efficacy. Mediated through redistributive preferences, we find a positive effect of labour market disadvantage on voting for left parties. Mediated through external efficacy we find a positive effect of labour market disadvantage on protest voting. In contrast, we do not find any effect of labour market disadvantage on internal efficacy. Hence, the observed effect of labour market disadvantage on political abstention is entirely mediated by external efficacy.","[Emmenegger, Patrick; Schraff, Dominik] Univ St Gallen, Dept Polit Sci, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Marx, Paul] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Polit Sci, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark",University of St Gallen; University of Southern Denmark,"Schraff, D (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Dept Polit Sci, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",dominik.schraff@unisg.ch,"Schraff, Dominik/I-4939-2019","Schraff, Dominik/0000-0003-3386-1352; Marx, Paul/0000-0003-4310-9228",Carlsberg Foundation [2012_01_0494],Carlsberg Foundation(Carlsberg Foundation),"Earlier versions of this paper were presented at the Council for European Studies Annual Conference 2014 and the Political Research Seminar at the University of Zurich.

J,"Shmueli, A",,,,"Shmueli, Amir",,,On the calculation of the Israeli risk adjustment rates,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Risk adjustment; National health insurance; Risk selection; Israel,SELECTION,"The Israeli risk adjustment formula, introduced in 1995 and which serves for the allocation of the health budget to the sickness funds, is unique compared to countries with a similar national health insurance system in that it is not calculated on the basis of actual cost data of the sickness funds but on the basis of quantities retrieved from surveys. The current article aims to analyze the implications of the Israeli methodology. The article examines the validity of the Israeli methodology used to set the 2004 risk adjustment rates and compare these rates with the correct ones, which are derived from the 2004 internal relative cost scales of the sickness funds. The Israeli methodology ignores services provided by the sickness funds and assumes constant unit cost across the sickness funds, an assumption which is implausible. Comparing the actual and the correct rates, it turns out that the actual rates over-compensate all the sickness funds for members in age 0-14, and under-compensate them for insurees aged 55+. In age 0-4, the over-compensation per capita is about NIS 1,500 while the under-compensation in age group 75+ reaches NIS 1,600. The current risk adjustment formula distorts the intended competition on good quality care among the sickness funds, and turns it into a competition on profitable members. After 18 years of using incorrect rates, the Israeli risk adjustment rates should be calculated, as is common in other systems, based on individual cost data from the sickness funds.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Hadassah Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Management & Econ, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Shmueli, A (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Hadassah Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Management & Econ, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel.",amirsh@ekmd.huji.ac.il,,,,,,,11,5,5,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This has led to controversial regulatory attempts to curb defaults by holding colleges, particularly those in the for-profit sector, increasingly accountable for the student loan repayment behavior of their students. Such efforts endeavor to protect taxpayers against the misuse of public money used to encourage college enrollment and to safeguard students against potentially risky human capital investments. Recent policy proposals penalize colleges for students' poor repayment performance, raising questions about institutions' power to influence this behavior. Many of the schools at risk of not meeting student loan default measures also disproportionately enroll low-income, nontraditional, and financially independent students.

When comparing the results of meta-analyses with those of later large trials or with those of large trials removed from the meta-analyses, discrepancies were reported. This paper addresses two issues: (1) how measures of the uncertainty in cost-effectiveness, i.e., cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs), and the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) are affected by the limited validity of small trials and (2) how to deal with this bias. To this end, the paper adopts a Bayesian approach. Using empirical estimates for the validity of small RCTs compared to larger RCTs, the probability of cost-effectiveness drops by almost 10 %, while the EVPI is three times higher. In conclusion, traditional CEACs and EVPI analyses based on (small) RCTs may need careful appraisal. Ignoring prior evidence on the validity of small-size trials leads to an underestimation of uncertainty in cost-effectiveness. For future economic analyses, it is important to incorporate aspects of uncertainty which are caused by flawed data on effectiveness .","[Mueller, Dirk] Univ Hosp Cologne, Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, D-50935 Cologne, Germany; [Mueller, Dirk] Univ Cologne, Dept Business Adm & Hlth Care Management, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Pullenayegum, Eleanor] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Gandjour, Afschin] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Cologne; University of Cologne; McMaster University; Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Müller, D (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Cologne, Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Gleueler Str 176-178, D-50935 Cologne, Germany.",dirk.mueller@uk-koeln.de,"Gandjour, Afschin/I-8963-2019; Pullenayegum, Eleanor/AAT-1712-2020","Pullenayegum, Eleanor/0000-0003-4265-1330",,,,,40,1,1,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

It finds that prejudice against homosexuals negatively affects the relative employment and relative earnings of gay men.

This article investigates causal and price transmission relationships between wholesale and retail prices for five fish species in Bangladesh that include: hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha), rohu (Labeo rohita), catla (Catla catla), pangas (Pangasius hypophthalmus), and tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus/O. niloticus). Causal relationships between wholesale and retail prices were tested using the Granger causality test while asymmetries in price transmission were examined using the Houck and Ward approach as well as the error-correction approach. The results show that the direction of causality in prices was from retail to wholesale in many of the value chains analyzed, indicating influence of retail price on wholesale price in the Bangladesh fish sector. In general, the price transmission was found to be symmetric in the short-run while a mix of symmetric and asymmetric in the long-run. The results also show variation in price transmission behavior between aquaculture and capture fisheries products. The retailers of aquaculture products, compared to their fisheries counterparts, are less likely to be in a position to easily pass through falling prices to wholesalers and farmers. For aquaculture products, elasticities of price transmission from retailer to wholesaler were generally greater from increases in price than from decreases in price.","[Sapkota, Pratikshya] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Dey, Madan M.] Univ Arkansas Pine Bluff, Aquaculture Fisheries Ctr, Pine Bluff, AR 71601 USA; [Alam, Md.

Charge material is transported from the base tanks to robotic centers by trolleys with built-in tanks. Ready products (e.g. engine blocks) are moved to the storing area located next to the adequate centre. Customers' orders are to be made at optimized costs in time.

To explore this issue, we compared the costs generated by different types of medical practice in French general medicine: i.e. conventional (CM-GP), homeopathic (Ho-GP), or mixed (Mx-GP). Data from a previous cross-sectional study, EPI3 La-Ser, were used. Three types of cost were analysed: (i) consultation cost (ii) prescription cost and (iii) total cost (consultation + prescription). Each was evaluated as: (i) the cost to Social Security (ii) the remaining cost (to the patient and/or supplementary health insurance); and (iii) health expenditure (combination of the two costs). With regard to Social Security, treatment by Ho-GPs was less costly (42.00 (sic) vs 65.25 (sic) for CM-GPs, 35 % less). Medical prescriptions were two-times more expensive for CM-GPs patients (48.68 (sic) vs 25.62 (sic)). For the supplementary health insurance and/or patient out-of-pocket costs, treatment by CM-GPs was less expensive due to the lower consultation costs (6.19 (sic) vs 11.20 (sic) for Ho-GPs) whereas the prescription cost was comparable between the Ho-GPs and the CM-GPs patients (15.87 (sic) vs 15.24 (sic) respectively) . The health expenditure cost was 20 % less for patients consulting Ho-GPs compared to CM-GPs (68.93 (sic) vs 86.63 (sic), respectively). The lower cost of medical prescriptions for Ho-GPs patients compared to CM-GPs patients (41.67 (sic) vs 63.72 (sic)) was offset by the higher consultation costs (27.08 (sic) vs 22.68 (sic) respectively). Ho-GPs prescribed fewer psychotropic drugs, antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In conclusions management of patients by homeopathic GPs may be less expensive from a global perspective and may represent an important interest to public health.","[Colas, Aurelie; Danno, Karine; Tabar, Cynthia] Labs Boiron, 2 Ave Ouest Lyonnais, F-69510 Messimy, France; [Ehreth, Jenifer] Laser Analyt & Conservatoire Natl Arts & Metiers, Paris, France; [Duru, Gerard] Cyklad Grp, Lyon, France",,"Danno, K (通讯作者)，Labs Boiron, 2 Ave Ouest Lyonnais, F-69510 Messimy, France.",karine.danno@boiron.fr,,,Laboratoires Boiron,Laboratoires Boiron,Laboratoires Boiron provided financial support for the analysis.,,26,6,9,0,15,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

We conclude that ingroup interpretations of intergroup interactions contribute to the lack of trust and ongoing reconstruction of distrust towards the other group. Constructions of group identities and group history reinforce differences between groups, shaping expectations about the behaviour of in-group and out-group members. In this process, seemingly unrelated past events and contextual changes were connected as uncontested arguments as to why the other group could not be trusted. The lack of trust and growing distrust stabilised group dynamics and thus distrust towards the other group. These inter- and in-group dynamics explain why adapting to major environmental changes, and future collaboration becomes more difficult in conflict situations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

While extreme poverty can be measured in different ways, hunger is certainly one of its cruellest manifestations. The first MDG set the target of halving the proportion of people who suffer from hunger between 1990 and 2015 and the SDG's headline target is the ending of hunger by 2030. This article attempts to look back at the role European Union (EU)'s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) may have played towards the MDG target and to look forward at the role it might play towards the SDG target, investigating, in particular, whether or not the recent focus on policy coherence for development at the EU level is likely to position the CAP as a force for good for the attainment of SDGs.","[Desta, Melaku Geboye] De Montfort Univ, Int Econ Law, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England; [McMahon, Joseph A.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sutherland Sch Law, Commercial Law, Dublin, Ireland",De Montfort University; University College Dublin,"Desta, MG (通讯作者)，De Montfort Univ, Int Econ Law, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England.",,"McMahon, Joseph/D-8076-2018","McMahon, Joseph/0000-0001-6580-354X",,,,,95,3,3,0,25,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The paper aims at establishing a framework from 79 institutions undertaking forest research across thirteen Mediterranean countries for measuring their research capacities and the potential they reached to disseminate results and innovations in forest research. The methodology adopted makes use of common indicators thereby allowing comparisons across countries as regards the following: (i) research lines performed in forest research, (ii) budget generated by forest projects, (iii) overall full budget spent for forest research, (iv) number of forest projects implemented, (v) number of total researchers, permanent staff and non-permanent staff deployed in forest research, and (vi) ISI papers published in forest subjects. Forest research capacities have tentatively been clustered to find similarities or dissimilarities across countries, in order to identify possible partnerships to be reached and to highlight causal indicators that affected the clustering. The paper findings contribute to address how capacity for forest research in the Mediterranean area is developed and how to measure and evaluate the performances of research and innovation systems. They provided further contributions to existing debates in the literature in order to foster research collaboration in the forest sector, knowledge mobilization, innovation and proposals/policies for a common research framework in the European forest sector.

The aim of the paper is to investigate the situation related to the social risk families in Latvia - to identify problems these families are facing, and to evaluate support provided by the state and the local governments. Situation analysis is based on publicly available statistical data and 24 semi-structured in-depth interviews with heads of social service offices and social work specialists. The research shows that families at social risk are characterized by a variety of problems - poverty, alcohol abuse, violence, unemployment, poor housing and other. Most of the problems are related to poor basic skills or lack of them, also to lack of motivation to change. Support for social risk families is provided by the state and local governments but as research data show, there are obstacles to problem-solving, especially in rural areas - shortage of financial and human resources; inadequate inter-institutional cooperation and coordination of work; and the lack of preventive work. To improve work with social risk families it is essential to elaborate more responsive system of services for families with children, to establish more effective collaboration between professionals and to allocate additional financial resources.","[Dobelniece, Signe; Millere, Jolanta] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia; [Salmane-Kulikovska, Ieva] Riga Stradins Univ, Riga, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies; Riga Stradins University,"Dobelniece, S (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia.",Signe.Dobelniece@llu.lv,"Dobelniece, Signe/AAB-5820-2020; Millere, Jolanta/AAC-5653-2020","Dobelniece, Signe/0000-0001-8456-0440; Millere, Jolanta/0000-0003-4713-9512",,,,,9,3,3,0,2,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-190-6,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2015,,40.0,,,,,141,150,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BD3PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360010100014,0

It is shown that the estimated stochastic volatilities and jumps using the intraday SVJD model correspond more closely to their non-parametric estimates, constructed using power-variation estimators, then when a daily SVJD model is used. Most importantly, the number of identified jumps increases by an order of magnitude in the intraday SVJD model compared to the daily one. As an additional result it is found that the jumps with high Bayesian probability of occurrence do exhibit clustering while the ones with lower probabilities of occurrence do not.","[Ficura, Milan; Witzany, Jiri] Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Banking & Insurance, Winston Churchill Sq, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Ficura, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Banking & Insurance, Winston Churchill Sq, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",milan.ficura@vse.cz; jiri.witzany@vse.cz,"Ficura, Milan/AAL-6102-2020; Witzany, Jiri/ABF-4362-2020",,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2099-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BF0SP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379396100008,0

There are dynamic periodic and deterministic models with common feature being represented by instantaneous replenishment in constant time periods. First, we present models assuming another than constant rate of demand within an inventory cycle. The demand rate takes polynomial form which is specified by particular interpolation conditions. These conditions give a chance to include various intermediate data to describe inventory level during the cycle with particular details. Second, we assume the holding cost rate to be time dependent as well, though of the first algebraic degree basically. However, the generalization to higher degrees is quite straightforward. The results, in particular - optimal replenishment lot size and optimal total cost per unit of time, yielded from these models with different interpolation conditions are compared with similar quantities provided by classical EOQ model. Sensitivity analysis of optimal quantities upon selected interpolation parameters is presented, too. Procedure used for symbolic derivation of optimal order quantity is elaborated in detail, and hints for its computer implementation are presented, as well. We use Mathematica not only for numerical calculations but also for symbolic derivations of analytic formulae giving optimal quantities provided by all models discussed. Some code snippets are also presented and discussed thus enabling us to inspect a particular symbolic versatility and performance power of Mathematica.","[Hofman, Jiri; Lukas, Ladislav] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Husova 11, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Hofman, J (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Husova 11, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic.",hofman@kem.zcu.cz; lukasl@kem.zcu.cz,"Lukas, Ladislav/B-5818-2016",,,,,,6,2,2,0,1,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,249,254,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900043,0

The fundamental tool for evaluating the costs of the enterprise is costing, which is among other things of particular importance particularly for businesses selling their performance externally. Costing allows assessing the profitability performance, which is one of the basic prerequisites of the company's success. Selecting the type of costing is essential for obtaining relevant information on the costs of the company's products and services. A basic overview of the different costing approaches and their impact on the profitability of products and services as well as the overall impact on profit of the company was created, based on searches of professional resources. Using a questionnaire survey, data on the use of various types of calculations in business entities in the Czech Republic were obtained. The data were compared with results of comparable research conducted in 2008. This comparison was the basis for drawing conclusions whether enterprises accept modern methods of managing costs, or whether the enterprises still use mainly the absorption costing. On one hand, however, this costing includes all costs of the enterprise; on the other hand it can be considered not always a satisfactory and sufficient method that was used in the Czech Republic at the time, when creation of calculations and prices was under central control. Absorption costing has many limitations, its principal drawback is the static explanatory power it refers to a specific amount and structure of performances. When changing volume and range of performances it ceases to perform its function. From the perspective of the constantly changing market conditions, companies should rely on the use of not only this costing, which can be a source of getting distorted information about the costs of the enterprises and the profitability of the performances and can lead to incorrect decisions of the company management.","[Kafkova, Ruzena] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Kafková, R (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Liberec, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,533,540,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200069,0

It is a manager of an enterprise to decide whether he wants an entity to comply with the rules and how he wants a company to fulfill the standards. Managers cannot treat an entity as independent unit separate from other participants of free market economy and from society. Modern enterprises are important members of every society, which gives them privileges and creates obligations as well. The qualitative analysis included all 23 companies that were present in RESPECTIndex since 2011 till 2014. With regard to corporate social responsibility, actions described in reports were classified into one of four areas: business surroundings, employees, society and the natural environment. In summary, the analysis of reports published by RESPECTIndex companies shows that awareness of corporate social responsibility in Poland is increasing. Concessive arguments include diversity of actions' range and complexity of social responsible activities, as well as the quality of reports. It can be observed that the objectives and fulfillment criteria derived from corporate social responsibility idea are different from the objectives set by a business unit making rational decisions based on short-term profit. It is highly possible that different objectives constitute the biggest difficulty for business entities. In addition, a lack of unified measurement method relating to the level of goal achievement as well as difficulty in defining objectives in social responsibility activities were observed. Analysis of corporate social responsibility reports together with financial reports of modern Polish enterprises shows that obligation for economic effectiveness coexists with social responsibility of a business conduct. Changes in business surroundings has forced enterprises to widen the scope of their activities, pay more attention to company's culture and ethics, and to respect the rights of others.","[Kolodziej, Sabina] Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland; [Maruszewska, Ewa Wanda] Univ Econ, Katowice, Poland",Kozminski University; University of Economics in Katowice,"Kolodziej, S (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland.",,"Kołodziej, Sabina/AAF-6831-2021; Maruszewska, Ewa Wanda/A-3596-2014","Kołodziej, Sabina/0000-0002-7467-1048; Maruszewska, Ewa Wanda/0000-0003-0461-4133",,,,,9,4,4,1,3,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,161,167,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200021,0

In recent years, the social studies of finance have grown profoundly, enhancing our understanding of finance across disciplinary boundaries. However, the way in which global finance is practised by local stockbrokers in non-western financial markets has received minor attention. Even though the Mumbai financial market is comparatively small, it is an instructive case due to a transition of financial practices over the previous two decades. Despite these rapid changes, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the oldest exchange in India, and its 'traditional' brokers remain active and relatively influential. Drawing on present-day experiences as well as historical recollections of BSE stockbrokers, this article shows that global finance is not an unambiguous or predictable force, but instead negotiated and thus actively shaped by local stockbrokers.","[Lagerwaard, Pieter] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Lagerwaard, P (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Fac Social & Behav Sci, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",pieterlagerwaard@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,4,4,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The assessment is guided by an analytical framework that predicts the relevance and receptiveness of different timber supply chains to current systems of trade-based governance. We find that Brazil's efforts to control illegal deforestation through satellite monitoring have contributed significantly to reducing deforestation, but the effects on degradation are less clear. Efforts focused on the timber supply chain, including certification and legal verification of traded timber, have been limited by the fragmented nature of Amazonian wood production. Both certification and legality verification favor large producers and concentrated supply chains destined for external markets (e.g. pulp and paper and high-value tropical sawnwood), while extensive legal requirements inhibit local benefit-capture. In order to prevent the means of forest governance (i.e. certification and law enforcement) from trumping its commonly stated ends (sustainable forest management and local welfare), there is a need to prioritize the generation of local benefit from locally adapted production systems.

In particular, due to the default of user, several controversies may emerge in the absence of a specific doctrine, as it happens in the Italian legislation (see, e.g., Hull, 1982; Lease et al., 1990). In this paper, some of the most critical contractual issues arising in the Italian legislative context are considered that turn out to be on the border between law and financial calculus and that may, in certain circumstances, generate controversies especially in the evaluation of the customer's credits (Carretta, 2004; Peccati, 1986). Moreover, since the local Generally Accepted Accounting Principles request the company to account for the expected provisions for specific risks, the calculation and assessment of the components customer's credits are not only necessary for the precise quantification of the credit in judicial question, but also from the point of view of financial accounting and reporting (see, e.g., Van Horne, 2009). In this regard, it is hence proposed to carry out the valuation of a customer's credit using a financial model proposed by Peccati L. (1986), that suggests to split up the lump-sum credit in three components: outstanding debt, claim for damages and penalty. Therefore, the aim of the present paper is intended to stress the relation between the proposed financial model and the necessities of a clear and transparent accounting and reporting, and the opportunity to reduce the gap in assessments of the debt of early termination of instalment contracts.","[Migliavacca, Alessandro; Puddu, Luigi; Tibiletti, Luisa; Uberti, Mariacristina] Univ Turin, Dept Management, I-10124 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Migliavacca, A (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Management, I-10124 Turin, Italy.",,"Migliavacca, Alessandro/JNV-2995-2023; Tibiletti, Luisa/L-2030-2015; Uberti, Mariacristina/HGB-8734-2022","Migliavacca, Alessandro/0000-0002-9243-5102; Uberti, Mariacristina/0000-0002-4556-4630",,,,,9,1,1,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,89,95,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200012,0

The framework begins at the end: it distinguishes three distinct 'transdisciplinary outcome spaces' and proposes articulating their content for purposive transdisciplinary research projects. Defining upfront the desired improvements has profound implications for how transdisciplinary research is conceived, designed, implemented and evaluated. Three key realms of transdisciplinary outcome spaces are distinguished - situation, knowledge, and learning - and elaborated: (1) an improvement within the 'situation' or field of inquiry; (2) the generation of relevant stocks and flows of knowledge, including scholarly knowledge and other societal knowledge forms, and making those insights accessible and meaningful to researchers, participants and beneficiaries; and (3) mutual and transformational learning by researchers and research participants to increase the likelihood of persistent change. Positioning the framework in the field of transdisciplinary literature reveals that much of the contestation concerning transdisciplinary research and practice may be attributable to the diverse but implicit ontological and epistemological perspectives inhabited by transdisciplinary researchers, leading to a call for more reflexive and explicit attention to these and other formative influences (i.e. sources of funding, project motivation, or locus of power).

The essence of global education, as the new approach in the educational process, is to show especially to the young citizens how the world works and also the number of problems that trouble it today. Thanks to the increasing globalization these problems are becoming world wide and thus often affect each of us in a certain degree and certain intensity. Global education should also help people be oriented in these issues and perhaps be able to create own attitudes to them. In this respect global citizenship is acquiring a strong position as one of the fundamental pillars of global education. Just global citizenship should show people the citizenship from the different, new perspective. It should provide new information and knowledge to people about the modern world, about the problems that are being expanded over it, that the world is diversified and each diversity has its own place and importance. It should also bring every person to the understanding that he or she is also a part of global entity and so everyone should accept its place and role in it. Further to this knowledge and to the feeling of belonging to the world community people need to be educated. Therefore, the education for global citizenship should form an integral part of the educational process at all its levels in the contemporary society. Global citizenship does not represent a legally defined term, but the feeling, approach or attitude to the world and the form of choice and belief in change. Therefore, through the education for global citizenship particularly young people, as the future of planet, should be led to the feeling of belonging and to the feeling of global citizen. They should be also led to act as active global citizens, who also bear an adequate responsibility for their action. Beside the current interconnectedness and interdependency of the world the issue of global citizenship and education for global citizenship does not pass any area no more. Therefore, it cannot be missing in the educational process of future economists, and thus in the study programs with economic focus. The graduates of these specializations will operate on the new global market after their graduation in a big extent. For this purpose they must be prepared adequately. They must be necessarily acquainted with global problems, learn how the global market works and how it should work to make a better, fairer and more sustainable place from the world. They have to learn how to accept these facts, act according to them and even bear responsibility for their acting. However, it is important to find the right space for this new approach in the education. At the same time it is very important to choose appropriate methods for its implementation, that will give a sufficient information, knowledge and practical skills about the issue of global citizenship for students and so they will have the opportunity to choose the attitude of global citizen. Based on the analysis of the importance of global citizenship and exploration of the current state of society in our issue and on the basis of synthesis of the gained knowledge we will try to define the importance of this phenomenon in the education of future economic experts. Through this we will try to point out the necessity of the implementation of global citizenship dimension into the educational process for these students. At the same time we will try to find and specify the appropriate methods for the implementation of this educational approach into the existing subjects in the education of future economists. The result of this paper will be finding that the global dimension of education for citizenship and the education for global responsibility cannot be missing in the education of future economists today.","[Mravcova, Anna] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Social Sci, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Mravcova, A (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Social Sci, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",mravcova.anna@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,718,729,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800069,0

In connection with a climatic change and methods of management, time and spatial uniformity of its occurrence (which is very affected by the landscape retention capacity) it becomes a considerable problem. The significance of the landscape retention capacity consists in balancing runoff conditions and reducing dangerous culmination discharges causing otherwise disastrous impacts on population and the landscape. From the point of view of the landscape retention capacity the organization of land resources and using the landscape play an important role at storm rainfalls unlike long-term precipitation. The occurrence of storm floods caused by rainfalls of very high intensity, short term duration and limited extent show evidence of the urgency of changes in the structure, use and the landscape arrangement resulting in the support of infiltration and thus increasing the soil retention capacity. The aim of the analysis involved in the article is to define the significance of separate factors affecting the natural process of retention in the catchment basin thus can assess the priorities in undertaking flood protection. The analysis was based on results achieved by using a new method how to determine water retention in the catchment basin. Resulting dependent variables of effective long-time retention, effective short-time retention, effective total retention and maximum specific runoff for single catchment basins of the river, were evaluated statistically by means of linear regression and correlation analysis, stepwise regression and multiple regression. It is possible to say, that the results achieved may suggest to re-evaluate some established views concerning the role of separate factors influencing natural retention of the landscape.

There are two types of robustness - quality and solution robustness. Quality robustness is a property of a solution whose quality, measured by the objective function value, does not deviate much from optimality when small changes in the problem data occur. Solution robustness can then be described as robustness in the solution space. This paper focuses on quality robustness - analysis of optimal solution and calculating its stability interval using proposed approaches based on interval programming. Stability of solution is calculated according to the possible changes in objective function coefficients only.

It would be an ideal situation if economic growth would reflect a permanent, long-term predictable constant. However, the reality is not theory. In these turbulent times the rate of economic growth was far from constant. This trend concerns the global economy. As Romer ( 2012, p.6) said growth has been rising over most of modern history and average growth rate in the industrialized countries were higher in the twentieth century than in the nineteenth. An exception to this scheme of increasing growth is slowdown in productivity growth. The main aim presented in this article was the analysis of the economic growth of the Slovak Republic. We used a method called growth accounting. The first step of the analysis was to spread the overall rate of economic growth on the contribution of each production inputs - capital, labour and technological progress (total factor productivity). The second step was the calculation of TFP by dual approach using the price and the amount of the factors. Our calculation was based on the neoclassical Cobb-Douglas production function. Calculation of primal and dual TFP can by useful for comparison of development of economic growth in the countries. Our result should confirm or refute the hypothesis that although countries have achieved economic growth the productivity growth gradually slowed.","[Raisova, Manuela; Durcova, Julia; Bartokova, Ludmila] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Raisová, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",manuela.raisova@tuke.sk; julia.durcova@tuke.sk; ludmila.bartokova@tuke.sk,"Raisova, Manuela/AAG-1414-2019; Ďurčová, Júlia/AAH-4286-2019; Bartokova, Ludmila/AAA-7128-2020","Raisova, Manuela/0000-0003-3393-7492; Bartokova, Ludmila/0000-0001-8662-660X",VEGA [1/0892/13]; Ministry of Education's scheme,VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)); Ministry of Education's scheme,This paper was written in connection with scientific project VEGA no. 1/0892/13.

Brand building and healthy organizational culture are elements of a bilateral communication with all significant partners as well as with employees. Nowadays the competitive advantage is obtained thanks to the competent, involved and motivated staff that is managed by conscious and competent leaders. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how responsible leadership exists in a transitional country and region, and how responsible leadership contributes to Human Resource Management (HRM). Research methods were theoretical analysis of scientific literature and a direct survey (the instrument of data collection was questionnaires). The quantitative sample of analyzing contains 98 managers - representatives of companies located in Poland. The 24 components of responsible leadership were listed, and a seven-point Likert scale was employed to gather responses. The data was collected in January and February 2015. Data analysis was accomplished using IBM SPSS Statistics 21. In the paper, the notion of a responsible leadership has been analyzed in term of a connection with the company HR strategy. Then, in the empirical research, there have been conducted studies on how managers understand the responsible leadership and what is the influence of the responsible leadership on the company HR strategy? Studies on the responsible leadership are conducted primarily in large organizations, which have been functioning on the market for a long time. In Poland, the concept of responsible leadership began to appear only in times of political and economic transformation (after 1989), with the influx of foreign investment. In contrast to countries with about 100 years of experience in the implementation of the concept of responsible leadership, its Polish history is quite short.

Relationships between employees and management frequently are informal and personal, which results in a low degree of formalism and bureaucracy and enables SMEs to react to environmental changes rapidly. In spite of these virtues on a local level only a quarter of Germany's SMEs operate internationally. Only 16 % of SME turnover is from exports. In total German industry though earns more than 30 % from export goods. Concerning international engagement German SMEs hence dispose of further growth and turnover potential. Why are Germany's SMEs reluctant to go abroad? This paper intends to fill gaps in knowledge on German SME internationalization and explore the cause and effect chain of SME characteristics, SME internationalization modalities and internationalization success in more detail. Already this short but contradictory overview shows that the topic of SME internationalization has not been explored systematically so far-though diverse studies are available on this question, hardly any author discusses the topic comprehensively in an empirically founded model that brings cause and effect relationships together. While some studies on SMEs in Northern European or Anglo-Saxon economies have been published, studies on German SMEs' internationalization so far are virtually unavailable. The preparation of going international, internationalization strategies applied and possible impediments to internationalization so far have not been explored by SME type (for instance differentiating by branch, firm size or management experience) systematically. The impact of internationalization strategies or preparation for internationalization on the degree of internationalization and comparative competitive performance has partly been evaluated for large MNCs but widely is unknown for SMEs so far. For example, to what extent do SME characteristics (e.g. firm age, branch, size, leadership) determine internationalization preparation, strategy and possible impediments to internationalization? To what extent do parameters of internationalization preparation, strategy and possible impediments to internationalization determine the degree of SME internationalization success and performance? To what extent does the degree of SME internationalization determine SMEs' competitive performance? To answer these research questions the paper conducts a systematic review of previous studies on SME internationalization strategies, impediments and success and derives categories to assess the cause and effect relationships of SME internationalization systematically. These considerations result in a causal research model, which will be argued and detailed as to its indicators in the course of the paper. Model hypotheses to be tested by multiple regression modelling are derived from previous empirical research in the course of the paper. To test this model the study relies on an empirical survey among 167 German SMEs. It applies exploratory factor analysis to assign adequate items to the parameters and develops a multiple regression model to test the relevance of the indicators of the model parameters on the assumed causal relationships.","[Ubreziova, Iveta; Hotzinger, Felix Franz] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Ubreziova, I (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Nitra, Slovakia.",iveta.ubreziova@uniag.sk,"Ubreziova, Iveta/AAJ-8669-2020",,,,,,29,1,1,0,13,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,1127,1139,,,,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800110,0

According to FAO (2009), food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. As Frankenberg, T. R. et. al (1997) claim, nutrition security exists when the person has a nutritionally adequate diet and the food consumed is biologically utilized. Nutrition requirements are different and mostly depend on society and household income. Meanwhile, a large number of empirical studies have been devoted to analyze consumer demand for food and demand for food diversity. It is believed that income is a relevant variable of consumer choice that explains the differences in consumption behaviour. In general, people with lower income have tendency to consume more fatty food and their nutrition is not diversified enough. Therefore, in this paper we will focus on consumption of macronutrients - proteins, carbohydrates and lipids in the Slovak republic. The attention will be paid to nutrition intakes of Slovak population and their evaluation from the point of food and nutrition security. Using data from Household budget survey from Slovak statistical office for years 2011 - 2014, we construct econometric model to analyse, which factors affect consumption of macronutrients. The regression analysis with dependent variables (income; family size; education, type of municipality and amount of children) is applied to analyse individual nutrition behaviour. Our analysis is not take into account age of individual household members. According to survey of Di Giuseppe, S. (2011), macroeconomic development also affects purchasing power and consumption. Due to this assertion we extend our analysis to macroeconomic indicators, such as GDP per capita and unemployment rate in selecte regions. Slovakia is divided into 8 regions (region of Bratislava; Trnava; Trencin; Zilina; Nitra; Banska Bystrica; Presov; Kosice). We assume that the existing differences between them, e. g. in transport infrastructure, education, GDP, incomes, employment, etc., affect consumer behaviour. Finally, the Berry index is used to evaluate food diversity in selected regions during the observed period. We tried to prove that there are differences in food diversity between lower income households and higher income households. Moreover, it is assumed that lower income households do not have diversified diet, resp. their diet is not sufficiently diversified. Our results are shown in tables and figures in this paper. To summarize, in our paper is analysed the development of macronutrient consumption of Slovak population, as well as identified the factors having impact on demand for macronutrients.","[Vargova, Ivana; Purma, Marcel; Pokrivcak, Jan] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Vargová, I (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Nitra, Slovakia.",xvargovai@is.uniag.sk,"Pokrivcak, Jan/O-4941-2014",,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,1140,1150,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800111,0

The goal of our paper is not to model the orders duration but to model the flow of the underlying financial news stream which courses the informative investors to take or change their trading positions in the order book. This way we can better understand phenomena like abnormal market volatility in reaction to the financial news publishing. Our research is based on the millisecond time stamped news related to Warsaw Stock Exchange WIG-20 index constitutes.

Although the discussion on the economic role of forests has been carried out for decades in mature market economies, there is scarce evidence based on data from emerging markets that were subject to a post-socialist transition. Another reason to undertake the study is the strong belief that new econometric tools (mainly spatial hedonic regression) can lead to more robust understanding of the influence of forest proximity on property values. We found strong evidence of a positive impact of forest proximity on undeveloped property transaction prices, although the importance of this variable is considerably smaller than that of other factors controlled for.

However, standard HIAs do not consider that chronic diseases (CDs) can be both caused and exacerbated by a common factor, and generally focus on exacerbations. As an illustration, exposure to near road traffic-related pollution (NRTP) may affect the onset of CDs, and general ambient or urban background air pollution (BP) may exacerbate these CDs. We propose a comprehensive HIA that explicitly accounts for both the acute effects and the long-term effects, making it possible to compute the overall burden of disease attributable to air pollution. A case study applies the two HIA methods to two CDs-asthma in children and coronary heart disease (CHD) in adults over 65-for ten European cities, totaling 1.89 million 0-17-year-old children and 1.85 million adults aged 65 and over. We compare the current health effects with those that might, hypothetically, be obtained if exposure to NRTP was equally low for those living close to busy roads as it is for those living farther away, and if annual mean concentrations of both PM10 and NO2-taken as markers of general urban air pollution-were no higher than 20 mu g/m(3).

During the first twenty-five years of its existence, this framework, however, remained overall vague, ambiguous, and largely ineffective. It was not until 2003, amidst a surge of regional trade agreements in East Asia and elsewhere that ASEAN Members undertook a consolidated effort to establish a more modern and cohesive legal integration framework on which to build an 'ASEAN Economic Community' (AEC). The ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATiGA), adopted in February 2009 and effective as of May 2010, is the centerpiece of the AEC. This article assesses the scope, depth, and legal mechanisms for trade in goods integration under ATiGA, while highlighting key differences compared to ASEAN's prior trade integration framework under the 1992 'Common Effective Preferential Tariff' scheme.","[Tevini, Anna G.] Shearman & Sterling LLP, Int Arbitrat Grp, New York, NY 10022 USA; [Tevini, Anna G.] Inst Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore, Singapore; [Tevini, Anna G.] Asian Affairs Comm New York City Bar, New York, NY 10036 USA",,"Tevini, AG (通讯作者)，Shearman & Sterling LLP, Int Arbitrat Grp, New York, NY 10022 USA.;Tevini, AG (通讯作者)，Asian Affairs Comm New York City Bar, New York, NY 10036 USA.",anna.tevini@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,8,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Ostrom theorizes that the commons often prevent resource exhaustion more effectively than the state, international institutions, or private owners. However, one of the foundations of commons, as an alternative program to the private/state dualism, ought to be the principle of equality that includes a gender perspective in theory and practice. The goal of this article is to provide thoughtful ways of incorporating gender in economic research from the viewpoint of feminist epistemology and to indicate the place of gender in Ostrom's work. The methodology of this study could be used for reading economic publications through a gender perspective as well as for inspiring economists to use both gender as a category of analysis and gender-sensitive language in their theoretical and empirical studies.","[Lapniewska, Zofia] Humboldt Univ, Res Training Grp Gender Category Knowledge, Ctr Transdisciplinary Gender Studies, Georgenstr 47, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Lapniewska, Z (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Res Training Grp Gender Category Knowledge, Ctr Transdisciplinary Gender Studies, Georgenstr 47, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",zofia.lapniewska@uj.edu.pl,"Łapniewska, Zofia/N-9230-2019; Łapniewska, Zofia/CAG-9393-2022","Łapniewska, Zofia/0000-0003-0002-5323; Łapniewska, Zofia/0000-0003-0002-5323",Fritz Thyssen Foundation [Az.40.13.0.008],Fritz Thyssen Foundation,"The Stipend of the Fritz Thyssen Foundation for the research on which this paper is based is gratefully acknowledged [grant number Az.40.13.0.008].

Our objective is to estimate UK values for SF-6D states using the original data and multi-attribute utility (MAU) regression after addressing its limitations and to compare the revised SF-6D and EQ-5D value predictions. Using the unaltered data (611 respondents, 3503 SG responses), the parameters of the original MAU model were re-estimated under three alternative error specifications, known as the instant, episodic, and angular random utility models. Value predictions on a QALY scale were compared to EQ-5D3L predictions using the 1996 Health Survey for England. Contrary to the original results, the revised SF-6D value predictions range below 0 QALYs (i.e., worse than death) and agree largely with EQ-5D predictions after adjusting for scale. Although a QALY is defined as a year in optimal health, the SF-6D sets a higher standard for optimal health than the EQ-5D-3L; therefore, it has larger units on a QALY scale by construction (20.9 % more). Much of the debate in health valuation has focused on differences between preference elicitation tasks, sampling, and instruments. After correcting errant econometric practices and adjusting for differences in QALY scale between the EQ-5D and SF-6D values, the revised predictions demonstrate convergent validity, making them more suitable for UK economic evaluations compared to original estimates.","[Craig, Benjamin M.] H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Hlth Outcomes & Behav Program, MRC CANCONT, 12902 Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Craig, Benjamin M.] Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, Tampa, FL 33620 USA",H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Craig, BM (通讯作者)，H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Hlth Outcomes & Behav Program, MRC CANCONT, 12902 Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL 33612 USA.;Craig, BM (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",benjamin.craig@moffitt.org,,"Craig, Benjamin Matthew/0000-0003-1121-1316","National Institutes of Health (NIH) Infrastructure grant, Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research'' [RC2-CA148332]; Dr. Craig's National Cancer Institute (NCI) Career Development Award [K25 -CA122176]","National Institutes of Health (NIH) Infrastructure grant, Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research''; Dr. Craig's National Cancer Institute (NCI) Career Development Award","Funding support for this research was provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Infrastructure grant, Developing Information Infrastructure Focused on Cancer Comparative Effectiveness Research'' (RC2-CA148332; PI: Fenstermacher); and Dr. Craig's National Cancer Institute (NCI) Career Development Award (K25 -CA122176).",,31,3,4,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

These changes in the intergenerational transmission process are economically significant, and stronger for boys than for girls.

However, the evidence to back these arguments remains mixed and inconclusive. In this study, we define and measure precarious work in Finland using five variables that reflect both objective and subjective insecurity: atypical employment, actually experienced unemployment, the threat of dismissal or unemployment, poor chances of finding a new job, and low earnings. Results based on Statistics Finland's Quality of Work Life Surveys from 1984 to 2013 indicate that, from a labour market or forms of employment perspective, the proportion of precarious wage earners has increased from 11% in 1984 to 13% in 2013. From a second perspective, however, focusing on changing working conditions, growing inequality and eroding social security mechanisms, we also analyse how a precarious labour market position is related to intrinsic job quality. Precarious workers experience decreased levels of skill and discretion, and they work in a less supportive environment than other employees.","[Pyoria, Pasi; Ojala, Satu] Univ Tampere, Sch Social Sci & Humanities, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland",Tampere University,"Pyöriä, P (通讯作者)，Univ Tampere, Sch Social Sci & Humanities, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland.",pasi.pyoria@uta.fi,"Pyöriä, Pasi/AAP-1741-2020","Pyöriä, Pasi/0000-0003-2913-585X; Ojala, Satu/0000-0003-3239-967X",Finnish Work Environment Fund [114326]; Academy of Finland [277376]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [277376] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Finnish Work Environment Fund; Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA),The financial support of the Finnish Work Environment Fund (114326) and the Academy of Finland (277376) is gratefully acknowledged.,,45,20,21,0,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Ports can be severely affected by these changes; therefore, ports need insight into how the system might change and what the impact of this will be on their competitive position. Given the intrinsic complexity of the container transport system and the presence of a wide range of deeply uncertain factors affecting the system, we use an exploratory modeling approach to study future scenarios for the global container network. Using scenario discovery and worst-case discovery, we assess the implications of various uncertain factors on the competitive position of the port of Rotterdam. It is found that overall the competitive position of Rotterdam is quite robust with respect to the various uncertain factors. The main vulnerability is the quality of the hinterland connections. A modest deterioration of the quality of the hinterland connections, resulting in increased travel time, will result in a loss of throughput for Rotterdam. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous research posits that consumers' goals change as their feelings change, but the question of how these feelings change remains unanswered. Drawing on 27 months of fieldwork observing interactions between real estate agents and homebuyers, this article elaborates three processes by which market intermediaries evoke emotions from buyers: individualized matching, sequencing and highlighting market scarcity. These observations reveal how individual preference and consumption decisions are subject to situational structuring by market intermediaries. Furthermore, this article argues that sales transactions present scholars with untapped opportunities to understand how emotions impact economic transactions, as well as the crucial role that intermediaries play in creating and sustaining these emotions.","[Besbris, Max] NYU, Dept Sociol, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Besbris, M (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Sociol, New York, NY 10003 USA.",mbesbris@nyu.edu,,,,,,,73,40,50,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Considerable progress has been made since, with the official launch of CFTA negotiations last June. A major prerogative for the realization of a CFTA is that fifty-four African States make concessions for the common benefit of liberalized trade. This paper therefore critically looks at what is being considered in the negotiations of a CFTA in terms of objectives, scope, disciplines and timelines. It also contemplates critical elements of operability and functionality of a future CFTA agreement and proposes key elements that may give content and help realize a prospective CFTA which can deliver on the promise of greater intra-African trade.","[Paez, Laura] United Nations Conf Trade & Dev UNCTAD, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Páez, L (通讯作者)，United Nations Conf Trade & Dev UNCTAD, Geneva, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,29,3,3,0,18,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Based on a return plan by the physician and the insured, participants increase their working hours slowly over a specified period of time. As participants are still classified as incapable of working they still receive sick leave benefits. Using claims data from the Techniker Krankenkasse, the largest German sickness fund, the study aims at identifying participants and analyzing the full return-to-work and the impact of the RTW program. Thereby, we account for socio-economic factors, insurance-based characteristics, and medical and health-related information. We consider a possible selection bias by using individual weights to analyze determinants of length of the sickness absence by applying models for survival analysis (Cox proportional hazard model). As a main result - depending on the central assumption of unconfoundedness - sickness absence is positively related to participation in the RTW program for those with sickness absence longer than 120 days. For mental disorders, our results indicate an even stronger effect. The study results emphasize the need further promotion of this instrument among those insured, physicians and employers, as occupational health management is one key for a successful return-to-work.","[Schneider, Udo; Linder, Roland; Verheyen, Frank] WINEG Sci Inst TK Benefit & Efficiency Hlth Care, Bramfelder Str 140, D-22035 Hamburg, Germany",,"Schneider, U (通讯作者)，WINEG Sci Inst TK Benefit & Efficiency Hlth Care, Bramfelder Str 140, D-22035 Hamburg, Germany.",dr.udo.schneider@wineg.de,,,,,,,45,24,25,2,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

To this end we assemble a panel data set of sea turtle nesting activity and satellite-derived measures of nighttime light. Controlling for the surveyor effort, the local economic infrastructure, and spatial spillovers, we find that nighttime light significantly reduces the number of sea turtle nests. According to data on replacement costs for sea turtles raised in captivity, our result suggests that the increase in lighting over the last two decades has resulted in the loss of close to 1800 sea turtles in the Caribbean, worth up to $288 million. Incorporating our empirical estimates into a stage-structured population model, we discover that the dynamic effect of nighttime light on future generations of sea turtles is likely to be much larger, with a cost of approximately $2.8 billion for Guadeloupe alone. More generally, our study provides a new approach to valuing the cost of environmental pollution associated with species extinction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

While that ruling was being appealed, the US Congress passed legislation stipulating that the application of CVD law to NMEs starting in 2006 was legal. China challenged this legislation at the WTO. The dispute resulted in a ruling that left open the possibility that the legislation violated the GATT, as well as a finding that the United States must investigate its application of countervailing and antidumping duties against China.

This dispute featured allegations that India's import measures applied against avian influenza- (AI-) infected countries over poultry and related products were too restrictive, in light of the World Organisation for Animal Health's (OIE's) scientifically motivated standards and guidelines. We rely on insights from a set of economic models of commercial poultry markets in the presence of negative externalities such as AI. We use such models to motivate critical tradeoffs arising at the intersection of government regulatory regimes designed to deal with AI and how they fit alongside trade agreements such as the WTO and standard-setting bodies such as the OIE, which combine to impose constraints on regulatory and trade policy. While we find the institutional design of the OIE to be well-motivated and we are in broad agreement with the overall thrust of the Panel Report in the dispute, we also highlight a number of subtle issues which pose longterm challenges for the multilateral trading system's ability to balance trade rules with public health concerns.","[Bown, Chad P.] World Bank, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Bown, Chad P.] CEPR, London, England; [Hillman, Jennifer A.] Georgetown Univ, Ctr Law, Washington, DC 20057 USA",The World Bank; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Georgetown University,"Bown, CP (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC 20005 USA.;Bown, CP (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.;Hillman, JA (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Ctr Law, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",cbown@worldbank.org; jah95@law.georgetown.edu,,"Bown, Chad/0000-0002-6963-7857",World Bank's MDTF-II Trust Fund,World Bank's MDTF-II Trust Fund,"Thanks to Kyle Bagwell, Robert Staiger, Nuno Limao, Arik Levinson, Ellen Terpstra, Clem Clay and seminar participants at the WTO Case Law conference at European University Institute and the Peterson Institute for helpful discussions.

As a result, there were widespread concerns that reversing QE might trigger financial instability in those countries. The central objective of our article is to empirically investigate this important issue by (1) examining the effect of QE on capital flows into developing Asia and (2) identifying the most significant factors that influence the effect of a QE taper tantrum on exchange rate instability. We find that capital flows into developing countries during QE were at least comparable to those before the global financial crisis. We also find that capital flows during QE and the symptoms of those capital flows such as high inflation, credit expansion, and the deterioration of the current-account balance accounted for much of the destabilizing effect of a QE taper tantrum. While there is no evidence that macroprudential policies directly reduce the destabilizing effect, they can nevertheless be useful preemptive measures.","[Park, Donghyun; Ramayand, Arief] Asian Dev Bank, Econ Res & Reg Cooperat Dept, Macroecon Res Div, Manila, Philippines; [Shin, Kwanho] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, 5-1 Anam Dong, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Asian Development Bank; Korea University,"Shin, K (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, 5-1 Anam Dong, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",khshin@korea.ac.kr,"Shin, Kwanho/AAL-7502-2021","Shin, Kwanho/0000-0001-9747-7603",Asian Development Bank; Korea University [K1421841]; National Research Foundation [NRF-2014S1A3A2044456],Asian Development Bank; Korea University; National Research Foundation,"This work was supported by the Asian Development Bank, Korea University Grant (K1421841), and the National Research Foundation (NRF-2014S1A3A2044456).",,14,16,18,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

In the past, health expenditure was mostly seen as a cost item, probably because many medical treatments are covered by public health insurance. However, policymakers are increasingly realizing that a growing health sector may be quite beneficial for an economy. It creates employment opportunities and it is relatively resistant to the fluctuations of the business cycle. Input-output analysis could be a useful tool to study the structural change resulting from the growth of the health sector. This paper quantifies for the first time the economic significance of the oral healthcare sector as a component of the German healthcare sector as a whole. The current data for the healthcare sector comes from Health Satellite Accounts, which while comprehensive do fail to answer important questions due to not incorporating certain sectors such as the oral healthcare sector. Therefore on the basis of the Health Satellite Account a specific Satellite Account for the oral healthcare sector is created by using billing data as well as epidemiological data, provided by several dental associations and the Institute of German Dentists. Based on this added information, gross value added data and the number of employees in the oral healthcare sector are computed. Gross value added in 2010 amounted to (sic)13.4 billion, with around (sic)4 billion being attributable to the secondary oral healthcare market; the market for solely out-of-pocket payments. In a second step the paper develops a model to forecast oral healthcare sector growth based on various explanatory variables such as demographic change, take-up behaviour, medical-technical progress, oral morbidity, aggregated supply (collective dental treatment times) as well as income levels and distribution, where the latter two are considered to be of particular importance. According to this model, by 2030 gross value added in the oral healthcare sector will amount to (sic)15.9 million, which corresponds to a 19.2 % increase. The secondary oral healthcare market will be the key to this increase since the model predicts a disproportionately high growth of 60.3 % bringing the total to (sic)6.3 million gross value added in 2030.","[Ostwald, Dennis A.] WifOR Wirtschaftsforsch, Rheinstr 22, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany; [Klingenberger, David] IDZ, Univ Str 73, D-50931 Cologne, Germany",,"Ostwald, DA (通讯作者)，WifOR Wirtschaftsforsch, Rheinstr 22, D-64283 Darmstadt, Germany.",dennis.ostwald@wifor.de,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,5,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

We evaluate the impact of randomly-assigned incentives for improving attendance at the summer program of a large metropolitan school district. Students were assigned to one of three experimental conditions: (1) financial incentives for parents combined with non-financial incentives for students, (2) non-financial incentives for students (no incentives for parents), and (3) control. We find that the combination of the parent and student incentives increased the daily attendance rate by 9% and the likelihood of having perfect attendance by 63%. The student-only incentives had a smaller and statistically insignificant effect on attendance. We find little evidence that these incentives affected attendance rates or standardized test scores during the regular school year following the summer program, but we do find that they increased the likelihood of re-enrolling in the district.

We detect jumps in equally spaced 10-minute returns for most liquid stocks quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange within one-year sample period. We match jumps with macroeconomic and firm specific news. We find that only the minority of jumps is associated with public information releases, whereas the majority of them is motivated by liquidity shocks observed in the spreads, volume, and the number of trades. Our findings show that jumps are related to the inability of the market to absorb new and big orders. Liquidity shocks in volatility, volume, and quoted spread are the key drivers accompanying the occurrence of the jumps. Finally, the introduction of a faster and more efficient trading system improves the liquidity by increasing the depth of the market.","[Bedowska-Sojka, Barbara] Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61857 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Bedowska-Sójka, B (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61857 Poznan, Poland.",barbara.bedowska-sojka@ue.poznan.pl,"Będowska-Sójka, Barbara/K-1112-2019","Będowska-Sójka, Barbara/0000-0001-5193-8304",,,,,41,13,13,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

It for the implementation of specific goal, appears lack of human resources, then subcontractor services or look for internal resources at the global level are used, so workers go on international assignments. International assignments have become topical in recent years, when the national borders have become more and more fragile, and companies develop their activities at international level. When going to international assignment, each expatriate experience psychological change circle. If the process is not well coordinated and expatriate or repatriate may decide to go home without reaching the objectives - international assignment is unsuccessful. To decrease the number of unsuccessful international assignments, it is necessary to analyse existing processes, understand the weaknesses of the process and figure out how to avoid or reduce these weaknesses. The goal of the study is to fmd out, what is the main shortcomings of international assignment process from expatriates and repatriates perspective, to improve global mobility team processes. With the study authors want to answer following questions: How international assignment process is evaluated by expatriates and repatriates? How international assignment process is evaluated by managers and personnel specialists? The data of the research is gathered with two surveys created by the authors: one for expatriates and repatriates, other for managers and personnel specialists. The results show that more than a half of expatriates and repatriates goes to international assignment together with their families. The reason, why expatriates and repatriates want go to international assignment, are opportunities for international experience and a possible career development. The highest stress for expatriates and repatriates is connected with difficulties to fmd a suitable residence and kindergarten / school for children. Conclusions: most of the repatriates in the current work use competences and skills acquired during the international assignment and international assignment has opened the way for career growth. The main reasons why expatriates return earlier are: expatriates family cannot adapt to the new situation or expatriates personality is not suitable for international assignment. There is not sufficiently performed preparation of expatriates and repatriates for international assignments in organizations, personnel specialists are minimally involved in the international assignment process.","[Blumberga, Solveiga; Treilina, Daiga] RISEBA Univ Business Arts & Technol, Riga, Latvia",RISEBA University of Applied Sciences,"Blumberga, S (通讯作者)，RISEBA Univ Business Arts & Technol, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,5,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,401,408,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200052,0

Most assume that increasing demand for cattle products produced in Brazil caused this deforestation, but the empirical work to-date on cattle documents only correlations between cattle herd size, pasture expansion, cattle prices, and deforestation. This paper uses panel data on deforestation and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) status-an exogenous demand shifter-to estimate whether changes in FMD status caused new deforestation in municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon and cerrado biomes during the 2000-2010 period. Results suggest that, on average, becoming certified as FMD-free caused a temporary spike in deforestation in the 2 years after a municipality became FMD-free, but caused subsequent deforestation to decline relative to infected municipalities during the 2000-2010 period.

The activities of Estonian companies and their attitudes to profitability analysis have been considered by using the results of a survey carried out in companies. The survey aims to draw attention to areas, which need improvement. It has been shown how the companies make use of the traditional income statement in the analysis process and whether any adjustment is needed; whether profits as a manifestation of the value of a company merit attention; whether attention is accorded to the capital maintenance problem and the price of capital - hence the real growth of the wealth; whether the cash-based profit or contribution margin, for example, are analyzed.

I model the tax effects via two transmission channels, the traditional user cost of capital channel and the cash flow channel, which is crucial for financially constrained firms.

It happens quite frequently nowadays that the choice to visit or return to a specific location can be consistently affected by acceptance perception expressed by the consumer with regard to the intangible aspects that surround the context and the structural endowment held by the chosen location. The concept of intangible component is firmly associated to a multisensory-type experience, based on some simple evidences: when it's not possible to categorize a tourist flow depending on some tangible determinants of the offer, whether for morphological, architectural, cultural-historical or religious, it will be the experiential variant engendered by those who provide a service or sell a product to give more weight to each tourism component and explain the basis for an overall assessment of the experienced elements. This is the case of the Feria de Abril a civil-type celebration that takes place in the town of Seville in Andalucia between the first and second week of April it has grown exponentially in terms of flows and business volumes during the last decade, reaching the quota of about one million visitors in 2015 and generating direct and induced effects on the economy of the place, up to cover in just one week about the 3% of the annual Seville GDP. On the basis of such premises, using a sample survey conducted during the event in 2015, the paper aims to investigate about the consumer buying behavior, identifying any correlations between acceptance indicators and success factors, and then building different multiple regression models between the variables useful to understand whether and in what way the experiential component influences the purchasing habits of the visitor in this kind of events.","[Di Mateo, Dante] Univ G DAnnunzio, Dept Econ, Viale Pindaro 42, Pescara, Italy",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Di Mateo, D (通讯作者)，Univ G DAnnunzio, Dept Econ, Viale Pindaro 42, Pescara, Italy.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,2,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,205,212,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200027,0

Climate communication and marketing efforts have been the focus of an interdisciplinary research exploring how food retailers, in their unique intermediary role between producers and consumers, could guide consumers' food choices in a more climate-friendly direction, with examples mainly from Sweden. Consumers are not aware of what actions are the most important from a climate point of view. A guide to more climate friendly protein choices (meat guide) was created within the project, with the aim of developing a way of informing about the environmental impacts of meat and other sources of protein. While food waste was considered an important issue, climate effects of transportation and packaging was of greater concern to the consumers in the study, who found it more important to buy local and seasonal food, and organic products, than to choose vegetarian alternatives. Observational studies in European stores, as well as interviews with representatives of Swedish supermarkets, revealed that direct climate messages were scarce. A recommendation to supermarkets is to promote vegetarian choices in store and develop the fruit and vegetable department. A novel suggestion is to encourage retailers to build on ambiguous categories and indirect messages, in particular local, seasonal and organic, in communicating climate mitigating behaviour and promote an increase in consumption of vegetables.","[Ekelund, L.; Spendrup, S.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Work Sci Business Econ & Environm Psychol, Alnarp, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Ekelund, L (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Work Sci Business Econ & Environm Psychol, Alnarp, Sweden.",,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,29,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62611-11-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2016,1132,,,,,,191,197,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1132.26,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7DM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391238400026,0

Built on a market garden model, this venture grew out of students' discussions and projects on the ideas of sustainability and the role the University could play at a practical and pragmatic level. The garden formally began to supplement part of the Agricultural campus' cafeteria's food needs in 2011 and 2012, and therefore funding came partially from the University's 'food' budget. In 2013, the Dean offered funding to develop a 3-year proposal to operationalize the garden within the Department of Plant and Animal Sciences. The future viability of the garden rests on building 'curriculum' around the garden; indeed, integrated education can be an important role for the garden. This purpose of the garden should be recognized, first that being its original intent of supplementing the food needs of the campus cafeteria and the campus community, and second to serve an education role. Beyond the obvious value in campus food and teaching, it behoves the university to provide leadership as the only agricultural campus in Atlantic Canada. The objectives are to: transition the Chef's Garden into the department; expand the market reach of the garden beyond the Campus Food Services; explore and implement ways to integrate the garden into curriculum both academic and non-academic; and generate revenue sources for capital expenditures.

We also find that such appointments are typically followed by a drop in the appointing firm's operating performance, and an increase in rent-seeking activities. This suggests that bank directors cannot strengthen corporate governance.

We find that financial flexibility has a significant and positive effect on both investment and firm performance. However, investment scale rather than investment efficiency seems to drive firm performance.

The study discusses the volume of the state tax revenue in relation to the organisation and costs of tax administration, which, though being strongly developed organisationally, is inefficient and expensive. The author presents the problem of declining budget revenues, especially in the area of VAT i.e. tax which have the largest share in the revenue to the state budget. Also identified and presented tax gap is estimated and its components are named (shadow economy, crime or tax optimisation). Instruments which could help to eliminate or to limit the gap already implemented in Poland and prepared to implement in the coming years are listed and described.","[Mierzejewska, Malgorzata] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Mierzejewska, M (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-261-9,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,27,,,,,,354,365,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH1PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000398381700035,0

The article investigates the structural changes in the main indicators of the global oil market in recent years. It analyzes the contribution of individual countries and regions in the total volume of proven oil reserves, its production, consumption, exports and imports. Individual and generalizing indicators of structural changes are used to quantify the dynamics of the processes. The trends of the global oil market that have been identified and studied in the article began to emerge in recent years and presumably will continue in the medium term. The key determinants of the market developments and its current structural changes are formulated. The position of the Russian Federation concerning the change in the global oil market is stated.

My research reveals provided by the two companies investigated CSR data which show that as of Orange Romania Telecommunications company and such as Raiffeisen Bank Romania carries a consistent, proactive corporate social responsibility strategy. In the case of the above-mentioned companies it can be emphasized that CSR is not only the domestic subsidiary, but they are representing our country with a growing international commitment to corporate social responsibility with. We have to mention when speaking about these two companies, that they had published with annual frequency of reports of CSR, social programs, these backed by many years of experience in the field. The aim of the study was to prove that turnover might net profit in proportion to detect the percentage of money allocated for the share of social programs by the international companies. Furthermore, to analyze the proactive and strategic engagement, that amount of money for the supported companies not fall for any negative trends in connection with the profit failure. Orange Romania and Raiffeisen Bank Romania follows a consistent, proactive corporate social responsibility strategy and therefore it can be stated on the basis of this information that in recent years they supported the same programs, and the ammount of allocated money has not changed with the change of the annual profit. It can be emphasized that CSR is clearly important not for only the to the domestic subsidiary, but the whole business group, representing our country with a growing international commitment to corporate social responsibility. We agree with the statement that the Romanian business community corporate responsibility have yet to develop much in order to grow up to the international responsibility practices, but fortunately our country is active in international companies to promote this by already operating abroad as here are trying to achieve the an already working pattern. Perhaps partly the fault of the national CSR professionals, it is easy to assume spells may fall to the side to hide behind a nice-sounding programs and projects to conduct a marketing responsibility activity. The change should not be described a fast one, but definitely one that moves in a positive direction in the Romanian companies, because they are taking responsibility with respect in this struggle.","[Nagy, Edit; Szasz, Erzsebet] Partium Christian Univ, Oradea, Romania",,"Nagy, E (通讯作者)，Partium Christian Univ, Oradea, Romania.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,717,724,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200094,0

(2009) 'Economization, part 1: shifting attention from the economy towards processes of economization', Economy and Society, vol. 38, no. 3, pp. 369-398 and Caliskan, K. & Callon, M. (2010) 'Economization, part 2: a research programme for the study of markets', Economy and Society, vol. 39, no. 1, pp. 1-32.] is that their analytical priorities reflect an economics-centric perspective: they prioritize the study of market exchange itself and of agents promoting market framing, while leaving non-economic agendas and the broader contexts of markets both understudied and undertheorized. This weakness tends to be attributed to contingent analytical priorities, which can be remedied by extending the program's focus without changing its theoretical tenets. This article, in contrast, suggests that these analytical priorities stem from a theoretical tension within the program, which is caused by the complete, instead of a selective adoption of the theoretical tools of the performativity agenda in the marketization program. As a result, while the program promotes the inclusion of non-marketizing agents through the notion of co-performation, its call to focus on those phenomena that agents qualify as 'economic' and on the making of market exchange delimits the analysis of non-marketizing agents to their helping/hindering effects on market framing. The solution proposed is to reassess some of the performativity-inspired tools of the program in favor of a more ANT-inspired approach to markets.","[Pellandini-Simanyi, Lena] ELTE, Dept Media & Commun, Budapest, Hungary",Eotvos Lorand University,"Pellandini-Simányi, L (通讯作者)，ELTE, Dept Media & Commun, Budapest, Hungary.",simanyi.lena@btk.elte.hu,,"Pellandini-Simanyi, Lena/0000-0002-5426-4103",Bolyai Research Grant; Hungarian Academy of Sciences [Pellandini-Simanyi]; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund [OTKA-101261],Bolyai Research Grant(Hungarian Academy of Sciences); Hungarian Academy of Sciences [Pellandini-Simanyi]; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)),"This work was supported by Bolyai Research Grant, Hungarian Academy of Sciences [Pellandini-Simanyi]; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund [OTKA-101261].",,53,4,4,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

However, with an increased focus on the domestic market and native species, the development in Brazil has been very different from most other successful aquaculture producers, particularly in Latin America. As in many other countries, the development started with introduced international species such as shrimp and tilapia in a typical developing country fashion, but has shifted to an increasing share of native species and focus on the domestic market. This article analyzes the main aspects concerning this development by the relative productivity of the main species, regulations and markets. Regulations and the technology spreading from international species may be considered as important factors for this somewhat unusual development. The future prospects for the Brazilian aquaculture industry development are positive, since there is not only space available for expansion for both exotic and native species, but also an untapped domestic market.","[Pincinato, Ruth Beatriz Mezzalira; Asche, Frank] Univ Stavanger, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Ullandhaug, Stavanger, Norway; [Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Prod, Gainesville, FL USA",Universitetet i Stavanger; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Pincinato, RBM (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Ullandhaug, Stavanger, Norway.",ruth.b.pincinato@uis.no,"Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728; Pincinato, Ruth/0000-0002-8320-680X",National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) - Science without Borders program; Norwegian Research Council,National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) - Science without Borders program(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)); Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),The authors are particularly grateful to the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) - Science without Borders program and the the Norwegian Research Council for financial support.,,44,18,18,0,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

These systemic changes bring along new factors that characterise the development of the rural area and are necessary for the spatial development and decision-making. The goal of the research was to identify the key factors of the smart rural development concept for the analysis of the territorial development and decision making in Vidzeme. The methodological framework of the study consists of two research methods: ESPON-CUBE method for grouping of rural areas, and AHP method for identifying the key factors for the concept of smart regional development. As the result, we have developed and described the key factors for the smart development concept of Vidzeme Region. The dominating direction for drafting and developing smart specialisation in Vidzeme is the direction of smart governance, followed by smart economics and smart population development. As regards the impact factors influencing the smart specialisation of Vidzeme Region, the biggest impact is felt from the state and municipalities. In the group of national influence factors, the most significant is the ability to provide a stable and sustainable economic situation in the country. In the assessment of local governmental impact, the highest priority is given to their ability to build collaboration with the population and entrepreneurs. The top priority in the population impact group is the activity of individual groups in acquisition and dissemination of innovative changes and ideas. The rural area development concept should also comprise the following indicators characterising the area: the entrepreneurial potential of the area, the potential of social ingenuity, creative consumers and knowledge networks.","[Rozentale, Sarmite; Krumins, Gatis; Krumina, Ieva] Vidzeme Univ Appl Sci, Valmiera, Latvia",Vidzeme University of Applied Sciences,"Rozentale, S (通讯作者)，Vidzeme Univ Appl Sci, Valmiera, Latvia.",,"Rozentale, Sarmite/ABI-5512-2020",,National Research Program [EKOSOC-LV 5.2.3.],National Research Program,"The paper was supported by the National Research Program EKOSOC-LV 5.2.3., a subproject for Latvian rural and regional development processes and opportunities in the context of the knowledge economy regarding development of rural areas and affecting indicators.",,7,0,0,0,7,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,129,136,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100018,0

As a special object of a study are chosen commercial banks, whose licenses were revoked by the Bank of Russia in 2013-2016 year. The study is based on the hypothesis that formalized red flags are required to determine the risk of fraud by various characteristics of the company's activities. The presence of significant evidence obtained earlier, prompted to choose a composition of the Board of Directors as area of research for highlighting red flags. Paper examines the connection between the risk of distortion of the financial statements and the company's Board of Directors.

That was the moment for us to propose to organize a research survey of the corporate communication field and its inter-relations in order to find a solution associated with informational resources, their assessments and providers of information, i.e. managers and employees of the power industry company. Thus, we have completed a research among a total number of 300 employees working with a large power industry company in Bulgaria. The number of 116 managers participating in the research occupied positions in various hierarchical levels and together with the rest of employees, they all assessed twelve informational resources on basis of qualities stipulated by the AIMQ model and amended by a few purposefully targeted questions. As a framework of our research we have chosen the AIMQ model developed by Lee and his collective of authors. This particular research comprises 15 categories enumerated as follows: 1.

Here PES did not enter an institutional vacuum, but was rather transformed through a process of reproducing existing institutional structures. This partly reflects established norms and values about 'bestways' of organizing forest management, but also existing structures of power, tenure and some groups' control over forest resources. In this sense, from a path dependency perspective, the new and 'innovative' market-based approaches, such as PES, do not represent 'critical junctures' with profound impacts on the future trajectory of forest management. The findings may have important implications for the prospects of implementing similar initiatives, such as REDD+. Future schemes of PES and REDD+ should hence to a higher degree take into account the limitations and challenges of institutional reproduction, interplay and path dependency in their planning and implementation.

College majors (defined at a detailed level) are most strongly related to wages observed three years earlier, when students were college freshmen. The responses to wages vary depending on the extent to which there is a strong mapping of majors into particular occupations.

The analysis focuses on patients suffering from hypercholesterolemia. Using a large and detailed dataset of patients collected by the Italian College of General Practitioners (SIMG) over the period 2001-2006, we observe the existence of heterogeneity in the time needed to reach an optimal level of health stock. We firstly explore whether patients recovering faster exhibit lower hospitalization rates. Secondly, we study the determinants of the speed of recovery to a good health status. Results suggest that a 10 % increase in the speed of recovery reduces hospitalization rates by 1 % in the general sample and by 1.25 % in patients in primary prevention. Furthermore, we show that recovering to a good health status is a multifaceted phenomenon, with technology explaining from 54 to 68 % of the total effect.","[Atella, Vincenzo; D'Amico, Francesco] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, CEIS Tor Vergata, I-00133 Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Atella, V (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, CEIS Tor Vergata, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",atella@uniroma2.it; damico@lse.ac.uk,,,Fondazione SIMG (Societa Italiana di Medicina Generale); SIMG (Societa Italiana di Medicina Generale),Fondazione SIMG (Societa Italiana di Medicina Generale); SIMG (Societa Italiana di Medicina Generale),"This work would have not been possible without the enthusiastic support provided by people at the Italian College of General Practitioners (SIMG) and in particular Claudio Cricelli, Iacopo Cricelli and Gian Piero Mazzaglia.

An evaluation of the effects of the Spanish clean air law on expenditure at hospitality venues,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Smoking ban; Hospitality venue; Household expenditure; Policy evaluation,TOBACCO; MODEL; INDUSTRY; IMPACT,"In January 2011 Spain modified clean air legislation in force since 2006, removing all existing exceptions applicable to hospitality venues. Although this legal reform was backed by all political parties with parliamentary representation, the government's initiative was contested by the tobacco industry and its allies in the hospitality industry. One of the most voiced arguments against the reform was its potentially disruptive effect on the revenue of hospitality venues. This paper evaluates the impact of this reform on household expenditure at restaurants and bars and cafeterias. We used household expenditure micro-data for years 2006-2012 to estimate models for the probability of observing expenditures and the expected level of expenditure. We applied a before-after analysis with a wide range of controls for confounding factors and a flexible modeling of time effects in order to identify the effects of the reform. Our results suggest that the reform caused a 2 % reduction in the proportion of households containing smokers but did not cause reductions in households' expenditures on restaurant services or on bars and cafeteria services.","[Garcia-Villar, Jaume] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Empresa, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Garcia-Villar, Jaume; Lopez-Nicolas, Angel] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ctr Recerca Econ & Salut, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Lopez-Nicolas, Angel] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Econ, Cartagena 30201, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Pompeu Fabra University; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"López-Nicolás, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ctr Recerca Econ & Salut, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",angel.lopez@upct.es,"; Garcia Villar, Jaume/D-7140-2013","Lopez-Nicolas, Angel/0000-0003-3112-7779; Garcia Villar, Jaume/0000-0002-8427-9541",Ministerio de Educacion [ECO2008-06395-C05-04]; European Regional Development Fund; Fundacion Seneca [08646/PHCS/08],Ministerio de Educacion; European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)); Fundacion Seneca(Fundacion SenecaSpanish Government),"Support from Ministerio de Educacion project ECO2008-06395-C05-04, co-funded by European Regional Development Fund, and from Fundacion Seneca through project 08646/PHCS/08 is gratefully acknowledged.",,23,6,6,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Both are practice-led, with uneasy but productive relationships with theorizing. Exploring their relations offers ways to address challenges faced by interdisciplinary management research, which struggles to connect research and practice. The authors describe how they brought the two fields together. We outline how we convened, designed and facilitated the fourth Oxford Futures Forum held in May 2014. This event brought together leading practitioners and researchers in a collective inquiry based on self-organizing, generative and reflexive making and dialogue. How participants engaged, from responding to the invitation to take part, as well as their practical and discursive encounters with one another during the event, threw up similarities and differences between the two fields. We present nine themes that capture the links and spaces between design and scenarios, yet suggest that they are not a straightforward overlap or a simple relationship, but rather a range of interactions between the fields, including feeding in, bridging, tension and repulsion. The paper's contribution is to suggest how scenario planning can engage with design, resulting in new opportunities for research and projects. These modes of engagement provide a framing to explore dialogues between other management disciplines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While there are many descriptions of the benefits of foresight, there is little research into how these benefits are created. In addition, although the view of innovations has shifted towards a systems understanding, the same has not happened with foresight, which is largely seen as a process. The process view and focus on the outcomes has created a situation where the dynamics between agents involved in foresight is still not well understood. One emerging approach to improve the understanding of the dynamics of foresight, and to embed foresight more closely with innovation management and policy, is the systems view. In this paper, we build on the systems view of foresight, and study what the elements in foresight as a system are and how they contribute to the creation of futures knowledge. Based on the literature, we propose six elements that are useful for understanding a foresight system and the creation of futures knowledge: agents, cognitive schemes, strategic objects, mediating events, memory objects and metaphors. We illustrate the systems view, the elements and their interaction with two case examples: one on creating future-orientation in a research and technology organisation and one on renewing a forest industry through roadmapping. Based on the elements and the case studies, we argue that the strategic objects and mediating events are important leverage points when steering foresight as a system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The method allows the dialogue between stakeholder representatives, government organizations and communities involved in that territorial process. The scenarios produced substantial and sometimes contradictory data: while they can be considered as a way of empowerment for the local communities, participatory scenarios also have their limits and may reveal structural forms of authority or domination within the project-promoting institutions and local communities. The information collected allows scientists of various areas (Modeling, Social Sciences), community leaders and managers to elaborate a reflection upon the levers that may condition the implementation of effective actions and public policies in territorial units.

Despite being controversial, this approach has influenced both the Inter-Agency Working Group on Cost-Benefit Analysis and the UK government's guidelines on discounting. We first clarify the theoretical basis of the ENPV approach. Then, rather than following previous work which used a single series of U.S. Treasury bond returns, we treat nominal interest rates and inflation as co-integrated series and estimate the empirical term structure of discount rates via the 'Fisher Effect'. This nests previous empirical models and is more flexible. It also addresses an irregularity in previous work which used data on nominal interest rates until 1950, and real interest rates thereafter. As we show, the real and nominal data have very different time series properties. This paper therefore provides a robustness check on previous discounting advice and updated methodological guidance at a time when governments around the world are reviewing their guidelines on social discounting. The policy implications are discussed in the context of the Social Cost of Carbon, nuclear decommissioning and public health. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The empirical analysis using dynamic panel data models shows that the effect of domestic and global economic slacks on domestic inflation in the new emerging economies has changed significantly since the end of the 1990s. Before the end of the 1990s, the domestic economic slack played a predominant role in driving domestic inflation. After the year 2000, however, the global economic slack played a significant and more important role in affecting domestic inflation. This finding implies that the prescription that central banks should specifically react to developments in global output is justified for the new emerging economies over the most recent decade.","[Zhang, Chengsi] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chengsi] Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China,"Zhang, CS (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, 59 Zhong Guan Cun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",zhangcs@ruc.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71173224],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71173224).,,26,4,4,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Based on 1984-2012 German Socio-Economic Panel Study data of sons and fathers, I show that fathers' risk aversion is inversely related to sons' long-run levels of education. A quasi-experimental setting provides no evidence for reverse causality. I find signs that sons with risk averse fathers experience lower educational mobility and considerably lower income mobility than their peers with risk taking fathers, though these differences can only be measured with large standard errors. The direct link between paternal risk attitudes and offspring's education outcomes can provide a novel explanation for the mechanism underlying the intergenerational persistence of economic statuses. It can further challenge the traditional view of own risk attitudes in the human capital investment theory and suggests that parental risk attitudes should be incorporated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The source of shocks has important implications for the trade-offs. In the face of external shocks to interest rates or inflation, a passive fiscal and active monetary policy mix performs well in stabilizing government liabilities, inflation, and real exchange rates but generates higher output volatility.

Judicialization can be discarded as well, since the incentives to enforce the WTO contract in this respect are lacking.

We begin from a conventional model of market equilibrium where an amenity is conveyed to homeowners by virtue of their residential location choices. Different housing markets may have different hedonic price functions due to variation across markets in the joint distribution of preferences, income, regulations, and technology. In this setting, taste-based sorting within and across markets confounds point identification of reduced form descriptions for amenity demand curves. However, we demonstrate that basic knowledge of the sorting process is sufficient to construct instruments that identify bounds on demand curves. Bounds on demand curves can be translated into ranges of welfare measures for non-marginal changes in amenities. We find these ranges to be potentially informative in a demonstrative application to evaluating the benefits of improved lake water clarity in the Northeast. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

His comparative focus on the interplay of statutory minimum wages and collective wage bargaining shows that while the latter is more effective than the former at reducing inequality, both require state intervention, with particular emphasis on participative standards to counter the erosion of industrial relations institutions.","[Bosch, Gerhard] Univ Duisburg Essen, Sociol, Duisburg, Germany; [Bosch, Gerhard] IAQ, Inst Work Skills & Training, Duisburg, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Bosch, G (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Sociol, Duisburg, Germany.",gerhard.bosch@uni-due.de,,,,,,,20,29,30,1,35,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

The second envisages that elite reform from above will succeed in re-engineering industrial relations and workers' protection according to an ideal social policy agenda - an unlikely prospect given the overriding importance of financial considerations and globalized competition. The third scenario centres on a counter-movement from below which presents trade unions with the daunting challenge of mobilizing the discontented far beyond their traditional constituency.","London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Hyman, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",R.Hyman@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,22,29,29,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

Based on data from the Australian household panel Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia, the article is the first to establish these gaps in Australia, and to examine the degree to which credence can be afforded to claims that endowments such as personality traits may help explain such wage differentials. Using ordinary least squares and Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition methods, the study explicitly includes the battery of Big Five personality traits in wage regressions and estimates the contribution of endowments and returns to these traits. The finding is that personality traits and returns to them do not differ along lines of sexual orientation. Gay men in particular suffer a substantial unexplained wage penalty in the workplace. Such unexplained differences suggest that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, though unlawful, may exist in Australia.","[La Nauze, Andrea] Univ Melbourne, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia",University of Melbourne,"La Nauze, A (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, 111 Barry St, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia.",ala1@unimelb.edu.au,,"La Nauze, Andrea/0000-0002-1666-8617","Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA)","Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA)(Australian Government)","I sincerely thank Professor John Haisken-DeNew for his guidance and helpful comments and thanks to whom this paper exists.

The basic production resource is land. Characteristic activity in agriculture is currently the cultivation of soil and planting crops. One of the most oilseed crops, which are grown in Slovakia, is oilseed rape which use is negligible as in human nutrition, as well as in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries and in recent years is growing its importance by increasing biofuel production. More attention is paid right to biofuels, which recently observed a significant increase in the world but also in Slovak Republic. Increased production of FAME in Slovakia affects the use of oilseed rape for industrial purposes, instead of human nutrition. Our article is focused on sown area of oilseed rape, which is needed to satisfy the demand for FAME at different levels of blending mandates in Slovak Republic. The aim of this paper, based on increasing the percentage of FAME in diesel fuel for the period 2005-2012, is to analyze the impact on the cultivation area of oilseed rape, under conditions we do not take into account foreign trade. Materials needed to prepare article are derived from secondary sources, mainly from the Situation and Outlook Reports of Research Institute of Agricultural and Food Economics, as well as from other sources. In the methodology we work with several relationships and value. During the processing of the data we used base and chain indices that allow us to express the growth and decline observed values with respect to the baseline period and the previous period. The need of oilseed rape area under cultivation, which is used to produce FAME, we calculated based on actual average indicators in the Slovak Republic for the chosen period. To the above calculation we used the following indicators: the percentage of biodiesel in the fuel, adopted by Government Regulation of SR, yield coefficient of rapeseed oil, diesel consumption in each year, and average yield from 1 ha(-1) of oilseed rape. Production of FAME from 1 ha(-1) of oilseed rape was calculated as a conjunction of the harvest from 1 hectare(-1) of oilseed rape and yield coefficient of oil from rapeseed, which represents about 34%. Under these assumptions, the consumption of FAME is equal to the conjunction of diesel of the year and the percentage of FAME in diesel. Total consumption of FAME in Slovakia we divided by FAME production from 1 ha(-1) of oilseed rape and we got projected sowing area of oilseed rape, which is needed to cover the needs of FAME in diesel. The work indicates to the increase in consumption of oilseed rape for the FAME production and the associated loss of land needed for the nutrition of the population. Renowned economists critically point to that condition, which may be the cause of rising food prices. The present article gives an overview of the actual needs of hectares for biodiesel production in the legislative conditions in Slovak Republic. Our article can serve as a methodological basis for further research, which will deal with the general loss of agricultural land due to the progress of the biofuel industry in the EU and worldwide.","[Bajusova, Zuzana; Zentkova, Iveta] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia; [Findura, Pavol] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Engn, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Bajusová, Z (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",bajusova.spu@gmail.com; iveta.zentkova@uniag.sk; pavol.findura@uniag.sk,"Bajusova, Zuzana/E-5560-2019","Bajusova, Zuzana/0000-0002-1960-5750",,,,,12,0,0,0,6,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,14,24,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800002,0

Out of these, the class of neural networks represented by self-organizing maps has become an important technique but only with a modest usage for the economic crisis. We apply the self-organizing maps technique for a set of worlds' economies, with the goal of identifying the resemblances and differences between worlds' economies. The model developed on self-organizing maps ensures detection of the imbalances and vulnerabilities of economies and find the determinant variables (early warning signals) for a financial-economic crisis situation.

Majority of the cross-price elasticities have positive values revealing a possible substitution effect among food groups. Demographic effects such as family size, number of kids, and age of the household's head significantly impact on food expenditures as well. Furthermore, results indicate that low-income, rural households tend to grow (produce) foodstuffs which are perceived as luxuries at home rather than purchase them at stores.","[Cupak, Andrej; Pokrivcak, Jan] Slovak Univ Agr, Nitra, Slovakia; [Rizov, Marian] Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, London, England; [Alexandri, Cecilia; Luca, Lucian] Inst Agr Econ, Bucharest, Romania",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Middlesex University,"Cupak, A (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Nitra, Slovakia.",xcupak@is.uniag.sk,"Pokrivcak, Jan/O-4941-2014; Cupak, Andrej/AAS-9503-2020; Luca, Lucian/HTM-0622-2023",,,,,,23,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,128,144,,,,,,17,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800013,0

The quantitative part of the mentioned research serves as the background of the present study, in which employers were asked about the newcomers entering the labour market. In the course of the research several hypotheses have been defined, out of which one of the principal hypotheses was that principally it is the professional experience and practical knowledge that count the most in judging entrants and in their successful employment as opposed to theoretical knowledge acquired in school.

Access to finance is fundamental for the survival and growth of SMEs. However, financial constraints are considered to be one of the most important factors that impede the growth of these firms. To contribute to the understanding of the financial constraints faced by SMEs, this paper sets out to find the firm level determinants of perception of access to finance as an obstacle to the operations of Turkish SMEs. We find that size, age, percentage of sales exported and business group affiliation do not have an effect on the tendency to see access to finance as an obstacle. Audited firms are less inclined to see access to finance as an obstacle to their operations. This inclination decreases with an increase in the percentage of sales exported. Firms that have made a recent credit application have a lower tendency to see access to finance as an obstacle. This tendency is strengthened with an increase in the percentage of sales exported.","[Erdogan, Aysa Ipek] Bogazici Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Bogazici University,"Erdogan, AI (通讯作者)，Bogazici Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",aysa.erdogan@boun.edu.tr,"Erdogan, Aysa/AAQ-3371-2020",,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,551,557,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000050,0

The disadvantage of this model consists in its orientation to the best period of the decision making unit (DMU) under evaluation, i.e. the aggregative efficiency is given as the best efficiency score across all periods. The paper formulates original modifications of the PP model - the model that is oriented on the worse period of the DMU under evaluation, and the model that computes average efficiency across all periods. In addition, we propose a multi-period SBM and super-efficiency SBM models that measure inefficiencies using relative slacks, i.e. negative relative deviations in the input space and positive ones in the output space. The results of all models are illustrated and compared on the three-period example taken from [6].

In Germany, the use of DAM is optional within HTAs of the German Institute of Medical Documentation and Information (DIMDI). Our study examines the use of DAM in DIMDI HTA reports and its effect on the quality of information provided for health policies. Methods: A review of all DIMDI HTA reports (from 1998 to September 2012) incorporating an economic assessment was performed. All included reports were divided into two groups: HTAs with DAM and HTAs without DAM. In both groups, reports were categorized according to the quality of information provided for healthcare decision making. Results: Of the sample of 107 DIMDI HTA reports, 17 (15.9%) used DAM for economic assessment. In the group without DAM, conclusions were limited by the quality of economic information in 51.1% of the reports, whereas we did not find limited conclusions in the group with DAM. Furthermore, 24 reports without DAM (26.7%) stated that using DAM would likely improve the quality of information of the economic assessment. Conclusion: The use of DAM techniques can improve the quality of HTAs in Germany. When, after a systematic review of existing literature within a HTA, it is clear that DAM is likely to positively affect the quality of the economic assessment DAM should be used.","[Kuhlmann, Alexander; Treskova, Marina; von der Schulenburg, J-Matthias Graf] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ Res Hannover CHERH, Hannover, Germany; [Braun, Sebastian] Xcenda GmbH Hlth Econ Res & Consulting, Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Kuhlmann, A (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ Res Hannover CHERH, Hannover, Germany.",ak@ivbl.uni-hannover.de,"Kuhlmann, Alexander/JFA-2021-2023","Treskova, Marina/0000-0002-3641-7225",,,,,8,0,0,0,1,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

The benefits for the consumers are obvious, but this paper contributes to the scarce literature on the retailers' value and focuses on the retailers as the key to sustainability of this business model. The concept of keeping the retailer satisfied is related to keeping the end-customers satisfied. The deal site must offer attractive deals for the end-customers and in order to do so it must foster good relations with the retailers, since they provide the products and services. One more important aspect is that satisfied retailers will provide quality service to the customers, which is important for the customer retention rate that again contributes to the retailer's satisfaction. To support proposed framework the internal database of Grouper (the Macedonian group deal site leader) is used to quantify the repetition rate of the retailers that offered promotion at least once on Grouper in the period January 2011- July 2014 and of total 1065 retailers 67% had promotions running more than once. We examine retailers' evaluation of daily promotions by conducting survey on 535 business partners that ran and completed Grouper promotions within January 2013 and June 2014.

The focus is centred on concrete and particular applications of standardized concepts such as market-value and value-at-risk. The close analyst engagement with numerical information is portrayed through a sequence of four practice modulations, which configure a movement from the unproblematic to the problematic, starting with value verification and value explanation, moving on to norm discussion and ending with inference/generalization procedures for the purposes of value re-estimation. The ethnographic evidence presented also reveals primary engagement with numerical inscriptions via boundary objects (specifically software programs and database management languages) and subsidiary human interaction; and a steady division of labour between humans and machines, with computers acting as mass calculators and analysts as skilled number surveyors.

In this study we compared several principal indicators based on overnight stays and arrivals, and consider the most-visited European countries. Annual time series data from the period following the global economic crisis were selected for Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and consequently processed. This standard approach was generalized to the analytical (resp. smooth) paths of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors depending on the parameter. Such an arrangement gives us one boundary point equal to a standard Fisher discriminant analysis and the other one to eigenvalue decomposition of only the between-sets covariance matrix (plsLDA). While the standard approach in calculus also considers the variance and covariance relations within sets, the analytical paths cover the vanishing of such influence. Many practical outcomes demonstrating the applicability of the given approach are discussed herein. Due to scaling of input data, the distribution of values between maximum and minimum was studied. It was recognized that the countries behave differently considering the results of both boundary points. Theoretical notes on the functional relation by analytical paths form a substantial part of this study.","[Malec, Lukas] Univ Business Prague, Dept Informat Technol & Analyt Methods, Spalena 76-14, Prague 11000 1, New Town, Czech Republic",,"Malec, L (通讯作者)，Univ Business Prague, Dept Informat Technol & Analyt Methods, Spalena 76-14, Prague 11000 1, New Town, Czech Republic.",malec@vso-praha.eu,"Malec, Lukáš/AAC-4978-2021","Malec, Lukáš/0000-0002-5586-4397",,,,,11,1,1,0,1,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,491,495,,,,,,5,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900084,0

There is open the question about the management of innovation processes in the company with regard to each specific type of uncertainty. To solve the above problems has been specially designed approach based on fuzzy set theory. Thus was created the data processing algorithm of the expert survey of entrepreneurs (more than 6,700 units) that are in its manufacturing portfolio of innovative projects. Within the individual uncertainties were determined the following parameters: at what time each uncertainty will manifest itself; what will be the condition of uncertainty (internal, external, or conjugated organizational environment); is it possible to predict the uncertainty or not; what will serve as a stimulus to the emergence of varying uncertainty (the origin). So, to predict the emergence of a situation of uncertainty can only generate their natures, market, and system of relationships, technological, regulatory, financial and temporal. In the case of organizational, informational, human nature to predict the uncertainty is impossible.

Therefore, many research activities in this business field have been revealed. This business field offers many possibilities for the long-time success, but also many shortcomings. The most meaningful shortcoming, e.g. for the start-up e-company, is definitely highly competitive environment. This mentioned element could be reduced by creation and implementation of an effective and successful e-strategy with the help of strategic management process. The practice and research studies show that the importance of strategic process in e-commerce is deeply underestimated. Therefore, the main subject of this paper is to analyse the existing possibilities of individual views on definition and creation of strategy and its processes in e-commerce. Based on the studies of available resources, the key element and principles leading to an effective strategy in e-commerce are created. It is also characterized by the strategic management process that optimizes the function of a successful e-strategy. The main aim of this paper is based on critical analysis of current approaches that leads to the creation and implementation of a successful strategy for electronic commerce and creation an effective process model for strategic management in e-commerce. The main methods used in this paper is an analysis and synthesis of current situation about strategy and e-commerce environment, modelling of process model for strategic management in e-commerce and case study that gives information about the selected e-company and compares the theoretical process model with the real strategic processes in e-commerce. The creation of the process model is based on literature review about the issue examined, especially the theory about the e-strategy and other process strategic model and the observation of the current e-commerce environment. The theoretically created process model is suitable for developing new research theories in the issued examined and for making effective strategic decisions in practice. This model could be used for reducing the shortcomings that e-companies during the strategic process usually make. The practical part of this paper focuses on the application of this process model in practice with the help of case study. This case study focuses on the analysis of contemporary strategic management of the selected e-company. Based on personal interviews with managers of this e-company and observation of its activities in e-commerce environment, the strategic process model for this selected e-company is proposed (respecting the main principles of theoretically created process model). At the same time the main shortcomings in the strategic process of the selected company are defined and recommendations for its elimination are suggested. The results of the paper show that the created process model of strategic management in e-commerce is valid and usable in theory and practise and can offer the effective way to the creation and implementation of a successful e-strategy.","[Svatosova, Veronika] Mendel Univ Brno, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Svatosova, V (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.",veronika.svatosova@mendelu.cz,"Svatošová, Veronika/AAF-4918-2020","Svatošová, Veronika/0000-0002-5308-8822",,,,,20,1,1,0,3,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,1079,1089,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800104,0

This trend was reflected by reducing unemployment and raising the number of unfilled jobs.

The paper begins by summarizing the basis for developing a strong, cross-disciplinary entrepreneurship program within the university. The University of North Carolina at Greensboro launched a cross-disciplinary program that has been a catalyst to launch new ventures, now in its sixth year with 48 courses in 26 departments/programs, which is discussed in Creative Cross-Disciplinary Entrepreneurship: A Practical Guide to a Cross Campus Program (Palgrave-MacMillan 2014). The paper concludes by offering how cross disciplinary academic programs inside the university leads to fruitful external private/public partnerships. Implications for Vietnam and developing countries are discussed.","[Welsh, Dianne H.

The paper generally contributes to a deeper understanding of the factors forming agribusiness field in a globalizing environment and assesses symptoms of these tendencies on the specific example of the dairy industry in the Czech Republic. First part of the article is focused on analysis of the milk production development in selected relevant markets / countries in the European Union. Based on this analysis are clearly shows different trends between the new and the old member of European Union, but also inside these regions. Second part is focused on analysis of the production and processing of dairy industry in the Czech Republic. Here, after an initial decrease of dairy production immediately after the transformation of Czech Republic agriculture in the nineties of the last decade, sector production is stagnated even in a situation, that the consumption of final products of dairy production in the last years is mildly increasing. From the analysis of demand-oriented approach to the analysis of sectorial relations follows knowledge insufficient adaptation to local production requirements of consumers. Fact that domestic producers of dairy products do not respond well on a changing needs of consumers of the Czech Republic, create space for the import of dairy products with higher added value, especially from Germany and Poland. On this basis increasing positive balance of international trade with milk, however, for products with higher added value is increasing the negative balance of international trade (especially with cheese). The analysis of price development shows that the dairy industry has in the commodity chain milk / dairy products difficult position, on their price margin presses retail chains and their manifestation of market power are very significant and negotiating ability is very high.","[Zdrahal, Ivo; Dudova, Barbora; Becvarova, Vera] Fak Reg Rozvoje & Mezinarodnich Studii, Trida Gen Piky 2005-7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Zdráhal, I (通讯作者)，Fak Reg Rozvoje & Mezinarodnich Studii, Trida Gen Piky 2005-7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",ivo.zdrahal@mendelu.cz; barbora.dudova@mendelu.cz; becvar@mendelu.cz,"Zdrahal, Ivo/E-4335-2018; Daňková, Barbora/E-5695-2018; Bečvářová, Věra/E-4321-2018","Zdrahal, Ivo/0000-0002-6631-8228; Becvarova, Vera/0000-0003-2015-574X",,,,,4,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,1190,1197,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800115,0

However, education systems pay only limited attention to this topic in most countries and remain focused on the development of hard skills. Is this approach rational or inadequate? This article provides new evidence on different aspects of the wage returns to soft skills (as an approximation of their productivity), and thereby contributes significantly to the discussion of the role of educational institutions in their development. It provides evidence that soft skills are as productive as hard skills. Moreover, it suggests that the productivity of hard skills stems from their combination with soft skills. These conclusions do not correspond to the fact that the value of education is intermediated mainly by hard skills, resulting in unequal development of soft and hard skills in schools. While concluding that education systems should pay more attention to soft skills development, the analysis recognises that this attention should be differentiated according to employers' needs, owing to substantial differences in the value of soft skills across economic sectors. It is also noteworthy that while significant gender differences in returns to hard skills were identified, wage returns to soft skills appear gender neutral.

Choosing the appropriate method to assess the cost of organ recovery is an issue of considerable interest to health economists, hospitals, financial managers and policy makers in most developed countries. Objectives: The main objective of this study was to compare a mixed method, combining top-down microcosting and bottom-up microcosting versus full top-down microcosting to assess the cost of organ recovery in a French hospital group. The secondary objective was to describe the cost of kidney, liver and pancreas recovery from French databases using the mixed method. Methods: The resources consumed for each donor were identified and valued using the proposed mixed method and compared to the full top-down microcosting approach. Data on kidney, liver and pancreas recovery were collected from a medico-administrative French database for the years 2010 and 2011. Related cost data were recovered from the hospital cost accounting system database for 2010 and 2011. Statistical significance was evaluated at P < 0.05. Results: All the median costs for organ recovery differ significantly between the two costing methods (non-parametric test method; P < 0.01). Using the mixed method, the median cost for recovering kidneys was found to be (sic)5155, liver recovery was (sic)2528 and pancreas recovery was (sic)1911. Using the full top-down microcosting method, median costs were found to be 21-36% lower than with the mixed method. Conclusion: The mixed method proposed appears to be a trade-off between feasibility and accuracy for the identification and valuation of cost components when calculating the cost of organ recovery in comparison to the full top-down microcosting approach.","[Hrifach, Abdelbaste; Brault, Coralie; Guerre, Pascale; Ganne, Christell; Serrier, Hassan; Colin, Cyrille] Hosp Civils Lyon, Pole Informat Med Evaluat Rech, Unite Evaluat Med Econ, 162 Ave Lacassagne,Batiment A, F-69424 Lyon 03, France; [Couray-Targe, Sandrine; Ganne, Christell] Hosp Civils Lyon, Pole Informat Med Evaluat Rech, Dept Informat Med, F-69424 Lyon, France; [Badet, Lionel] Hosp Civils Lyon, Hop Edouard Herriot, Serv Urol, F-69437 Lyon, France; [Guerre, Pascale; Serrier, Hassan] Hosp Civils Lyon, Cellule Innovat Delegat Rech Clin & Innovat, F-69237 Lyon, France; [Labeye, Vanessa] Hosp Civils Lyon, Hop Edouard Herriot, Coordinat Hospitaliere Prelevement Organes & Tiss, F-69237 Lyon, France; [Farge, Pierre; Colin, Cyrille] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, F-69008 Lyon, France; [Hrifach, Abdelbaste] Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, HESPER EA 7425, F-69008 Lyon, France",CHU Lyon; CHU Lyon; CHU Lyon; CHU Lyon; CHU Lyon; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1,"Hrifach, A (通讯作者)，Hosp Civils Lyon, Pole Informat Med Evaluat Rech, Unite Evaluat Med Econ, 162 Ave Lacassagne,Batiment A, F-69424 Lyon 03, France.;Hrifach, A (通讯作者)，Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lyon, HESPER EA 7425, F-69008 Lyon, France.",abdelbaste.hrifach@chu-lyon.fr,"Serrier, Hassan/GVT-9517-2022; Guerre, Pascale/GXG-7161-2022","Serrier, Hassan/0000-0002-5920-1830; Guerre, Pascale/0000-0002-8182-1227",,,,,30,11,11,0,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Forestry economic theory is yet mainly concentrated on bilateral exchanges within market institutions. This paper shows how the harvest and regeneration of trees as the objectively observable outcome of forest management vary with the institutional framework Existing coordination theorems of market institutions are derived from a game theoretic interaction model which allows to extend the institutional setting towards political coordination of forest management. The analysis reveals that privately optimal harvest ages are restricted to fully internalized interdependence settings while external effects under collective ownership cannot be internalized via implicit coordination or exchanges of individual property rights. The derivation of an intertemporal model of public forestry goods provides empirically testable hypotheses on the evolution of forests within political institutional settings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This relationship may differ in European countries, where care is mainly delivered by nonprofit providers. In accordance with the economic theory of production, we estimate a total cost function for nursing home services using data from 45 nursing homes in Switzerland between 2006 and 2010. Quality is measured by means of clinical indicators regarding process and outcome derived from the minimum data set. We consider both composite and single quality indicators. Contrary to most previous studies, we use panel data and control for omitted variables bias. This allows us to capture features specific to nursing homes that may explain differences in structural quality or cost levels. Additional analysis is provided to address simultaneity bias using an instrumental variable approach. We find evidence that poor levels of quality regarding outcome, as measured by the prevalence of severe pain and weight loss, lead to higher costs.

Continuous regional anesthesia for outpatients has been shown effective but the economic impact on the perioperative process-related healthcare costs remains unclear. One hundred twenty consecutive patients were included in this assessor-blinded, prospective cohort study and allocated according to inclusion criteria in the day-care or in the in-patient group. Standardized continuous popliteal sciatic nerve block was performed in both groups for 48 h using an elastomeric pump delivering ropivacaine 0.2 % at a rate of 5 ml/h with an additional 5 ml bolus every 60 min. Outpatients were discharged the day of surgery and followed with standardized telephone interviews. The total direct health costs of both groups were compared. Moreover, the difference in treatment costs and the difference in terms of quality of care and effectiveness between the groups were compared. Total management costs were significantly reduced in the day-care group. There was no difference between the groups regarding pain at rest and with motion, persistent pain after catheter removal and the incidence of PONV. Persistent motor block and catheter inflammation/infection were comparable in both groups. There was neither a difference in the number of unscheduled ambulatory visits nor in the number of readmissions. Day-care continuous regional analgesia leads to an overall positive impact on costs by decreasing the incidence of unplanned ambulatory visits and unscheduled readmissions, without compromising on the quality of analgesia, patients' satisfaction, and safety.","[Saporito, Andrea; Anselmi, Luciano] Bellinzona Reg Hosp, Dept Anaesthesiol, Bellinzona, Switzerland; [Calciolari, Stefano; Ortiz, Laura Gonzalez] Univ Italian Switzerland USI, Mecop Inst, Lugano, Switzerland; [Borgeat, Alain; Aguirre, Jose] Balgrist Univ Hosp, Anaesthesiol Div, Zurich, Switzerland","Regional Hospital of Bellinzona & Valleys, San Giovanni; Universita della Svizzera Italiana; University of Zurich","Saporito, A (通讯作者)，Bellinzona Reg Hosp, Dept Anaesthesiol, Bellinzona, Switzerland.",andrea.saporito@eoc.ch,,"Aguirre, Jose/0000-0001-5417-6173; CALCIOLARI, STEFANO/0000-0002-7420-5194",Bellinzona Regional Hospital,Bellinzona Regional Hospital,"The authors express their gratitude to the employees of the clinical and financial departments of Bellinzona Regional Hospital, who provided resource use and cost data for the cost estimations.

The results show that the observed wages give a more positive perspective of the gender wage gap than offered ones. Furthermore, the existence of an important gender wage gap for reservation wages has been noted, which is possibly because women take charge of household and family caregiving tasks to a greater degree than men.

It, then, analyses to what extent the methodological differences between selected Futures Studies techniques (e.g. forecasting, trend analysis, Delphi, backcasting, causal layered analysis and integral futures approach) intersect with the conceptual and normative differences between contemporary theories of International Relations stemming from Realism, Liberalism, Constructivism, Post-structuralism, Normative Theory and Critical Theory. The paper characterizes the relevant futures techniques with reference to the theories of International Relations, and scrutinizes selected futuristic narratives of International Relations from a methodological perspective. It, then, elaborates how Futures Studies and International Relations can benefit from each other's strengths in terms of their methodologies and assumptions.

But there are few studies systematically discussing the interplay between online courses and global education equality quantitatively. Here, we indicate that online education is more like the global public goods with on-rival and non-excludable in consumption. We establish an educational outcome model and indicate that popularity of online education is likely to give rise to the human capital augmentation, both for developing and developed countries. And this growth stems from the characteristics of global public goods. To analyze the possibility of the potential growth, we suggest that an online education club would help countries to escape from the dominant strategies of Free ride, which is the common dilemma in public goods supply. So the cooperation would bring coordinated growth to countries with different advantages in educational resources. And this win-win situation offers an underlying driving force to the development of human capital and economics. This paper provides a view offering the deep understanding on reducing the gap of education outcome between countries, and get a coordinated development in the Internet or MOOCs Era. It gives more supports to the development of online education in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The enlightenment approach allows allocating a competitive price or, alternatively, a price that matches the recreational hunting cost for driven hunts associated with self-consumption. The starting point is information gathered from two surveys of 740 owners of hunting estates (supply side) and 557 hunters (demand side) in Andalusian forests. The results show that 76% of the total driven hunt spots for big game were self-consumed by owners in the 2009-2010 hunting season. Regarding the traditional AAS framework, self-consumption is nearly one million euros less when the enlightenment approach is considered. This lower bound, compared to the upper bound imputed through market prices in the AAS, allows simulating a range of values for hunting self-consumption and expanding policy recommendations for hunting management.

Because these two variables are determined simultaneously, researchers control endogeneity skews(e.g., reverse causality, omitted variables) when conducting empirical analysis. With these caveats in mind, the literature finds that a favourable work environment and high job security lead to better health conditions. Being employed with appropriate working conditions plays a protective role on physical health and psychiatric disorders. By contrast, non-employment and retirement are generally worse for mental health than employment, and overemployment has a negative effect on health. These findings stress the importance of employment and of adequate working conditions for the health of workers. In this context, it is a concern that a significant proportion of European workers (29 %) would like to work fewer hours because unwanted long hours are likely to signal a poor level of job satisfaction and inadequate working conditions, with detrimental effects on health. Thus, in Europe, labour-market policy has increasingly paid attention to job sustainability and job satisfaction. The literature clearly invites employers to take better account of the worker preferences when setting the number of hours worked. Overall, a specific flexicurity'' (combination of high employment protection, job satisfaction and active labour-market policies) is likely to have a positive effect on health.","[Barnay, Thomas] Univ Rouen, Dept Econ, Cream, Upec,Erudite,Tepp, 3 Ave Pasteur, F-76186 Rouen 1, France",Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Universite de Rouen Normandie,"Barnay, T (通讯作者)，Univ Rouen, Dept Econ, Cream, Upec,Erudite,Tepp, 3 Ave Pasteur, F-76186 Rouen 1, France.",barnay@u-pec.fr,"BARNAY, Thomas/F-6338-2015","BARNAY, Thomas/0000-0002-5107-6027",OECD Economics Department,OECD Economics Department,"I would like to thank Carissa Faulkner (OECD), Nathalie Greenan (Cee), Christine Le Clainche (Cee, Ens Cachan, Lameta), Patrick Lenain (OECD), Pierre-Jean Messe (Cee), Catherine Pollak (Drees) and Yann Videau (Upec, Erudite) for their comments on a preliminary version and Eric Defebvre (Upec, Erudite) for his help on Health at Work European policies.

During WWII, cohorts of men in the United States whose birthdays fell within particular intervals of time were required to register for the draft on specific dates. These policies created discontinuities in registration age, which subsequently resulted in discontinuities in graduation rates. Because mandatory registration ages fell as the war progressed, the independent variable, diploma receipt, can be measured in terms of both a high school and a college diploma. The results indicate that both forms of credentialing directly improve physical wellness and increase the utilization of health care. These effects are larger than those estimated using ordinary least squares.","[Woodworth, Lindsey] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Woodworth, L (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",lwoodworth@ucdavis.edu,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality through the Quality, Safety, and Comparative Effectiveness Research Training (QSCERT) Program [T32HS022236]","Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality through the Quality, Safety, and Comparative Effectiveness Research Training (QSCERT) Program","The author would like to thank Sarah Hamersma, Jonathan Hamilton, and Damon Clark for their helpful comments and suggestions.

In this article, I study the impact of an intensive in-service teacher training program on reading skills offered to kindergarten teachers in France. The program modifies the lesson content and encourages teachers to adapt instruction to student needs by dividing the class according to initial achievement. While assessing impact is usually difficult due to the presence of ability bias and teacher selection, I show that in this context, a value-added model that controls for school and teacher characteristics constitutes a legitimate strategy to estimate the treatment effect. Results show that all students benefiting from the program progressed in reading skills at the end of the year. Besides, weaker students progressed faster on less-advanced competences (such as letter recognition), while stronger students improved their reading skills. This suggests that teachers adjusted content to students' needs. Finally, a cost-effectiveness analysis reveals that the program is approximately three times more cost-effective than reducing class size in France. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to select the open unit trusts for investment, a fuzzy multicriteria evaluation method is proposed. This method is inspired by algorithms of ELECTRE I and III methods.

Credit, debit, liquidity, and funding valuation adjustments (CVA, DVA, LVA, and FVA) are simply introduced as modifications to the payout cash flows of the trade position. The framework is flexible enough to accommodate actual trading complexities such as asymmetric collateral and funding rates, replacement close-out, and re-hypothecation of posted collateral-all aspects which are often neglected. The generalized valuation equation takes the form of a forward-backward SDE or semi-linear PDE. Nevertheless, it may be recast as a set of iterative equations which can be efficiently solved by our proposed least-squares Monte Carlo algorithm. We implement numerically the case of an equity option and show how its valuation changes when including the above effects. In the paper we also discuss the financial impact of the proposed valuation framework and of nonlinearity more generally. This is fourfold: First, the valuation equation is only based on observable market rates, leaving the value of a derivatives transaction invariant to any theoretical risk-free rate. Secondly, the presence of funding costs makes the valuation problem a highly recursive and nonlinear one. Thus, credit and funding risks are non-separable in general, and despite common practice in banks, CVA, DVA, and FVA cannot be treated as purely additive adjustments without running the risk of double counting. To quantify the valuation error that can be attributed to double counting, we introduce a nonlinearity valuation adjustment (NVA) and show that its magnitude can be significant under asymmetric funding rates and replacement close-out at default. Thirdly, as trading parties cannot observe each others' liquidity policies nor their respective funding costs, the bilateral nature of a derivative price breaks down. The value of a trade to a counterparty will not be just the opposite of the value seen by the bank. Finally, valuation becomes aggregation-dependent and portfolio values cannot simply be added up. This has operational consequences for banks, calling for a holistic, consistent approach across trading desks and asset classes.","[Brigo, Damiano; Liu, Qing D.; Pallavicini, Andrea] Imperial Coll London, Dept Math, London, England; [Pallavicini, Andrea] Banca IMI, Largo Mattioli 3, I-20121 Milan, Italy; [Sloth, David] Danske Bank, Rate Opt & Inflat Trading, Copenhagen, Denmark",Imperial College London,"Brigo, D (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Dept Math, London, England.",damiano.brigo@imperial.ac.uk; daphne.q.liu@gmail.com; andrea.pallavicini@imperial.ac.uk; dap@danskebank.com,,,,,,,40,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-1009,,978-3-319-33446-2; 978-3-319-33445-5,SPRINGER P MATH STAT,,,2016,165,,,,,,3,35,,10.1007/978-3-319-33446-2_1,0.0,,,33,Economics; Mathematics; Statistics & Probability,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BM3QG,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000462538500001,0

It is highly controversial if any valuation adjustment besides the basic CVA should be taken into account, and if so, for what purpose. Even today, the handling of CVA, DVA, FVA, ...differs between the regulatory, the accounting, and the economic point of view. Eventually, if an agreement is reached that CVA has to be taken into account, it remains unclear if CVA can be modelled linearly, or if nonlinear models need to be resorted to. Finally, industry practice and implementation differ in several aspects. Hence, a unified theory and treatment of FVA and alike is not yet tangible. The conference Challenges in Derivatives Markets, held at Technische Universitat Miinchen in March/April 2015, featured a panel discussion with panelists representing different points of view: John Hull, who argues that FVA might not exist at all; in contrast to Christian Fries, who sees the need of all relevant costs to be covered within valuation but not within adjustments. Damiano Brigo emphasises the nonlinearity of (most) valuation adjustments and is concerned about overlapping adjustments and double-counting. Finally, Daniel Sommer puts the exit price in the focus. The following (mildly edited) record of the panel discussion repeats the main arguments of the discussants-ultimately culminating in the awareness that if everybody charges an electricity bill valuation adjustment, it has to become part of any quoted price.","[Brigo, Damiano] Imperial Coll London, Dept Math, London, England; [Fries, Christian P.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Math, Theresienstr 39, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Hull, John] Univ Toronto, Joseph L Rotman Sch Management, 105 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3E6, Canada; [Scherer, Matthias] Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Finanzmath, Pk Ring 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Sommer, Daniel] KPMG Financial Risk Management, D-60549 Frankfurt, Germany; [Werner, Ralf] Univ Augsburg, Wirtschaftsmath, Univ Str 14, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",Imperial College London; University of Munich; University of Toronto; Technical University of Munich; University of Augsburg,"Brigo, D (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Dept Math, London, England.",damiano.brigo@imperial.ac.uk; christian.fries@math.lmu.de; hull@rotman.utoronto.ca; scherer@tum.de; dsommer@kpmg.com; ralf.werner@math.uni-augsburg.de,,,,,,,7,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-1009,,978-3-319-33446-2; 978-3-319-33445-5,SPRINGER P MATH STAT,,,2016,165,,,,,,147,168,,10.1007/978-3-319-33446-2_8,0.0,,,22,Economics; Mathematics; Statistics & Probability,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BM3QG,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000462538500008,0

The approach was suggested 30 years ago and has only been applied two other times with market data and has never been applied in the recreation context. We model boat fuel as an essential input in the production of sportfish harvested offshore and trace the value of changes in harvest quality with shifts in the demand for boat fuel. To implement the model we generate the first estimate of the demand for sportfishing boat fuel using the infrequent-purchases model. The estimate of boat fuel price elasticity is more than six times larger than typical estimates for the household demand for automobile fuel. Our estimates of the value of fishing quality are similar to estimates using stated preference and travel cost methods, but have the advantage of being based on market purchases.","[Carter, David W.; Marvasti, Akbar; Liese, Christopher; Crosson, Scott] NOAA, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 75 Virginia Beach Dr, Miami, FL 33149 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Carter, DW (通讯作者)，NOAA, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 75 Virginia Beach Dr, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",david.w.carter@noaa.gov; akbar.marvasti@noaa.gov; christopher.liese@noaa.gov; scott.crosson@noaa.gov,"Carter, David W/G-7472-2016","Carter, David W/0000-0001-8960-7236",US Government,US Government,The views expressed herein are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of NOAA or any of its subdivisions.

From 1740 to 1806 a settlement campaign was underway in the very sparsely populated forest areas in the upper catchment of the Liswarta River. This was supported by the Prussian state and was later dubbed the Frederician colonisation. Frederician colonies were established in wooded areas with poor soils. They were most commonly colonies of woodcutters and pitch burners as well as industrial colonies with forges and smithies. In the catchment of the Upper Liswarta River, traces of past industrialisation can still be discerned relics of ancient mill races and channels supplying water to numerous smithies as well as levees and old pond basins. The landscape in the area studied still features hydro-engineering structures that were used to lower the water level in the Jezioro lake. The landscape of settlements and villages that were founded as forest colonies is also a relic of the Frederician colonisation in the area. The presentation of local nature and culture as interwoven throughout history opens as yet untapped opportunities for developing new forms of tourism in many rural and woodland areas.","[Fajer, Maria; Machowski, Robert; Rzetala, Mariusz; Waga, Jan Maciej] Univ Silesia, Katowice, Poland; [Rzetala, Mariusz] Jan Dlugosz Univ, Czestochowa, Poland",University of Silesia in Katowice; Jan Dlugosz University,"Fajer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Silesia, Katowice, Poland.",,"Machowski, Robert/M-4911-2018; Machowski, Robert/Z-2122-2019; Fajer, Maria/F-7559-2013; Rzetala, Mariusz/A-8540-2012","Machowski, Robert/0000-0002-8408-6790; Rzetala, Mariusz/0000-0002-5155-3524",,,,,14,1,1,0,6,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,531,538,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200069,0

While the goal to halve global poverty has been achieved, advancement toward halving global hunger is not on track. Nearly 850 million people worldwide still suffer from chronic hunger. Besides, undernutrition remains prevalent. More than 2 billion people suffer from deficiencies in essential micronutrients, such as iron, zinc and vitamin A, and about the same number of people around the globe are overweight or obese. The global community should aim to end hunger and undernutrition by 2025, although evidence on how to effectively end the growing challenges of overweight and obesity remains limited. This goal needs to be prioritized for economic and ethical reasons. Due to adverse impacts on human capital formation and productivity, hunger and undernutrition lead to large global economic losses. Hunger and undernutrition also lead to human suffering, but the economic returns of investing in their elimination can be very high. To achieve this goal, governments and donors must allocate sufficient resources and pursue appropriate policies and investments. The experience of countries such as Brazil, China, Thailand and Vietnam in reducing hunger and undernutrition suggest that it is realistic to strive for this goal by accelerating the pace of reduction. To this end, horticultural value chains have a critical role to play in ensuring an adequate supply of nutrient-dense foods as well as enhancing incomes of smallholder farmers.","[Fan, S.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Fan, S (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,,,,,,43,5,5,1,7,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62611-36-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2016,1126,,,,,,9,20,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1126.2,0.0,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BI1PC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406635200002,0

The paper presents an approach for dynamic project portfolio management based on the Analytic Network Process (ANP) model. The ANP model consists of four basic clusters (projects, resources, criteria, time) with their elements and influences. An important factor of the proposed ANP model is time.

In addition to estimating the amount of stress in particular countries, we investigate its sources by breaking it down into its fundamental parts, covering how it is a result of country-specific macroeconomic divergences and the EMU-wide non-fundamental component, with special attention given to the role of missed forecasts. Our results confirm that peripheral countries were exposed to risks emerging from low interest rates while the core countries did not suffer from much monetary policy stress. Interestingly, the bulk of it was non-fundamental, i.e., not caused by inflation and output gap differentials between countries. We show that missed forecasts did make an important contribution to this part of the stress and were mainly responsible for pushing the interest rate below its rule-consistent level.","[Gajewski, Pawel] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, POW 3-5, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Gajewski, P (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, POW 3-5, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland.",pawelg@uni.lodz.pl,"Gajewski, Pawel/G-3570-2013","Gajewski, Pawel/0000-0002-8220-2081",,,,,34,5,5,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Using large-scale census firm data from China, we investigate the determinants of this kind of reverse privatization and its impact on firm performance. We find that (1) the decision of reverse privatization by Chinese private firms is affected by local political risk, firm-level financial characteristics, and industry-level characteristics, (2) the reverse privatization significantly affects the firm's performance, which is measured in different proxies but the effects are not consistent, and (3) moreover, we find that the benefit of reverse privatization decreases as government ownership increases. Our results suggest that the prevalence of reverse privatization in China is a political outcome, which is affected by the trade-off of political risk and political privilege. Our work suggests that political risk and political considerations are the main driving factors of privatization, or its opposite, reverse privatization. Reverse privatization, to some extent, is a rational choice in some transition economies.

It is known that communicative activities are built densely in business processes and often predetermine performance of the last. We believe that the binding objectives, coordination of economic interests, a combination of organizational values, coordination of actions of specific business units are carried out by exploiting their communicational resources. The research concept consists in establishment of influence on effective interaction of partners of an activity rate of their communication activities. The cooperated forms allow to take additional incomes in the form of excess profit which source are cumulative inventories of the communication equity of the partner organizations. At the same time highly competitive organizational systems differ considerably in bigger degree of communicative activity. We believe that the most acceptable way of an assessment of extent of influence of communicative factors on a condition of the organization is the matrix form constructed on the basis of coordinates of activity and intensity. The matrix allows to identify as a first approximation dependence of the organization on communication processes. Besides, application of a matrix of communication organization development gives the chance to accurately establish a vector of change of a condition of the organization by means of activization of its communication resources. Depending on types of activity and the markets in which it operates, communicative activity and communication intensity are various. Communicative activity is expressed in initiation of interactions, and communication intensity characterizes productivity of the established connection. Thus, it becomes possible to receive the complex vision of results of organizational development which is spread out to quantitative and high-quality parameters. Use of a matrix of communication development is seen in two directions: first, in diagnosing of level of communication development, and, secondly, in strategic management by the organization. The strategic aiming of the offered tool is realized in its capability to designate options of transformational shifts by scanning communicative organization activity. It has been studied the opinions of focus groups, representedby the management team, the most important partners and non-management staff of several industrial and commercial companies in the North Caucasus Federal District of the Russian Federation, which showed a rather mixed picture concerning the communicative activity. Besides, data on the level of satisfaction with the external and internal communications giving an idea of the directions of transformation of business systems for the purpose of increase in their organizational effectiveness taking into account a satisfaction factor have been obtained. Degree of satisfaction with interaction, as communicative reaction to joint activities, acts as a significant condition in decision making. Thus, development of processes of interactions relies on management of the communicative factors and resources of business systems playing the leading role in acceptance of effective management decisions regarding potential opportunities of organizational development.","[Krivokora, Evgenia] North Caucasus Fed Univ, Inst Econ & Management, Stavropol, Russia",North Caucasus Federal University,"Krivokora, E (通讯作者)，North Caucasus Fed Univ, Inst Econ & Management, Stavropol, Russia.",,"Krivokora, Evgenia Ivanovna/H-1540-2016",,,,,,11,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,539,546,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200070,0

We attempt to solve this problem by analyzing online trade. Different from offline trade, inherent home bias is the only cause of online border effect because local governments are usually unable to restrict online trade. Thus, the difference between the border effect in online and offline trade can be reasonably interpreted as the existence of government protectionism in the offline market. We find a statistically significant difference between online and offline border effects in China, which can be interpreted as strong evidence that policy barriers remain significant and hinder interregional trade.","[Li, Qin; Li, Mingzhi; Luo, Jinfeng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Li, Q (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Weilun Bldg 123, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",liq.10@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Luo, Jinfeng/0000-0001-8812-0178",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273151],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors are grateful for the comments received from the 13th EBES Conference in Istanbul, the Singapore Economic Review Conference 2013, and the International Research Seminars at the School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University.

That paper intends to provide the meaning of work for HRM practitioners in Turkey. Main purpose of doing that is to examine the nature of HRM via the Turkish experience. The paper is grounding on the work concepts that are provided by John W. Budd. In his prominent study [The Thought of Work] Budd examines the meaning of work under ten different concepts on work. The paper is trying to find how Turkish HRM practitioners mean work and their approach run into which category. For that purpose, at first the paper will provide a general conceptual framework of Budd's study, then, depending that ten-conceptualisation- approach it will examine the data from HRM practitioners via a periodical, HR Dergi [HR Magazine] that publishes the interviews with those practitioners.

However, a range of problems unresolved still constrain the transition of Russia to a trajectory of sustainable innovative development. In particular, the discussions on choosing certain priorities of development which could set a powerful impetus for innovative modernization of the domestic economy and could facilitate the provision of its competitiveness in the context of formation of the new technological mode are being held up to the present. The place, occupied by technological modes in the national economies' development of different countries has been identified for justification of one's viewpoint on the problem under consideration. The undertaken analysis of the innovative development programs' has indicated that particular emphasis is being placed on the issues of energy saving and energy efficiency enhancement in the documents, elaborated in practically all countries. The article substantiates the thesis, that due to the current structure of the Russian economy with the dominant development of the energy sector, energy efficiency enhancement should be necessarily considered as a top priority that should be of the system nature, embracing the technological modernization's other priorities. It is only the ultimate concentration of the efforts that may boost the creation of competitive energy-efficient technologies, which, along with the nano-, bio-, information and nuclear technologies, should become the basic ones within the framework of the new technological mode of the economy's development. In compliance with the results of the study undertaken the proposals on forming the mechanism of energy saving and energy efficiency enhancement intensification, harmonization of legislation at various levels of economic management in the areas of energy saving and innovative activity, revitalization of public-private partnerships in the implementation of the organizational, financial, economic and legal support of priorities in the sphere energy saving and energy efficiency enhancement have been put forward.","[Melnik, A.

By aligning this work with current literature from the field of family business, the paper develops foresight be considering both the community and business aspects as part of a coherent whole. The future for the businesses owned and managed by the Pakistani community in Scotland is likely to be mixed, as some develop toward heritage business status whilst others fall victim to changing economic conditions.

The average treatment effect on the treated from matching methods for the welfare indicator variables (log-transformed household per adult equivalent income, poverty head count, poverty gap, and poverty severity) are robust against hidden bias arising from unobserved confounding variables that simultaneously affect assignment into frankincense forest cooperative firm membership and each of the welfare indicator variables.

Currently, the HIN comprises 16 horticultural industries (a mixture of regional and national industry organisations) which work directly with around 16,000 growers and land managers via their existing networks. Initially, significant skills in e-communication that enabled the development of tools and resources to deliver improved practice change outcomes were built up, along with personal development sessions and networking. Due to changing industry needs, the network has shifted priorities to exchange industry intelligence, collaborate and learn more about other horticultural industries through field walks and share lessons learnt. Member industry development officers (IDOs) and executive officers meet every two months and connect with researchers and government personnel to view relevant research in the field and laboratory and discuss policy proposals and outcomes from within DEPI and other organisations in an informal setting. To improve industry capability, targeted training events such as evaluation are offered. These are based on industry priorities and in co-operation with relevant institutions. As a result of the HIN program, member horticulture industries have a formal, regular and focused opportunity for networking and collaborating. This enables the industries to work together on a range of common issues, learn from each other's experiences, and achieve agreed outcomes.","[Treeby, J.; McConnell, S.] Dept Environm & Primary Ind Victoria, POB 905, Mildura, Vic 3502, Australia; [Hincksman, M.] Dept Environm & Primary Ind Victoria, POB 264, Woori Yallock, Vic 3116, Australia",,"Treeby, J (通讯作者)，Dept Environm & Primary Ind Victoria, POB 905, Mildura, Vic 3502, Australia.",,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62611-36-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2016,1126,,,,,,227,230,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1126.29,0.0,,,4,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BI1PC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406635200027,0

The question arising now is whether these costs can still be justified by the benefits that come with the currency union. While many of the benefits such as greater unity, stability and influence in a geopolitical sense are hard to quantify, previous research suggests that adopting a common currency also has more tangible advantages such as lower inflation and increased bilateral trade among member countries. This paper focuses on quantifying those benefits and finding a causal effect between joining a currency union and an increase in bilateral trade. In this paper we undertake a difference-in-differences analysis to answer a simple question: what happened to the trade of the new member countries after their entry into the Eurozone relative to the counterfactual approximated by the rest of the EU members who did not join during the relevant time period? The importance and difficulty of finding a convincing group of control countries led us to examine what happened to bilateral trade of some of the most recent Eurozone joiners, more specifically those joining after 2004. We used a conventional gravity approach for the main regression and the results fall within the range of previous estimates for the effect of joining the Eurozone on bilateral trade. More precisely, we have found that trade between the new member countries and their Eurozone partners has gone up by around 8% to 10% whereas the trade with non-Eurozone countries has not changed.","[Vamvu, Danusia; Miron, Dumitru; Miclaus, Paul; Tamas, Anca] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Econ & Int Affairs, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Vamvu, D (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Econ & Int Affairs, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Miron, Dumitru/AAW-4320-2020; Miclaus, Paul/HTO-1393-2023","Miron, Dumitru/0000-0003-0606-6329;",,,,,8,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,93,100,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200012,0

We explore the convergence between recent research in urban sustainability governance and crowdsourcing. This is done by reviewing the literature in order to acquire important evidence to support the inductive process of theory building, and to highlight the upcoming trends in participatory research and policy-making that exploit ICI' and Web 2.0 social software. Our analysis indicates that a transformative relationship between data and people creates new forms of distant search for solutions and decision making. We argue that interest in crowdsourcing has expanded from computing researches to social and environmental applications. This new practical dimension unlocks the futures of integration of crowdsourcing into best practices in the governance of sustainability in an urban context. Building on evidence that implementing crowdsourcing into the forthcoming governance of urban sustainability is increasingly recognised as a common priority, the paper suggests policy makers to devote more resources to ensure openness, transparency, interoperability and adaptability of crowdsourcing platforms.

A novel feature is that the decomposition is performed not only at the mean but also over the entire distribution of earnings. In addition, an entire state, rather than a few cities, is considered. This paper finds that at least 25.6 percent, and probably more, of the gap is unexplained by the main observable characteristics at the mean. More interestingly, the unexplained part grows moving up the distribution of earnings, which indicates the possibility of a glass-ceiling effect for women. Results provide new insight into gender wage gaps among the highly educated, theories and empirical analysis in labor economics, and quantification in the history of education.","Kookmin Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136702, South Korea",Kookmin University,"Sohn, K (通讯作者)，Kookmin Univ, Dept Econ, Jeongneung Gil 77 Jeongneung Dong Seongbuk Gu, Seoul 136702, South Korea.",ksohn@kookmin.ac.kr,,,,,,,45,6,6,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

In recent years the world has witnessed the rapid growth of the Chinese economy and an associated surge in demand for petroleum and oil products, alongside the emergence of alternative sources of oil and natural gas to those produced by OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) and Russia, such as Brazil's pre-salt reserves and shale gas in the United States. The US is undergoing a veritable energy revolution with its use of unconventional oil and natural gas production techniques in low-permeability reservoirs, chiefly shale gas. Brazil's prospects as an international player are on the rise thanks to the exploration of oil and natural gas from its pre-salt reserves, which could lead to exports of petroleum of over 2 million barrels/day. All these movements have a direct influence on the petrochemical industry. This article aims to foster discussions about the risks and opportunities facing the Brazilian petrochemical industry with the exploration of oil and natural gas in Brazil and unconventional sources in the United States.

We examine this phenomenon in a particular context: Advanced Placement (AP) exams in the United States. We exploit variation in the AP exam schedule from year to year which results in a student who takes two exams in one year having more or less time between the exams than a student who takes the same two exams in a different year. We find evidence that more time between exams results in higher scores, particularly on the second exam, and that this effect varies across different types of students. Our estimates suggest that a student taking two exams ten days apart is 6-8% more likely to pass them both than a student taking the same exams only one day apart. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Location, urbanicity, and education are associated with expenditures on certain types of fish products among ethnic Malays and Chinese only. Policy recommendations include targeting larger households with lower prices for bulk purchases and consuming households in older age groups. Efforts to promote regularity of fish product purchases should be directed toward urban Malay and Chinese households seeking convenient cooking methods, while measures to boost fresh fish consumption could be concentrated among higher-educated Malay households, given their unexpected lackluster consumption rates and expenditures.","[Tan, Andrew K.

The far future argument says that people should confront catastrophic threats to humanity in order to improve the far future trajectory of human civilization. However, many people are not motivated to help the far future. They are concerned only with the near future, or only with themselves and their communities. This paper assesses the extent to which practical actions to confront catastrophic threats require support for the far future argument and proposes two alternative means of motivating actions. First, many catastrophes could occur in the near future; actions to confront them have near-future benefits. Second, many actions have co-benefits unrelated to catastrophes, and can be mainstreamed into established activities. Most actions, covering most of the total threat, can be motivated with one or both of these alternatives. However, some catastrophe-confronting actions can only be justified with reference to the far future. Attention to the far future can also sometimes inspire additional action. Confronting catastrophic threats best succeeds when it considers the specific practical actions to confront the threats and the various motivations people may have to take these actions.

I study this question in the context of a 1957 amendment to the Mississippi marriage law that was aimed at delaying the age of marriage; changes included raising the minimum age for men and women, parental consent requirements, compulsory blood tests, and proof of age. Using a difference-indifferences design at the county level, I find that, overall, marriages per 1,000 in the population in Mississippi and its neighboring counties decreased by nearly 75 percent; the crude birthrate decreased between 2 and 6 percent; and school enrollment increased by 3 percent after the law was enacted (by 1960). An unintended consequence of the law change was that illegitimate births among young black mothers increased by 7 percent. I show that changes in labor market conditions during this period cannot explain the changes in marriages, births, and enrollment. I conclude that stricter marriage-related regulations that lead to a delay in marriage can postpone fertility and increase school enrollment.","Univ Calif San Diego, Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Bharadwaj, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",prbharadwaj@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,24,11,14,1,17,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

Some of these disturbances may be insured such as fire and/or storm in some European countries. However, forest insurance has trouble to spread in particular because of the existence of some brakes such as the forest insurance premium, often considered as too high compared to the profitability of the forest investment. In this context, we propose an actuarial insurance model to insure multiple natural hazards (windthrow, fire, insect outbreak) in forests that determine the insurance premium in different senarios. In particular, the scenarios differ in terms of the link between the hazards, either they are mutually independent or dependent, and in terms of the parametric solutions to the actuarial problem, either a discrete time period approach or a continuous one. We propose an application of the actuarial model to a silver fir (Abies Alba Mill.) stand in the Slovak Paradise region (Slovakia). We show that gross insurance premiums range from (sic)5.62/ha at a scale of 150,000 ha at age 150, to (sic)6312.81/ha at a scale of 15 ha at age 50. In addition, we show that the most efficient solution in terms of the minimisation of the gross insurance premiums is provided under the assumption of random occurrence of mutually independent natural hazards and with a continuous time period approach.

Against this background, many studies have recommended the use of informal institutions in the pursuit of officially-recognized local forest management. But informal institutions and formal institutions do not operate independently of each other in influencing how people act. Therefore, it is important to understand how formal and informal local forestry institutions interact with each other. This paper provides insights based on qualitative study of community, private and state forest contexts in Ghana. The findings indicate that when formal and informal local forestry institutions have common goals and both are functional, they complement each other to achieve the common goals. When they have common goals but only one institution is functional, the functional institution substitutes the non-functional one. When the goals diverge, the more functional institution outcompetes the other. When both institutions are non-functional, there is an institutional void that creates room for unregulated resource use. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, the performance of harvesting contractors has been the topic of many studies over the years, but few of these have investigated the critical issue of whether contractor performance is in alignment with downstream needs. Furthermore, no previous study has suggested a clear route that forest companies can take to promote alignment of their employed contractors. This paper presents a framework specifically designed to help managers measure and foster contractor alignment within their wood supply chain. The framework was tested on a large sample of harvesting contractors operating in Sweden, for which a performance survey and a statistical procedure was utilized to segment contractors into groups of varying levels of alignment with their customer company. Results from the test were then used to suggest to the customer's managers the most viable blend of four generic alignment approaches for each contractor group: active sourcing, adapted incentives, active use of power advantage, and tailored contractor development programmes. If implemented, such a structured but differentiated approach to contractor alignment should lead to the most beneficial response from each contractor, and eventually to improved performance of the wood supply chain. Consequently, forest companies need to use, and be proficient in the use of, a variety of approaches to contractor alignment to make the most of their contractor force. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We use the indices recently introduced by Bennett and Hatzimasoura (Poverty measurement with ordinal data. Institute for International Economic Policy, IIEP-WP-2011-14, 2011), which can be interpreted as ordinal counterparts of the classical Foster et al. (Econometrica 52(3):761-766, 1984) poverty measures. We decompose changes in self-reported health poverty over time into within-group health poverty changes and population shifts between groups. We also provide statistical inference for the Bennett and Hatzimasoura's (Poverty measurement with ordinal data. Institute for International Economic Policy, IIEP-WP-2011-14, 2011) indices. Results suggest that when fair self-reported health status is chosen as a health poverty threshold all of the used indices indicate the growth of health poverty in Britain. However, when the health poverty threshold is lower (poor self-reported health status) the increase in health poverty incidence was compensated by decreasing average health poverty depth and improving health inequality among those who are poor with respect to health. The subgroup decompositions suggest that the most important factors accounting for the changes in total health poverty in Britain include a rise of both health poverty and population shares of persons cohabiting and couples with no children as well as an increase of the population of retired persons.","Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Brzezinski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland.",mbrzezinski@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Brzezinski, Michal/N-3365-2013","Brzezinski, Michal/0000-0002-7704-3805",,,,,17,11,13,6,44,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

With only idiosyncratic harvest uncertainty, we show that frictionless post-harvest quota trade can achieve full efficiency and eliminate quota-overage discards completely. In the absence of such trade, we deduce an ad valorem tax/subsidy that eliminates discards while delivering a desired aggregate harvest target. Alternatively, we show that a hybrid policy, i.e., a combined quota and landings fee, can implement a manager's aggregate target harvest level efficiently and without discards. When harvest shocks, in addition, have a fishery-wide common component, post-harvest quota trading per se cannot eliminate discards; policy intervention in the form of either landing taxes or a hybrid scheme is needed. Given the prevalence of trading restrictions in many quota-managed fisheries worldwide, our paper offers important policy advice. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Value chains of hake, anchovy and mackerel, were studied and two alternative methodologies were undertaken, one based in structural models for agricultural markets and the other analyzing cointegration across the prices at the different levels of the value chain. For domestic seafood production, a perfect competitive framework could be rejected, and no price transmission along the chain was found. For imports, price transmission increased due to the power exercised by traders on producers in the origin countries. In species where the supply is dominated by local product, the margin of traders depends on origin prices. However, traders can influence producer prices in international markets, what increase their margins. Consequently, traders are interested in those species where the supply is dominated by imports, which provides more possibilities to increase their margins.","[Fernandez-Polanco, Jose; Llorente, Ignacio] Univ Cantabria, Dept Business Adm, IDES, E-39005 Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Fernández-Polanco, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Dept Business Adm, Fac CC Econ, Ave Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",jm.fernandez@unican.es,"Fernadez Polanco, Jose/JZC-9271-2024; Llorente, Ignacio/AAY-8397-2020","Llorente, Ignacio/0000-0001-9426-0601; Fernanadez-Polanco, Jose/0000-0001-6456-3492",,,,,58,18,19,1,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

Profitable, cheap factory-farmed chicken is dependent on large-scale, industrial throughput, yet those very same intensive conditions pose real risks for disease outbreaks. Campylobacter in poultry is now the main reported cause of food poisoning in the UK, responsible for more than 100 deaths a year. In this paper, drawing upon fieldwork from across the poultry supply chain, we argue that the intersection of just-in-time pressures, commercial and regulatory, with particular practices of biosecurity on farms and in processing factories, provides prime conditions for the amplification and spread of Campylobacter. We go on to argue that such ecologies of poultry production are best understood as part of a relational economy of disease, and that the very control exercised over the lives of farmed birds risks reversal into ever greater insecurity.","[Allen, John] Open Univ, Fac Social Sci, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Lavau, Stephanie] Univ Plymouth, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",Open University - UK; University of Plymouth,"Allen, J (通讯作者)，Open Univ, Fac Social Sci, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England.",allen@open.ac.uk; stephanie.lavau@plymouth.ac.uk,,"Lavau, Stephanie/0000-0001-8942-451X",Economic and Social Research Council (UK) [RES-062-23-1882]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G034974/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G034974/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council (UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (UK) [RES-062-23-1882].,,47,19,20,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Simulating the co-production of sustainability knowledge,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Varieties of transdisciplinarity; Teaching; Sustainable development; Criteria and indicators,EDUCATION,"Despite its many advantages, teaching transdisciplinary is a costly enterprise. Transferring diverse theoretical, methodological, and practical skills may require several teaching staff; developing meaningful stakeholder interaction is time-intensive; and managing the research process demands significant efforts in logistics and coordination. This article seeks to make two distinct contributions. Conceptually, it introduces a framework for distinguishing between soft, inclusive, reflexive, and hard transdisciplinarity, based on the notion that there are diminishing returns to all features of the practice. Empirically, it examines a classroom simulation - the Sustainable Development Indicator Exercise (SDIE) - as an example of soft transdisciplinarity. In the SDIE interdisciplinary student groups play the role of policy advisers. Building on a concrete transdisciplinaly research project, they explore their understanding of sustainability, develop a multi-criteria decision making method for assessing sustainability criteria and indicators, elaborate and present their results, and reflect on their experience. All aspects of the exercise follow the logic of role playing: organizing group interaction, distributing responsibilities, interacting with their political principal, presenting their findings, and evaluating their progress. Experience from the simulation reveals insights into ways students address and express concerns with objectivity, transparency, deliberation, and balancing sustainability; it also points to ways for moving beyond soft transdisciplinarity.

We used data from a discrete choice experiment (CE) with attributes describing changes in the quality of the forest and recreation. The choice experiment technique makes it possible to disentangle the effect of the trait of altruism and environmental concern with regard to different attributes and their levels. Environmental attitudes were measured using the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale, whereas the trait of altruism was determined using the Self-Reported Altruism (SRA) scale. The parameterization employed in the survey was a WTP space model. Results show that both altruism and environmental concerns have significant effects on the amount people are willing to pay for changes in forest management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

There are several deficiencies of this approach. First, this is appropriate for elliptical distributions only and it fails to recognize the well-known stylized facts of financial assets returns. Second, Pearson correlations are usable in representing non-linear dependencies even if these are present between returns, in which effect they cannot constitute a general measure of dependence. The goal of the paper is to highlight a possibility of applying an alternative approach to modelling dependencies between financial assets returns based on the concept of copulas and the concept of rank correlation.

The paper aims to investigate the influence of corporate governance of the banks that operate in the cooperative credit system on performance and quality of loans, over the years 2010-2011-2012. The analysis is conducted on a sample composed of 48 Italian banks, divided into 24 cooperative banks and 24 popular banks. The sample is made up of banks from all over Italy and very different in terms of dimension. The methodology of analysis is based on multivariate OLS regressions. The main results refer to the presence of significant relationships between board dimension and the quality of loans, and among the number of committees and performance and the quality of loans. The presence of a significant and negative relationship between the board dimension and the ratio of impaired loans to gross loans, indicates the possibility that enlargement of board dimension allows a better quality of loans. The presence of a positive relationship between the number of committees and the ratio of impaired loans to gross loans signals the possibility that a greater number of committees can produce a worse quality of loans. The presence of a negative relationship between the number of committees and bank performance suggests to limit and manage the complexity of governance in banks operating in the cooperative credit system.","[Bussoli, Candida; Gigante, Marisa; Tritto, Maria Bruna] Univ LUM Jean Monnet, SS 100 Km 18, Bari, Italy",Lum Jean Monnet University,"Bussoli, C (通讯作者)，Univ LUM Jean Monnet, SS 100 Km 18, Bari, Italy.",bussoli@lum.it; ma.gigante@lum.it; marytritto28@hotmail.it,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,432,441,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000040,0

The community member states with some exceptions, are among the least developed countries in the world with low level of human development. In addition to the low level of human development, the study also shows unsatisfactory results in many indicators of progress towards convergence process. The study concludes that ECOWAS as an economic community has failed to satisfactorily function in eliminating disparities within member countries in terms of human development.

Its aim is to contribute to the enhancement of the scientific quality of integrated knowledge. The synthesis is the common result that has to be achieved through processes of integration. In order to be successful and lead to scientifically valid results, such processes of integration have to be convincing in terms of methods and in terms of epistemology. However, in inter- and trans-disciplinary projects, the fact that methods of integration have to be chosen and described in a way that allows a judgement of the validity and scope of findings is often neglected. Furthermore, there is a marked lack of concern in many such projects about the epistemic challenges that should be met in order to integrate knowledge originating from different fields. We introduce the Inventory of Synthesis, an instrument developed to facilitate the epistemic analysis and description of the integrated results of inter- or trans-disciplinary research and to identify where methods of integration are needed. This instrument thus helps to link the connected issues of the epistemic structure of the synthesis and of the choice of integration methods. Referring to the results of an interview study, we discuss the special challenge transdisciplinary research has to cope with in dealing with non-academic knowledge. We endorse a double perspective, one from the point of view of inquiring into processes of integration and one from the point of view of designing and implementing them. Because we observe how the scholarly discourse on inter- and trans-disciplinary research and the demands accompanying the practical work in such projects risk drifting apart, we call for an approach to integration taking into account research findings on such processes and for research into integration informed by practical needs.

Methods: Fixed regression models using monthly data on per capita prescriptions claims and consultations between 2009 and 2013 at the municipality level, before and after the introduction of the electronic prescription system. Results: The electronic prescription system with no copayment increased the number of prescriptions by between 6.0 and 8.1 %. It decreased the average size of each prescription, but it did not decrease the number of consultations. Conclusion: The reduced direct and indirect costs of obtaining prescriptions after the introduction of the electronic prescription system changed the financial incentives facing the patients and physicians.

This has also been the case for Romania which, beginning with September 2014, has started the process of issuing and of using such cards.

In this paper, we applied analytic network process (ANP) with benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks (BOCR) to evaluate four existing wood extraction methods (rubber-tired skidder, tracked skidder, cable logging and animal skidding) and select the best one based on SFM strategies in the Caspian (Hyrcanian) Forest, in northern Iran. The required data were obtained either from the previous studies or through pairwise comparisons conducted by a panel of forest engineering experts. Based on the BOCR subnetworks and their corresponding criteria, four alternatives were synthesized. ANP analysis indicated that the benefits and risks were more important in terms of decision-making, compared to the opportunities and costs. Finally, the alternative of 'rubber-tired skidder' was selected as the most suitable method for meeting SFM strategies. The decision framework proposed in this study offers a means for the reorganizing and planning of timber harvesting operations as an integral step toward SFM. By making minor adjustments for local conditions, this decision framework can be adapted for many other regions and countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In 2009-2011, the Basel Accords were revised once more with the intent of establishing financial regulations that would prevent future stampedes on the financial markets. This could be seen as the introduction of a new order in which markets are, indeed, governed through standards. However, this paper argues that Basel III is, like its predecessors, caught in rhetorically charged performation struggles in which neoliberal principles continue to hold sway, and may, at best, be seen as postliberalism in the making. Beginning from a reconceptualization of the theory of performativity of economics that highlights the contingent and political nature of performative agency, the empirical argument is substantiated through textual-intertextual analysis of the rhetorical circulation of affective signs in the Basel III negotiations.","[Just, Sine Norholm] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Porcelaenshaven 24, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",,"Just, SN (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Porcelaenshaven 24, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",snj.dbp@cbs.dk,,,,,,,49,1,1,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Such a comprehensive approach to enterprise financial situation assessment makes it more resistant to changes of business conditions, and thus should be more objective in comparison with econometric models basing on several, often limited in terms of information, financial ratios. In addition, it should be noted, that the use of fuzzy logic allows for significant flexibility in both - the model-creating step and during its later use.

If universities and faculties are to be successful in a highly competitive environment then they must satisfy the needs of their main customers, the students.","[Toma, Sorin-George] Siedlce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, Siedlce, Poland; Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest,"Toma, SG (通讯作者)，Siedlce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, Siedlce, Poland.",tomagsorin62@yahoo.com,"Toma, Sorin-George/AFC-5952-2022","Toma, Sorin-George/0000-0001-9116-7751",,,,,16,0,0,0,0,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2457-483X,,,PROC BASIQ,,,2015,,,,,,,441,448,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK2IL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000432877200054,0

In line with that, serious questions are being raised about the desirability of the level of reindustrialisation modern economies are currently experiencing. This topic is even more important for transition economies in which deindustrialisation occurred at significantly lower levels of GDP.

Now we focus on the question whether share markets perform random walk. When analysing we proceed from the following idea. In the case that a share rate makes a random walk, other step should not be dependent on the previous step. Provided that, the probability of the transition from any state i to the state j should be equal to the relative frequency of the state j and should be equal to the fixed vector components. The transition probability matrix should be identical to the limit matrix. The study is carried out on the day prices changes of three share titles CEZ, KB, O2.

In 1994, there was a major change in South African society in comparison to previous political development. The politics of apartheid was officially refused and new liberal democratic Constitution was implemented. This new Constitution guarantee rights to all members of the society without any exclusion. However, the reality is rather different from the ideals defined in the Constitution. The history of last twenty years (1994-2014) has shown that there are very significant new cleavages (conflicts lines) in the society of Republic of South Africa. What it is possible to observe nowadays is a shift from the conflict line black versus white people to the conflict line majority vs. minorities. Undoubtedly, the racial aspects are still very important but it is obvious that since 1994 there is a rise of new challenges regarding the status of minorities in the society. The aim of this study is to describe these new cleavages that appear in the society of Republic of South Africa. Special attention will be headed to the sexual (LGBT) and religious minorities. In last two decades, there have been cases of the various attacks on these minorities. What can be observed in post-apartheid South Africa is the rise of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and the hate of LGBTs. The examples of concrete events will be used in order to explain the discussed trends and phenomena. In terms of methodology, this article shall be seen as a preliminary study and survey. Thus, descriptions of the discussed issues shall be the main method that is used. The available primary and secondary sources of literature will be studied and analyzed. As the topic of this article is very contemporary, most of the thesis cannot be confronted with the conclusions of other authors. It is also necessary to emphasize that the described trends cannot be considered as having been completed yet, thus the presented conclusions cannot be understood as definitive.

The achieved results shall be confronted with the existing theories related to the cleavages in society (especially the works of Seymour M. Lipset and Stein Rokkan).

With a few exceptions, they move from donor to recipient through incentive systems, including high rates of compensation and frank payment. Recently, women have turned in small but growing numbers to private oocyte banking as a way to preserve and defer their fertility. This paper draws on interviews with both clinicians and clients to consider the ways that women use private banking to manage fertility. It argues that the move from purchasing third-party fertility to private banking is a move from a scarcity economy, where lack is resolved in exchange (Simmel), to an economy of singularities (Karpik) where the autologous genetic signature of the materiel renders it non-commensurable. Hence, its value can only be realised through preservation and private retention.","[Waldby, Catherine] Univ Sydney, Fac Arts, Sociol & Social Policy, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Waldby, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Fac Arts, Sociol & Social Policy, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",catherine.waldby@sydney.edu.au,,"Waldby, Catherine/0000-0002-5989-9917",Australia Research Council [FT100100176]; Australian Research Council [FT100100176] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australia Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This work was supported by the Australia Research Council [grant number FT100100176].,,49,26,28,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The study found that even though there has been a significant increase in REDD+ research since 2007, there are variations in country and regional studies as well as significant gaps in the REDD+ literature. However, there is optimism that promising forthcoming research in the post-Paris Agreement era will cover the existing gaps in REDD + literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We compare prominent statistical models for cost-effectiveness analysis alongside randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and covariate adjustment to assess their performance and accuracy using data from a large RCT. Seemingly unrelated regressions, linear regression of net monetary benefits, and Bayesian generalized linear models with various distributional assumptions were used to analyse data from the TASMINH2 trial. Each model adjusted for covariates prognostic of costs and outcomes. Cost-effectiveness results were notably sensitive to model choice. Models assuming normally distributed costs and effects provided a poor fit to the data, and potentially misleading inference. Allowing for a beta distribution captured the true incremental difference in effects and changed the decision as to which treatment is preferable. Our findings suggest that Bayesian generalized linear models which allow for non-normality in estimation offer an attractive tool for researchers undertaking cost-effectiveness analyses. The flexibility provided by such methods allows the researcher to analyse patient-level data which are not necessarily normally distributed, while at the same time it enables assessing the effect of various baseline covariates on cost-effectiveness results.","[Mantopoulos, Theodoros; Welton, Nicky J.] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Bristol, Avon, England; [Mitchell, Paul M.; Andronis, Lazaros] Univ Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Publ Hlth Bldg, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [McManus, Richard] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Primary Hlth Care Sci, Oxford, England",University of Bristol; University of Birmingham; University of Oxford,"Andronis, L (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Publ Hlth Bldg, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",l.andronis@bham.ac.uk,,"Mitchell, Paul/0000-0002-7593-4460; Andronis, Lazaros/0000-0001-7998-7431; Welton, Nicky J/0000-0003-2198-3205; McManus, Richard/0000-0003-3638-028X","MRC; National Institute for Health Research; MRC [MR/K025643/1, G0802413, MR/L004933/2] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [1608555, G0802413, MR/K025643/1, MR/L004933/2, MR/L004933/1] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [CDF/01/017, NF-SI-0514-10114, NIHR-RP-02-12-015, RP-PG-1209-10051] Funding Source: researchfish",MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"We wish to thank Dr Manuel Gomes for his comments and useful discussion on an earlier version of the paper, presented at the Health Economics Study Group (Sheffield, January 2014).

Only a limited number of studies have linked justice policies to outcomes beyond crime, particularly education, which carries large monetary and non monetary benefits. The current study relies on detailed administrative data and unique policy rules under which youth are assigned to behavioral treatment programs. The administrative data allow for a rich set of controls for observed family- and youth-specific heterogeneity. In addition, the treatment assignment rules create discontinuous thresholds among youth who are deemed eligible or not eligible for treatment, rules which the study exploits empirically to address the non-random selection bias in estimating plausibly causal effects of treatment eligibility and treatment receipt. Estimates indicate that certain types of intensive mental health intervention can lower dropout and increase high-school completion for justice-involved youth. Effects on grades are negative or not significant, possibly due to the greater retention of less academically-skilled students. We also assess heterogeneity in the treatment effects, and find that the effects on dropout tend to be greater among youth believed to be less academically engaged prior to treatment.

Indonesian political entities utilise the regimes to pursue bureaucratic benefits and national interests. Forest Management Units (FMUs) comprise our heuristic model. We identified international and domestic actors and institutions that underlie the concept of FMUs and how FMUs are implemented along with the actors' interests. We built our framework and propositions based on bureaucratic politics theory and the theorem on pathways of influence. We used observations, content analysis, and expert interviews to distinguish among actors and institutions, as well as various actors' interests in FMU development. We found that the German government, via the German company Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ), is the most powerful actor behind FMUs. International actors have dual motivations for supporting FMUs: (i) formally, they want to find the clearest, most efficient way to invest their international cooperation funds in tropical countries and to counter global deforestation; and (ii) informally, they want to counter the influence of Indonesian palm oil plantations. In addition, international interests could be contrary to domestic interests in terms of utilising FMUs. There is a strong, converging concern shared by international and domestic actors, whereby domestic actors use the formal goals of international regimes to pursue domestic interests. Domestic bureaucracies use FMU programmes to relocate power back to the central bureaucracies by preparing instruments that are formally in line with international regimes, but informal in that these instruments are dominated by domestic bureaucracies. For example, the instruments include reinforcing state forest areas, promoting forest benefits, centralising the budget, capacity building, and centralising information. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

How reliable? Which programs are different?,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Accountability; Teacher training; Heterogeneity,STUDENT-ACHIEVEMENT; HETEROGENEITY; INFERENCE,"Sixteen US states have begun to hold teacher preparation programs (TPPs) accountable for teacher quality, where quality is estimated by teacher value-added to student test scores. Yet it is not easy to identify TPPs whose teachers are substantially better or worse than average. True teacher quality differences between TPPs are small; estimated differences are not very reliable; and when many TPPs are compared, multiple comparisons increase the danger of misclassifying ordinary TPPs as good or bad. Using a large and diverse dataset from Texas, we evaluate statistical methods for estimating teacher quality differences between TPPs. The most convincing estimates come from a value-added model where confidence intervals are widened by the inclusion of teacher random effects (or teacher clustering in large TPPs) and further widened by the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Using these confidence intervals, it is rarely possible to tell which TPPs, if any, are better or worse than average. The potential benefits of TPP accountability may be too small to balance the risk that a proliferation of noisy TPP estimates will encourage arbitrary and ineffective policy actions.

We model levels of anxiety among young homeowners carrying mortgage debt before and after the recession as an early indicator of how the crisis affected the experience of home loans. The positive effects of being a mortgaged homeowner before the recession declined significantly after the housing crisis.

We make both an original empirical and analytical contribution by suggesting that notions of governance and metagovernance failure are important for analyzing the development, tensions and contradictions of city region economic governance within the context of the UK Government's devolution and localism agenda (in particular Devolution Agreements). We consider that governance failure arises because of the primacy of a neoliberal-dominated strategy orientation towards the market and its failure in the delivery of skills. Governance and metagovernance mechanisms are unable to sufficiently coordinate effective responses to address a legacy of de-industrialisation, deep-rooted labour market and sociospatial inequalities.","[Etherington, David] Middlesex Univ, Ctr Enterprise & Econ Dev Res, London NW4 4BT, England; [Jones, Martin] Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",Middlesex University; University of Sheffield,"Etherington, D (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ, Ctr Enterprise & Econ Dev Res, London NW4 4BT, England.",d.etherington@mdx.ac.uk; martin.jones@sheffield.ac.uk,"Jones, Martin/ABI-6890-2020","Jones, Martin/0000-0002-4627-2293","ESRC, WISERD Civil Society [ES/L0090991/1]; IAA Grant, Making City-Regions Work: Inclusive Governance, Skills, and Labour Market Disadvantage; ESRC [ES/L009099/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L009099/1] Funding Source: researchfish","ESRC, WISERD Civil Society(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); IAA Grant, Making City-Regions Work: Inclusive Governance, Skills, and Labour Market Disadvantage; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","We would like to thank the anonymous referees and the editors of the Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society for their constructive feedback.

The framework that is developed in this paper suggests a donor-specific trade-off between fostering best performing universities and increasing university efficiency when introducing competitive funding in the university sector. We test this assertion based on a university-level panel dataset across eight European countries from 1994-2006. Estimating a simultaneous two-stage Stochastic Frontier Approach, we find that international public funds decrease the productivity of the best performing universities, which suggests a non-negligible effect because of the administrative burden induced by competitive funding. However, the competition for international public funds also disciplines universities as evidenced by a positive impact on efficiency. Conversely, tuition fees enhance the productivity of the best performing universities but increase the spread of universities with lower productivity, which suggests a strong sorting effect.

Our research represents the first econometric analysis of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) COBRA subsidy and contributes to a better understanding of consumer responses to government-subsidized private health insurance and discussions surrounding Affordable Care Act (ACA) policies. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we find that the subsidy is associated with a substantial increase in own-name employer coverage among the targeted group. We estimate a -0.38 to -0.27 price elasticity of demand for health insurance, depending on the specification. This suggests that consumers are somewhat more price sensitive than previously thought, although there are caveats to generalizing from past settings to individuals affected by ACA subsidies. We also find that part of the increase in subsidized coverage was offset by a decrease in unsubsidized non-group insurance.","[Moriya, Asako S.] AHRQ, Ctr Financing Access & Cost Trends, Rockville, MD 20857 USA; [Moriya, Asako S.; Simon, Kosali] Indiana Univ, SPEA, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Simon, Kosali] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Moriya, AS (通讯作者)，AHRQ, Ctr Financing Access & Cost Trends, Rockville, MD 20857 USA.",Asako.Moriya@ahrq.hhs.gov,,"simon, kosali/0000-0002-3231-1466",,,,,42,9,10,0,11,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

We use a rich administrative database composed of three sources: data of enrollment and graduation from the Chilean higher education system, test scores and labor market outcomes from the Chilean Unemployment Insurance database.

In the case of lung diseases in the national German hospital market, we therefore analyze the current structure of care, and forecast future trends in key process indicators. Methods We use standardized, patient-level, activity-based costing from a national cost calculation data set of respiratory cases, representing 11.9-14.1% of all cases in the major diagnostic category respiratory system'' from 2006 to 2012. To forecast hospital admissions, length of stay (LOS), and costs, the best adjusted models out of possible autoregressive integrated moving average models and exponential smoothing models are used. Results The number of cases is predicted to increase substantially, from 1.1 million in 2006 to 1.5 million in 2018 (+2.7% each year). LOS is expected to decrease from 7.9 to 6.1 days, and overall costs to increase from 2.7 to 4.5 billion euros (+4.3% each year). Except for lung cancer (-2.3% each year), costs for all respiratory disease areas increase: surgical interventions +9.2% each year, COPD +3.9%, bronchitis and asthma +1.7%, infections +2.0%, respiratory failure +2.6%, and other diagnoses +8.5% each year. The share of costs of surgical interventions in all costs of respiratory cases increases from 17.8% in 2006 to 30.8% in 2018. Conclusions Overall costs are expected to increase particularly because of an increasing share of expensive surgical interventions and rare diseases, and because of higher intensive care, operating room, and diagnostics and therapy costs.","[Vogl, Matthias; Leidl, Reiner] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, POB 1129, D-85758 Munich, Germany; [Vogl, Matthias; Leidl, Reiner] Univ Munich, Munich Sch Management, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Munich, Germany; [Vogl, Matthias; Leidl, Reiner] Munich Ctr Hlth Sci, Munich, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; University of Munich,"Vogl, M (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, POB 1129, D-85758 Munich, Germany.;Vogl, M (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Munich Sch Management, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Munich, Germany.;Vogl, M (通讯作者)，Munich Ctr Hlth Sci, Munich, Germany.",matthias.vogl@helmholtz-muenchen.de; leidl@helmholtz-muenchen.de,"Leidl, Reiner/GQY-7389-2022; Leidl, Reiner M/B-7209-2009; Vogl, Matthias/E-4944-2015","Leidl, Reiner M/0000-0002-7115-7510;",,,,,47,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

As a result, the Swedish Forest Agency (SFA) has requested further development of methods for broad consultation and active participation in order to strengthen the social values of forests. This paper aims to identify in particular the private forest owners' perceived need for collaboration and dialog regarding the social values of forests. The study's primary empirical data was derived from interviews with 40 private forest owners. A framework developed by Emerson et al. (2012) was applied to facilitate analysis of the forest owners' perceptions of procedural and institutional arrangements, existing leadership, the current level of knowledge and access to different types of resources. The paper identifies a need for the SFA to become more proactive and assume more of a leading role. The level of knowledge regarding social values was found to be quite low among the majority of the private forest owners. They wanted more information; they asked for increased support and advice, and they wanted to see improved coordination rather than collaboration on social values. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Existing explanations focus mainly on economic determinants, like the rise of intra-industry trade. We argue that the international trade institutions of the World Wade Organization (WTO) themselves are also key for understanding which type of interest mobilization is likely to arise. We contend that the institutional setting of issue-linkage based trade negotiations creates incentives for firms to work through broad sector-wide lobbying organizations, while judicial adjudication and enforcement in WTO dispute settlement stimulates de-linkage, leading to product-specffic interest mobilization. We illustrate how these two arguments can explain the coexistence of both sector-wide and product-specific lobbying in the contemporary international trade regime. We provide evidence on interest mobilization for United States (US) and European Union (EU) initiated WTO disputes, and on EU and US domestic interest organizations that mobilize during multilateral trade rounds or are present at WTO ministerial conferences.","[De Bievre, Dirk] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp Ctr Inst & Multilevel Polit, Int Polit, Antwerp, Belgium; [Poletti, Arlo] LUISS Guido Carli Rome, Dept Polit Sci, Int Publ Policy, Rome, Italy; [Poletti, Arlo] LUISS Guido Carli Rome, Sch Govt, Rome, Italy; [Hanegraaff, Marcel] Univ Amsterdam, Polit Sci, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Beyers, Jan] Univ Antwerp, Polit Sci, Antwerp, Belgium; [Beyers, Jan] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp Ctr Inst & Multilevel Polit, Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp; Luiss Guido Carli University; Luiss Guido Carli University; University of Amsterdam; University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp,"De Bièvre, D (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Antwerp Ctr Inst & Multilevel Polit, Int Polit, Antwerp, Belgium.;Poletti, A (通讯作者)，LUISS Guido Carli Rome, Dept Polit Sci, Int Publ Policy, Rome, Italy.;Poletti, A (通讯作者)，LUISS Guido Carli Rome, Sch Govt, Rome, Italy.;Hanegraaff, M (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Polit Sci, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Beyers, J (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Polit Sci, Antwerp, Belgium.;Beyers, J (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Antwerp Ctr Inst & Multilevel Polit, Antwerp, Belgium.",dirk.debievre@uantwerpen.be; apoletti@luiss.it; M.C.Hanegraaff@uva.nl; jan.beyers@uantwerpen.be,"De Bièvre, Dirk/G-2323-2018","De Bièvre, Dirk/0000-0003-3030-6492",,,,,60,14,14,0,12,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

We analysed the effect on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination initiation by girls aged 12-18 of two campaigns set up in Flanders (Belgium) in 2007 and 2009: a personal information campaign and a combined personal information and financial incentive campaign. We analysed (objective) data on HPV vaccination behaviour from the National Alliance of Christian Mutualities (NACM), Flanders' largest sickness fund. We used z-scores to compare the monthly proportion of girls initiating HPV vaccination over time between carefully selected intervention and control groups. Separate analyses were done for older and younger girls. Total sample sizes of the intervention (control) groups were 221 (243) for the personal information campaign and 629 (5,322) for the combined personal information and financial incentive campaign. The personal information campaign significantly increased vaccination initiation, with older girls reacting faster. One year after the campaign the percentages of vaccination initiation for the oldest girls were 64.6 and 42.8 % in the intervention and control group, respectively (z = 3.35, p = 0.0008); for the youngest girls the percentages were 78.4 and 68.1 % (z = 1.71, p = 0.09). The combined personal information and financial incentive campaign increased vaccination initiation among certain age groups. One year after the campaign the difference in percentage points for HPV vaccination initiation between intervention and control groups varied between 18.5 % (z = 3.65, p = 0.0002) and 5.1 % (z = 1.12, p = 0.26). Under a non school-based vaccination system, personal information and removing out-of-pocket costs had a significant positive effect on HPV vaccination initiation, although the effect substantially varied in magnitude. Overall, the obtained vaccination rates remained far below those realised under school-based HPV vaccination.","[Lefevere, Eva] Univ Antwerp, Herman Deleeck Ctr Social Policy, St Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Hens, Niel] Hasselt Univ, Ctr Stat CenStat, Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Hens, Niel; Beutels, Philippe] Univ Antwerp, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Modelling Infect Dis, Vaccine & Infect Dis Inst, WHO Collaborating Ctr, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [De Smet, Frank] Natl Alliance Christian Mutual, Brussels, Belgium; [De Smet, Frank] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Occupat Environm & Insurance Med, Leuven, Belgium; [Beutels, Philippe] Univ New S Wales, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Antwerp; Hasselt University; University of Antwerp; World Health Organization; KU Leuven; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Lefevere, E (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Herman Deleeck Ctr Social Policy, St Jacobstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",eva.lefevere@uantwerpen.be; niel.hens@uhasselt.be; frank.desmet@cm.be; philippe.beutels@uantwerpen.be,"Hens, Niel/M-4445-2017; Beutels, Philippe/A-1919-2010","Hens, Niel/0000-0003-1881-0637; Beutels, Philippe/0000-0001-5034-3595; De Smet, Frank/0000-0002-0656-5921",Research Foundation Flanders; Methusalem research Grant from the Flemish government; IAP Research Network of the Belgian State (Belgian Science Policy) [P7/06],Research Foundation Flanders(FWO); Methusalem research Grant from the Flemish government; IAP Research Network of the Belgian State (Belgian Science Policy)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office),The authors thank the NACM for collaborating in the research.

A long-term, nationwide analysis from Switzerland",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Social health insurance; Cream skimming; Risk adjustment; Switzerland,ADVERSE SELECTION,"Community rating in social health insurance calls for risk adjustment in order to eliminate incentives for risk selection. Swiss risk adjustment is known to be insufficient, and substantial risk selection incentives remain. This study develops five indicators to monitor residual risk selection. Three indicators target activities of conglomerates of insurers ( with the same ownership), which steer enrollees into specific carriers based on applicants' risk profiles. As a proxy for their market power, those indicators estimate the amount of premium-, health care cost-, and risk-adjustment transfer variability that is attributable to conglomerates. Two additional indicators, derived from linear regression, describe the amount of residual cost differences between insurers that are not covered by risk adjustment. All indicators measuring conglomerate-based risk selection activities showed increases between 1996 and 2009, paralleling the establishment of new conglomerates. At their maxima in 2009, the indicator values imply that 56 % of the net risk adjustment volume, 34 % of premium variability, and 51 % cost variability in the market were attributable to conglomerates. From 2010 onwards, all indicators decreased, coinciding with a pre-announced risk adjustment reform implemented in 2012. Likewise, the regression-based indicators suggest that the volume and variance of residual cost differences between insurers that are not equaled out by risk adjustment have decreased markedly since 2009 as a result of the latest reform. Our analysis demonstrates that risk-selection, especially by conglomerates, is a real phenomenon in Switzerland. However, insurers seem to have reduced risk selection activities to optimize their losses and gains from the latest risk adjustment reform.","[von Wyl, Viktor] Univ Zurich, Epidemiol Biostat & Prevent Inst, Hirschengraben 84, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland; [von Wyl, Viktor; Beck, Konstantin] CSS Inst Empir Hlth Econ, Tribschenstr 21, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland; [von Wyl, Viktor] Univ Bern, Inst Social & Prevent Med, Finkenhubelweg 11, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Beck, Konstantin] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Blumlisalpstr 10, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Bern; University of Zurich,"von Wyl, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Epidemiol Biostat & Prevent Inst, Hirschengraben 84, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland.",viktor.vonwyl@uzh.ch,,"von Wyl, Viktor/0000-0002-8754-9797",,,,,16,7,7,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has introduced the average (service) life multiplied by In(2) as so-called Half-Life (HL) to define the period for accounting carbon sequestration in wood products. This work investigates the dynamics of apparent HL and carbon content within three important categories of wood utilization (construction, furniture and packaging) considering sales on the wood product level in Austria for the period 2002 to 2011. Static HL for finished products derived from a literature study is used for upscaling information about carbon flows and associated HL to semi-finished HWP. From HL on the product level three category-His are derived. Averaged over 10 years, we find the following HIs: 33.0 years for construction, 8.5 years for furniture, and 1.4 years for packaging. For each category the shares of semi-finished HWP (sawnwood and wood-based panels) are determined. With this information, the average Kyoto-relevant HL for semi-finished HWP can be deducted. For the period 2002-2011, it is 9.5 to 16.6 years for sawnwood and 9.0 to 11.0 years for wood-based panels. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Those beginning in the fall experience a shorter break between the courses. We test whether the length of that gap explains the students' performance in the subsequent course. Initial results suggest that a longer gap is associated with lower grades. However, including student fixed effects eliminates the observed knowledge decay with a few exceptions: knowledge decay remains for students in language courses, for students with below-median SAT Math scores, and for students with majors outside STEM fields.

This has limited our understanding about patterns of agency and empowerment of women across countries. Measuring key dimensions of women's agency and empowerment is complex, but feasible and important. This paper systematically explores what can be learned from Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for fifty-eight countries, representing almost 80 percent of the female population of developing countries. It is the first such empirical investigation. The findings quantify some important correlations. Completing secondary education and beyond has consistently large positive associations, underlining the importance of going beyond primary schooling. There appear to be positive links with poverty reduction and economic growth, but clearly this alone is not enough.

This contribution examines the concept of gender norms and summarizes key insights from sociology and other social sciences. Norms do not float free: they are materialized in specific domains of social life and are often embedded in institutions. An automatic process of socialization cannot explain the persistence of discriminatory norms. Norms change in multiple ways, both in response to broad socioeconomic change and from the dynamics of gender relations themselves. Restructuring of gender orders, and diversity and contradictions in gender norms, give scope for activism. The rich literature on normativity supports some but not all approaches in feminist economics and indicates new possibility for the field.","[Pearse, Rebecca; Connell, Raewyn] Univ Sydney, Fac Educ & Social Work, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Pearse, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Fac Educ & Social Work, Bldg A35, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",rebecca.pearse@sydney.edu.au; raewyn.connell@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,94,97,112,1,56,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The current stage of the research is implemented in the conditions of significant growth of domestic tourism indicators. Due to the changing economic realities the consumer behaviour in the tourism sector of Russian citizens is changing in the direction of displacement of interest to domestic destinations and amateur travel forms. In this context, the creative team proposed the Concept of development of tourist routes of the Russian Federation. It is based on the principle of continuity of strategic objectives and targets in the system of split-level planning in terms of the issues of the development of transport systems and the development of inbound and domestic tourism in the Russian Federation. The project is being developed for the pilot areas within the boundaries of the Central Federal District of the Russian Federation. The main tasks of the Concept include transport infrastructure, involving the repair and reconstruction of more than 4 thousand kilometres of roads (both federal and regional), construction of new gas stations and space planning of new rest areas for motorists in accordance with existing national standards. High-quality transport links will make it possible to implement new tourist routes and destinations both within the subjects and in inter-regional aspect. According to the calculations, this will help ensure that the capacity of only 200 of those objects included in the program will increase up to 11 million tourists a year. Based on the results of work, conducted together with the Department of State Policy in the field of road infrastructure of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, the following was carried out: - the offer for a new ring segmented tourist road transport routes passing through the territory of the Russian Federation within the Central Federal District was formulated; - criteria for the selection of tourist attraction, which lay the basis for the proposed ring route were tested; - the basic stages of the programme implementation: the first one is the creation of a ring route and base segments; the second one is the development of an extensive network of inter-regional tourist routes were defined.","[Alexander, Fedulin; Tatiana, Krivosheeva; Olga, Vapnyarskaya] Russian State Univ Tourism & Serv, Cherkizovo, Russia",Russian State University of Tourism & Service,"Alexander, F (通讯作者)，Russian State Univ Tourism & Serv, Cherkizovo, Russia.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,929,935,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100121,0

In our previous papers, we computed the IS-LM equilibrium for the linear model and defined the dynamic system. In this work, we estimated the parameters using statistical data for Romania during 2001Q2-2014Q2 and computed the multipliers. These parameters and multipliers were further used to compute the coefficients of the two dimensional dynamic system. We further augmented the dynamic system, with an objective function, reflecting the sum of the square differences of the real actual government expenditures, from the values established by fiscal policy. We applied the Pontryagin's Principle in order to compute the optimal conditions of the optimal control problem. The overall dynamics of the economy is computed for short run, considering the monetary policy of constant stock of bound, using Runge-Kutta algorithm in MATLAB. The dynamics of the system was analyzed via phase diagram. The results reflect the fact that the economy is in an unstable zone, with expected inflation decreasing and real wealth increasing, fact that determines us to add an objective function for minimizing the square differences of the government expenditures from the stationary ones during 2016Q1-2017Q4.","[Andrei, Ana; Galupa, Angela; Georgescu, Irina Alexandra] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Econ Informat & Cybernet, Bucharest, Romania; [Androniceanu, Armenia] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Adm & Publ Management, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Andrei, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Dept Econ Informat & Cybernet, Bucharest, Romania.",aaeconomy@gmail.com; angela.galupa@csie.ase.ro; armenia.androniceanu@man.ase.ro; irina.georgescu@csie.ase.ro,"Georgescu, Irina/K-6435-2015; Androniceanu, Armenia/AAC-4697-2020","Georgescu, Irina/0000-0002-8536-5636;",,,,,12,17,17,0,5,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Unlike most extant studies, which compare the performance of local and foreign banks, we assess how foreign shareholdings affect bank efficiencies. We also apply resource-based theory to analyze whether the foreign shareholdings' countries of origin matter. We find that foreign shareholders from more developed countries enhance the bank's resource base. Those from Asia have the greatest effect, perhaps because of their proximity and familiarity. Moreover, excessive regulation stifles the host countries' profit efficiency potential. Finally, foreign shareholding concentration potentially enhances efficiencies by reducing agency costs.","[Chan, Sok-Gee; Koh, Eric H.

The paper dismisses the notion held in the literature that Integrated Reporting only began in 2010 (de Villiers, Rinaldi and Unerman, 2014) with the establishment of the Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). Furthermore, the ever changing needs of stakeholders contributed to the growth of different reporting systems (Financial Reporting, Balanced Scorecard, Triple Bottom Line, Sustainability Reporting and Integrated Reporting). The paper may provide regulators, reporting organisations and academics with an accountability context in which the evolution of Integrated Reporting occurred. The paper departs from the popular view that began in 2010 and offers insights of how the changing dynamics of accountability due to the continuous change in stakeholders' needs contributed to the birth and development of . The paper further challenges that while it may successfully overcome some of the limitations of Financial Reporting, Balanced Scorecard, Triple Bottom Line, Sustainability Reporting; it still has a long way to go in order to address its own shortcomings.","[Chikutuma, Chisinga N.] Univ South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Chikutuma, CN (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa.",,,,,,,,25,0,0,1,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-261-9,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,27,,,,,,34,44,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH1PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000398381700004,0

The Sanitary and Phytosanitary and Technical Barriers to Trade Agreements of the World Trade Organisation include provisions on disclosure of better information, on legal default rules and on debiasing through law that are similar to the ones proposed in the Behavioural Law and Economics literature to nudge governments towards specific directions. This happens even in the absence of a (centralised) social planner. The article further aims to use behavioural trade regulation to draw some general lessons for Behavioural Law and Economics; most importantly, to show that nudging may have a libertarian rather than a paternalistic result. Finally, the paper proposes that behavioural regulation should be complemented by learning facilities to debias government institutions and lead to social and institutional learning.","[Dimitropoulos, Georgios] Max Planck Inst Luxembourg Procedural Law, 4 Rue Alphonse Weicker, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",,"Dimitropoulos, G (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Luxembourg Procedural Law, 4 Rue Alphonse Weicker, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",georgios.dimitropoulos@mpi.lu,,,,,,,112,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,978-3-319-29562-6; 978-3-319-29560-2,ECON ANAL LAW EUR,,,2016,,,,,,,263,287,,10.1007/978-3-319-29562-6_14,0.0,,,25,Economics; Ethics; Law; Sociology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Sociology,BG6NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390674500015,0

There are companies with medium-sized databases expecting a dramatic increase of their data. These companies might contemplate the idea of adopting Big Data technologies with current single-node infrastructure, so that further transition to proper, distributed, Big Data architecture will run smoothly. How penalizing is this early adoption of a big data technology relative a classical solution based on a SQL database server? Considering general acknowledged benchmark TPC-H database schema, random records were inserted into PostgreSQL and Hive/Hadoop sub-schemas created for scale loadings between 0.1 and I. For each scale factor, 500 random, non-aggregate queries were generated. Main query parameters were the number of attributes in SELECT and WHERE clauses, number of joins, of BETWEEN, IN operator, number of values appearing in IN clauses, number of AND logical connectors, etc. Query execution durations were collected using jMeter.

SE as a specific mechanism for delivery of goods and services within the existing socio-economic system may not disregard the effectiveness and efficiency. The relationships between effectiveness and efficiency are very complex but, nevertheless, are one of the main issues dealt with by economic sciences. Currently, we can observe equating of the two terms, or rather treating them as complementary dimensions of the assessment of an organization activity. Combining both components we can talk about organizational effectiveness, i.e. the ability of a company to current and strategic adaptation to changes in the environment, as well as to productive use of resources in order to implement the adopted structure of objectives [38]. Activities of social economy organizations (social enterprises) should take into account appropriate relationships between the purpose, effect and effort. Therefore, the issues of efficiency and effectiveness should be treated as foreground elements in the process of implementing their social mission.","[Golenski, Wojciech] Univ Opole, Fac Econ, Ozimska 46a, PL-45058 Opole, Poland",University of Opole,"Golenski, W (通讯作者)，Univ Opole, Fac Econ, Ozimska 46a, PL-45058 Opole, Poland.",wgolenski@uni.opole.pl,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,5,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

In accordance with Gibrat's law which is also known as Law of proportionate effect, firm growth is the stochastic process that does not depend on firm size. The aim of this study is to test the validity of Gibrat's law at the sectoral level using 1-digit Statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community Rev.2 (NACE). Methods: The data are taken from database Albertina Gold Edition. The data for more than 36 thousand of Czech firms in the period 2008-2013 is used. To examine the relationship between firm size and firm growth, the linear auto-regression model is applied and subsequently F-test is used to verify the null hypothesis that Gibrat's law is valid. Because of specifics of public sector, we test the Gibrat's law validity only for private sector (sector A-N according to NACE). Results: The validity of Gibrat's law is rejected on the aggregate level and also for most of the industries in the Czech Republic. The validity of law is not rejected only in mining and quarrying (sector B) and financial and insurance activities (sector K). The smaller firms tend to grow faster than larger ones in other industries. Conclusion: The study concludes that the Gibrat's law is not valid in the Czech Republic in period 2008-2013 using industry level and smaller firm grow faster in comparison with their larger counterparts in the great majority ofprivate sector. The reasons could be more: size of industry, competition rate, minimum effective scale of production, greater flexibility of smaller companies or support of small and medium size business.

Productivity affecting traits, such as growth, mortality and different yields, are included in the study. In addition, economic values are calculated for several quality traits like fillet gaping, appearance and fat content of flesh. Productivity traits had the highest economic importance if the traits could be improved. However, quality traits may cause even higher economic losses, if the quality decreases.

This paper examines reasons underlying the current situation and draws conclusions as to what measures should be taken in Russia and other countries with similar business and social environment to effectively reform the Profession. The analysis of the history of Accountants' Professional movement in Russia makes us believe that when reforms are carried out in a professional field, it is important to consider the self-identity of professionals. The lack of developed civil institutions slows down the development of any profession. Professional organisations can achieve success only when they are established by and work together with relevant government authorities. Therefore, Russia and other similar economies would benefit from a mixed regulation of the Accounting Profession, like the existing in France, while the English accounting model seems less effective.","[Karelskaia, Svetlana N.; Zuga, Ekaterina I.] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Sokolov, Viatcheslav Y.] St Petersburg State Univ Econ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Sokolov, Viatcheslav Y.] PricewaterhouseCoopers, Moscow, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University; Saint-Petersburg State University of Economics,"Karelskaia, SN (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia.",,"Zuga, Ekaterina/N-2729-2013; Karelskaya, Svetlana/N-2740-2013; Zuga, Ekaterina/AAH-6889-2021","Zuga, Ekaterina/0000-0002-2470-4403; Karelskaya, Svetlana/0000-0002-6721-3401;",,,,,37,0,0,0,6,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-261-9,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,27,,,,,,190,200,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH1PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000398381700020,0

Because family businesses are hybrid organizations with partially or totally overlapping family and business identities, a second consensual assumption is shared by most family business scholars and entrepreneurs: the business needs to stay in the family, so intra-family succession is the optimal ownership and management transfer solution. Yet both assumptions adopt the perspective of the business founder or the current family business leader. Next generations are rarely asked to express their thoughts and feelings about the future of the family firms that they are expected to protect, develop and pass on to their own children. Do next generation members share these two assumptions or do they envision their potential leadership role differently, expressing alternative views about the meaning and scope of family business succession? In this article, we present and discuss four alternative future leadership projections generated by a group of 14 next generation members participating in a training workshop held in the west of France in August 2013.

An innovative economy implies continuous technological improvement as well as production and export of advanced products offering very high added value. The study has showed that the innovation-based development leads to the production of goods and services that meet international standards, and requires increased investment. For this reason, it is necessary to determine which investments are influencing the Russian economy and serve as a driver to a more intensive innovation process in the country. The authors' conclusion is that the most important signals evidencing Russia's arrival at a new level of innovation may include indicators such as: a high index of economic freedom, a high level of education and science, high quality of life, high cost and quality of human capital, a highly competitive economy, a large proportion of innovative companies (about 60-80%) and innovative products, etc. The analysis, carried out in the paper, reveals that an innovative economy is the next economic formation which replaces the industrial economy.","[Lenkovets, Olga Mikhailovna; Kirsanova, Natalia Yurievna] St Petersburg Min Univ, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint Petersburg Mining University,"Lenkovets, OM (通讯作者)，St Petersburg Min Univ, St Petersburg, Russia.",,"Kirsanova, Natalia/AAE-3479-2019; Lenkovets, Olga/AAG-5877-2019","Kirsanova, Natalia/0000-0003-1012-4763; Lenkovets, Olga/0000-0003-4144-1331",,,,,5,2,2,0,6,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,559,564,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100073,0

While existing theories stress effects on ideological position and rely on a spatial model of party choice, it argues that labor market status can also affect variables relevant in a valence model. Based on the concept of relative deprivation, it argues that non-standard workers with a poor job situation tend to hold the government responsible and punish it at the polls. The article makes a theoretical contribution by integrating elements from political economy, electoral behavior and social psychology. The argument is tested for temporary workers in the 2009 German general election. The findings lend support to the theory: compared to permanent workers, temporary workers in this election were more likely to hold the government responsible for their poor economic situation and vote against it.","[Marx, Paul] Univ Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Marx, P (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.",marx@sam.sdu.dk,,"Marx, Paul/0000-0003-4310-9228",Carlsberg Foundation [2012_01_0494],Carlsberg Foundation(Carlsberg Foundation),This research was financially supported by a grant from the Carlsberg Foundation (grant number 2012_01_0494).,,79,27,27,1,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Thus, many of these studies use the gender of the household head as a key control variable. This study questions this assumption, using original qualitative and quantitative data on rural-urban migration of women in Ghana to show that gendered social norms of household provisioning influence the intrahousehold flow of remittances. Regression results indicate that migrant women are more likely to send remittances to other women, creating female-centered networks of remittance flows even within male-headed households. The implications of this for intrahousehold resource allocation are explored through an analysis of the impact of the gender of the remitter and recipient on education expenditure. The results show that regardless of the gender of the household head, households in which women are the primary recipient of remittances spend more than twice as much on education as households in which men are the primary recipient.","[Pickbourn, Lynda] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst Thompson Hall,200 Hicks Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Pickbourn, L (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst Thompson Hall,200 Hicks Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",lpickbourn@hampshire.edu,,,,,,,51,15,19,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Our results controlling for endogeneity show that net equity flows to emerging markets were mostly influenced by global risk factors, while net debt flows were affected by country-specific factors. We further distinguish the factors that were more pronounced in determining net portfolio flows to emerging markets since the GFC. The US real interest rate had significant spillover effects on net equity flows after the GFC. An increase in country's domestic credit attracted net debt inflows before the GFC, while it was associated with net equity outflows after the GFC. We also find that capital controls moderated net debt flows since the GFC.","[Pyun, Ju Hyun] Korea Univ, Sch Business, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University,"Pyun, JH (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Sch Business, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",jhpyun@korea.ac.kr,,"PYUN, JU HYUN/0000-0001-6815-3976",,,,,21,2,2,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The influence of early shading of roots of asparagus on harvesting time, spring yield and farm income was investigated in this study. The cultivated region of asparagus (cultivar is grande F-1) is Gangwon-do (highland region) in the Republic of Korea. The artificial shading (covered 99% shading net) was applied in greenhouse on January 20. When the artificial shading was applied, the first harvesting time was delayed about 2 weeks, ratio of freezing and frost injury was decreased. So spring yield of asparagus was increased by 792 kg ha(-1) and farm income has increased by 4,018 $ ha(-1). As a result, early artificial shading was judged as a way to delay of first harvest time and to avoid freezing and frost damage.","[Seo, H. T.; Kim, Y. J.; Jang, E. H.; Hong, D.

Perturbations coming from the macro - and meso-levels, reduce profitability and sustainability as separate economic entities and the economy as a whole. However, in the context of the global crisis, the services sector demonstrates the highest resistance to them. According to analysts, the market capacity of services in Russia increased 50 times over the past 15 years and it is still far from the limit. In this regard, the search for reserves of increase sustainability of the national economy should be based on the development of this sector. The article is about analysis and forecasting of development of this sector, namely the development of the tourism industry, because on one hand, according to the world tourism organization, he capacity of this market in Russia is about 70 million tourists annually has already to date, and on the other hand, it is planned further increase in 2-3 times.

The implementation of the proposed formats will be the impetus to exit the industry to a qualitatively new level corresponding to the best international standards, and will also help enhance financial and economic sustainability and competitiveness of the tourism market in general.

This zone has better conditions to support rainfed agricultural production, wood energy supply and fodder for livestock but it also experiences the highest rate of deforestation in the country. This study analyses the drivers of deforestation in Ziro province of Southern Burkina Faso. For data collection and analysis, the area of forest cleared annually was used as the dependent variable, whereas household characteristics and local institutions (tenure and property rights) were considered independent variables. Data were collected through focus group discussions (FGD), participant observation, interviews with key informants and from 200 farm households. Tobit regression results reveal that land tenure insecurity and low agricultural production expressed in the sizes (areas) and ages of farms led to increased deforestation. In addition, the significance of tenure insecurity as a driver of deforestation indicated that migrants contributed more to deforestation than the indigenous groups. Greater rights and improved legal status might reduce the rights to limited use granted to migrants. Furthermore, supports from government to increase local community's capacity to monitor protected forests are likely to reduce field expansion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using National Household Survey data, the authors analyse Peru's ethnic wage gap by sex over the period 2005-11. Although the gender wage gap is smaller than the ethnic gap, indigenous women compound both disadvantages. Interpreting the unexplained component of the gap as an upper-limit measure of ethnic discrimination, the authors then decompose the explained component into the discrete effects of individual, job and locational characteristics. Since more of the ethnic wage gap can be explained on these grounds among women, they conclude with targeted policy proposals.","[Kolev, Alexandre; Robles, Pablo Suarez] Univ Paris Est Creteil Val Marne, Fac Econ Sci & Management, ERUDITE Res Team Use Individual Temporal Data, Paris, France; [Kolev, Alexandre; Robles, Pablo Suarez] ITC ILO, Turin, Italy",Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Kolev, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est Creteil Val Marne, Fac Econ Sci & Management, ERUDITE Res Team Use Individual Temporal Data, Paris, France.",kolev@u-pec.fr; pablo.suarezrobles@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

This paper aimed at developing a multivariate prioritization approach to guide conservation of medicinal tree species of Wari-Maro Forest Reserve in central Benin. Ethnobotany surveys were conducted in communities surrounding the forest, using individual semi-structured interviews with 149 people. Additionally, 42 plots were established in the forest to assess the availability of reported species, using mensuration of ecological indicators. Ethnobotanical indices, harvesting risk index, economic importance, threat status, adaptability to climate variations and ecological indicators were computed and pulled into principal components for each species, to yield a compound priority value. Overall, 73 medicinal tree species were reported for 94 traditional medicinal uses. Using our approach, twelve species emerged as priority species for conservation. The most important priority species were Afzelia africana, Khaya senegalensis, Milicia excelsa and Pterocarpus erinaceus. Local perceptions on the availability of three of these species were perfectly congruent with ecological indicators. Enrichment planting and assisted rejuvenation were suggested as urgent conservation actions to be taken. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While ostensibly aimed at promoting participation by forest adjacent communities, these reforms more often appear to sustain domination by forest administrations or private enterprises and have increasingly been associated with inequitable social outcomes. Part of the explanation for this must be sought in the professionalization promoted by these reforms in the sense of scientific management approaches and structured and detailed systems of information gathering, dissemination and planning. Professionalization has its roots in the historical development of forestry bureaucracies with a basis in principles of scientific forestry that, more recently, has come to resonate with logics of development and neoliberalism. Professionalization emerges in participatory reform as technically and procedurally demanding framings that inhibit implementation, downplay politics and promote inequality. The contributions to this special issue illustrate empirical pathways to unpack and question the framing of participatory forestry as professionalization by pointing to its anti-democratic and social consequences and questioning its relevance and usefulness to actual forest management practice.

We work towards understanding an embeddedness-homophily connection with the support of a case study of the decline of a formerly dominant handloom weavers' community in Kerala, the Saliyars. We demonstrate that there is a spectrum of cohesion along which network links can be categorised, and that it is homophilous-embeddedness that truly defines cohesion. We build the evidence that the Saliyars' networks were characterised by 'homophilous-embeddedness', which, we show, has been relayed across generations. Due to this attribute, the Saliyars are placed as an example that counters the standard line in the literature that community cohesion has been historically congruent to technological progress and knowledge diffusion in handloom in India.","[Kamath, Anant] Azim Premji Univ, Bangalore 560100, Karnataka, India; [Cowan, Robin] UNU MERIT, NL-6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands; [Cowan, Robin] Univ Strasbourg, BETA, Strasbourg, France",Maastricht University; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Kamath, A (通讯作者)，Azim Premji Univ, Bangalore 560100, Karnataka, India.",anant.kamath82@gmail.com,,,"United Nations University/MERIT (UNU-MERIT), Maastricht, The Netherlands","United Nations University/MERIT (UNU-MERIT), Maastricht, The Netherlands(Netherlands Government)","This work was supported by the United Nations University/MERIT (UNU-MERIT), Maastricht, The Netherlands.",,54,9,9,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

However, the research to date suggests that such interventions have relatively little impact on consumer choices. This paper explores whether alternative approaches to communicating nutrition information might increase its impact on consumer choice as well as whether the presence of calorie information affects the effectiveness of other policy approaches. Study 1 tests a variety of methods for conveying nutrition information to promote choice of lower-calorie snack items, including basic numerical information, contextualized numeric information, and heuristic cues such as traffic lights and letter grades. Results suggest that using heuristic cues to communicate the information holds special promise for changing behavior. Study 2 examines the interactive impact of calorie labeling and choice architecture (presenting options in caloric sequence), and shows that calorie information has a beneficial impact, but only when organization of snacks by caloric content facilitates use of the information. These results speak to the importance of understanding how combinations of policy approaches can trigger nonobvious consumer responses, activating different psychological processes when implemented together or individually. They suggest that novel policies to enhance the effectiveness of existing legislation deserve further investigation.","[Downs, Julie S.; Wisdom, Jessica; Loewenstein, George] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Social & Decis Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Downs, JS (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Social & Decis Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",downs@cmu.edu,"Loewenstein, George/G-7616-2014","Downs, Julie/0000-0003-2405-6837",NIA [553558PO2329453]; USDA Economic Research Service [59-4000-8-0077],NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); USDA Economic Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"We gratefully acknowledge NIA (grant number 553558PO2329453) and the USDA Economic Research Service (grant number 59-4000-8-0077).

The analysis is based on administrative data showing the complete provision of medical services in the ambulatory sector in Germany and data from other sources. The data were provided by the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, the Federal Statistical Agency, the Federal Office of Construction and Regional Planning, and the Federal Insurance Agency. The impact of an increase in specific medical services on hospitalizations for ACSCs was estimated using linear spatial models at the level of the 413 German counties and county boroughs for the years 2007 and 2008. To allow for an undistorted estimation of the coefficients, SA and physician density were instrumented using a two-stage 'least squares' approach. The SA and the rate of hospitalizations for ACSCs were age-standardized. In the models, a well-defined set of covariates was controlled for. According to the models, an additional a,not sign spent on ACSC treatment decreases the rate of hospitalizations for ACSCs for women and men up to an annual Uniform Value Scale For Doctors' Fees point value of approximately 6,891 and 5,735, respectively. The correlation is not linear but, as suspected, exhibits diminishing marginal returns. Our models suggest that additional medical services reduce the rate of hospitalizations for ACSCs but that this correlation depends on the absolute level of office-based services in a county, all covariates being held equal. Ceteris paribus counties with a very high volume of services exhibit 'flat-of-the-curve medicine', while counties with a very low current level of specific medical services benefit most from an increase in those specific services.","[Sundmacher, Leonie] Univ Munich, Dept Hlth Serv Management, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Kopetsch, Thomas] Natl Assoc Statutory Hlth Insurance Phys, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",University of Munich,"Sundmacher, L (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Dept Hlth Serv Management, Schackstr 4, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",sundmacher@bwl.lmu.de,"Sundmacher, Leonie/B-7696-2016",,,,,,33,15,16,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Building on organizational learning and reputation-based perspectives, this study examines (a) how governmental regulatory investigation into the firms' product quality in a given industry, an infrequently studied form of government regulations, is invoked; and more intriguingly, (b) whether these processes are reinforced or weakened as the government agency accumulates experience in investigation programmes. These questions are answered through an analysis of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's defects investigation programmes over motor vehicle engine products in the US automobile industry from 1977 to 2003. The results show that the agency appears to initially focus on increasing technical efficiency, but shifts its attention to other aspects of performance, such as fairness, as it repeats investigation programmes, seemingly influenced by the reputational dynamics towards a generalized reputation. The study ends with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.","[Rhee, Mooweon] Yonsei Univ, Sch Business, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Kim, Tohyun] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Business, Seoul 110745, South Korea",Yonsei University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Rhee, M (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Business, 134 Shinchon Dong, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",mooweon@yonsei.ac.kr,"Kim, Tohyun/C-6403-2011","Kim, Tohyun/0000-0002-3605-0603","Basic Science Research Program through National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [NRF-2013S1A3A2053799]","Basic Science Research Program through National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (NRF-2013S1A3A2053799) (to M.R.).",,91,3,4,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

However, in recent years, climate change mitigation, through reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD +(1)) has emerged as one of the most important aspects of forest governance arrangements. This is due to the fact that REDD + has the potential to provide a framework for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation while addressing rural poverty and conserving forest biodiversity at the same time. In other words, the REDO + scheme provides co-benefits beyond its main goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, REDD + is seen by many forest governance experts as a scheme that has the potential to slow down deforestation in a country like Cameroon, which arguably, has the highest rate of deforestation in the Congo Basin. However, this will depend on the effectiveness of Cameroon's REDD + policy strategy, its efficiency in meeting its objectives at the lowest cost, and its ability to equitably distribute costs and benefits associated with the scheme. This paper assesses the effectiveness of REDD + policy design in Cameroon within the context of the climate change regime. The paper employs the policy design approach to analyze four components of Cameroon's REDD+ policy design framework governance and institutional arrangement; emissions baseline; leakage and scale; and technical issues. An economic-based assessment of the forest transition curve and the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) reveals limitations that could render the REDO + scheme cost ineffective for Cameroon. The paper suggests that Cameroon would have to focus on strengthening its existing governance structures and nurturing its forest related international agreements, if it is to design a REDD + policy strategy that is consistent with the nested climate change regime approach.

Non-hierarchical clustering is also employed in EM-algorithm that uses complex empirical conditional or joint distributions for so-called model-based clustering. Non-hierarchical clustering methods demand preliminary knowledge of the number of clusters. Penalized information criteria (AIC, BIC) are used for preliminarily estimating the number of components for EM-algorithm. However, clustering with mixture models does not provide the possibility to achieve perfect separation; we obtain only probabilities of objects falling into the particular clusters. We have already discussed the issues concerning whether the resulting mixture components are separated and to what extent the classification is unambiguous in Bartosova and Bina (2014), and Longford and Bartosova (2014).

In order to meet this objective, we use the econometric analysis of the data provided by the UNCTAD database, for the period 1970-2013, focusing on the two relevant indicators: foreign direct investment flows (FDI) and the Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP per capita), for the group of developed countries. In order to measure the correlation and interdependency between the two variables, we use the dedicated software for statistical analyse. The conducted analysis reveal that, in developed countries, the FDI and GDP indexes evolve rather differently throughout the above mentioned period, and the relationship between these variable could be approximated by a power function. The identified correlation reveals the fact that, in the case of developed countries, a higher level of economic development will trigger inward foreign direct investment flows to other recipient economies, thus acting more like investment transferred to other economies instead of recipients for inward foreign investments. After the appearance of the financial crisis in 2007-2008, foreign investments have become the most important for the global economic activity, in light of the depression that has affected the world's countries during the past few years. The findings of the present research contribute to a better grasp of the existing relationship between the foreign investment flows and the level of economic development and this relationship can be seen as rather helpful when adopting the economic policy measures on a global scale.","[Boghean, Camen; Prelipcean, Gabriela; Boghean, Florin] Stefan Cel Mare Univ, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Boghean, C (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ, Suceava, Romania.",,"Prelipcean, Gabriela/AAQ-1424-2020; ALINA, CALUSERU/HPD-4030-2023","Prelipcean, Gabriela/0000-0002-2584-1733;",,,,,4,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,459,466,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200059,0

Consequently, securing the company critical information assets from sophisticated insider threats and outsider attacks is essential to ensure business continuity and compliance with regulatory frameworks. Security risk management is the process that identifies threats and vulnerabilities of an enterprise information system, evaluates the likelihood of their occurrence and estimates their potential business impact. It is a continuous process that allows cost effectiveness of implemented security controls and provides a dynamic set of tools to monitor the security level of the information system. Given the uncertainty and complexity of security risks analyses, the identification of risk factors as well as the estimation of their business impact require tools for assessment of risk with multi-value scales according to different stakeholders' point of view. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to model risk factors using semantic network to develop the decision network and the Analytical Network Process (ANP) to evaluate factors of complex problems taking into consideration quantitative and qualitative data. As a decision support technique ANP also measures the dependency among risk factors related to the elicitation of individual judgement.","[Brozova, Helena; Rydval, Jan; Sup, Libor] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Agr Econ & Management, Dept Syst Engn, Prague, Czech Republic; [Sadok, Moufida] Higher Inst Technol Studies Commun, Tunis, Tunisia; [Sadok, Moufida; Bednar, Peter] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Comp, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Bednar, Peter] Lund Univ, Dept Informat, Lund, Sweden",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Institut Superieur des etudes Technologiques en Communications de Tunis; University of Portsmouth; Lund University,"Brozová, H (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Agr Econ & Management, Dept Syst Engn, Prague, Czech Republic.",,"Brozova, Helena/K-2834-2017; Rydval, Jan/C-7491-2017","Brozova, Helena/0000-0002-0322-251X; Rydval, Jan/0000-0002-3463-5042",,,,,18,0,0,0,5,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,74,79,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900013,0

Ceska sporitelna and its German owner Erste Bank has been selected, CSOB and the Belgian owner KBC Bank NV and Komercni banka with the French owner of the Societe Generale have been selected. A comparison is performed based on measurable indicators (ROE, ROA, interest margin, credit risk - the risk of loans/assets). When comparisons were taken into three time periods: 2001 - 2007 represent the period before the financial crisis, the years 2008 - 2011 period the financial crisis and the years 2012 and 2013 period after the financial crisis. The main difference in the trend of indicators can be found mainly in the years 2001-2007 compared to following years. The Czech banks were the worst results in 2001. This year, however, was still their transformation relating to their sale to foreign owners. In other years, but Czech banks already reached very good results. Their profitability indicators showed even more than double profitability compared to their foreign owners. The comparison showed that the foreign owners of Czech banks hit by the financial crisis more than Czech banks. The worst results achieved KBC Bank NV in 2009, which showed ROE - 23%. One of the reasons is undoubtedly higher credit risk for foreign banks.","[Cernohorska, Libena] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Econ, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Cernohorska, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Econ, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,283,290,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200037,0

The sample size of quantitative technique in this research was 400 employees who are knowledgeable and working in Toyota Motor Thailand Co., Ltd. The theoretical framework of this study took learning organization as independent variable which used Peter Senge's concept with five dimensions, i.e. personal mastery, shared vision, mental model, team learning and systems thinking. Moreover, organizational performance was also used as dependent variable, which consists of financial perspective (operational income grow, return on investment, sale growth, and market share), customer perspective (on time delivery, quality of delivery, delivery reliability, and customer satisfaction), internal process perspective (efficiency of internal process, cost reduction, process cycle time, and waste rate), and learning and growth perspective (number of new product launches, training, employees satisfaction, and turnover rate). A balanced scorecard was used to measure four perspectives. In the data collection, 41 questions were used in a questionnaire-based survey which was proved by experts. This survey used a five-level rating scale, which is considered as the most appropriate research approach to gather information. Chronbach's alpha was used to test the reliability of questionnaire which can acceptable result was 0.915. For data analysis, a regression analysis was applied to find independent variable on the dependent variable to test hypotheses. The findings indicated that the current level of dimensions of learning organization that characterize Toyota Company has a moderately positive association with organizational effectiveness and has a strongly positive relation with organizational performance with statistical significance at 0.05 level. In conclusion, the results obtained from this study could be used as a strategy of characteristics of the learning organization applied for the Toyota Company to enhance performance and to be used as a guideline for improvement and planning in order to gain competitive advantage.

Consumers in the Japanese market are likely to willingly substitute between wild and farmed import product, placing continued pressure on price for Australian wild-harvested abalone suppliers into this market. A challenge for producers of wild-harvested product is the development of marketing strategies to build product differentiation and greater demand for wild products.","[Hoshino, Eriko; Gardner, Caleb; Hartmann, Klaas] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Hoshino, Eriko; Jennings, Sarah] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania,"Hoshino, E (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Private Bag 49, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",eriko.hoshino@utas.edu.au; caleb.gardner@utas.edu.au; sarah.jennings@utas.edu.au; klaas.hartmann@utas.edu.au,"Jennings, Sarah M/J-7888-2014; Hartmann, Klaas/B-3991-2008; Gardner, Caleb/I-7086-2013; Hoshino, Eriko/N-7557-2013","Gardner, Caleb/0000-0003-0324-4337; Hoshino, Eriko/0000-0001-7110-4251",Australian Seafood CRC; Abalone Council Australia Ltd.,"Australian Seafood CRC(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); Abalone Council Australia Ltd.",We acknowledge the support of the Australian Seafood CRC and Abalone Council Australia Ltd.,,55,9,9,2,24,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The proliferation of transdisciplinary research (TDR) has, however, only progressed moderately up until now. The main reason for this is the lack of a generally accepted quality standard for TDR. In addition to meeting the quality standards of excellence of 'normal science', TDR is supposed to respond to a variety of societal demands. Establishing a quality standard that incorporates these requirements would only be possible in the long-term as it calls for far reaching changes on both an institutional level as well as that of science as a whole. Building up a practice of quality assurance in TDR today lays the necessary foundation to bring about such changes. The aim of this paper is to present a ready-to-use quality guideline which we intend will contribute to that foundation. The guideline is customized to such TDR that aims to bring specific knowledge to bear on policy issues relating to sustainable development. The guideline addresses three groups of actors: researchers, program mangers or donors and policymakers. It shows these actors what they can do specifically to assure the quality of the transdisciplinary research process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, the Over the Counter (OTC) voluntary market represents the greatest opportunity for forest landowners to participate in carbon transactions. However, lack of a consistent carbon price signal and sporadic demand coupled by high transaction costs has prevented widespread participation from family forest landowners. Adoption of a U.S. based cap-and-trade program reduces price risk and may provide incentives for sustainable forest management across large areas. Yet few studies have examined the supply side of carbon offsets and factors affecting project financial viability. To address this gap, we assessed how (1) property characteristics (i.e. stocking level, forest type, size etc.); (2) silvicultural treatments; and (3) protocol and legislative requirements affect the financial viability of compliance forest offset projects, focusing on California's Air Resource Board (ARE) program due to its significance as the world's second largest carbon market. We used forest inventory data from 25 properties in the northeastern United States to examine the viability of the sites as ARE offset projects. We utilized the U.S. Forest Service Forest Vegetation Simulator for our growth and yield simulations. To examine the factors that influence project viability, we used a classification and regression tree analysis performed in S-Plus software. Results indicate C stocking and property size are the most important property characteristics driving return on investment. However, protocol requirements and legislative assumptions impacting long-term monitoring costs are also important factors. While reduced price risk in a compliance carbon market has the potential to improve forest management in North America; high initial project development costs, long-term monitoring obligations, and legislative uncertainty are significant barriers that will limit family forest landowner market participation. The model developed here can be used by U.S. landowners to assess the financial viability of their property as a compliance offset project and can be utilized by policymakers to develop cost-effective climate change policy.

All designated requirements have to be satisfied by private label products, whose share in Europe, particularly in Slovakia, is constantly increasing. Private label brands have established their market in the United Stated and Europe in the past few decades. Consumers tended to perceive private label brands as a substitute or option to the national brands because of their white - black packs, location somewhere on the bottom shelves and low price. However, over the time, there have been several significant changes, which have made private labels acceptable alternatives for the purchase. Development of private labels is now a global phenomenon, which brings both - advantages as well as disadvantages. The most apparent expansion of private labels, for the year 2013, was noticed in Switzerland with 37.7 %, unchanged in USA and the lowest one in China (0.4 %). The aim of the present paper was to point out the basic trends in development and consumption of private label products in the USA, Europe and Slovak republic and to determine Slovak consumer's preference of private label products. As research methods, there have been used the methods of survey and structured questionnaire consisting of 11 questions. The total number of respondents was 1.380 randomly selected respondents buying in international retail chains Tesco Stores Slovakia, Billa, Lidl, Kaufland and domestic retail chains COOP Jednota Slovensko and CBA Slovakia (that means 230 respondents per one retail chain). For a deeper analysis of the obtained results, there have been set out assumptions, which have been tested with the use of Pearson's chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, Mann-Whitney U-Test and Cramer's contingency coefficient. The results of the present paper show, despite the fact, that the market share of private labels was in the USA in the year 2013 at the level of 18 % and in the Europe at the level over 50 % and that the Slovak consumer's consumption and preference of private label products are on a really high level (45 % of respondents said that they are buying private label products and 27.46 % of respondents said that they prefer private label products before products of traditional brands), there are still some possibilities how to achieve more satisfactory results at the market of private labels.","[Kosiciarova, Ingrida] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Kosiciarová, I (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",ingrida.kosiciarova@uniag.sk; ludmila.nagyova@uniag.sk,"Košičiarová, Ingrida/AAX-6180-2020; Nagyova, Ludmila/I-8152-2018","Košičiarová, Ingrida/0000-0003-3763-0826; Nagyova, Ludmila/0000-0002-5220-2857",,,,,19,1,1,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,482,497,,,,,,16,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800048,0

Stocks and consumption of fixed capital are estimated by a Perpetual Inventory Method. In the paper, the transformation of the Czech model of the Perpetual Inventory Method is applied to estimate the indicator, which is not in the scope of annual accounts. On the basis of Markov chain approach to maintenance models we estimate the age structure and the average age of chosen assets in the Czech economy. The analysis uses also the basic demographic indicators to describe the ageing situation in Czech industries.

We use quarterly data over the period 2003-2013. When measuring the shadow banking activity at national level, the shadow banking activities are most extensive in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. We conclude that banking institutions originated fewer loans in reaction to tighter lending standards (imposed by these banking institutions on their loans). However, the expected positive impact of tighter lending standards on loans provided by shadow banking institutions is not confirmed. We can also admit flexible reactions of OFIs to a current economic situation during the analysed period while the behaviour of MFIs followed a long-term strategy, i.e. banks did not react to short-term objectives as frequently as non-banks. In this context, we can conclude that banks met their stabilising role in the economy while non-banks tried to fill up gaps in the financial markets.","[Kucerova, Zuzana] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Policy, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Pomenkova, Jitka] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Elect Engn & Commun, Dept Radio Elect, Tech 12, Brno 61600, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Brno University of Technology,"Kucerová, Z (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Policy, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",zuzana.kucerova@vsb.cz; pomenkaj@feec.vutbr.cz,"Kucerova, Zuzana/K-6162-2018","Kucerova, Zuzana/0000-0001-6888-9262",,,,,16,0,0,0,4,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,425,430,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900073,0

The questionnaire was given to 390 respondents living in the Czech Republic. The data were analysed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software. The sub-segments of the target group have been formed, and characterized on the basis of cluster analysis (data processed in analytical program SPSS). This paper describes only a partial output of the primary marketing research with focus on the brand and product policy importance for the defined segment. Generally, it can be said that this segment buys first of all food, then clothing and fashion accessories, dry goods, books and magazines. In the financial services sector, the typical demand is for financial products such as current account, pension insurance, building savings and life insurance. There are also remarkable findings in the area of tourism. This segment goes on holidays 2-3 times a year, prefers foreign destinations and the willingness to pay for the holidays is not too significant (approximately 500 euros). The brand is essential especially in connection with product categories such as electronics, cosmetics and food products.

By the shopping at the farmers market consumers demonstrate preference not only for fresh and tasty food, but also their willingness to support local production and community.","[Miskolci, Simona] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Dept Reg & Business Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 63100, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Miskolci, S (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Dept Reg & Business Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 63100, Czech Republic.",motyl@mendelu.cz,"Miškolci, Simona/E-4187-2018","Miskolci, Simona/0000-0003-0680-3130",,,,,24,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,698,706,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800067,0

This paper examines legal characteristics and usage of different forms of partnerships and certain hybrid legal forms as types of business organizations in several European countries with the aim of establishing the advantages and disadvantages of their use. The results are then compared with the existing legislation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. There has not been much use of partnership forms in these countries, mainly due to the unlimited liability imposed on partnerships members. Following recent trends of some jurisdictions allowing limited liability partnerships, the aim of this paper is to examine the attractiveness of partnership form features and to discuss the possibility of creating new hybrid business forms which will suit the needs of SMEs in these countries.","[Mulovic, Ana; Hunjet, Anica] Univ North, Koprivnica, Croatia; [Mrgud, Mia] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",University North - Croatia; University of Sarajevo,"Mulovic, A (通讯作者)，Univ North, Koprivnica, Croatia.",ana.mulovic@unin.hr; mia.mrgud@efsa.unsa.ba; anica.hunjet@unin.hr,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,577,586,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000053,0

Despite Turkey's unclear European integration prospects further Turkish immigration to the established member countries of the EU will continue. The strongest waves may flow to Germany, Netherlands or France, where numerous Turkish minorities are already present and where the living standards are high. The results from the statistical part of the paper show the positive correlation between immigration total and the growth of gross domestic product, the negative correlation of immigration total and unemployment and a positive relationship between immigration total and income total which is in agreement with the expected dependency direction. As regards the immigration from Turkey it is less correlated to unemployment than immigration total. But there is a correlation between immigration from Turkey and the stock of foreigners in Germany This is in accordance with the theoretical concept of network theory where an existing community of migrants keeps attracting new migrants because the costs and risks associated with migration are lower, thanks to established linkages to the country of origin. The observed correlation of migration and unemployment points to the fact that immigration to Germany responds to changes in demand in the labour market. Even though a time lag may occur in the case of unemployment and immigration, migration appears as a relatively effective mechanism to offset existing imbalances in German labour markets.","[Palat, Milan] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Terr Studies, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Palát, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Terr Studies, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",mpalat@mendelu.cz,"Palat, Milan/C-6084-2013",,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,775,781,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800073,0

The paper examines the long-run and short-run impact of research and development expenditures and research and development personnel on patents in the United States. Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) statistics is applied for unit root test to determine whether the variables in the model are I(0), I(1) or mutually cointegrated. The requirement for applying ARDL model is that none of variables are I(2) integrated. According to the results of Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin tests, it is proved that all variables are stationary. Using Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL), developed by Pesaran et al. (2001), the results point to long-run causality from research and development expenditures and research and development personnel to patents. The investigation confirmed strong casual effect on dependent variable. The error correction term that embodies the speed at which dependent variable returns back to long- run equilibrium after a change in independent variables following a shock in short-run indicates that approximately 93% of disequilibria from previous years converge to long-run equilibrium the current year.","[Palfyova, Janka] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Pálfyová, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",janka.palfyova@tuke.sk,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,4,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2467-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,503,509,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH7LE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402646500058,0

They may be of different nature, and, therefore, a household financial plan is exposed to many different types of risk (e.g., life-length risk, market risk). Measuring the risk should be treated as an important part of financial planning, allowing to better address preferences of a household. Encompassing in a measure at least the most significant types of risk is, however, a challenge. A measure of risk suited to household financial planning will not be value oriented, nor cash-flow oriented. It should rather be in a way related to the question about threats to life standard and to ability of the household to accomplish its goals.

However, in general, the number of these subproblems is exponential in the number of fractions in the problem. In this paper, we focus on some polynomial cases of the above decomposition.

In line with the previous literature, our results indicate that uninsured individuals are, on average, in worse health conditions. However, if we compare individuals within the same diagnosis category, the uninsured are actually healthier, with a lower number of chronic conditions and a lower risk of mortality. This indicates that the uninsured are admitted to the hospital only for more serious conditions. In addition, our results show that uninsured individuals consume less health care. In particular, conditional on being admitted to a hospital and controlling for health conditions, the uninsured have lower total charges, fewer procedures, and a higher mortality rate.","[Castaneda, Marco A.; Saygili, Meryem] Univ Texas Tyler, Dept Social Sci, 3900 Univ Blvd, Tyler, TX 75799 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at Tyler,"Saygili, M (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Tyler, Dept Social Sci, 3900 Univ Blvd, Tyler, TX 75799 USA.",tekinmrym@gmail.com,"SAYGILI, MERYEM/AAI-6300-2021",,Center for Social Sciences Research at the University of Texas at Tyler,Center for Social Sciences Research at the University of Texas at Tyler,We gratefully acknowledge financial support for this study from the Center for Social Sciences Research at the University of Texas at Tyler.

Critics of charter schools argue that charter schools create those achievement gains by focusing exclusively on test preparation, at the expense of deeper learning. In this paper, I test that critique by estimating the impact of charter school attendance on subscales of the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System and examining them for evidence of score inflation. If charter schools are teaching to the test to a greater extent than their counterparts, one would expect to see higher scores on commonly tested standards, higher-stakes subjects, and frequently tested topics. Despite incentives to reallocate effort away from less frequently tested content to highly tested content, and to coach to item type, I find no evidence of this type of test preparation. Boston charter middle schools perform consistently across all standardized test subscales.","[Cohodes, Sarah R.] Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, Educ Policy & Social Anal, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University Teachers College; Columbia University,"Cohodes, SR (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Teachers Coll, Educ Policy & Social Anal, New York, NY 10027 USA.",cohodes@tc.columbia.edu,,"Cohodes, Sarah/0000-0002-7921-7020",,,,,31,7,16,1,118,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

The SI/PASS evaluation literature is extensive, but it has not adequately addressed potential selection bias. We evaluate an SI/PASS program at an Australian university through a randomized-encouragement-design experiment. A randomly selected subgroup of students from first-year courses (N=6954) was offered large incentives (worth AUD 55,000) to attend PASS which increased attendance by an estimated 0.47 hours each. This first-stage (inducement) effect did not vary with the size of the incentive and was larger (0.89) for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Instrumental-variable estimates suggest that 1 hour of PASS improved grades by 0.065 standard deviations, which is consistent with the non-experimental literature. However, this estimate is not statistically significant, reflecting limited statistical power. The estimated effect is largest for students in their first semester at university.

A key question is how to promote organizational change to support current management objectives. In 2012, the US Forest Service reorganized its budget and performance measurement structure to support the agency's current emphasis on restoration. We report the results of a survey designed to understand whether this policy change contributed to organizational change and whether the approach was accompanied by key factors known to support successful organizational transitions. We received completed surveys from 1210 agency employees (47% response rate). Although results were mixed, we found that the new approach resulted in some changes to planning approaches and staff roles. Approximately half of those in leadership positions said prioritization and integration had improved. Staff identified a need for improved communication and reported that effective leadership was central to success. These results provide some indication that similar tools can be employed to shift organizational structure and behavior to support the evolving missions of forestry agencies. Future research should investigate how to promote organizational change and learning beyond individual actors via effective leadership, communication, and evaluation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Theoretically, the methodology is based on a discrete choice model with random utility. Empirically, the econometric specification is a Nested Multinomial Logit Model. The data used comes from the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) organized in 2011 by the National Institute of Statistics. The results reveal that uneducated women or those having only a primary education prefer to meet the traditional midwives than seek modern maternal health services. Moreover, the absence of a paid job for the pregnant woman, the large size of the household, Islamic or animist religion, poverty, high costs of healthcare and transportation are constraints which make the pregnant woman to prefer the services of traditional midwives to modern services of maternal health. The use of modern healthcare services by pregnant women in Cameroon can therefore be improved by at least two means: firstly, by improving on the level of education of women and economically empowering them. Secondly, in a context where the costs of healthcare services are paid directly by the pregnant women themselves or by their families, it is important to put in place health insurance schemes in order to guarantee proper follow-up of pregnant women until delivery as well as taking care of complicated cases.","[Anya, Saturnin Bertrand Nguenda; Yene, Atanase] Univ Douala, Fac Econ & Appl Management, Douala, Cameroon",,"Anya, SBN (通讯作者)，Univ Douala, Fac Econ & Appl Management, Douala, Cameroon.",nguenduz_144@yahoo.fr,,"Yene, Atanase/0000-0001-7367-2172",,,,,44,3,5,0,1,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

We focus on differences between preferred provider organizations (PPOs) and two recent innovations: plans that feature a narrow panel of providers, and plans that allow free choice of providers but increase demand-side cost sharing: consumer-driven/high-deductible health plans. Health plan effect estimates change dramatically after controlling for endogenous plan type choice, and individual fixed effects. With these controls, narrow-panel plans reduce the probability of new treatment spells relative to PPOs by 34 percent with little effect on chronic, repeat visit spells. Visit reductions are more concentrated in less severe conditions in narrow-network plans, hence diagnostic coding on the remaining patients increases. We find no evidence that either narrow panel or higher-cost-sharing plans pay lower prices per procedure or have less intensive treatment given initiation of treatment. With controls, consumer-driven/high-deductible health plans are associated with higher total spending on procedures than PPO plans.","[Ellis, Randall P.; Zhu, Wenjia] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Ellis, RP (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",ellisrp@bu.edu,,,Verisk Health,Verisk Health,"We are grateful to Arlene Ash, Francesco Decarolis, Tim Layton, Tom McGuire, Erik Schokkaert, Frank Sloan, and participants at the American Society of Health Economists and the Risk Adjustment Network for useful comments and insights, although the authors bear full responsibility for any errors or omissions.

Nonetheless, eight out of the ten regions in Ghana remain predominantly rural where only 32.1 % of the national health sector workforce works. Doctor-patient ratio in a predominantly rural region is about 1: 18,257 compared to 1: 4,099 in an urban region. These rural-urban inequities significantly account for the inability of Ghana to attain the health related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) before the end of 2015. Purpose: To ascertain whether or not rural-urban differences exist in health worker motivation levels and quality of health care in health facilities accredited by the National Health Insurance Authority in Ghana. Methods: This is a baseline quantitative study conducted in 2012 among 324 health workers in 64 accredited clinics located in 9 rural and 7 urban districts in Ghana. Ordered logistic regression was performed to determine the relationship between facility geographic location (rural/urban) and staff motivation levels, and quality health care standards. Results: Quality health care and patient safety standards were averagely low in the sampled health facilities. Even though health workers in rural facilities were more de-motivated by poor availability of resources and drugs than their counterparts in urban facilities (p < 0.05), quality of health care and patient safety standards were relatively better in rural facilities. Conclusion: For Ghana to attain the newly formulated sustainable development goals on health, there is the need for health authorities to address the existing rural-urban imbalances in health worker motivation and quality health care standards in primary healthcare facilities. Future studies should compare staff motivation levels and quality standards in accredited and non-accredited health facilities since the current study was limited to health facilities accredited by the National Health Insurance Authority.","[Alhassan, Robert Kaba] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Alhassan, Robert Kaba] Univ Ghana, Noguchi Mem Inst Med Res, Dept Epidemiol, Legon, Ghana; [Nketiah-Amponsah, Edward] Univ Ghana, Dept Econ, Legon, Ghana",University of Amsterdam; University of Ghana; University of Ghana,"Alhassan, RK (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Alhassan, RK (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, Noguchi Mem Inst Med Res, Dept Epidemiol, Legon, Ghana.",arkabason@gmail.com,"Nketiah-Amponsah, Edward/S-9239-2019","Nketiah-Amponsah, Edward/0000-0002-9754-1983; Alhassan, Robert Kaba/0000-0003-4227-4854","Netherlands government through the Ministry Foreign Affairs; Science for Global Development (WOTRO) division of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), under the Global Health Policy and Systems Research (GHPHSR) programme [W07.45.104.00]","Netherlands government through the Ministry Foreign Affairs; Science for Global Development (WOTRO) division of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), under the Global Health Policy and Systems Research (GHPHSR) programme","This study was conducted with the financial support of The Netherlands government through the Ministry Foreign Affairs and the Science for Global Development (WOTRO) which is a division of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), under the Global Health Policy and Systems Research (GHPHSR) programme (Funding/grant number: W07.45.104.00).",,29,13,17,1,14,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Admittedly, the WTO Appellate Body's judicial minimalism approach to trade dispute settlement has so far prevented it from making any broad claims about public morals exception. Nevertheless, I argue that the Appellate Body has already waded into treacherous waters. Going forward, the WTO Appellate Body must be cautious so as not to permit moral imperialism and put the delicately balanced multilateral trading system at grave risk. For this purpose, I propose a more nuanced approach to define public morals as well as manage its extraterritorial application in international trade law.","[Du, Ming] Univ Surrey, Chinese & Comparat Law, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England",University of Surrey,"Du, M (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Chinese & Comparat Law, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England.",Michael.mingdu@gmail.com,"Du, ming/JAD-2238-2023",,,,,,62,11,13,0,7,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The virus can cause severe illness and concomitant diseases with the highest risk for children, the elderly, and individuals with disease dispositions. The study objective is to assess the influenza burden in Germany. Methods This retrospective claims data analysis used the Health Risk Institute research database containing anonymized data of 4 million individuals. The study period comprised the influenza season 2012/2013 in which patients with documented influenza were identified. Disease frequency rates were calculated for a population with disease dispositions and a population not at high risk. Disease burden was assessed based on health-services utilization during the influenza season. Vaccine rates were calculated by identifying vaccinations. Results We observed 65,826 patients with influenza, resulting in 1,160,646 documented influenza cases after extrapolation. Overall, otitis media and pneumonia was higher in the influenza-infected population compared to the non-influenza-infected population and especially high in children. Hospitalization cost amounted to (sic)87,202,485 with a mean stay of 7 days, and total outpatient costs were (sic)14,947,976. Vaccination rates were <4 % for children and 37 % for patients aged >60. Conclusions Seasonal influenza can cause severe outcomes with hospitalizations and excess costs. Especially influenza-infected children are affected by concomitant diseases with higher disease burden. Furthermore, documented vaccination rates are quite low.","[Haas, Jennifer; Braun, Sebastian] Xcenda GmbH, Lange Laube 31, D-30159 Hannover, Germany; [Wutzler, Peter] Univ Jena, Jena Univ Hosp, Inst Virol & Antiviral Therapy, Hans Knoll Str 2, D-07745 Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Haas, J (通讯作者)，Xcenda GmbH, Lange Laube 31, D-30159 Hannover, Germany.",jennifer.haas@xcenda.de; sebastian.braun@xcenda.com; peter.wutzler@med.uni-jena.de,,,AstraZeneca GmbH Germany,AstraZeneca GmbH Germany(AstraZeneca),"The data analysis was performed in cooperation between Xcenda GmbH, Elsevier Health Analytics and the Health Risk Institute with support from AstraZeneca GmbH Germany.",,32,18,18,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

It provides an overall measure of a population's health based on individuals' personal perceptions of their own health. In this paper, we focus our analysis on under-health as the fact of having a level that falls behind the health requirements necessary to perform what is considered an expected life based on Self Assessed Health. For Spain using the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), we can confirm there exist under-healthy people by occupation, age group and sex. Additionally, under-healthy workers are most likely to be found among skilled agricultural, fishery workers and elementary occupations.","[Pascual-Saez, Marta; Cantarero-Prieto, David; Gonzalez-Prieto, Noelia] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Avda Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Cantarero-Prieto, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Avda Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",david.cantarero@unican.es,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

This article analyses advice on fostering innovation from Australia's main statutory economics adviser, the Productivity Commission. It argues that the Productivity Commission's comprehensive 2007 report, Public Support for Science and Innovation, contributed to a policy vacuum hampering government support for innovation for nearly a decade. First, within the Productivity Commission's understanding of innovation was a contradiction between its required policy targeting criteria and the impossibility of meeting these criteria. Second, the resulting stance on innovation policy was at odds with research and theory on the drivers of innovation and hence growth - particularly innovation systems theories and those based on evolutionary economics. The ensuing innovation policy vacuum suggests that the Productivity Commission placed the abstract ideological purity' of neoclassical economic theory above empirical exploration of how government can best support Australia's future economic development. Since late 2015, moves to fill this policy vacuum have included a Senate inquiry, a government department restructure, and the creation of a new Innovation and Science statutory advisory board. Whether these initiatives foster sustained innovation will depend on the extent to which they adopt approaches based on innovation systems or evolutionary economics, and transcend the static neoclassical mindset espoused by the Productivity Commission.","[Dalitz, Robert] Univ Canberra, Inst Res & Reporting, Bruce, ACT, Australia",University of Canberra,"Dalitz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Canberra, Bldg 26 Scrivener,27 Thynne St, Bruce, ACT 2617, Australia.",rob.dalitz@canberra.edu.au,,"Dalitz, Robert/0000-0002-9332-632X",,,,,48,2,2,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The gap with respect to non-immigrant schoolmates is first measured. The hypotheses that first (second) generation students coming from (whose parents come from) countries with a higher performance in math fare better than their immigrant peers coming from lower ranked countries are then tested on a sample of about 13,000 immigrant students. The estimated average immigrant-native score gap in math amounts to 12 points. The results show that immigrant students coming from higher-ranked origin countries have a significantly lower score gap, and are thus relatively less disadvantaged. For example, coming from a country in the top quintile for math and having attended school there for one year improves the absolute score gap by more than 33 points, the highest coefficient among the variables that reduce the gap, such as parental education and socio-economic status.

Most of these analyses build on the model developed by Gouveia (1997), who defines the extent of SHI as consequence of a choice by self-interested voters. In this model, an indicator reflecting individuals' relative income position and relative risk of falling ill determines the voting decision. Up to now, no empirical evidence for this key assumption has been available. We test the effect of this indicator on individuals' preferences for the extent of SHI in a setting with mandatory SHI that can be supplemented by private insurance. The data is based on a DCE conducted in the field with a representative sample of 1538 German citizens in 2012. Conditional logit and latent class models are used to analyze preference heterogeneity. Our findings strongly support the assumptions of the models. Individuals likely to benefit from public coverage show a positive marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for both a shift away from other beneficiary groups toward the sick and an expansion of publicly financed resources, and the expected net payers have a negative MWTP and prefer lower levels of public coverage.","[Pfarr, Christian] Univ Bayreuth, Inst Publ Finance, Dept Law & Econ, Bayreuth, Germany; [Schmid, Andreas] Univ Bayreuth, Hlth Management, Dept Law & Econ, Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth; University of Bayreuth,"Schmid, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Hlth Management, Dept Law & Econ, Bayreuth, Germany.",christian.pfarr@uni-bayreuth.de; andreas.schmid@uni-bayreuth.de,"Schmid, Andreas/AAA-7147-2019","Schmid, Andreas/0000-0002-0141-0971",German Research Foundation (DFG); German Research Foundation (DFG) [UL163/4-2],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank three anonymous referees for very helpful comments and suggestions.

This paper estimates the mean and distributional impact of single-sex high schools on students' cognitive achievement, major choice, and test-taking behavior by exploiting the random assignment policy adopted in Seoul, Korea. Based on administrative data for a period of seven years, I find that, on average, the positive effects of single-sex schooling on test scores are small, especially when the parental and teacher sorting are accounted for. Although the magnitude of the estimated effects is small, I find that the effect is relatively larger for students in quantiles 0.5-0.8 of the distribution of test scores. The impact is trivial, on the other hand, for students located at the very bottom and the very top quantiles. Moreover, I do not find any differences, both practically and statistically, in major choice and test-taking behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study investigated the impact in the context of expensive hospital drugs. This study aimed to: (1) investigate the effect of productivity costs on cost-effectiveness outcomes, (2) determine whether economic evaluations of expensive drugs commonly include productivity costs related to paid and unpaid work, and (3) explore potential reasons for excluding productivity costs from the economic evaluation. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify economic evaluations of 33 expensive drugs. We analysed whether evaluations included productivity costs and whether inclusion or exclusion was related to the study population's age, health and national health economic guidelines. The impact on cost-effectiveness outcomes was assessed in studies that included productivity costs. Of 249 identified economic evaluations of expensive drugs, 22 (9 %) included productivity costs related to paid work. One study included unpaid productivity. Mostly, productivity cost exclusion could not be explained by the study population's age and health status, but national guidelines appeared influential. Productivity costs proved often highly influential. This study indicates that productivity costs in economic evaluations of expensive hospital drugs are commonly and inconsistently ignored in economic evaluations. This warrants caution in interpreting and comparing the results of these evaluations.","[Krol, Marieke; Tan, Siok Swan; Brouwer, Werner; Hakkaart, Leona] Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Krol, Marieke; Tan, Siok Swan; Brouwer, Werner; Hakkaart, Leona] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, POB 1738, NL-3000 Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Krol, M (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, POB 1738, NL-3000 Rotterdam, Netherlands.",krol@bmg.eur.nl,"Krol, Marieke/HGA-7950-2022; Brouwer, Werner/HSB-9241-2023","Brouwer, Werner/0000-0002-0476-8397; Krol, Marieke/0000-0002-6153-0828; Hakkaart-van Roijen, Leona/0000-0003-0635-7388; Tan, Siok Swan/0000-0002-9522-2321",Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development (ZonMW) [152002018],Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development (ZonMW)(Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development),This study was funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development (ZonMW Grant number 152002018).,,65,34,37,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

A meta-analysis of response variables considering the total cost of the intervention and surgical time was completed using the items selected in the first revision, and their differences were analyzed. We then calculated the opportunity cost represented by these time differences using the data obtained from the studies in the second review of the literature. Nine items were selected in the first review and three in the second. Traditional laparoscopic surgery has a lower cost than the da Vinci (p < 0.00001). Robotic surgery takes longer (8.0-65.5 min) than traditional surgery (p < 0.00001), and this difference represents an average opportunity cost for robot use of a,not sign 489.98, with a unit cost factor/time which varies according to the pathology dealt with, from a,not sign 8.2 to 18.7/min.

The detrimental effect of uncertainty on hiring is more pronounced when firms face greater firing and replacement costs and when they face less direct competition from other similar firms.

If too many former students go into default, the college will face sanctions by the federal government and lose eligibility to provide currently enrolled students federal financial aid, such as the Pell grant. To avoid these sanctions, some colleges have chosen not to participate in federal loan programs by excluding loans from students' financial aid packages. In this article, I investigate the student-level impacts associated with the decision of community colleges to opt out of the Stafford loan program. Utilizing administrative records from over 50 community colleges located in a single state, I estimate the within-college differences in outcomes for Pell-eligible students before and after an institution opts out of the federal loan program. I find that Pell-eligible students enrolling when the community college offered federal loans were 7.6 percentage points more likely to borrow than Pell-eligible students who enrolled when the institutions opted out. Overall borrowing also increased by $368 a year. I also find that students borrowing a loan attempted 19 additional credits in their first year of enrollment and were more likely to attempt and complete math and science courses than non-borrowers.

Median annual household income was USD 1122, based on household survey data from 264 households in six villages adjacent to the Sundarbans, in Khulna, Bangladesh. Forest income represented 74% and 48% of the total household income for the lower and middle income households respectively, but just 23% for higher income households. Although higher income households derived a larger absolute income from forest resources than the lower income households, the addition of forest income to household income reduces measured income inequality by 27% suggesting that forests offer a more egalitarian source of income than most other sources at the study sites. Thus reducing forest income as a result of reduced access to forest resources would greatly affect the livelihood outcomes for the rural poor and increase wealth discrepancies among households near the forest margins.

The second postulates that the increase in the persistence of radiative forcing transmits a stochastic trend to the time series for temperature. Results indicate that the persistence of radiative forcing and temperature changes from I(0) to I(1) during the last 500 years and that the I(1) fingerprint in radiative forcing can be detected in a statistically measureable fashion in surface temperature. As such, our results are consistent with the physical mechanisms that underlie the theory of anthropogenic climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study surveyed non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners in the states of Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin to elicit their willingness-to-harvest (WTH) timber and woody biomass. Results consistently showed that higher revenues, associated with higher prices, and attitudes supporting harvesting of woody biomass were associated with greater WTH levels. Intentions of not conducting a commercial harvest in the future were a strong predictor of WTH. Average effects differed by state. Else constant, Minnesota respondents reported higher WTH and showed greater responsiveness to timber and biomass revenue changes compared to their counterparts in Michigan and Wisconsin. Absentee ownerships, different opinions regarding environmental impacts of biomass harvesting, divergent ownership objectives, past harvest experiences and future harvest plans, and environmental organization membership helped explain different WTH levels across states. Marginal probability analyses suggest revenues from woody biomass, as compared to timber, had much lesser influence on potential supply of woody biomass from NIPFs. Differences in WTH estimates between states suggest that strategies to increase availability of woody biomass should be crafted to each state's conditions and emphasize alternatives to increase timber revenues.

In the meantime, in the most regions with the companies participating in CGTs, a significant increase (3.1% on the average) in the tax revenues over the previous year has been noted.

Methods We first applied the newly developed Generalized Sup ADF test to locate multiple healthcare bubble episodes and then estimated the switching regression model specifying multiple healthcare bubble periods to evaluate to what extent macroeconomic variables (such as the interest rate, public debt, and fiscal deficit) and public financing healthcare programs influence the magnitude of healthcare bubbles in terms of the deviation of the medical care price inflation from either the overall price inflation or the money wage growth. Results Our results show that expansionary monetary and fiscal policies play important roles in determining the deviation of the medical care price inflation from the overall price inflation and that the net government debt has a positive impact on the deviation of the medical care price inflation from the money wage growth. The US healthcare market is now in the middle of a healthcare bubble, and this healthcare bubble has developed slowly and has lasted for approximately 3 decades, mirroring an increased societal preference for healthcare. Conclusions Policymakers in the US should cautiously consider the fact that healthcare bubbles must imply a misallocation of resources into healthcare, leading to negative consequences on the sustainability of the healthcare system.","[Chen, Wen-Yi; Liang, Yia-Wun] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Senior Citizen Serv Management, 193,Sec 1,Sanmin Rd, Taichung 40343, Taiwan; [Lin, Yu-Hui] NanKai Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, 568 Chung Cheng Rd, Tsao Tun 54243, Nan Tou, Taiwan",National Taichung University of Science & Technology,"Lin, YH (通讯作者)，NanKai Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, 568 Chung Cheng Rd, Tsao Tun 54243, Nan Tou, Taiwan.",chenwen@nutc.edu.tw; ywliang@nutc.edu.tw; lin2138@nkut.edu.tw,,,,,,,43,7,8,3,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Gradual and systematic deregulation at home and increased international integration promises even better economic performance. While this may be only partly true since a good part of India is untouched by economic growth in any meaningful way, even if official reports of declining poverty are to be believed. The question this paper poses is why, despite envious economic growth rates, India's development seems elusive. This is a complex issue and could be addressed variously but the reasons are all likely to resort to nation-centric explanations. I take an alternative perspective, to position India in the wider capitalist dynamic of the late twentieth century, articulating the national with the global. Late capitalism in India and for that matter other select developing countries has meant new technologies, mature capitalists and a relatively well-developed state. All three cumulatively stand for economic growth, industrialisation, urbanisation and some politically negotiated redistribution. However, as I would like to argue that the workings of compressed capitalism, that is, primitive accumulation, which is historically complete elsewhere, is an ongoing feature in India, dispossessing and displacing people thereby jeopardising future development. Furthermore, the persistence of petty commodity production due to displacement and exclusion due to technology-led and enclave-based economic production adds to the development conundrum. The resulting inequality in India in an expanding economy is thus not an anomaly but a reflection of systemic capitalist dynamics.","[D'Costa, Anthony P.] Univ Melbourne, Contemporary Indian Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [D'Costa, Anthony P.] Univ Melbourne, Dev Studies Program, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"D'Costa, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Contemporary Indian Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.;D'Costa, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dev Studies Program, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",adcosta@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,46,5,5,0,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2198-9923,,978-981-10-0454-4; 978-981-10-0453-7,DYNAM ASIAN DEVEL,,,2016,,,,,,,19,39,,10.1007/978-981-10-0454-4_2,0.0,,,21,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BG8KZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392399800002,0

However, this mechanism conflicts with fiscal interests of the state, forcing it to develop new tax regulations. On the other hand, any additional regulation leads to the feedback from financial market. In case of thin capitalization, it is manifested in the emergence of new hybrid forms of financing and new financial instruments to avoid or mitigate the impact of fiscal restraints.

Based on Monte Carlo simulations, this paper proves that, in some circumstances, the duration of making systematic bad decisions can be very long.","[Dragota, Victor] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dragota, V (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",victor.dragota@fin.ase.ro,"Dragota, Victor/B-9076-2011","Dragota, Victor/0000-0001-7284-5297",,,,,28,3,4,0,13,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Secondly, we attempt to illustrate the correlative forms between arrivals and overnight stays. By the coefficients of elasticity (E, E', E), the existence of forms of relationship between the factor considered independent arrivals (x) and the dependent factor, overnight stays (y) were determined. Also, the methodology allowed that, in the dynamics of the 12 months, the comparison basis be successive: E with fixed comparison basis which was the first sub-period (the month of January), E' with comparison basis the previous immediate sub-period (the precedent month); E where the comparison sub-period was a certain season sub-period (the month when the seasonality registered the maximum value). The results highlight correlative connections and implicit dependence between arrivals and overnight stays, but also the necessity to identify other factors with influence over the tourism attraction of Romania.

Food quality and safety, their origin and labelling are currently discussed in different fora. EU legislation also defines the main principles of consumer protection from which, in accordance with the title of the paper, are significant: (1) the high level of food and other consumer goods safety, and (2) the principle of consumer awareness of what they consume. Dubious product quality, misleading food labelling and other related problems represent threats for consumers from which they must defend. They have to be active market participants, sufficiently impressed by this issue and interested in food labelling. It is necessary to gain knowledge of food labelling and to have relevant information to decide correctly which food to choose and buy. Consumer education is a very important tool to enhance consumer protection, too. Educated consumers who know their rights and duties as well as rights and responsibilities of other market actors are able to adequately defend and protect themselves. Therefore we have focused on consumer awareness of food labelling. Based on the research results, the aim of the presented paper is to find out the consumer awareness of food labelling and to suggest recommendations to improve the current state.

Using the recursive bivariate probit model, we jointly test the probability of the sudden stop in international lending and its simultaneous effect on the host countries' interbank markets. The empirical results suggest that the risk of a sudden stop is associated with global liquidity shock; host country productivity shock; and the common lender contagion effect. This facilitates the transmission of interbank stress from advanced economies to emerging markets. However, the tension is mitigated by the flight-home effect caused by domestic investors' repatriation. The sudden stop is more likely to occur in countries with lower financial openness but higher financial risk. Lending flows to the banking sectors are more sensitive to shocks than the flows to the non-bank private sectors.","[Le, Chau H.

Under the framework of real savings and green GDP, the huge energy consumption and carbon emissions will bring in huge natural resource losses, and then affect the total factor productivity (TFP) seriously. When taking the input-output relationship into consideration, the natural resource losses of heavy industry will decrease significantly. As the upstream of the industrial chain, heavy industry offered a large number of subsidies to the downstream industries by providing energy, raw materials, and taking on carbon emissions. This article verified the transfer of natural resource losses among industries, and estimated the real TFP of heavy industry from input-output and traditional perspective, respectively. The results showed that there was an increasing trend in the growth rate of heavy industry's TFP in the perspective of input-output.","[Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Liu, Kui] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",bqlin@xmu.edu.cn,"Liu, Kui/AAF-1370-2020; Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Liu, Kui/0000-0001-9048-0236; Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X",Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy [1260-Z0210011]; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding [1260Y07200]; Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund,Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy; Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding; Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund,"The paper is supported by the Grant for Collaborative Innovation Center for Energy Economics and Energy Policy (No. 1260-Z0210011), Xiamen University Flourish Plan Special Funding (No. 1260Y07200), and Newcastle University Joint Strategic Partnership Fund.",,30,25,25,3,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Lehman shock and the world credit crisis caused a recession in the global economy, including the agriculture and flower sectors. Because the flower bulb sector in Japan had been stagnating before the shock, significant damage appears to have resulted from the recession, whereas the sector had been greatly damaged in the Netherlands; however, it appears to have made a prompt recovery. We demonstrate economic models of standard international trade theory as an analytical framework. A small country model is applied to represent the Japanese sector, whereas a two-country model is applied to represent the relationship between the Dutch and the American bulb industries. We investigate some factors and influences affecting both countries. In particular, we perform an in-depth analysis of the influence on the Japanese tulip bulb industry. We conclude that the Dutch bulb industry had been greatly affected by the Lehman shock; however, it has made a prompt recover, whereas the Japanese industry was affected by the shock is yet to recover. Dutch bulbs are globally sold, including Brazil, Russia, India and China, which are BRICs countries with rapidly growing countries. The protracted stagnation of the Japanese bulb industry has resulted in fundamental and long-term problems, including high cost and small-scale bulb production, low income of rice production and a change in consumer flower preference.","[Niisato, Y.] Toyama Univ, Fac Econ, Toyama, Toyama, Japan; [Takeda, T.] Takaoka Univ Law, Fac Law, Takaoka, Toyama, Japan",University of Toyama,"Niisato, Y (通讯作者)，Toyama Univ, Fac Econ, Toyama, Toyama, Japan.",,,,,,,,9,1,1,0,10,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62611-11-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2016,1132,,,,,,55,63,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1132.8,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7DM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391238400008,0

In the previous programming period, the European Union invested from public sources into both tourism activities, in purely business, but also in activities that have a positive impact on regional development. This article aims to show how the investments from public sources in tourism were used and how significant its impact was on the selected region of the Czech Republic. The research question is whether the support of tourism from public sources has a major impact on the overall development and whether this effect is greater than that of the market itself. The main methods used to answer the research question are statistical descriptive methods, time series analysis, index analysis, correlation analysis, the chosen methods of so-called Counterfactual Impact Evaluation analysis and questionnaires. The outputs of analyses indicate that the market development of tourism has a greater influence than very high intervention from public funds into the development of tourism in the period 2007 2013, respectively 2015. The use of the Counterfactual Impact Evaluation methods show that 1 CZK from public sources generated in the selected region 34 cents from private sources, and that 71% of the projects focused on services, marketing and creation of tourism products in the region would not be implemented without public funds.

The results of one-way Granger causality show that globalization influenced military expenditures in Germany, and Japan. Moreover, there was no evidence that military expenditures caused globalization in any G7 country. The evidence from Italy shows interaction causality between globalization and military expenditure.

In comparison, there has been little investigation of the contribution of NTFPs in urban areas and amongst the urban poor. This paper reports results from a survey of 450 households across three towns on the use and value of tree NTFPs collected by households in the poorer areas from their own homesteads, open spaces within towns and at the urban periphery. Collection (and purchase) of tree NTFPs was widespread, especially of firewood and fruits. The ratio collected from homesteads relative to other urban spaces differed between products and the amount required. Overall, approximately 20% of household income was derived from urban tree NTFPs. The highest contribution (33%) was amongst the poorest sectors represented by mostly recent migrants to towns who were living in informal settlements whilst trying to establish a foothold in the urban economy. In the formal housing areas the contribution was at least 14%, which has been overlooked by standard income surveys in urban areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, I focus narrowly on the effect of additional time used for individualized tutorials. In 2005, MATCH Charter Public High School integrated two hours of tutorials throughout an extended day. The unanticipated implementation of this initiative and the school's admissions lottery allow me to use two complementary quasi-experimental methods to estimate program effects. I find that providing students with daily tutorials that are integrated into the school day and taught by full-time, recent college graduates increased achievement on tenth-grade English language arts exams by 0.15-0.25 standard deviations per year. I find no average effect in mathematics beyond the large gains students were already achieving, although quantile regression estimates suggest the tutorials raised the lowest end of the achievement distribution in mathematics.","Brown Univ, Dept Educ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University,"Kraft, MA (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Educ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",mkraft@brown.edu,,,,,,,42,18,18,0,53,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

China has been the leading participant in the global fiber trade in recent years. In this study, China's import of wastepaper and wood pulp by supplying source was assessed through a two-stage differential production model. The analyses revealed that wastepaper imports were inelastic in both expenditure and price, the magnitude of price elasticity estimates became larger after considering the variation of total expenditure, and the substitution between wastepaper and wood pulp imports was limited. Rising imports of wastepaper had small effects in reducing the rapidly growing imports of wood pulp by China. Thus, the concern over environmentally detrimental effects of importing virgin wood pulp from countries with poor forest management practices will likely continue. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The labor market returns to progress in community college,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Returns to college; Non-completion; Postsecondary education,STUDENTS; EDUCATION; SELECTION,"Despite copious research on the labor market returns to college, very little has adequately modeled the pathways of non-completers or compared their outcomes with those of award-holders. In this paper, we present a novel method for linking non-completers with completers according to their program of study. We use this method to calculate the labor market returns to programs of study, accounting for those who obtain an award and those who do not. We use a large dataset of community college transcripts matched with earnings data. We find that different classification systems - by algorithm, intent or goal - yield very different enrollment patterns across programs. Importantly, these classifications make a substantial difference to earnings patterns. Returns vary by program completion and by program non-completion. Consequently, combining completers and non-completers yields a new pattern of returns. We find that the variance in returns by subject of study is reduced when we combine data on completers and non-completers. In particular, the large returns to nursing awards are substantially lower when we account for the probability of completing a nursing program and the returns to not completing a nursing program. In addition, progression per se does not lead to higher earnings for non-completers: progressing further in a nursing program is no different from accumulating general college credits. If validated, these findings have significant implications for policies on program choice and on student retention policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

About two-thirds of the increase in aggregate labor productivity arises from reallocation of employment from low-to high-productivity sectors and one-third from productivity increases within sectors. Decomposition of productivity growth using microdata also reveals an important contribution from reallocation. We also document substantial change in the composition of exports. We argue that structural change was not a direct result of selective industrial policy simply because the incentive system displayed little sectoral selectivity during the period when major structural change took place.,"[Atiyas, Izak] Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey; [Atiyas, Izak; Bakis, Ozan] Sabanci Univ, Competitiveness Forum, TUSIAD, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey",Sabanci University; Sabanci University,"Atiyas, I (通讯作者)，Sabanci Univ, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey.",izak@sabanciuniv.edu,"Bakis, Ozan/AAE-4941-2019","Bakis, Ozan/0000-0001-9785-1992",European Union,European Union(European Union (EU)),"The authors thank Zeren Taspinar, Damla Yildiz, and Caglar Kaya for excellent research assistance.

This paper investigates whether QoL changed for the general Dutch population over the period 2001-2008. A beta regression model was employed to address specific features of the QoL distribution (i.e., boundedness, skewness, and heteroskedasticity), as well non-linear age and time trends. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) was calculated by combining model estimates of mean QoL with mortality rates provided by Statistics Netherlands. Changes in QALE were decomposed into those changes caused by QoL changes and those caused by mortality-rate changes. The results revealed a significant increase in QoL over 2001-2008 for both genders and most ages. For example, QALE for a man/woman aged 20 was found to have increased by 2.3/1.9 healthy years, of which 0.6/0.8 was due to QoL improvements.","[Gheorghe, Maria; Brouwer, Werner B.

Students take on the role of polluters who must consider the costs of complying with a uniform reduction and a tradable permits program. The class is divided into high-cost polluters and low-cost polluters so students can observe the gains from trade as high-cost students purchase pollution rights from the low-cost students in the tradable permits scenario. A major advantage of the game is that it can be conducted within as little as 20 minutes and does not require that students have prior knowledge of economics or regulatory policies. This makes the game appropriate for economics and noneconomics courses alike.","[Caviglia-Harris, Jill L.] Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA; [Caviglia-Harris, Jill L.] Salisbury Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Salisbury, MD USA; [Melstrom, Richard T.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",University System of Maryland; Salisbury University; University System of Maryland; Salisbury University; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Caviglia-Harris, JL (通讯作者)，Salisbury Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA.",jlcaviglia-harris@salisbury.edu; mel-strom@okstate.edu,,"Caviglia-Harris, Jill/0000-0001-7860-4857; Melstrom, Richard/0000-0001-6420-5425",,,,,11,6,6,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

The European Social Survey (ESS), documenting self-reported tax evasion in 26 countries, allows us to test individual and institutional factors simultaneously. We model the effect of institutional and social capital factors affecting informal transactions. We predict that informality is fostered by social relations and trust, and curbed by institutional trust. Regulation and taxation fuel informal transactions, while effective enforcement inhibits them. These predictions are simultaneously tested with individual-level data from the ESS, complemented with country-level data on regulation, taxation levels and enforcement. Multilevel binary and multinomial logit, fixed effects, Markov chain Monte Carlo method and adaptive Gaussian quadrature regressions confirm the predictions regarding social capital, trust and tax burden. Contrary to much prior research, we find weak and inconsistent effects of regulation and enforcement, which may also be due to the limited variation of our country sample.","[Adriaenssens, Stef; Hendrickx, Jef] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Campus Brussels, Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Adriaenssens, S (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Campus Brussels, Louvain, Belgium.",stef.adriaenssens@kuleuven.be,"Adriaenssens, Stef/M-3297-2019; Adriaenssens, Stef/F-2982-2010","Adriaenssens, Stef/0000-0001-9357-6575",,,,,80,9,9,0,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

We connect these literatures by highlighting a previously unstudied determinant of college choice, namely the college choice made by one's older sibling. Data on 1.6 million sibling pairs of SAT-takers reveals that younger and older siblings' choices are very closely related. One-fifth of younger siblings enroll in the same college as their older siblings. Compared to their high school classmates of similar academic skill and with observably similar families, younger siblings are about 15-20 percentage points more likely to enroll in 4-year colleges or highly competitive colleges if their older siblings do so first. These findings vary little by family characteristics. Younger siblings are more likely to follow the college choices of their older siblings the more they resemble each other in terms of academic skill, age and gender. We discuss channels through which older siblings' college choices might causally influence their younger siblings, noting that the facts documented here should prompt further research on the sharing of information and shaping of educational preferences within families.

J,"Beckstead, N",,,,"Beckstead, Nick",,,How much could refuges help us recover from a global catastrophe?,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Global catastrophic risk; Existential risk; Refuges; Disaster shelters; Bunkers; Social collapse,RISK,"Some global catastrophes (such as nuclear wars, pandemics, or an asteroid collision) might destroy civilization. Some propose building well-stocked shelters constantly staffed with people trained to rebuild civilization in such cases. These refuges would have an unimpressive expected cost per life saved, but could conceivably have an impressive expected cost per future generation allowed to exist. From some ethical perspectives that highly value future generations, building refuges may therefore seem like a promising idea. However, several factors significantly dilute the potential impact of refuges, even if the proposed catastrophes occur. Government/private disaster shelters, people working on submarines, and isolated peoples who prefer to be left alone serve these purposes to some extent already. Many proposed catastrophes do too much/too little damage for refuges to help, affect the environment in ways that make refuges largely irrelevant, or otherwise give relatively limited advantages to the people in refuges. In global food crises or social collapse scenarios, refuges would add little to aggregate stocks of population, resources, food, and relevant skills; but they may add something unique in terms of isolation and coordination. These potential benefits of refuges seem the most promising, and may be worthy of further analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Much of the originality of this paper derives from the multilayered qualitative approach which provides a deeper insight into the direct and indirect mechanism through which the OMP is perceived to work. This paper argues that, more than the prevailing literature suggests, in order to increase the benefits of using the OMP then considerable investment in time is required. The findings show that the academic's cost in terms of time is greatest when asking 'lecturer effectiveness' type questions, but the benefits derived are potentially longer term than standard 'lecture content' based question. Students value the use of the OMP, principally because it demonstrates respect for them; this helps to create an atmosphere of trust, which can encourage engagement and an active approach to student learning. The research informs a discussion on how practical implementation techniques can be used to maximise the benefits and limit the costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on household surveys, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and a review of literature we investigated differences in livelihood assets, park dependence and livelihood outcomes for households with and without CRMAs. We investigated the role of park environmental incomes (PEI) in poverty alleviation and factors influencing dependency on PEI. Results revealed significant differences in household assets but no significant differences in park dependence and livelihood outcomes. People report that PEI on average constitute 18% of total incomes. Poor households have a higher dependency on PEI and it reduces income inequality by 13%. CRMAs have a significant positive effect on total PEI but no significant effect on total household income and relative environmental income. In areas with CRMAs, taungya farming and bee keeping practiced as part of the CRMAs increase annual household incomes by 26% and 28% respectively and constitute potential pathways out of poverty. However, the impact of the agreements is still low due to their limited scale and coverage and the targeting criteria which limits access for communities with a high dependency on park resources and high levels of conflict.

This paper studies a dynamic game among countries that face the prospect of such a shift. Each country derives some flow utility from its own emissions, which are chosen unilaterally. But flow emissions by all countries increase the pollution stock in the world. In addition to generating global damages such as global warming, the pollution stock may trigger an irreversible and abrupt jump in global damages or catastrophe at an unknown date in the future. We ask whether endogenous and exogenous threats of such a jump in damages or catastrophe mitigate the tragedy of the commons and examine their implications on welfare. Our analysis yields different emission responses to these threats as compared to the related literature that focuses only on the single-polluter case. For example, when the hazard rate is exogenous and countries commit to nonlinear strategies, we find that the threat of a possible jump in damages or catastrophe may induce a lower or larger emission level and initial welfare due to multiple equilibria. These results are maintained when the hazard rate endogenously depends on emission decisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Using all rounds of the Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys (1988-2008) and employing a variety of spatial and empirical estimation techniques, results indicate that in addition to own-child mortality, neighbourhood child mortality shocks are also a determinant of women's fertility in Ghana.

J,"Regan, DH",,,,"Regan, Donald H.",,,Explaining Trade Agreements: The Practitioners' Story and the Standard Model,WORLD TRADE REVIEW,,,English,Review,,,,,,,ECONOMIC-THEORY; TARIFFS,"There are two widely accepted explanations of why politically motivated governments make trade agreements. There is an informal explanation, which I shall call the practitioners' story', even though it is most economists' informal view as well. And there is a formal explanation in the economics literature, which I shall call the standard model', referring to the basic structure shared by the Bagwell-Staiger and Grossman-Helpman models. Unfortunately, the practitioners' story and the standard model contradict each other at every crucial point. For example, in the practitioners' story, trade agreements are about reducing politically motivated protectionism; and getting an agreement depends on political support from exporters. But in the standard model, trade agreements never reduce such protectionism; and politics plays no role in securing an agreement. This paper expounds the contradictions between the practitioners' story and the standard model, which have gone largely unremarked. It refutes suggestions by defenders of the standard model that the contradictions are illusory. It identifies the different assumptions made by the two explanations that generate the contradictions. It gives reasons for skepticism about the standard model. And it discusses why all of this matters.","Univ Michigan, Sch Law, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Regan, DH (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sch Law, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",donregan@umich.edu,,,,,,,34,8,10,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2015,14,3.0,,,,,391,417,,10.1017/S1474745614000469,0.0,,,27,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,CR7ZJ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361570500001,0

We investigate the productivity effect of intensity standards using a tractable general-equilibrium model featuring multiple sectors and firm-level heterogeneity. Qualitatively, we demonstrate that intensity standards are always inferior to uniform taxes, as they misallocate both dirty and clean inputs across firms and sectors, which lowers productivity.

Our contribution is threefold. First, in contrast to earlier literature, we allow the convergence rate to vary, and thereby uncover significant differences in the speed of convergence across time and regions. Second, we control for spatial correlations across regions. Third, we estimate convergence among regions, rather than countries, and thereby highlight noteworthy variations within a country. Although we find (beta) convergence on average, we also identify significant differences in the catching-up process across both time and regions. Moreover, we use the coefficient of variation to measure the dynamics of dispersion levels of mortality and life expectancy (sigma convergence) and, surprisingly, find no reduction, on average, in dispersion levels. Consequently, if the reduction of dispersion is the ultimate measure of convergence, then, to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first that shows a lack of convergence in health across EU regions.","[Maynou, Laia; Saez, Marc] Univ Girona, Res Grp Stat Econometr & Hlth GRECS, Girona 17071, Spain; [Maynou, Laia; Saez, Marc] CIBER Epidemiol & Publ Hlth CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain; [Maynou, Laia; Bacaria, Jordi] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England; [Saez, Marc; Lopez-Casasnovas, Guillem] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ctr Res Hlth & Econ CRES, Barcelona, Spain; [Bacaria, Jordi] ITAM, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Lopez-Casasnovas, Guillem] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona, Spain; [Lopez-Casasnovas, Guillem] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona Grad Sch BSGE, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat de Girona; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Pompeu Fabra University; Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico; Pompeu Fabra University; Pompeu Fabra University,"Saez, M (通讯作者)，Univ Girona, Res Grp Stat Econometr & Hlth GRECS, Campus Montilivi, Girona 17071, Spain.",marc.saez@udg.edu,"Bacaria, Jordi/E-3747-2013; Lopez-Casasnovas, Guillem/A-9342-2013","Bacaria, Jordi/0000-0003-1438-647X; Lopez-Casasnovas, Guillem/0000-0001-8020-9987; Maynou Pujolras, Laia/0000-0002-0447-2959","Short Term Grant Abroad for PhD European; CIBER of Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Spain; Grant for Universities and Research Centres for the Recruitment of New Research Personnel (FI-DGR), AGAUR, Government of Catalonia (Generalitat de Catalunya)","Short Term Grant Abroad for PhD European; CIBER of Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Spain; Grant for Universities and Research Centres for the Recruitment of New Research Personnel (FI-DGR), AGAUR, Government of Catalonia (Generalitat de Catalunya)","This work was partly funded by the Short Term Grant Abroad for PhD European, CIBER of Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Spain, benefiting Laia Maynou, who is also a beneficiary of the Grant for Universities and Research Centres for the Recruitment of New Research Personnel (FI-DGR 2012), AGAUR, Government of Catalonia (Generalitat de Catalunya).

We here provide a refined advanced pharmacoeconomic model which uses state-of-the-art methods including a mixed treatment comparison (MTC) analysis. The aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of current immunosuppressive therapy regimens (TR): sirolimus + early withdrawal of cyclosporine + steroids (TR1), sirolimus-early transition (TR2), everolimus-early transition (TR3) and tacrolimus low dose + mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) + steroids (TR4). An up-to-date Markov model with current source data was employed to assess the cost-effectiveness of modern immunosuppressive regimens over 12-month and 10-year time periods. Transition probabilities for the occurrence of events for the first year were based on an MTC analysis. The robustness of the model was tested in extensive sensitivity analyses. Within the 12-month time period TR2 yields the highest life years (0.987 LY), generating costs of 17,500 a,not sign. In terms of years with functioning graft (FG), TR4 yields the best efficacy over the 12-month model duration (0.970 years with FG). For the 10-year time period, TR2 yields the lowest costs (107,246 a,not sign) and dominates both TR3 and TR1, as it is simultaneously more effective. Within the 10-year model duration, TR4 reaches slightly higher effects compared with TR2 (6.493 vs. 6.474 LY) resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 387,684 a,not sign per LY gained. The early transition to sirolimus provides long-term efficiency results comparable with a tacrolimus-based regimen, which represents a common treatment standard after kidney transplantation. Both are superior to other investigated immunosuppressive regimens.","[Juergensen, Jan Steffen] Hsch Oekonomie & Management, D-10625 Berlin, Germany; [Juergensen, Jan Steffen] Charite, Dept Nephrol & Med Intens Care, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Ikenberg, Robert; Greiner, Roger-Axel] IMS HLTH GmbH & Co OHG, D-80636 Munich, Germany; [Hoesel, Volker] StatSciConsult, D-80636 Munich, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin,"Jürgensen, JS (通讯作者)，Charite, Dept Nephrol & Med Intens Care, Charitepl 1, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",jan_Steffen.juergensen@charite.de,,,"Pfizer Pharma GmbH, Berlin, Germany","Pfizer Pharma GmbH, Berlin, Germany","This study was funded by an unrestricted grant from Pfizer Pharma GmbH, Berlin, Germany.",,45,4,4,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Occupations experience discontinuous declines in net male employment growth at tipping points ranging from 25% to 45% (from 13% to 30%) female in white-collar (blue-collar) occupations from 1940 to 1990. These patterns appear consistent with a Schelling (1971) social interaction model where tipping results from male preferences toward the fraction female in their occupation. Supporting the model's predictions, evidence from the General Social Survey indicates that tipping points are lower in regions where males hold more sexist attitudes toward the appropriate role of women.","Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Pan, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",jesspan@nus.edu.sg,"Pan, Jessica/AHA-4915-2022","Pan, Jessica/0000-0002-8640-9768",Sanford J.

This uncertainty emanates from paucity of quality manpower, inability of the industry to move up the value-chain, underdeveloped state of the domestic market and unpreparedness of the industry for disruptive technologies. These factors may erode the competitive advantage of the industry and inhibit the growth momentum. This paper is an attempt to reassess the findings considering a longer time horizon, encapsulating a broader set of information and supporting evidences from literature. Our findings suggest that the exponential growth the industry has exhibited over the years has not shown any significant reversals in recent times. Further, reassessment of the concerns outlined earlier makes it a bit difficult to believe that the industry is likely to face any serious threats and challenges in the foreseeable future. Instead, our findings suggest that the future of the Indian IT outsourcing industry is not that uncertain, and in all probability the industry would retain its competitive standing in the global market and make promising strides ahead.

While previous studies have focused almost exclusively on the impacts of FSC certification on forest management practices, our research focuses on elucidating the impacts of the Malaysian Timber Certification Scheme (MTCS) on the forest management systems of Peninsular Malaysia. Using primary and secondary data, our study analyzes the types of noncompliance issues present in these systems and their frequencies and distributions over space and time. We found that the distribution of noncompliance issues across the MTCS forest management standard was skewed toward the more ecologically-related criteria. Yet we also found evidence of significant improvements having already occurred in the forest management systems of Peninsular Malaysia. Overall, our systematic analysis of the role of certification in shaping forest management systems in Peninsular Malaysia suggests that PEFC-endorsed schemes like the MTCS may ultimately lead to positive impacts in these systems.

Traditionally, NI planning and implementation has been conducted in isolation, based upon fixed assumptions about the future. This fails to recognise both the long-term socio-economic, climate-related and technological challenges and uncertainties of the coming century and the growing interconnectivity between these individual infrastructure systems. Here we develop a methodology for generating a range of strategies for the provision of NI suitable for an integrated 'system-of-systems' assessment of NI's future management. To provide coherent links with policy choices, integrated strategies are developed at an aggregate level with a diversity of investment requirements, demand management techniques, and levels of environmental targets. To facilitate implementation within NI simulation models, the example strategies are constructed from sectoral sub-strategies focusing on changes in demand, capacity utilisation and capacity expansion. Further new strategies can be explored and the approach lends itself to an iterative analytical approach, potentially capturing a wide range of policy questions.

Providers of ski resorts must have a good understanding of their customers if they are to understand their quality perceptions or have a chance of successfully implementing service quality programmes. The paper investigates the relationship of factors influencing the satisfaction and loyalty according to ski resorts customers and ski resort providers. The qualitative data were collected in ski resorts of Slovakia and Austria. A total of 58 depth customer interviews of 3 ski resorts in Slovakia and depth provider interviews of 3 ski resorts in Slovakia and 3 ski resorts in Austria were analyzed using software Maxqda. The results of the research show that there is a gap between perception of satisfaction and loyalty factors of customers and providers of ski resorts. The findings suggest that providers of ski resorts should focus more on factors of the satisfaction and loyalty according to ski resorts customers' expectations. Theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are being discussed.","[Bediova, Monika; Ryglova, Katerina] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Bédiová, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Brno, Czech Republic.",monika.bediova@gmail.com,"Ryglová, Kateřina Provazník/L-1592-2018","Ryglová, Kateřina Provazník/0000-0001-8511-5437",,,,,20,0,0,1,13,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-190-6,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2015,,40.0,,,,,37,45,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BD3PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360010100003,0

The first stage is carried out with the opinion of experts applied to uncertain numbers and Ordered Weighted Average (OWA) operators to assess the overall benefits of each profile to choose the best alternative.

Does this greater visibility mean that ITD has entered a 'golden age' crowned with universal success, or does this new approach still face difficulties of an institutional, individual, epistemological or methodological nature? Does the researcher who situates himself between or beyond disciplines represent a new scientific profile that is transforming traditional disciplinary identities? Finally, is ITD a simple recombination of existing disciplines with varying degrees of originality, or does it embody a new thought style that calls for the dedisciplinarization of academic structures and the full recognition of its transgressive status? In this paper I shall attempt to answer these programmatic questions and shed light upon the following elements: the inter- and transdisciplinary approach is underway and still - beyond its potentialities and success faces some obstacles; interdisciplinary research is often promoted or claimed, but it is sometimes not recognized as a form of research in its own right; and taking seriously the issues of ITD involves rethinking disciplinary identities. It represents a new thought style and a promising future for education and research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It identifies the determinants of women's decision-making power using a qualitative survey conducted over 2008-9, and it investigates their effects on women's health status using the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey panel dataset for the period 1994-2004. The study finds that women's health status is positively associated with their education, the number of brothers they have, whether they live in their birthplace, and whether their age is close to that of their husband. In contrast, women's health is negatively associated with whether they are in a marriage of their choice compared to an arranged marriage. The study concludes that multiple factors originating from context-specific gender norms affect women's decision-making power and have differential effects on women's health outcomes.","[Dito, Bilisuma Bushie] Maastricht Univ, Globalizat Transnationalism & Dev Res Grp, Grote Gracht 90-92, NL-6211 SZ Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Dito, BB (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Globalizat Transnationalism & Dev Res Grp, Grote Gracht 90-92, NL-6211 SZ Maastricht, Netherlands.",bilisumabb@gmail.com,,,,,,,44,9,10,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

In the paper we present data about empirical verification of validity the theoretical conclusions of leverage, according to the level of achievement the return on capital invested in the business of an enterprise is determined by the leverage. The subject of analysis are financial data from the set of agricultural companies of selected region in the Slovak republic in the period 2008-2012 obtained from balance sheets and profit and loss statements of each analysed companies. From the basic set of 46 companies, we selected 25 companies that have farmed continuously throughout the analysed period. Under the effect of financial leverage, we understand a change in the return on equity influenced by amount of liabilities and cost of borrowed capital influenced by interest expense. In the group of agricultural farms are included primarily cooperatives and limited companies. Our task is to consider the degree of determination the return on equity calculated from profit before tax. The rate of determination was quantified through functional method of analysis the return on equity based on the equation EAT/VK = EBIT/T x EBT/EBIT x EAT/EBT x T/A x A/VK When quantifying the econometric model we used panel data, specifically the fixed effect model (FEM). We come out from the equation: In (ROE)(i) = alpha(i) + ln alpha 1(EBIT/T) + ln alpha 2(EBT/EBIT) + ln alpha(3)(EAT/EBT) + ln alpha(4) (A/VK) + u(i) For the quantification of the parameters of the econometric model we will use econometric software Gretl, which is publicly available on the internet. Based on the analysis results, we can conclude, the indebtedness of agricultural companies analysed region of Slovak Republic increased return on equity. With the increasing indebtedness is increasing return on equity. The average values for the five years confirmed, that from total set of companies leverage worked in seven companies negatively (i.e. 28 % of total enterprises) and in eighteen (i.e. 72 %) worked positively. The five-year average change of leverage increased average value of return on equity by 0.10 EURO of profit after taxes to 100 EURO accounting value of equity. Based on the analysis results of panel data we can conclude, that increase in leverage by 1 % brings increase ROE by 0.88 %. Reduction of interest profit also increase ROE by 0.59 % and increase the share of sales of assets by 1 % increase ROE of 0.90 %.","[Gurcik, Lubomir] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Gurcík, L (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",lubomir.gurcik@uniag.sk; viktor.porhajas@uniag.sk; katarina.gurcikova@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,1,3,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,231,242,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800023,0

Previous publications focused mainly on prevalent patients and thus research gaps were identified regarding costs and treatment patterns of incident patients before and after the first diagnosis. Methods: Analyses were conducted using claims data obtained from a large German sickness fund (Techniker Krankenkasse). Inclusion criteria consisted of patients with at least two secured outpatient or one inpatient ADHD diagnosis in 2007. Incidence was ensured by defining a baseline period without ADHD-diagnosis in 2006. In addition to diseaserelated cost analyses compared to a control group including age group comparisons, comorbidities, the proportion of multimodal treatment and medication treatment patterns were described. Results: In total, 9083 newly diagnosed ADHD patients were identified (73 % male; mean age: 12.9 years (SD: 10.3)). The mean total cost of ADHD patients during the year after the first diagnosis exceeded the mean total cost of the year before by 976 (sic) (Differencein-Difference-estimator: 1006 (sic)). Our analyses have shown that 10 % of ADHD patients have been treated with multimodal therapy. In addition, 11 % of the investigated ADHD population have received methylphenidate or atomoxetine preceeding the date of diagnosis in the relevant observation period. Discussion: This study provides important insights into the costs as well as the treatment patterns of incident ADHD patients. ADHD-related costs and medications can be identified prior to the date of the first ADHD diagnosis. Although, multimodal therapy is presented as an optimal treatment option by many international guidelines and experts, its proportion for treatment is low (10 %). Further research is necessary to identify reasons for the low proportion of multimodal therapy and (cost-) effectiveness has to be evaluated in comparison to other treatment options. In addition, ADHD-related costs could be identified before the first diagnosis is documented. The reasons for medication prior to diagnosis have to be further investigated.","[Klora, Mike; Zeidler, Jan; von der Schulenburg, J. -Matthias Graf] Leibniz Univ Hannover, CHERH, Otto Brenner Str 1, D-30159 Hannover, Germany; [Linder, Roland; Verheyen, Frank] Sci Inst TK Benefit & Efficiency Hlth Care WINEG, Hamburg, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Klora, M (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, CHERH, Otto Brenner Str 1, D-30159 Hannover, Germany.",mk@cherh.de,,,Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF),Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This study has been supported by the Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (BMBF).,,37,14,14,0,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

The necessity to solve large instances of the weighted p-median problem has led to the approximate approach based on a radial formulation, which enables to solve bigger instances in admissible time making use of a universal IP-solver. Nevertheless, huge instances of the p-median problem may resist to attempts to solve them by the approach due to big size of the possible service center location set. To comply with this phenomenon, we suggest the two phase method. The first phase consists of the process, when bisection process applied on the D-max problem is used to reduce the set of possible service centers. We search for such D-max to obtain suitable set of possible locations for the following public service design problem. Then the second phase, which is based on the radial approach, solves the public service system design problem with reduced set of possible locations. Hereby, we study the impact of the parameters of the two-phase decomposition on the solution accuracy and saved computational time.","[Kvet, Marek] Univ Zilina, Fac Secur Engn, 1 Maja 32, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Janacek, Jaroslav] Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina; University of Zilina,"Kvet, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Secur Engn, 1 Maja 32, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",marek.kvet@fbi.uniza.sk; jaroslav.janacek@fri.uniza.sk,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,0,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,455,460,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900078,0

Methods: A web-based survey of orthopedic practices in the United States was used to assign a first date of onsite MRI capacity acquisition (if any) to specific orthopedic practices. Medicare claims data for 2006-2010 was obtained for providers in orthopedic practices acquiring onsite MRI capacity and in matched orthopedic practices without an onsite MRI over the same period of time. Multivariate regression was used to estimate the change in provider Medicare MRI volume one year before and one year after the onsite MRI acquisition year for providers in MRI practices compared to providers in propensity-score matched non-MRI practices. Results: In all of the MRI volume change models estimated, the association between onsite MRI acquisition and the change in provider Medicare MRI volume (one-year post-onsite-MRI-acquisition less one year pre-acquisition) was consistently small and not statistically significant. This lack of association was robust to changes in model specification in terms of types of MRI exams considered, specific covariates included in the multivariate model, or the process used to confirm individual provider affiliation with study practices in study years. Conclusions: Our analysis of Medicare claims data provides no empirical support for the proposition that acquisition of onsite MRI capacity within an orthopedic surgery practice induces an increase in the rate of MRI use for Medicare patients among practice providers, relative to physicians in practices without MRI capacity over the same time period.","[Ohsfeldt, Robert L.] Texas A&M Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, MS 1266, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Li, Pengxiang] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Gen Internal Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Schneider, John E.] Avalon Hlth Econ, Morristown, NJ 07960 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M Health Science Center; University of Pennsylvania,"Ohsfeldt, RL (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, MS 1266, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",rohsfeldt@tamu.edu,"Ohsfeldt, Robert/AAG-6514-2019","Ohsfeldt, Robert/0000-0002-6117-056X",,,,,48,2,2,0,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

This effectiveness stems from its closeness to practice-based/situated expertise and real-life problem contexts. This article presents and tests one approach within transdisciplinary research, which specifically focuses on increasing the participation of actors from outside of academic in knowledge production processes, called transdisciplinary (TD) co-production. The framework for TO co-production focused on five focal areas (inclusion, collaboration, integration, usability, and reflexivity) in three research phases (Formulate, Generate, Evaluate). This paper tests and evaluates the use of this framework in five research projects. The results discuss how the focal areas and research phases dealt with many crucial issues in transdisciplinary knowledge production. They stimulated a high level of stakeholder participation and commitment to the research processes, and promoted knowledge integration and reflexive learning across diverse sectors and disciplines. The approach, however, came up against a number of practical barriers stemming primarily from institutional, organizational and cognitive differences of the participating organizations. While TD co-production increased the usability of the results in terms of their relevance and accessibility, it paradoxically did not ensure their anchoring in respective institutional and political contexts where societal change occurs.

The process which led to this outcome was of an extremely dramatic nature. It should be noted that the previously planned actions which took place at that time were marked both by exceptional predetermination and remarkable efficiency. From that moment on, the events that have been taking place in the local and international systems, triggered by the largest country in the world in terms of its territory, began to draw the attention of politicians, businessmen and the general public. It has become clear that, regional in their nature, interventions of Russia in the Crimea and in eastern Ukraine are part of a long-term Russian strategy calculated for many years. The current foreign policy of Russia is based on all available instruments. Moscow, to attain its goals, with great precision uses political, financial, military, and economic tools. For example, it is tightening economic cooperation with China, is seeking an agreement with Germany and France, and is holding talks at the G20 summit in Milan. At the same time, it is fostering the conflict in Ukraine and is destabilizing the economic situation in Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, and Poland. Through trade restrictions it skilfully aggravates the tensions between the European Union governments. In the meantime, it is trying to gain allies in the Balkans and in the Mediterranean area, and it is making new global alliances. It is clear that thanks to its activity in many fields, Russia has become the initiator of major political and economic transformations on a transnational scale. It is also an important player in the international arena. Here, some questions need to be asked. The key ones are as follows: 1) What is the direction of the policy of the Russian Federation? 2) Are the goals set by the Moscow authorities feasible? 3) What will be the cost of the Kremlin's actions on a regional, continental, and global scale? Finding answers to these questions will help predict and understand the scale of the transformations that may soon occur. This will also allow to estimate the resources that will be necessary in the process of the forthcoming changes.","[Przygoda, Miroslaw] Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Przygoda, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Warsaw, Poland.",miroslawprzygoda@wp.pl,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,200,209,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000020,0

The push is to transform, by 2015, the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) into the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). The AEC would create a single market for goods, services, and investments and a single production base for the region. Closer economic integration, however, requires an effective system for the settlement of the kind of disputes that inevitably arise from the further liberalization of trade and investment. To this end, in 2004, ASEAN adopted the Protocol on Enhanced. Dispute Settlement Mechanism, which establishes a near rule-based Dispute Settlement Mechanism for the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA DSM). In the decade since its establishment, the AFTA DSM has never been invoked. This article explores the limitations and constraints of the AFTA DSM and proposes an arbitration model as the ideal method of conflict resolution for ASEAN and the eventual AEC.","[Puig, Gonzalo Villalta] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Law, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Puig, GV (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Fac Law, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,98,4,4,0,16,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The CV events of interest were myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina, heart failure (HF), stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Method: A systematic literature search was performed in the following databases according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines -Medline, Embase, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, TIBORDER, and German dissertation database from January 2003 to October 2013. Both observational studies and randomized clinical trials were considered for the review. All values stated in (sic) are inflation adjusted to 2014 (sic) unless stated otherwise. Result: This review included 13 articles. For newly occurred MI patients, the average hospitalization costs during the acute phase were reported to be between (sic) 6790 and (sic) 8918 per admission. In the first year after a MI event, direct medical costs were (sic) 13,838-14,792 per patient. Direct medical costs of chronic HF patients were found to be between (sic) 3417 and 5576 per patient per year. Treatment costs increase with disease progression. The average treatment costs for hospitalized PAD in the acute phase were reported to be (sic) 4963 per admission, (sic) 2535 per patient during month 1-6 after the initial hospitalization, (sic) 1601 in month 7-12, and (sic) 1390 in month 13-18. For stroke of all types, total direct medical costs in the 1st year after an event were reported to be (sic) 13,273 per patient. Total direct medical costs during the 1st year after an ischemic stroke event were (sic) 17,399-21,954 per patient, (sic) 6260 in month 13-18, and (sic) 6496 per year in the subsequent 4 years. Conclusion: MI, unstable angina, HF, stroke and PAD have a high financial impact on the German health care system. Treatment costs of these diseases are mostly incurred during the acute phase of events and tend to decrease over time. Hospitalization and rehabilitation costs were two major cost drivers. Medication costs was one of the smallest cost component reported.","[Schmid, Tamara] Amgen GmbH, Hanauer Str 1, D-80992 Munich, Germany",Amgen; Amgen Research Munich GmbH,"Schmid, T (通讯作者)，Amgen GmbH, Hanauer Str 1, D-80992 Munich, Germany.",Tschmid@amgen.com,,,,,,,27,21,21,2,66,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Nevertheless, forest managers continuously make long-term decisions that will be subject to climate change impacts. The manager's assessment of possible developments and impacts and the related uncertainty will affect the combined decision on timing of final harvest and the choice of species for regeneration. We analyse harvest of a Norway spruce stand with the option to regenerate with Norway spruce or oak. We use simulated variations in biophysical risks to generate a set of alternative outcomes, investigating effects on decision making of three aspects of uncertainty: (i) the perceived time horizon before there will be certainty on outcome, (ii) the spread of impacts across the set of alternative outcomes, and (iii) the subjective probability (belief) assigned to each outcome. Results show that the later a forest manager expects to obtain certainty about climate change or the more skewed their belief distribution, the more will decisions be based on ex ante assessments suggesting that if forest managers believe that climate change uncertainty will prevail for a longer period of time, they may make sub-optimal decisions ex ante.

Reinsurance limits insurer costs associated with specific individuals, while risk corridors protect against aggregate losses. Both tighten the insurer's distribution of expected costs. This paper compares the economic costs and consequences of reinsurance and risk corridors. We simulate the insurer's cost distribution under reinsurance and risk corridors using data for a group of individuals likely to enroll in Marketplace plans from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We compare reinsurance and risk corridors in terms of risk reduction and incentives for cost containment. We find that reinsurance and one-sided risk corridors achieve comparable levels of risk reduction for a given level of incentives. We also find that the policies being implemented in the Marketplaces (a mix of reinsurance and two-sided risk corridor policies) substantially limit insurer risk but perform similarly to a simpler stand-alone reinsurance policy.","[Layton, Timothy J.; Mcguire, Thomas G.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Hlth Care Policy, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Sinaiko, Anna D.] Harvard Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Boston, MA USA",Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Methods: A systematic review established the disease areas with the strong sources of evidence of the short, medium and long-term benefits of human milk for preterm infants as opposed to the use of formula milk. The analysis assessed the economic impact of reducing rates of necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, sudden infant death syndrome, leukaemia, otitis media, obesity and neurodevelopmental impairment. Results: Based on the number of preterm babies born in 2013, if 100% of premature infants being fed mother's milk could be achieved in the NICU, the total lifetime cost savings to the NHS due to improved health outcomes is estimated to be 46.7 pound million (30.1 pound million in the first year) with a total lifetime QALY gain of 10,594, There would be 238 fewer deaths due to neonatal infections and SIDS, resulting in a reduction of approximately 153.4 pound million in lifetime productivity. Sensitivity analyses indicated that results were robust to a wide range of inputs. Conclusions: This analysis established that increasing the use of human milk in NICUs in the UK would lead to cost savings to the NHS. More research is needed on the medium and long term health and economic outcomes associated with breastfeeding preterm infants, and the differences between mother's own and donor breast milk.","[Mahon, James; Claxton, Lindsay; Wood, Hannah] Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House Innovat Way, York YO10 5NQ, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Mahon, J (通讯作者)，Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House Innovat Way, York YO10 5NQ, N Yorkshire, England.",Jamesmahon@coldingham-economics.co.uk,,"Wood, Hannah/0000-0002-4983-0342",Medela AG,Medela AG,"We confirm that this manuscript describes original work and has neither been published elsewhere nor is under consideration by any other journal.

In this paper we go further and think that it is a first level driver in the configuration of our deepest perceptions and has a paramount influence on shaping our worldviews and metaphors, though this aspect goes unnoticed for most of the population. In this paper we analyze how metaphors take action in the characterization of technologies, mainly emerging technologies, and in their evolution, and furthermore the impact of technologies and metaphors on the way we perceive our daily life. We analyze metaphors underlying brain nature and artificial intelligence, raising the connections between them and showing how metaphors in one of these fields impact on the way we understand the other. This fact has important consequences, for instance it conditions the evolution of computational systems, and we propose two scenarios for this evolution. This paper relies on the conceptual model and classification of metaphors proposed by Lakoff and Johnson in Metaphors we live by, from the orientational metaphors that show values and mantras, to the deepest structural metaphors that are reconfiguring how life is conceived. It also relies on CLA (Causal Layered Analysis) and to its reference book CLA 2.0 in order to insert this analysis in a wider and future oriented framework and to analyze scenarios.

Among students with high baseline attendance, the incentive had no effect on attendance after it was discontinued, and test scores were unaffected. Among students with low baseline attendance, the incentive lowered post-incentive attendance, and test scores decreased. For these students, the incentive was also associated with lower interest in school material and lower optimism and confidence about their ability. This suggests incentives might have unintended long-term consequences for the very students they are designed to help the most. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In other words, futures studies frame futures. These frames might be powerful, triggering social action and societal transformation, yet they risk to be criticised and provoke scepticism. The environmental field has a long tradition in futures studies: environmental outlooks. Some of these outlooks, e.g. those published by the IPCC are among the most prominent examples of outlooks that provoke scientific, social and political debate, create commotion and provoke action. Part of these discussions deal with how outlooks frame the future and how they handle the uncertainty inevitably linked to framing futures. The way these challenges are dealt with may affect the overall assessment of an environmental outlook. This article attempts to identify the way environmental outlooks frame futures. We do not strive for exhaustiveness, but deliberately restrict to an in-depth analysis of a handful of recent environmental outlooks. We conclude that environmental outlooks reflect a lack of clarity and argumentation upon how they frame futures and how they deal with uncertainty. This epistemological and methodological ambiguity risk to affect the outlooks' credibility and impact. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Most of the literature on this green electricity market focuses on consumers' characteristics and product attributes that could affect participation. However, the contribution of this environmental consumerism to the overall environmental good does not depend on participation alone. The real impact relies on market participation for green consumers (the proportion of green consumers) combined with the level of green consumption intensity - the commitment levels, or proportion of consumption that is green. We design an online interface that closely mimics the real market decision environment for electricity consumers in Western Australia and use an error component model to analyze consumers' choice of green electricity products and their commitment levels. We show that product attributes have limited impact on the choice of green products; however, there is still great potential for better participation by improving the design of green electricity programs. When green products are selected, most respondents select the minimum commitment possible, and this is insensitive to the premium being charged on green power, suggesting that we are largely observing a buy-in 'warm glow' for carbon mitigation.

Using theories of policy instrument choice, this paper attempted to shed light on the conditions under which the instrument choice takes place. Over the past few years, there has been a significant change in political perception on illegal logging. In fact, the problem has been brought forward as one of the most chronic forest problems in the country. At the same time, there has been growing dissatisfaction on the previous range of instruments and measures. In addition, MoEF decision to use legality verification heavily interacts with the trend on import legislations in a number of countries. In fact, the trend is still more friendly for Indonesian timber products than boycotts. Legality verification was also preferred due to its streamlined requirements, compared to the more comprehensive standards of sustainability certification. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We find that in utero exposure to elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol negatively affects offspring cognition, health, and educational attainment. These findings are based on comparisons between siblings that limit variation to short-lived shocks and controls for unobserved differences between mothers that could bias estimates. Our results are consistent with recent experimental results in the neurobiological literature linking exogenous exposure to stress hormones in utero with declines in offspring cognitive, behavioral, and motor development. Moreover; we find that not only are mothers with low levels of human capital characterized by higher and more variable cortisol levels but that the negative impact of elevated cortisol on their offspring is greater.

Yet, despite these potential gains, the appropriate design and application of forest conservation and climate change mitigation approaches such as the mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +) in such contexts remain little studied. Unanswered questions relate to the propensity of farmers in conflict affected areas to conserve forests for climate change mitigation. Such questions include, for what reasons and under what circumstances would such farmer participate in climate change mitigation activities? In this paper we address these questions by developing an econometric Logit model to understand factors influencing the propensity to conserve forest of farmers from 14 villages in Colombia. These villages are located in a region recognized as a stronghold of guerrilla insurgencies and as the center for illegal crop cultivation. The region was selected as it is also the proposed target area for piloting Colombian government REDD + activities. A household survey (n = 90) showed that four explanatory variables are significantly related to the 'propensity to conserve forest'. 'Harvest of non-timber forest products' (specifically bush meat) positively influences a farmer's propensity to conserve forest. In contrast, higher 'percentage of forest area', 'deforestation for (the production of) subsistence crops' and 'harvest of wood product', each have a negative influence. Overall, results show an already high propensity to conserve forest among farmers (70% of respondents) and indicate their growing propensity toward the conservation of primary forest and management of degraded lands and secondary forest. These results might be attributable to efforts undertaken to reduce the causes of armed-conflicts and ecosystem deterioration, such as enhancement of land tenure security and farmer associations' rules to reduce deforestation.

Non-preference-based instruments (often disease-specific questionnaires) are commonly mapped to utilities. We investigated if the relationship observed between the Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) and the EQ-5D-3 L in patients with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) also applies in opioid-induced constipation (OIC). Methods: EQ-5D-3 L patient-level data from a clinical study of lubiprostone in OIC (n = 439) were scored using the UK tariff. A published mapping between the PAC-QOL and the EQ-5D-3 L was tested using these data. New mapping formulas were analysed, including PAC-QOL total and subscale scores. The root mean square error (RMSE), the adjusted R-2 and predicted/observed plots were used to test the fit. Results: The utility measured with the EQ-5D-3 L was 0.450 +/- 0.329, with a distinctly bimodal distribution. This significantly improved if patients responded to treatment (defined as an increase of three spontaneous bowel movements per week, with no rescue medication taken). The published mapping in CIC performed poorly in this OIC population, and the PAC-QOL could not be reliably mapped on to the EQ-5D-3 L even when re-estimating coefficients. This was shown in our two mappings (using PAC-QOL total score, and subscale scores) by a high RMSE (0.317 and 0.314) and a low R-2 (0.068 and 0.080), with high utilities underestimated and low utilities overestimated. Conclusions: Patients with OIC have a low quality of life which does improve with the resolution of symptoms. However the PAC-QOL cannot be used to estimate the EQ-5D-3 L utility - potentially as the PAC-QOL does not capture the all relevant aspects of the patients quality of life (for example the cause of the opioid use).","[Hatswell, Anthony James] BresMed, 84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England; [Hatswell, Anthony James] UCL, London, England; [Vegter, Stefan] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands",University of London; University College London; University of Groningen,"Hatswell, AJ (通讯作者)，BresMed, 84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England.;Hatswell, AJ (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.",ahatswell@bresmed.co.uk,,"Hatswell, Anthony/0000-0003-1129-326X",Sucampo Pharma Europe,Sucampo Pharma Europe,"Access to data and funding was provided by Sucampo Pharma Europe.

Following the degrowth argument, the advancement of human well-being calls for a shift from growth-based societies to ones grounded in the ethos of degrowth. In this regard, we acknowledge the necessity for both theoretical principles and examples of good practice, which can lead to this transition. To this end, the article combines some of the underlying principles of the degrowth paradigm (i.e. decolonisation of the imaginary, reciprocity and conviviality, and environmental sustainability) with those of Critical Community Psychology, as well as, in one case, of Liberation Psychology (i.e. conscientisation and de-ideologisation, responsible togetherness, and environmental justice). This integration intends to equip academic scholars, practitioners, and social activists with visions and practices for the implementation of strategic actions aimed at individual and social well-being. The article concludes with a thorough reflection on social justice and how to better promote it through the combined contributions of both degrowth and Critical Community psychology.

Taking a socio-constructionist approach to research and through the analysis of secondary data, it, explores current issues and debates concerned with the environment, disasters and depletion of natural resources; social context including movies and entertainment, the media and technology, the evolution of the theme park and cultural transmission; and economical realities, covering poverty vs. world elite and global culture, all of which are seen as drivers of the potential future tourism market. In so doing, it presents a narrative (scenario), provoking the notion that in the year 2200 death and hunting humans will form part of the tourism entertainment industry and a practice carried out by the wealthy-elite, a view backed with substance. It argues, that as a result of past and current engagements with murder, death and human atrocities, and significantly our relationship with death, humans will gradually become more accustomed to death as a form of spectacle, influenced by current entertainment, movies and the media. Death as entertainment by form of detachment (emotionally and physically) will further influence the future fun aspect of hunting humans. Significantly, changes in our natural environment will lead to great challenges, lack of water, depleted food resources and greater disparity between the wealthy and impoverished; all of which will drive the change in our humanly existence. This papers aims to provide a provocative account of the 'potential future meaning of tourism', through the application of current knowledge, and significantly, it is our relationship with death and violence that are central, death and violence are becoming diluted and thus, will be a source of future entertainment and a tourism activity - in less humans can reach a level of transcendence that has never been present, to transcend the culture they have created, one that has always witnessed violence as a means to survival. If violence can be detached then we will be presented with a 'wild card', a future that is truly out of this world. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To investigate the effect, we use a global vector autoregression (GVAR) model with time-varying trade weights to account for changing international trade linkages. We show that the long-term impact of a shock to Chinese GDP on South African GDP is much stronger in 2009 than in 1995, due to the substantial increase in South Africa's trade with China since the mid-1990s. At the same time, the importance of the U.S. economy to South Africa diminished considerably. The results indicate one of the possible reasons why the recent global crisis did not affect South Africa as much as it affected developed economies. It also stresses the increased risk, to the South African and other economies, should China experience slower GDP growth.","[De Waal, Annari; van Eyden, Renee] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"De Waal, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hatfield, South Africa.",annari.dewaal@up.ac.za,"de Waal, Annari/G-2118-2015; Van Eyden, Renee/AAO-3991-2021","de Waal, Annari/0000-0003-1190-7081; Van Eyden, Renee/0000-0002-6238-6215",Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the UK; Cambridge Commonwealth Trust,Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the UK; Cambridge Commonwealth Trust,Annari De Waal acknowledges financial support from the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the UK and the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust.,,20,8,8,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Moreover, the proposed model is based on specialist insight, and can measure whether the selected technology is still promising and socially and technically feasible at the current time domestically and worldwide based on a technology growth curve. The results of the case study suggest which technology items have been implemented or unimplemented due to particular accelerators or obstacles, which items are still promising, and the technology level of the items. The proposed model focuses on the technology items themselves, whereas previous evaluation activities have focused only on the process and impacts of foresight projects. Moreover, this post-evaluation model can be applied to various emerging technology items that are continuously selected and reported around the world, allowing for the monitoring of changes in the brightness and realization status of previously selected items. Thus, the model can provide feedback for the future selection process to improve the reliability of emerging technology selections and suggest the information for decision-making with related to a particular emerging technology item.

I apply the approach to data from 2004 to 2008 for all hemodialysis patients in Atlanta, Georgia. The results indicate that a one-facility acquisition by the average provider in the average market would lead the average patient to spend 28 percent more days in the ICU/CCU. Estimates that do not control for the role of idiosyncratic matching would predict smaller, though still economically and statistically significant, effects on the affected patients.

Bringing a host state's obligations under other trade agreements as a part of the Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET) standard in investment treaties represents a new challenge. As argued here, a host state's violation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) establishing a violation of the FET standard not only serves as a unique single issue to be decided in an investment dispute, but would also have important legal implications. That is, investor-state arbitration might function as a competing forum with the WTO for setting future trade matters, and the risk of fragmenting WTO law in various arbitral awards would be increased. Ultimately, the security and predictability of the WTO law system would be undermined and eroded in the context of investment treaties. It is suggested that WTO Members should develop more efficient rules to safeguard the integrity of WTO law from undue interferences by investors in their investment treaties.","[Lin, Tsai-yu] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Law, Law, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lin, Tsai-yu] Natl Chengchi Univ, LLB, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Lin, Tsai-yu] Univ Edinburgh, LLM, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Lin, Tsai-yu] Natl Chengchi Univ, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Chengchi University; University of Edinburgh; National Chengchi University,"Lin, TY (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Law, Law, Taipei, Taiwan.;Lin, TY (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, LLB, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan.;Lin, TY (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, LLM, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland.;Lin, TY (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan.",tylinkkry@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,20,2,2,0,0,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

In the last 25 years, the country's forestry sector has undergone several reorganizations. In the process of a current reform, the overall aim of this study is to gain a broader understanding of the current state of forest sector in Tajikistan. Our specific objectives are a) to describe the current institutional network's complexity, (b) to analyze stakeholders' perceptions on the key challenges towards good forest governance, (c) and give recommendations to tackle the key challenges, so that important forest ecosystem services (ES) may be enhanced, thus, also contribute to the development of the sector. We elaborate a generic framework, which simplifies complex interaction of governance and forests ecosystem services. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through questionnaire-based interviews with stakeholders of the forestry sector. The results indicate that the forestry sector is still far from representing good forest governance, however the newly established structure seems to be a first step. Yet, challenges in establishing sound legal frameworks, decision-making transparency, and implementation enforcement must still be overcome. While it is too early and challenging to assess the impacts of forest governance on ES and vice versa, the survey respondents highlight the importance of provisioning services for the development of the forest sector. Given the post-Soviet background, almost all member countries developed along similar lines. Therefore, the study results are not only of significance for Tajikistan, but also countries with similar history and socioeconomic context. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To address this, we used Florida (U.S.) as a case study, and identified barriers to forest landowner participation in a hypothetical carbon-offset program and landowner willingness-to-accept compensation for enrollment. Preferences were elicited via survey methods and a recent innovation to best-worst scaling (BWS), called best-worst choice (BWC), which retains the analytical features of scaling while enabling measurements in a traditional discrete-choice framework. Results indicate that NIPF landowners are more influenced by revenue than early withdrawal penalty or contract duration, but will exchange revenue for other contract features. We estimate that programs offering $20 or $30 per-acre-per-year have significantly stronger impacts on enrollment than $5 or $10. The least preferred feature was a 100-year commitment. Overall our BWC approach is novel in that it circumvents BWS` limitation by providing an ability to estimate actual willingness-to-pay/accept. The U.S. has a new policy to cut 32% of 2005 power plant carbon emissions by 2030 and allow forest C offsets. Thus, results can also be used to inform state-level policies that compensate landowners for capturing C emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines one potential source: the countries' constitutions. Based on a large cross-country dataset from 2011, the study demonstrates that women's representation in parliament is larger in countries with constitutional protection from gender-based discrimination. Baseline estimates suggest that the presence of such protection results in over a 3.5 percentage point increase in women's share of parliamentary seats. The study probes some underlying mechanisms and shows that places with constitutional protection from gender-based discrimination are likely to have legislation directly targeting women's underrepresentation.

Robin Brumfield and Burhan Ozkan, co-founded Suzanne's Project in Turkey to empower Turkish women by providing them with the necessary tools and resources to scale and sustain profitable agricultural businesses. Forty-five percent of Turkey's female work-force are farmers who serve a vital role in the region's economic advancement toward sustainable agriculture, gender equality and food security. To empower the women through education the program provided training in business planning and management and also included computer literacy, alternative production systems, soil productivity, plant nutrition, and other best management practices training. The courses resulted in 100% of the women completing most sections of an agricultural business plan by the end of the course using guided worksheets. A survey of women who participated in Suzanne's Project 1.5 years after they took the course indicated that it had lasting, positive effects on them. The investigators conducted face-to-face interviews of participants in the pilot program. Follow-up survey questions explored changes in personal empowerment, program impacts on their business, inter-personal networking, and suggestions for changing/improving the course. All of the women felt more personally empowered after taking the course as exemplified by the statement before, I was only the woman and wife, but now I am a business woman. One woman commented that she had more respect from her husband after taking the course. The biggest changes in their businesses after the course were an increase in sustainable production practices and beginning to keep records for cost accounting, including knowing what records to keep and why. 100% of participants were eager to share what they had learned with other women and with their husbands. Participants expressed an interest in taking more courses, especially on cost accounting. They would like similar courses to be offered to their husbands, but they appreciated the women only setting for their classes.","[Brumfield, R.

Design A two-part demand model for alcohol consumption is used to determine the price elasticity of alcohol. Quantile regression is used to determine the price elasticity estimates for various levels of consumption. Setting The study uses Australian data collected by the National Drug Strategy Household Survey for the years 2001, 2004 and 2007. Measurements Measures of individual annual alcohol consumption were derived from three waves of the National Drug Strategy Household Survey; alcohol prices were taken from market research reports. Findings For the overall population of drinkers, a 1 % increase in the price of alcohol was associated with a 0.96 % (95 % CI -0.35 %, -1.57 %) reduction in alcohol consumption. For those in the highest 10 % of drinkers by average amount consumed, a 1 % increase in the price of alcohol was associated with a 1.26 % (95 % CI 0.82 %, 1.70 %) reduction in consumption. Conclusions Within Australia, policies that increase the price of alcohol are about equally effective in relative terms for reducing alcohol consumption both for the general population and among those who drink heavily.","[Byrnes, Joshua] Griffith Univ, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Logan Campus L03 2-15, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia; [Shakeshaft, Anthony] Univ New S Wales, Natl Drug & Alcohol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Petrie, Dennis] Univ Melbourne, Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Doran, Christopher M.] Hunter Med Res Inst, Newcastle, NSW 2305, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Logan Campus; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Melbourne; Hunter Medical Research Institute; University of Newcastle,"Byrnes, J (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Logan Campus L03 2-15, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia.",j.byrnes@griffith.edu.au,"Petrie, Dennis/L-7689-2018; Petrie, Dennis/AAK-5153-2020; Shakeshaft, Anthony/U-4637-2017; Byrnes, Josh/AAA-4387-2021","Petrie, Dennis/0000-0002-3882-2531; Petrie, Dennis/0000-0002-3882-2531; Shakeshaft, Anthony/0000-0002-5472-0930; Byrnes, Joshua/0000-0001-6562-711X",,,,,45,10,10,1,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

It examines entitlement characteristics, such as nontransferability, duration, payment, compulsory period, and other policies to assess their effect on the proportion of leave men use out of the total parental leave in each country. The findings, which suggest that a large majority of men take nontransferable and highly paid leave, and a small minority take other types, provide the basis for developing the Parental Leave Equality Index (PLEI). PLEI ranks countries by the degree to which parental leave policies reinforce or diminish the gendered division of labor. Results indicate that although Iceland's parental leave policies do the most to advance gender equity, no country has equal, nontransferable, and well-paid leave for each parent. This policy arrangement would be a precondition to men's and women's equal participation in childcare.","[Castro-Garcia, Carmen] Pablo Olavide Univ, Econ Quantitat Methods & Econ Hist Dept, Seville, Spain; [Pazos-Moran, Maria] Inst Fiscal Studies, Res Area Gender & Publ Policies, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Castro-García, C (通讯作者)，Pablo Olavide Univ, Econ Quantitat Methods & Econ Hist Dept, Seville, Spain.",carmen@singenerodedudas.com; maria.pazos@ief.minhap.es,,,,,,,51,65,70,5,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

This chapter interrogates the role technology plays in development in rural regions through a micro-level study. Specifically, it interrogates an ICT4D project established by a prominent Indian NGO that aims to empower rural communities through public access to ICTs. Drawing upon field based research from the state of Tamil Nadu and the Union Territory of Pondicherry, South India, this paper demonstrates that ICTs do offer limited opportunities in the form of generic information and enhanced skills, especially amongst children, young and -educated people, to participate in the information revolution. Research also shows that it can provide employment opportunities on occasion, develop the social prestige of individuals and the villages and offer opportunities to specific groups within the-village communities such as women, youth and others who are otherwise socially marginalised. That said, the research also illustrates that the due to the uneven distribution of gains of growth in India since neoliberalisation in the 1990s, ICTs have not been conducive to transformative empowerment. Drawing on literature on empowerment, I argue that while ICTs provide opportunities for empowerment, existing structural inequalities and systemic conditions hinder the possibilities for transformative empowerment and in some instances reinforce pre-existing inequalities and contributes to uneven development. Empowerment through ICTs can only be enabled if the ICT4D initiative addresses the key drivers of marginalisation in rural communities-structural and-systemic conditions.","[Chatbar, Rakhee] Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Chatbar, R (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.",chara651@gmail.com,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2198-9923,,978-981-10-0454-4; 978-981-10-0453-7,DYNAM ASIAN DEVEL,,,2016,,,,,,,209,228,,10.1007/978-981-10-0454-4_11,0.0,,,20,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BG8KZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392399800011,0

My paper uses data from the banking sector for estimating the cost and profit performance on these banks. Using these time series I could observe the CRM implementation impact over these two variables variation in time. The implementation of a CRM system increases a company's ability to obtain profit. Usually, those companies which implement CRM, earn sufficient money to defray addition costs. Considering companies from bank sector, we agree that their high quality products and services empower these companies with an additional revenue that overcomes the significant cost of using a CRM system. The conclusion is that companies generate value for themselves by generating value for their clients. So the CRM role is in creating the dual value.","[Chirita, Nora; Barbul, Andrada] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Econ Cybernet Stat & Informat, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Chirita, N (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Econ Cybernet Stat & Informat, Bucharest, Romania.",norachirita@yahoo.com; andradabarbul7@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,231,236,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386192300037,0

Since much of the fishing industry is composed of small family-owned businesses, commercial fishermen often have to rely on the private health insurance markets. Do commercial fishermen working in more dangerous areas or with more dangerous gear mitigate their risk by purchasing health insurance? I examine the relationship between the economics of the North Carolina commercial fishing fleet and private market health insurance purchases in the two years immediately preceding the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010. Establishing this baseline is important, as the slow implementation of the Act's expanded coverage will take time to make meaningful impacts on commercial fishing fleets. I close by considering which aspects of commercial fishing might be most affected by the ACA.","[Crosson, Scott] NOAA, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 75 Virginia Beach Dr, Miami, FL 33149 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Crosson, S (通讯作者)，NOAA, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 75 Virginia Beach Dr, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",scott.crosson@noaa.gov,,"Crosson, Scott/0000-0002-8126-1282",NOAA [NA05NMF4741003],NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),I thank the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries for continued access to their original data and for agreeing to participate in a follow-up study.

An index of riskiness is then estimated and used to calculate the augmented performance measure (APM). By construction, the APM separates the managerial premium of the fund from systematic risk premium, so it is better than the economic performance measure.

In this chapter I argue that Howrah's hastis, many of which are inhabited by the minority and marginalised Muslim population, are forgotten places: historically and politically constructed habitats that are neglected, but nevertheless deeply inhabited, by the state (Lee and Yeoh, Urban Studies 41(12): 2295-2301, 2004; Fernandes, Critical Asian Studies 42(2): 265-272, 2010). In these hastis, services that are the responsibility of the state, such as access to education or the civic amenities discussed by Walters (this volume), are not adequately provided for, resulting in uneven development and vulnerable urban spaces within Howrah city. Furthermore, I show how forgotten places leave a gap that NGOs and grassroots organisations try to fill, drawing on ethnographic fieldwork to describe the efforts of Howrah Pilot Project, an organisation that runs grassroots-level development initiatives in one of Howrah's bastis. By considering how Howrah Pilot Project works to provide Muslim children from the poorest households within that basti with access to education-widely considered a basic human right-I argue that it can be viewed as a response to the processes of active forgetting perpetuated through historical sociocultural structures of inequality and injustice. However, such organisations need to be augmented by a responsive state in order to achieve meaningful, long-term, beneficial change.","[Gibson, Lorena] Victoria Univ Wellington, Cultural Anthropol, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Gibson, L (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Cultural Anthropol, Wellington, New Zealand.",Lorena.Gibson@vuw.ac.nz,"Gibson, Lorena/O-9260-2016",,,,,,51,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2198-9923,,978-981-10-0454-4; 978-981-10-0453-7,DYNAM ASIAN DEVEL,,,2016,,,,,,,187,207,,10.1007/978-981-10-0454-4_10,0.0,,,21,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BG8KZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392399800010,0

However, it is essential to realize that the population is very extensive term and brings together groups of people with different characteristics. Therefore not only the influence of the population as a whole was examined, but the population was for research purpose divided into groups according to the economic activity of citizens. The relationship between population and air transport demand was explored in Germany as a whole and also separately for its districts. Although previous research has proven the relationship between the population and air transport demand, in this case is shown that air transport demand depends much more on number of inactive citizens than on the whole population. It was also discovered that the demand is more dependent on the total population of the country than on the number of inhabitants in individual districts.","[Hermankova, Lenka; Melichar, Vlastimil] Univ Pardubice, Jan Perner Transport Fac, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Hermánková, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Jan Perner Transport Fac, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",,"Melichar, Vlastimil/W-9412-2018","Melichar, Vlastimil/0000-0001-8232-1614",,,,,14,0,0,1,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,19,25,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200003,0

The evidence shows that bank size, the degree of revenue diversification, and the CEO's shareholding are positively associated with the independent directors ratio. A higher outside block shareholding is correlated with a larger board size and a higher independent directors ratio. As the creditors' stake decreases, a larger board and greater board independence are required to maintain internal corporate governance.

By analyzing a Coasean environment where the appropriation of property rights is costly, we show Coasean bargaining in the presence of a pre-existing (Pigouvian) tax may be superior.

One way to mitigate the negative effects of these processes is to support the formation of human capital, strengthening the competent adaptability and mobility of labor, which will help to build social and emotional resilience to shocks in labor markets. At the same time, more demands are and will be placed on a man than in the past, not only at the level of knowledge, willingness to acquire professional knowledge, but also at the level of more commitment, perseverance, creativity, purposefulness, ability to get ahead and achieve something, ability to carry a certain amount of risk and responsibility for their personal progress as part of human capital of an individual. A close relationship to the creation and transfer of knowledge in the information society creates for everyone a challenge to sustain and enrich their competencies continuously. Since we are continuous learning, human capital is constantly forming and developing. In terms of development and formation of human capital, there is new trend of lifelong education within the school education system as well as trainings along the job in educational structures of enterprises and in all ranges of formal and informal education, within all methods of acquiring knowledge are applied, including a self-study. Today, most of the knowledge are aging and even outdated before the working life end- rapid economic and technological development causes the acceleration of time, and consequently individuals or groups do not come into contact with a permanently existing knowledge or traditional classification of knowledge. They are rather to meet variable flow of knowledge, which direction is difficult to predict. The risk of high flexibility in the labor market include the fact that the acquiring of skills required for success in the labor market is becoming more and more an individual responsibility, along with how flexible employment relationships helped to weaken corporate investments in trainings.","[Martincova, Marta] Univ Econ Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Martincová, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia.",,,,VEGA [c.1/0409/14],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This article was elaborated in the framework of the research project VEGA c.1/0409/14 Development trends of comparative economic systems.,,9,0,0,0,9,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,315,321,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100042,0

Over the last few years, across the region, services are increasing as a share of total employment, GDP and exports, driving value addition and providing critical inputs to boost other economic activities. The purpose of this paper is to describe the performance of CEECs in exporting services that become more apparent when one looks at trade through the lens of new trade-in-tasks paradigm. This significance of services in trade has been demonstrated through two key elements: (1) services as final exports and (2) the role of services in supporting other export economic activities, such as manufacturing. Findings of the study suggest that services are a significant source of the region's international competitiveness and CEECs seem to be the group that currently is reaping the benefit from the globalization of services.

Due to operational issues within a fresh produce supply chain involving many small and medium players, the coordination and communication will be inefficient. This results in perceptions of unfair behaviour and results in strained supply chain relationships within a food supply chain. The paper proposes the implementation of the MOVIE (Model, Operations, View, Intelligence and Events) model to instigate distributive, procedural and interactive fairness perceptions along the entire supply chain. By communicating on a real-time basis and accounting for user specific access levels, the proposed cloud-based IT system will provide better access to information pertaining to the products, whilst it is being processed by different elements within the supply chain. Through accurate and timely communication of this information, the information that was traditionally communicated only to the bigger and more powerful supply chain actors will be available to every supply chain actor irrespective of size or purchasing power. Though Enterprise Resource Planning systems are plentiful, this has not percolated the food supply chain sector, and the proposed system accounts for such a lack within the food supply chain management context. The implementation of the proposed system will not only improve storage and marketing of easily perishable fruits and vegetables but also effectively improve perception of fairness along the fresh food supply chain, thus contributing to effective supply chain relationships.","[Paul, R.] RMIT Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Info Tech, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Jacob-John, J.] La Trobe Univ, Fac Business Econ & Law, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); La Trobe University,"Paul, R (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Info Tech, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,3,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62611-11-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2016,1132,,,,,,105,112,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1132.14,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7DM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391238400014,0

Romania stands out in particular through its potential natural tourism, through its geographic position that offers a status of the Carpathian-Danubian-Pontic country, through its natural elements defining the structure and landscape of the territory: the Carpathian Mountains, the Danube River and Black Sea. There is one negative aspect that refers to these elements as not being exploited at its maximum level. An original component of the anthropic resource in Romanian tourism is rural tourism with its typical symbols: music and costumes, crafts, gourmet products, dances, folk instruments, handicraft articles. As a trend, Romanian village will undergo to both favorable and unfavorable social and economic effects. The favorable ones, derive from economic activities developed, and unfavorable ones are especially environmental. The favorable effects lead to local and regional development which includes the village. Romanian tourism has many shortcomings: too many tourists and abandoned equipment and materials that can undermine small settlements. Another major issue concerns culture and education of the tourists. Demand in terms of places and products, should not cause distortion and destabilization of local culture. Tourism development without respecting a particular code is damaging both for countryside and natural ecosystem. The countryside is exposed to degradation through the following actions: depopulation, the rapid spread of urban areas, soil, water, air. land and forest pollution, increasing and generalized degradation of the landscapes and cultural qualities.","[Popescu, Gabriela; Adamov, Tabita; Dincu, Ana Mariana; Iosmim, Iasmina] Banats Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med King Michael I Roma, Timisoara, Romania",Banat University of Agricultural Sciences & Veterinary Medicine,"Popescu, G (通讯作者)，Banats Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med King Michael I Roma, Timisoara, Romania.",,"TABITA CORNELIA, ADAMOV/GWQ-7737-2022; Iosim, Iasmina/B-2683-2019",,,,,,7,0,0,0,8,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,495,502,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200064,0

This means that in competitive markets the VAT should be kept, while in markets with imperfect competition the replacement of the VAT with other indirect tax, notably the turnover tax, could be considered. We conclude by determining, based on the developed theoretical model, weaknesses, which should be taken into account by policymakers and tax officials when designing tax reform policy in order to prevent market failures.","[Sokolovska, Olena] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Kyiv Inst Ind Econ, Res Inst Fiscal Policy, State Fiscal Serv Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine; [Sokolovskyi, Dmytro] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Inst Ind Econ, Kiev, Ukraine; [Serebrianskyi, Dmytro] State Fiscal Serv Ukraine, Res Inst Fiscal Policy, Kiev, Ukraine",National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Institute of Industrial Economics of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine; National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Institute of Industrial Economics of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine,"Sokolovska, O (通讯作者)，Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Kyiv Inst Ind Econ, Res Inst Fiscal Policy, State Fiscal Serv Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine.",elena.lukyanenko@gmail.com,"Sokolovska, Olena/H-2270-2014; Sokolovskyi, Dmytro/H-8313-2014","Sokolovska, Olena/0000-0002-4259-3786; Sokolovskyi, Dmytro/0000-0002-4339-4201",,,,,17,0,0,0,0,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The conclusions of the macroeconomic analysis can be checked for the consumers by an empirical survey, examining the consumer attitudes and preferences about the use of electronic commerce in Romanian urban areas. The analyzed sample comprised 385 young urban consumers, stratified by gender, age, income, employment status and level of education, which were directly interviewed, the questionnaire containing 20 items. Based on the macroeconomic data analysis, the results showed that Romania is occupying one of the last places of the hierarchy of countries according to the number of computers users per 100 inhabitants, due to the lack of computers in the rural areas. The empirical analysis showed that the low usage rate of the e-commerce is due, in the opinion of users, to fear for fraud, the lack of trust in the payment safety on the internet, ineffective web-sites and also due to the low promotion of e-commerce.

Our results show that the plan as it was formulated was globally beneficial to the forest sector compared with a scenario without a plan. In addition, we show that, compared with the formulated plan, a storage-oriented alternative plan reduces the fall in price observed after the hurricane, increases storage volume, increases the total gains in surplus of the overall sector but postpones the price rebound after the shock.

Homeowners may a have a preference or distaste for year-round calendars for a variety of reasons, ranging from perceived academic effects to family home and work life disruptions. If households do favor one school calendar relative to another, they may have to pay an additional amount to move to a house with a different calendar. In this paper, we test this possibility. We exploit a natural experiment setting to examine how multi-track year-round calendars influence Wake County, NC residential housing prices. School assignment zone and school fixed effects are included to control for unobserved neighborhood and school characteristics that might be correlated with year-round calendars and housing prices.

Thus, the purpose of this study was to estimate the utility associated with treatment administration and adverse events of hepatitis C treatments. Design Health states were drafted based on literature review and clinician interviews. General population participants in the UK valued the health states in time tradeoff (TTO) interviews with 10-and 1-year time horizons. The 14 health states described hepatitis C with variations in treatment regimen and adverse events. Results A total of 182 participants completed interviews (50 % female; mean age = 39.3 years). Utilities for health states describing treatment regimens without injections ranged from 0.80 (1 tablet) to 0.79 (7 tablets). Utilities for health states describing oral plus injectable regimens were 0.77 (7 tablets), 0.75 (12 tablets), and 0.71 (18 tablets). Addition of a weekly injection had a disutility of -0.02. A requirement to take medication with fatty food had a disutility of -0.04. Adverse events were associated with substantial disutilities: mild anemia, -0.12; severe anemia, -0.32; flu-like symptoms, -0.21; mild rash, -0.13; severe rash, -0.48; depression, -0.47. One-year TTO scores were similar to these 10-year values. Conclusions Adverse events and greater treatment regimen complexity were associated with lower utility scores, suggesting a perceived decrease in quality of life beyond the impact of hepatitis C. The resulting utilities may be used in models estimating and comparing the value of treatments for hepatitis","[Matza, Louis S.; Devine, Mary K.; Jordan, Jessica B.; Landrian, Amanda S.] Outcomes Res, Evidera,7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Sapra, Sandhya J.; Kalsekar, Anupama] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Global Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Princeton, NJ USA; [Dillon, John F.] Univ Dundee, NHS Tayside & Med Res Inst, Dundee, Scotland; [Davies, Evan W.] Outcomes Res, London, England; [Feeny, David H.] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON, Canada",Evidera; Bristol-Myers Squibb; University of Dundee; McMaster University,"Matza, LS (通讯作者)，Outcomes Res, Evidera,7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",louis.matza@evidera.com,"Dillon, John F/A-2478-2013; Davies, Evan/GWU-9310-2022","Dillon, John/0000-0002-2164-4476",Bristol-Myers Squibb,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),"Financial support for this study was provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb.

The paper is based on case studies in four Community-Forestry User Groups (CFUG) in the mid-Hills of Nepal and draws upon semi-structured interviews, participatory rural appraisal exercises and analyses of aerial photographs. First, we find that the operational plans supposed to guide community-level management are based on sub-standard forest inventories, which limits their potential role in practical forest management. Second, we find that community-level managers do not rely on the operational plans in their practical forest management. Finally, we find that community-level forest managers in these four cases have managed to conserve their community forests over time and appear knowledgeable about the developments in the condition of their forests in the sense that their impressions of past and current forest condition are mirrored in what we can observe from analysis of change in forest condition based on aerial photographs. Based on these results we question the usefulness of inventory-based management planning in the context of community forestry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A systematic framework was used to collect and organise qualitative and quantitative evidence from thirty three case studies across Wales, Scotland and England. Two descriptive typologies emerged from an iterative analysis of the case study data: one identifies five different business models and one deals with community involvement in governance and benefit distribution and finds four different enterprise types. Testing detailed financial data against the typologies demonstrates the limitations of current definitions of social and community enterprises in the forestry sector. The balance of traded and grant income used to distinguish between enterprise types is not a satisfactory device in forestry contexts. Three main barriers to enterprise development were identified as start-up costs, woodland and business management skills, and bureaucracy. Evidence supporting the popular hypothesis that social and community enterprises produce more and diverse benefits from woods was elusive. Policy responses should recognise a broad spectrum of woodland enterprise types rather than social enterprise alone, focus on the potential of different business models, and enable communities to find innovative solutions to securing the capital, technical and legal advice they require.

For many of these catastrophes, isolated refuges could keep some people alive and enable them to rebuild civilization in the post-catastrophe world. This paper examines the potential importance of refuges and what it would take to make them succeed. The successful refuge will have a variety of qualities, including isolation from catastrophes and self-sufficiency. These qualities can be achieved through a variety of specific design features. We introduce the concept of surface-independence as the gold standard for refuge excellence: refuges isolated from Earth's surface will offer maximum protection against both the catastrophe itself and potentially harmful post-catastrophe populations. However, surface-independence introduces significant design challenges. We present several challenges and evaluate possible solutions. Self-sufficiency in food provision can be greatly enhanced via chemical food synthesis. The rejection of waste heat from subterranean refuges can be enhanced via building piping networks and locating refuges near running groundwater or in ice. The high cost of extraterrestrial refuges can be offset by integrating refuges into space missions with scientific, political, or commercial goals. Overall, refuges show much promise for protecting civilization against global catastrophes and thus warrant serious consideration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The program supports alternative forms of transportation: public transit, membership in ride-share or car-share programs, and/or the purchase of a bicycle. However, it is not known whether the program constitutes an efficient allocation of government funding, or how the scheme compares to more basic programs offering only cash subsidies. Using a novel dataset combining data from BC SCRAP-IT with British Columbia's AirCare emissions testing program, we find that BC SCRAP-IT results in substantial emissions reductions and that this type of incentives scheme compares favourably with previous subsidy-only schemes. On average, emissions reductions per vehicle are equivalent to a benefit of C$566, whereas the average program payout is C$886 per participant.

To determine if the market induces a real deterrence effect, we extend the event windows up to one year. On average, the market reacts negatively and enduringly to the announcement of an accident. However, this average effect is largely driven by the airline industry and by government interventions. The estimated average compounded abnormal return following environmental accidents does not differ from zero after one year. This does not exclude, in severe events affecting large firms, huge losses in equity value, but the significant negative cumulative abnormal returns estimated immediately after an environmental accident in previous studies do not persist. Our results suggest that in a market driven by institutional investors, the deterrence effect is likely to be weak. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The SF-6D is a preference-based measure of health, the use of which has been increasing throughout the world. Other countries have provided population norms for the SF-6D. To date, SF-6D population norms for Portugal do not exist. This study therefore aimed to derive SF-6D Portuguese population norms. A representative sample of the Portuguese general public (n = 1,500) was used in a telephone-based interview. The SF-36v2 was applied and the Portuguese SF-6D value set was used to obtain the SF-6D index. Descriptive and inferential data analyses were applied to sociodemographic variables, the dimensions of the SF-6D and the SF-6D index. Health index scores of the target population and selected subpopulations were estimated using domain estimation techniques when necessary. SF-6D utility scores decline with increasing age. Women, widowed individuals and individuals with low educational attainment report lower levels of SF-6D utility scores than men, those with a high educational attainment and those who are single.

The rationale and potentials of the two pilots as arenas for socio-technical experimentation and global niche formation are analysed, as well as the tensions and bottlenecks involved in nurturing socially rich innovation ecosystems and in maintaining social and political support over time.","[Carvalho, Luis] Erasmus Univ, European Inst Comparat Urban Res Euricur, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Carvalho, Luis] Erasmus Univ, Dept Urban Port & Transport Econ RHV, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Carvalho, L (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, European Inst Comparat Urban Res Euricur, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50,Room H16-23, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",decarvalho@ese.eur.nl,"Carvalho, Luis/W-3271-2019","Carvalho, Luis/0000-0002-7700-4558",Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies,"I am very grateful to the Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies for their financial support (case of Songdo) and to all the interviewees and colleagues who greatly helped during the field visits and collection of empirical material, in particular Jeroen van Haaren, Joao Bruno Campos, Ines Placido Santos and Leo van den Berg.

A brief survey of the business models and corporate governance of the major BRICS economies demonstrates the considerable differentiation that exists among them, but even more so, with the exception of South Africa, the BRICS economies stand in contrast to the Anglo-American model of developed legal and regulatory structures and market-oriented corporate governance. This suggests a vitality in the diversity of governance and institutions, which can continue to deliver high rates of business growth and economic development.","[Clarke, Thomas] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Clarke, T (通讯作者)，UTS Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",t.clarke@uts.edu.au,,"Clarke, Thomas/0000-0002-9719-9647",,,,,138,7,8,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

This paper examines patterns of association between household wealth, poverty, and livelihood dependency either on forest extraction or agricultural activities in Ucayali, Peru. The analysis is based on survey data of 578 households with geographical, ethnic and environmental heterogeneity. A typology of economic strategies was defined through relative income shares derived from agriculture, forest, wages and other income sources. Our results show that households have multifaceted livelihood systems. While forest/environmental products provide nearly 40% of total income, agriculture is critical to both indigenous communities and to farmers of non-Amazonian origin. We test the hypothesis that households relying on agriculture are wealthier than forest-dependent households. In addition, we examine the role played by ethnicity and location as interacting variables. The analysis suggests a strong role of specific ethnic and locational configurations in shaping income and asset patterns, with some weak evidence of statistically lower poverty levels being credited to dependency on forest products. Context-specific assessments of livelihood-environment interactions provide critical insights to development and environmental policies and programs, which need to recognize different forms through which households integrate forest use and agriculture.

I argue that much of this analysis relies on a notion of efficiency that is flawed on both static and dynamic grounds and fails to address the inefficiencies of existing management institutions. I propose that reallocation is rarely a first-order concern. Rather, it is a red herring that detracts from far more necessary fundamental reforms within the recreational sector. These reforms would significantly improve the accountability and efficiency of the sector and establish the necessary institutions to resolve allocation disputes in an adaptive, efficient manner through arms-length transactions. I propose a general framework for reform of mixed recreational-commercial fisheries and discuss realistic rights-based policies to better manage fishing mortality for private recreational anglers and facilitate transferability across sectors. I close with an appeal for more policy-relevant work on recreational fisheries by fisheries economists.","[Abbott, Joshua K.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Abbott, Joshua K.] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Environm Econ & Sustainabil Policy, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Abbott, JK (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, POB 875502, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",joshua.k.abbott@asu.edu,,,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,"I thank Daniel Willard, Roger Martini, Jim Wilen, Mike Travis, and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

These trends have a positive impact on the proximity market. The companies' objectives are to maximize financial resources, attract customers and increase their fidelity by satisfying their continuously developing needs. We cannot deny the fact that digital marketing plays a major role in the business environment and in today's economy. The strategies of marketing specialists attempt to attract and build fidelity among customers, not by the use of physical dissemination materials but through the means of the approved accustomed technology, which is at the customers' disposal. The paper underlines the development of proximity marketing, as a way of communication between firms and clients. The importance of the mobile phone/tablet has become indispensable for keeping the customers informed. This fact has determined a strong influence that digital impact has on the consumer's behavior. The paper explains the extent to which the new proximity technologies (devices that emit notification signals beacons) are present in the sectors of economy worldwide, mainly in the developed countries. With the help of surveys (quantitative instruments) made by various marketing specialists we can notice that in the near future of digital market, the proximity towards the customer will become the new strategy adopted by companies in order to satisfy the client's needs.","[Ana-Maria, Giurea] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Ana-Maria, G (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",ana.giurea@yahoo.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,2,8,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2457-483X,,,PROC BASIQ,,,2015,,,,,,,361,369,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK2IL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000432877200044,0

Our tests yield three distinct market regimes (low, high, and extreme volatility) and evidence consistent with herd behavior during both the high- and extreme-volatility regimes. U.S. market-related factors are found to dominate regime transitions and thus significantly contribute to herd behavior in all market sectors with the exception of industrials, suggesting that industrials are relatively immune to global shocks.

Thereby, appropriate, forecasting techniques are critically important for the SC's decision-makers to analyze and uncover the patterns of historical correlative data of the demands and then project those patterns into the future. A novel statistical forecasting method based on the dynamic relationship identification algorithm (SF-DRIA) was presented in this paper Combined with the adaptive modeling techniques, the dynamic relationship model reflecting the relational pattern between the forecasting result and its correlative influencing variables was constructed initially. Then, in accordance with the continuously optimized forecasting precision and the newly added correlative data, the parameter estimates and the structure coefficients of the model were regulated to achieve the optimal forecasting results. A case performed by the core enterprise in a supply chain reveals that the proposed method produces higher accurate forecasting and better tracking capability to the trend of the demands compared with several traditional statistical forecasting approaches. Moreover; the high robustness of the SF-DRIA method is guaranteed by the employment of the forecasting precision.","[Cao, Jian] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Cao, Jian] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA USA; [Chen, Yangyang; Zhou, Gengui] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Technology; University of Iowa; Zhejiang University of Technology,"Cao, J (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",jcao@zjut.edu.cn; nbchenyy@qq.com; ggzhou@zjut.edu.cn,"Zhou, Gengui/G-4985-2011","Cao, Jian/0000-0002-7313-5892","National Nature Science Foundation, China [71172182, 71371169]; State Scholarship Fund, China [201208330004]; Hangzhou Economics & Society Science Foundation, China [A12GL05]","National Nature Science Foundation, China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Scholarship Fund, China; Hangzhou Economics & Society Science Foundation, China","This research work was partially supported by the National Nature Science Foundation, China (71172182; 71371169), the State Scholarship Fund, China (No.201208330004) and the Hangzhou Economics & Society Science Foundation, China (A12GL05).",,30,1,2,1,28,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Thus, methodical insufficiency regarding tax system evaluation in terms of entrepreneurship promotion of companies, as well as an increasing number of various entrepreneurship promotion methods, ambition to attract more foreign innovations, economic integration and globalization determined the selection of a scientific research direction.

Methods such as induction, deduction, abstraction, research and comparative analysis, as well as expert research based on statistical data analysis have been used to reach this aim. By validating the theoretical assumptions during expert evaluation, it was found that the tax system in terms of entrepreneurship promotion of companies can be evaluated by using thirty-nine different variables. The latter are grouped according to the criteria that link them together: evaluation of environment for establishing a business, tax accounting, tax system structure and tax administration. During the research, experts formed a list of variables promoting the entrepreneurship of companies which was approved according to Cronbach alpha and Kendall coefficients.

It should be noted that, when evaluating the entrepreneurship of subjects, the entrepreneurship of various companies is usually emphasized and studied, while the entrepreneurship of self-employed individuals is ignored. Evaluation of the latter is particularly important as self-employed individuals will establish their own companies to expand their business. Thus, the significance of tax system evaluation in terms of entrepreneurship promotion of self-employed individuals is based on the fact that, after determining the tax system variables that promote entrepreneurship, preconditions are created to ensure a targeted tax policy formation and management of its implementation, by rationally using the existing potential in order to increase the country's economic competitiveness. Therefore, the aim of the research is to form a list of tax system elements that influence the entrepreneurship of self-employed individuals and provide guidelines for the formation of a tax system which would promote the entrepreneurship of these individuals. Methods such as induction, deduction, abstraction, research and comparative analysis, as well as expert research based on statistical data analysis have been used to reach this aim.

During the research, experts formed a list of variables promoting the entrepreneurship of self-employed individuals which was approved according to Cronbach alpha and Kendall coefficients. Results of the practical research which involved nineteen countries with different economic levels around the world have confirmed the list of tax system evaluation variables in terms of entrepreneurship promotion of self-employed individuals. Based on this list, guidelines are provided for the formation of a tax system which would promote the entrepreneurship of these individuals.

The discussion is illustrated by showing how Poland used revitalisation funding in the last budget programming period in the European Union (2014-20). The article is interdisciplinary in character, because not only does it present the legal and financial aspects of the problem under consideration, but also takes into account the special character of urban revitalization processes arising from their multidimensionality, long-term perspective and social aims. The legal side is explored using comparative and dogmatic methods and the financial aspects are analysed with an empirical method. The manifestation of the crucial importance that the European Union attaches to the comprehensive regeneration of degraded urban areas as a vehicle for developing the entire Community and for reaching the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy are EU's strategic documents approved by ministers from the Member States, especially the Leipzig Charter of 2007 and the Toledo Declaration of 2010. Another proof are the substantial financial allocations from European funds to urban regeneration activities that in the recent financial programmihg period were particularly large in the case of Poland. Multidimensional regeneration of urban areas is special in that it must have guaranteed fmancial sustainability in the long term, i.e., beyond the present horizon of financial support from the EU. All beneficiaries of EU's revitalisation funds (the Member States) must therefore be capable of prospective thinking, good planning, making careful choices of revitalisation projects, creating incentives for people to engage in revitalization processes, and choosing the right financial instruments. Putting together all these abilities is the only guarantee that revitalization will be successful and that it will help attain the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy.","[Czechowska, Dorota; Slebocka, Magdalena; Tylman, Aneta] Univ Lodz, Inst Finance, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Czechowska, D (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Inst Finance, PL-90131 Lodz, Poland.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,475,482,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200061,0

Such factors can be sorted to domestic and foreign sets. One-way and two-way relations between them and inflation can be considered. Therefore, vector auto-regressive model (VAR) seems to be a proper tool for modelling the reality. However, basic VAR model can suffer from insufficient forecasting performance caused by its linear nature. We employ two nonlinear vector autoregressive alternatives for predicting inflation: Time-Varying Parameter VAR model with stochastic volatility and VAR Neural Network model. In both cases we select the specification with the best combination of inflationary factors. Neural Networks are flexible tool which can be easily adjusted to an autoregressive form. Resulting VAR-NN models produce accurate inflation forecasting, but they take essential information mainly from the previous inflation observations and ignore the other series. Compared to that, TVP-VAR model is a statistical method applicable only for specific sort of problems. It is successful in incorporating information from all modelled series. TVP-VAR model leads to better forecasting performance than VAR-NN.","[Dobesova, Anna] 1 Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Zemedelska 1, Brno, Czech Republic; [Hampel, David] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Dobesová, A (通讯作者)，1 Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Zemedelska 1, Brno, Czech Republic.",anna.dobesova@mendelu.cz; david.hampel.uso@mendelu.cz,"Hampel, David/B-6765-2013",,,,,,16,1,1,1,8,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,133,138,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900023,0

The gender and race of the instructor is significant with female and non-white instructors being downgraded by students. The usual findings of expected grades inflating teaching evaluations are contested by the empirical evidence from this paper. Highly selective liberal arts colleges claim to provide a better education based on smaller class sizes and excellent teachers that are also active scholars. The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants of effective teaching in Economics and Business, according to student evaluations of teaching (SET) at one such college.

The flower market in the Netherlands for instance is using auctions for a long time. Mainly private Internet auction platforms like eBay Inc. became more famous in the 1990s. Airline companies were one of the first, which used dynamic auctions to sell their flight tickets. Over the years more sectors wanted to profit by using this instrument like the hotel and touristic industry. In this paper we mainly focus on dynamic auctions as used by Airlines. With the first-price auction and the second-price auction we review two different models of auctions. Both models can evolve optimal allocations of the goods depending on the situation, the framing and the purpose. In general the ambition of the described models is to maximize the profit of a seller of one or more similar goods by finding the optimal allocation to the buyers over multiple periods. By varying the form ( framing) of the auction the optimal results can be controlled. In dependence of the framework the seller or auctioneer can influence or at least approximate the behavior of the buyers. However, different cases require different kinds of optimal auctions. In the described model the first-price auction as well as the second-price auction result in optimal allocations, if all side conditions can be fulfilled. In general the implementation of the second-price auction is easier, because the strategies of the bidders can calculated simpler. For the first-price auction the credibility of the seller is necessary. Particularly, in relation to the practice the optimal auction seems to be a suitable alternative to traditional price-setting mechanisms.","[Hoffmeister, Christian Martin] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia; [Uzik, Martin] Berlin Sch Econ & Law Inst, D-10825 Berlin, Germany",Technical University Kosice; Berlin School of Economics & Law,"Hoffmeister, CM (通讯作者)，Memeler Str 5, D-50735 Cologne, Germany.",christian.hoffmeister@student.tuke.sk; martin.uzik@hwr-berlin.de,"Uzik, Martin/Q-2851-2016",,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2467-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,236,244,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH7LE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402646500028,0

J,"Inama, S",,,,"Inama, Stefano",,,Ex Ore Tuo Te Iudico:☆ The Value of the WTO Ministerial Decision on Preferential RoO for LDCs,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article discusses one of the outcome of the Bali package for the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), namely the Decision on preferential rules of origin (RoO) for LDCs, the prior proposals and discussions as well as its aftermath and prospects. Preferential RoO are a no man's land in the multilateral trading system that has so far failed to regulate this important customs law, differently from customs valuation and customs classification. This is one reason why the ink of the Decision on preferential RoO for LDCs (The Decision) was not even dry when practitioners and commentators started to wonder about the value of the Decision. Most observers looked at the 'big picture' and rapidly relegated the value of the Decision to the realm of the 'best endeavours scenario'. This is certainly true since the legal nature of the Decision and its wording do not provide clear guidelines or obligations. However, the real value of the Decision has to be contrasted with the existing background of multilateral disciplines and practices on preferential RoO. This paper argues that when measured against such background, the true value of the Decision may be reviewed under a new light, especially taking into account the possible work that could be carried out in the context of the Decision. In fact, the Decision contains a number of novelties and guidelines on drafting RoO. This holds especially true when the content of the Decision is contrasted with the annexes dealing with RoO contained in Kyoto Conventions of 1974 and 1999, and the 'Common Declaration with regard to preferential rules of origin' of the WTO Agreement on Rules of Origin (ARO). The Decision contains a number of interesting recommendations, albeit with a series of limitations, and sets preferential RoO for LDCs as an agenda item of the Committee on Rules of Origin (CRO). Much of the Decision's value will thus depend on the will and the ability of WTO members, especially of the preference giving countries and LDCs, to build up a meaningful way forward in the context of the CRO to make further progress on suitable RoO for LDC that could benefit the multilateral trading system as a whole in the field of preferential RoO.","[Inama, Stefano] UNCTAD, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Inama, S (通讯作者)，UNCTAD, Geneva, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,3,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Then options of retirement/disposal due to various reasons are explained and last but not least the impacts of these individual methods of retirement/disposal are analyzed in relation to economic (business) performance of an enterprise. The consequences/effects of this process are analyzed from the economic, accounting as well as tax perspective. In order to dispose an asset completely from the accounting records, it must meet the applicable criteria for disposal. At first it is necessary to analyze its technical condition and then suggest options for its further efficient use, if possible. Should it be impossible or appropriate to use the asset further, it may be disposed. The paper is also aimed at the process of liquidation/settlement of insured events that resulted in tangible asset disposal. Such events are often caused by employees or third parties.

Financial crises, by increasing the incidence of sunk costs of entry into exporting, reduce firm export dynamics. Financially-vulnerable exporters are not able to fully realize economies of scale in production and access better-sophisticated technologies. The number of products and destinations per exporter are therefore likely to decrease in times of crisis. We use a comprehensive cross-country dataset on export dynamics, with data covering 1997-2011 for 34 developing countries to investigate this issue. Building on the generalized difference-in-differences procedure proposed by Rajan & Zingales (1998) to remove any endogeneity bias, the results point to a negative and economically large effect of financial vulnerability on export diversification. Financial crises reduce export dynamics disproportionately more in financially dependent industries. This effect is less pronounced in countries with initially more open capital account, suggesting that portfolio inflows are good substitutes for underdeveloped domestic financial markets.","[Jaud, Melise] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Kiendrebeogo, Youssouf] Univ Auvergne, CERDI, World Bank, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Veganzones-Varoudakis, Marie-Ange] Univ Auvergne, CERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France",The World Bank; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Jaud, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",mjaud@worldbank.org; ykiendrebeogo@worldbank.org; veganzones@aol.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,264,278,,,,,,15,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000025,0

In this paper we develop an instrument aimed at measuring customers' perceptions of CSR, and test it comparatively in four important industries (mobile telecom services, banking services, dairy products, and personal care products).

This paucity of evidence is surprising given that reduction in household economic burden is an explicit aim for such policies. Our study assessed the equity impact on household OOP spending for facility-based delivery of the user fee reduction policy implemented in Burkina Faso since 2007 (i.e. subsidised price set at 900 Communaut, FinanciSre Africaine francs (CFA) for all, but free for the poorest). Taking into account the challenges linked to implementing exemption policies, we aimed to test the hypothesis that the user fee reduction policy had favoured the least poor more than the poor. We used data from six consecutive rounds (2006-2011) of a household survey conducted in the Nouna Health District. Primary outcomes are the proportion of households being fully exempted (the poorest 20 % according to the policy) and the actual level of household OOP spending on facility-based delivery. The estimation of the effects relied on a Heckman selection model. This allowed us to estimate changes in OOP spending across socio-economic strata given changes in service utilisation produced by the policy. A total of 2,316 women reported a delivery between 2006 and 2011. Average household OOP spending decreased from 3,827 CFA in 2006 to 1,523 in 2011, without significant differences across socio-economic strata, neither in terms of households being fully exempted from payment nor in terms of the amount paid. Payment remained regressive and substantially higher than the stipulated 900 CFA. The BurkinabS policy led to a significant and sustained reduction in household OOP health spending across all socio-economic groups, but failed to properly target the poorest by ensuring a progressive payment system.","[Ridde, V.] Univ Montreal, Montreal Sch Publ Hlth, CRCHUM, Dept Med Sociale & Prevent, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Agier, I.] Univ Montreal, CRCHUM, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Jahn, A.; Mueller, O.; De Allegri, M.] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Publ Hlth, Heidelberg, Germany; [Tiendrebeogo, J.; Ye, M.] Ctr Rech Sante Nouna, Nouna, Burkina Faso",Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Ridde, V (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Montreal Sch Publ Hlth, CRCHUM, Dept Med Sociale & Prevent, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",valery.ridde@umontreal.ca; manuela.de.allegri@urz.uni-heidelberg.de,"Ridde, Valery/AAD-2736-2019; ridde, valery/AAV-1016-2020; Ye, Maurice/AAG-8660-2021","Ridde, Valery/0000-0001-9299-8266; ridde, valery/0000-0001-9299-8266; De Allegri, Manuela/0000-0002-8677-1337",,,,,49,27,29,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Based on an analysis of business-to-business advertisements in two US food industry trade publications, we show the generative influence of social movements on perceived market opportunities. Building on recent scholarship on market-making, we find that market actors articulate and reshape critiques of their own industry by making claims about what consumers ostensibly want and about how their products can satisfy those desires. We find that business-to-business food ingredient advertisements selectively articulate precepts of the emergent 'good food' movement by urging manufacturers to develop healthy, natural, and 'clean' foods. While 'good food' advocates typically portray processed and packaged food as inherently unhealthy, suppliers and trade associations' advertisements transform this critique by claiming that products will be more marketable to consumers if they are made with ingredients designed to provide specific health benefits and to comply with federally mandated product labeling regulations. As such, we find that these business-to-business advertisements mediate between imagined demands and pragmatic constraints while serving as a conduit for the influence of social movements on industry practices and products.","[Schleifer, David] Publ Agenda, 6 E 39th St,9th Floor, New York, NY 10016 USA; [DeSoucey, Michaela] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Schleifer, D (通讯作者)，Publ Agenda, 6 E 39th St,9th Floor, New York, NY 10016 USA.",david.schleifer@gmail.com; mdesoucey@ncsu.edu,"Schleifer, David/D-8969-2011","DeSoucey, Michaela/0000-0003-1183-402X",,,,,72,6,7,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

NTFP use frequently raises concerns about the sustainability of, or ecological impacts associated with, NTFP harvesting, as well as local contextual factors which may limit or reduce the impacts. Here we test the conceptual model first advanced by Uma Shaanker et al. (2004) relating to the factors that may limit or exacerbate the ecological impacts associated with NTFP harvesting. These were the extent of local dependence on NTFPs, the degree of marketing and the level of local ecological knowledge, Data were collected via household questionnaires and ecological surveys of woody plants from eight villages throughout South Africa. We found no significant relationships between measures of ecological impact with local ecological 'knowledge or market proximity and engagement. There was a strong positive relationship between ecological impacts and NTFP dependency as indexed through mean annual direct-use value for NTFPs. This indicates that the higher the dependency and demand for NTFPs, the greater is the possibility of high impacts to the local environment. However, other contextual drivers not included in the original Uma Shaanker et al. (2004) model may also play a role, particularly the strength of local resource governance institutions.

The study attempted to assess the progress and challenges the country faces in the course of delivering on the promises it has made to its citizens, to better their living standards in measurable terms within the time frame for attainment of the MDGs. The available secondary data obtained from reliable sources for the period 1990-2013, indicate that Nigeria has made remarkable progress in many targets. However, the country is not likely to achieve all the goals as many of the targets are still lagging behind the 2015 deadline. To be specific, the Nigeria is not likely to attain the target of reducing poverty as over 60% of the population still live in abject poverty, but there is improvement in hunger reduction target. Even though, Nigeria has made some tremendous progress in reducing child and maternal mortality rate, the country still reported among the worst countries in these targets in the world. The fragile security, safety of lives and properties (terrorist attacks, frequently armed robbery cases, kidnapping, military and paramilitary extrajudicial killings of civilians, and other social vices) in recent time have brought setbacks in the country. More so, high-fertility rate, high rate of unemployment, large-scale institutional corruption and bad governance, as well as misplaced priorities, are among the major bottlenecks that are militating the country from achieving MDGs by 2015. For Nigeria to achieve its prospects of attaining the targets in order to fulfil the promises to improve the well-being of its citizens by 2015, rigorous efforts should be made to tackle the obstacles that are impeding inclusive growth and sustainable development goals. The Nigerian government and partners should create and implement policies that would lead to poverty reduction, creation of better jobs and wealth. The Nigerian government should provide affordable health care and other social infrastructure and services within urban and rural areas.","[Verter, Nahanga] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Languages & Cultural Studies, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Horak, Miroslav] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Languages & Cultural Studies, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Antwi Darkwah, Samuel] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Terr Studies, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Verter, N (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Languages & Cultural Studies, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xverter@mendelu.cz; miroslav.horak.ujks@mendelu.cz; darkwah@mendelu.cz,"Horák, Miroslav/D-8000-2018; Verter, Nahanga/E-4845-2018","Horák, Miroslav/0000-0001-8327-8785; Verter, Nahanga/0000-0002-5889-134X",,,,,31,0,0,0,10,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,1151,1162,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800112,0
J,"Widman, U",,,,"Widman, Ulrika",,,Shared responsibility for forest protection?,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Public-private partnership; Forest protection; Nature conservation agreements; Trust; Forest policy; Discretionary power,BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION,"Worldwide, there is growing reliance in forest politics on public-private partnerships (PPPs) as a means for forest-environmental protection. In Sweden, such partnership characterizes the approach in nature conservation agreements (NCAs) in the forest policy from 1993 and onwards. NCAs are negotiated between the County Administrative Board/the Forest Agency and a landowner, where the landowner agrees to, with some compensation, provide a public service in terms of protecting biodiversity. However, assessments of the implementation of NCAs show rather inefficient implementation of set goals in general, even if there are great regional variations. This paper explores factors affecting the establishment of PPPs in two neighboring counties distinguished by high and low level of goal achievement of NCAs respectively. The analysis focuses on the process among the landowners and responsible authorities, their incentives for collaboration, and the potential for developing shared motives.

The log-linear ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is a simple but limited statistical technique due to its log-normal distributional assumption. Duration models allow more flexible distributional assumptions, but they create unnecessary statistical complexity. Considering these limitations, a third and most efficient alternative that joins statistical simplicity and distributional flexibility is examined in this article. Generalized linear models (GLMs) are used to explain tourists' length of stay at each of 100 Brazilian destinations. The log-gamma distribution is shown generally to fit data better than the log-normal alternative, indicating that GLMs outperform the log-linear OLS without requiring the complexity of duration models.","[de Oliveira Santos, Glauber Eduardo] Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Santos, GED (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo EACH USP, Sch Arts Sci & Humanities, Ave Arlindo Bettio 1000,Ed 2,S 302A, BR-03828000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",glauber.santos@usp.br,"de Oliveira Santos, Glauber Eduardo/G-9727-2013","de Oliveira Santos, Glauber Eduardo/0000-0001-8731-101X",,,,,44,1,1,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

For these wineries, gaining access to the markets is of paramount importance. Our work explores the distributor's main business motivations, and the possibilities to pursue them in their business relationships with the wineries. To tackle this issue, we carried out a vertical differentiation of the service wine supply resorting to the Means-End Chain approach. Results show that a trustful relationship with the winery is the main central issue for wine distributors, while wine quality is the winery's key attribute. Furthermore, the winery's own will to access the market and to develop marketing strategies is also of great importance for the wine distributor.","[Escobar, Cristina; Maria Gil, Jose] CREDA UPC IRTA, Ctr Agrofood Econ & Dev, Barcelona, Spain",IRTA,"Escobar, C (通讯作者)，CREDA UPC IRTA, Ctr Agrofood Econ & Dev, Barcelona, Spain.",cristina.escobar@upc.edu,"Escobar, Cristina/K-8896-2017; GIL, Jose M./B-2699-2012","Escobar, Cristina/0000-0002-1418-2955; GIL, Jose M./0000-0003-3313-9052","Catalan Vine, Wine and Cava Observatory","Catalan Vine, Wine and Cava Observatory","The authors want to express their gratitude to the Catalan Vine, Wine and Cava Observatory, for their financial support and their orientation in their research.",,50,3,5,2,14,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2016,15,4.0,,,,,33,41,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EW1DD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402229200004,0

The focus is on current (rather than future) business conditions. Two macro factors are considered: (1) a dynamic factor estimated by maximum likelihood from a set of 4 monthly series; (2) the first of eight static factors estimated by principal components using a panel of 102 monthly series. Recession probabilities generated using standard probit, autoregressive probit, and Markov-switching models exhibit very different properties. Overall, a simple Markov-switching model based on the big data macro factor generates the sequence of out-of-sample class predictions that better approximates NBER -recession months.

Evidence on the Intensity of Different Spillover Channels,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; DOMESTIC FIRMS; MULTINATIONAL FIRMS; PRODUCTIVITY,"The aim of this paper is to empirically disentangle specific channels of technology spillovers from FDI to domestic firms. To this end, we look into the mechanisms of technology diffusion through FDI and investigate six measures of spillovers in a sample of Romanian firms for the period 1999-2007. Our results show that the position in the supply chain is essential for capturing FDI spillovers, as local suppliers enjoy productivity gains, while local clients suffer productivity losses. We also show that foreign affiliates internalise all benefits associated with supplier upgrading, thus raising concerns about the social return on technology transfer. Additionally, our approach allows us to separate horizontal spillovers into a competition effect, an imitation/demonstration effect and a labour mobility component. We find only labour mobility to act as an efficient channel for horizontal knowledge diffusion, even though its direction depends highly on human capital.","[Jude, Cristina] Banque France, Paris, France; [Jude, Cristina] Univ Orleans, Lab Econ Orleans, Orleans, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France; Universite de Orleans,"Jude, C (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.;Jude, C (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, Lab Econ Orleans, Orleans, France.",,,,,,,,39,41,43,3,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2016,39,12.0,,,,,1947,1973,,10.1111/twec.12335,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,EG0BY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390697000004,0

This research takes advantage of detailed information on worker performance and confidential information on firm revenue and operating costs to investigate the relationship between talent migration and firm profitability in major league sports, one of the few industries in which detailed information about the past performance of each individual worker (athlete) is known to all potential employers. I use confidential microdata from the 2007 Economic Censuses, and from the 2007 and 2008 Service Annual Surveys to investigate the link between individual worker performance and team profitability, controlling for many other aspects of the sports business, specifically taking account of the mobility of athletic stars and superstars from one team to another. The investigations in this article provide limited support for the hypothesis that hiring talented individuals (stars) will increase a firm's profit. However, there is no convincing support for the incremental benefit of hiring superstars. The peculiar characteristics of major league sports suggest that these results are probably not generalizable.","[Weinberg, Daniel H.] Virginia Tech, Virginia Bioinformat Inst, Social & Decis Analyt Lab, Arlington, VA USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Weinberg, DH (通讯作者)，2501 Lisbon Lane, Alexandria, VA 22306 USA.",dhweinberg@gmail.com,,,,,,,46,2,2,1,45,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

This paper analyzes PSOs in these 12 countries for the year 2010 using the recently proposed Global Connectivity Index to measure direct and indirect market access and a novel subsidy database covering 90% of PSO movements in these countries to assess value-for-money. We show that PSO services represent about 2.5% of all commercial movements in the 12 countries analyzed, generating about 1% of these countries' total air transport connectivity. Over all routes for which data was available, approximately USD $900 million was earmarked for PSO and air service discount provision in 2010, with average subsidies per movement ranging from about $700 to $3500. PSO market access and efficiency outcomes vary across the countries analyzed. Some countries, such as Germany and the United States, focus on providing network access for smaller communities, thereby creating not only point-to-point, but also onward connectivity, while others such as Norway, Sweden, and Ireland, predominantly aim at providing lifeline services that connect remote regions to a nearby economic center without providing onward connections.

The article argues that the ESF (European Social Fund) is a crucial example in this regard since it combines financial incentives, procedural requirements and programmatic conditions. In order to analyse local responses to this complex governance tool, the article deploys analytical tools from the Europeanization literature and builds on in-depth case knowledge from 18 cities in six European countries. A QCA (Qualitative Comparative Analysis) combined with case discussions reveals three different types of responses to the ESF. In 'transformer-cases', both usage of the ESF and change brought by it can be observed. In 'cream-skimmer-cases', only usage but no change was measured, and in 'refusenik-cases', neither usage nor change was detected. While usage of the ESF can be explained by individual motivation of local actors or the incentivizing dimension of the funds, change is apparently more complex.","[Zimmermann, Katharina] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Zimmermann, K (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Dept Social Sci, Berlin, Germany.",k.zimmermann@uni-oldenburg.de,"Zimmermann, Katharina/I-8266-2019","Zimmermann, Katharina/0000-0002-1074-3356",European Union Seventh Framework Programme [266768],European Union Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7-2013) under grant agreement no 266768 (LOCALISE).

The alternatives to the benchmark produce superior density forecasts. This comparative density performance appears to be driven more by stochastic volatility than by oil prices, and it primarily occurs outside of the great recession. We use our density forecasts to compute a recession risk indicator around the great recession. The alternative model with the real price of oil generates the earliest strong signal of a recession; but it surprisingly indicates reduced recession immediately after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. Use of the net oil-price increase nonlinear transformation of oil prices does lead to warnings of highly elevated risk during the Great Recession.","[Rothman, Philip] Carolina Univ, Dept Econ East, Brewster A-424, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Ravazzolo, Francesco] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Econ & Management, I-39100 Bozen Bolzano, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"Rothman, P (通讯作者)，Carolina Univ, Dept Econ East, Brewster A-424, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",rothmanp@ecu.edu,"Ravazzolo, Francesco/G-1118-2016","Ravazzolo, Francesco/0000-0003-0645-1788",,,,,40,9,10,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

This paper aims to investigate how exports of final goods are affected by better access to foreign intermediate inputs. In particular, the paper empirically tests whether expanding the set of available intermediate input suppliers through preferential rules of origin liberalisation affects exports of final goods. We exploit the introduction of the southern Mediterranean countries into the Pan-Euro-Med zone of diagonal cumulation which meant that foreign intermediate inputs could be used from more countries than before without jeopardising the preferential access to the EU. Using a fixed effects specification that controls for detailed levels of unobserved heterogeneity and multilateral resistance, we examine the effect of the new diagonal cumulation possibilities on southern Mediterranean exports to EU-15. We find a positive effect on both export intensity, the value of exports, and export diversification, the number of exported products. Being part of the Pan-Euro-Med zone of diagonal cumulation is associated with a 20per cent increase in export intensity and a 5per cent increase in export diversification.","[Andersson, Anna] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Andersson, A (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Lund, Sweden.",,,,,,,,32,12,13,1,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2016,39,8.0,,,,,1048,1079,,10.1111/twec.12308,0.0,,,32,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DS7BY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380938700001,0

Although such preleasing is an extensive and significant activity, it has not received adequate attention in the real estate economics and finance literature. Using an equilibrium micro-economic agency model, this paper examines the economics of commercial real estate preleasing. The equilibrium prelease contract rent is a function of several variables, including the expected spot market rent, financing benefits from preleasing, developer-lessor and tenant-lessee risk-hedging behavior, the interplay between lessor and lessee default options, and the market capitalization rate. Our paper demonstrates how the distribution of risk preferences for lessees (and lessors) generates separating market equilibrium for the prelease and spot lease. We also consider the impacts of developer default and the lessee cancellation clause on the prelease rent equilibrium.","[Edelstein, Robert H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Fisher Ctr Real Estate & Urban Econ, 602 Fac Bldg,6105, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Liu, Peng] Cornell Univ, Sch Hotel Adm, Ctr Real Estate & Finance, 465B Statler Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Cornell University,"Liu, P (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Hotel Adm, Ctr Real Estate & Finance, 465B Statler Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",edelstei@haas.berkeley.edu; peng.liu@cornell.edu,,,,,,,18,3,3,2,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Using data for all U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas between 2005 and 2012, the authors find that the presence of more highly educated people will result in a higher median wage in the community overall, as do many studies, but that this factor does not significantly increase the wage for any individual education cohort.

Conventionally this is done by applying certain linear-quadratic optimization algorithms to dynamic econometric models. Several algorithms extend this baseline framework to nonlinear stochastic problems. However, those algorithms are limited in a variety of ways including, most importantly, their restriction to local best solutions only and the symmetry of objective function. The contribution of the current study is that we adopt differential evolution (DE) in the context of nonlinear stochastic optimal control problems, thus ensuring better convergence to a global optimum and explicitly considering parameter uncertainty by evaluating the expected objective function. The latter is done by minimizing the median over a set of multiple Monte Carlo draws of uncertain parameters and by separately evaluating the random parameter draws looking particularly at extreme cases. Comparing DE with more traditional methods, which make use of linear-quadratic optimization, in two economic models, we find that the solutions obtained for expected and ex-post functions differ consistently raising doubts about the optimality of ex-post solutions. We claim that this research is aimed to broaden the range of decision support information used by policy makers when choosing an optimal strategy under much more realistic conditions.","[Savin, Ivan] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Chair Econ Policy, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Savin, Ivan] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, Bur Econ Theor & Appl, UMR 7522, Strasbourg, France; [Savin, Ivan] Univ Jena, Chair Microecon, Jena, Germany; [Savin, Ivan] Ural Fed Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Management, Russian Federat, Chair Econometr & Stat, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Blueschke, Dmitri] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Dept Econ, Klagenfurt, Austria",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universite de Lorraine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Ural Federal University; University of Klagenfurt,"Savin, I (通讯作者)，Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Chair Econ Policy, Karlsruhe, Germany.;Savin, I (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, Bur Econ Theor & Appl, UMR 7522, Strasbourg, France.;Savin, I (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Chair Microecon, Jena, Germany.;Savin, I (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Management, Russian Federat, Chair Econometr & Stat, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",ivan.savin@kit.edu,"Savin, Ivan/P-9035-2016","Savin, Ivan/0000-0002-9469-0510; Blueschke, Dmitri/0000-0002-5493-1893","German Science Foundation [DFG RTG 1411]; Helmholtz Association [HIRG-0069]; Projex CSES, Initiative d'Excellence, Universite de Strasbourg","German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association); Projex CSES, Initiative d'Excellence, Universite de Strasbourg","Ivan Savin acknowledges financial support from the German Science Foundation (DFG RTG 1411), the Helmholtz Association (HIRG-0069) and Projex CSES, Initiative d'Excellence, Universite de Strasbourg.

Among decision theorists, however, this term usually refers to imprecision in an individual's probabilistic judgments, in the sense that the available evidence is consistent with more than one probability distribution over possible states of the world. Avoiding a prior commitment to either of these interpretations, Fishburn has explored ambiguity as a primitive concept, in terms of what he calls an ambiguity measure a on the power set of a finite set , characterized by five axioms. We prove, in purely set-theoretic terms, that if is a so-called necessity measure on and is its associated possibility measure, then is an ambiguity measure. When is construed as a set of possible exemplars of a vague predicate , then and may be regarded as arising from a fuzzy membership function f on , where designates the degree to which is applicable to . In this case a(A) represents the degree to which the partition differentiates members of with respect to the predicate . When is construed as a set of possible states of the world, a necessity measure may be regarded as a very special type of lower probability known as a consonant belief function, and a possibility measure as its associated upper probability, whence a(A) represents the degree of imprecision in the pair with respect to the event A. Fishburn's axioms are thus consistent with an interpretation of ambiguity as linguistic vagueness, as well as (a very special sort of) probabilistic imprecision.","[Shattuck, Mark; Wagner, Carl] Univ Tennessee, Dept Math, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Wagner, C (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Dept Math, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",shattuck@math.utk.edu; cwagner@tennessee.edu,"Wagner, Carl/AFQ-5172-2022",,,,,,14,2,2,1,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2016,81,2.0,,,,,153,165,,10.1007/s11238-016-9534-3,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DV6PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383059600001,0

However, it requires the support of sophisticated public institutions. This paper explains how Classical Rome provided such support in the main areas of economic activity by relying on public possession as a titling device, enacting rules to protect innocent acquirers in agency contexts, enabling the extended family to act as a contractual entity, and diluting the enforcement of personal, obligations which might collide with impersonal exchange. Focusing on the institutions of impersonal exchange, it reaches a clear positive conclusion on the market-facilitating role of the Roman state because such institutions have unambiguously positive effects on markets. Moreover, being impersonal, these beneficial effects are also widely distributed across society instead of accruing disproportionately to better-connected individuals, (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc, All rights reserved.","[Arrunada, Benito] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Barcelona, Spain; [Arrunada, Benito] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics,"Arruñada, B (通讯作者)，Pompeu Fabra Univ, Barcelona, Spain.;Arruñada, B (通讯作者)，Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain.",benito.arrunada@upf.edu,"Arruñada, Benito/M-3408-2019","Arruñada, Benito/0000-0003-1391-9895",Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-57131-R],Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"This work has benefitted from advice and comments received from the editor, Ran Abramitzky, two anonymous reviewers, Maria Brosius, Yun-chien Chang, Giusseppe Dari-Matiacci, Damian Fernandez, Stephen Hansen, Francois Lerouxel, Joe Manning, Fernando P.

In this paper we investigate a potential competitiveness-driven operational carbon leakage due to the European Union Emissions Trading scheme (EU ETS). We focus on two energy-intensive sectors, cement and steel, and phases I and II of the EU ETS. From a simple analytical model, we derive an equation linking net imports of cement and steel to local and foreign demand along with carbon price. We then econometrically estimate this relation both with ARIMA regression and Prais-Winsten estimation, finding that local and foreign demand are robust drivers of trade flows. We find no significant effect of the carbon price on net imports of steel and cement. We conclude that there is no evidence of carbon leakage in these sectors, at least in the short run.","[Branger, Frederic; Quirion, Philippe] CIRED, Lyon, France; [Branger, Frederic] AgroParistech ENGREF, Paris, France; [Quirion, Philippe] CNRS, F-75700 Paris, France; [Chevallier, Julien] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, Paris, France; [Chevallier, Julien] Univ Paris 8 LED, Paris, France",Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); IPAG Business School,"Branger, F (通讯作者)，CIRED, Lyon, France.;Branger, F (通讯作者)，AgroParistech ENGREF, Paris, France.",branger@centre-cired.fr,"Chevallier, Julien/AAY-9567-2020; Quirion, Philippe/E-9686-2011","Chevallier, Julien/0000-0002-4423-9502; Chevallier, Julien/0000-0001-9109-0205",,,,,81,40,42,4,58,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2016,37,3.0,,,,,109,135,,10.5547/01956574.37.3.fbra,0.0,,,27,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DP8OL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378757400005,0

Elites and contesting political groups utilise postcolonial rhetoric to legitimate their political goals by projecting that their country, in this case Kazakhstan, was colonised by the Tsarist Russia and then by the Soviet Union. For President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev's nationalising regime the status of Kazakhstan as a colony represented a vital item in post-1991 nation-building projects. Political opposition and Kazakh national-patriots contested this official discourse, blaming the regime for scarce efforts towards full decolonisation'. The absence of major intellectual discussion allowed these elites and political players to reappropriate these discourses in the political rather than critical intellectual domain.","[Kudaibergenova, Diana T.] Univ Cambridge, Alison Richard Bldg,7 West Rd, Cambridge CB3 9DT, England",University of Cambridge,"Kudaibergenova, DT (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Alison Richard Bldg,7 West Rd, Cambridge CB3 9DT, England.",dk406@cam.ac.uk,,"Kudaibergenova, Diana T./0000-0003-4481-2089",,,,,71,38,40,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,JUL,2016,68,5.0,,,,,917,935,,10.1080/09668136.2016.1194967,0.0,,,19,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,DT5JV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000381520400006,0

This article argues that, drawing from a strong self-perception toward a neo-functionalist interpretation of its own history, the EU uses 'neo-functional peace' as an approach for resolving protracted disputes, through deconstructing highly political issues into technical meanings in order to achieve mutually acceptable agreements. This article explores the EU's efforts to normalize relations between Kosovo and Serbia, and examines the reliance on aspects of neo-functionalism for building peace after protracted disputes. We argue that neo-functional peace has played a crucial role in normalizing political relations and reconciling some of the outstanding disputes between Kosovo and Serbia. Building on this case study, we suggest a theoretical concept of neo-functional peace as a useful means to conceptualize the EU's peace support practices.","[Visoka, Gezim; Doyle, John] Dublin City Univ, Glasnevin D09 Y074, Dublin, Ireland",Dublin City University,"Visoka, G (通讯作者)，Dublin City Univ, Glasnevin D09 Y074, Dublin, Ireland.",gezim.visoka@dcu.ie,,"Visoka, Gezim/0000-0001-8725-3067; Doyle, John/0000-0002-0763-4853",European Community [PIRSES-GA-2011-295232],European Community,We are grateful to the JCMS editors and the three anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments.

The proliferation of international organizations in the Global South raises the question of whether and how they practice local norm appropriation. This article uses ethnographic methods to investigate the appropriation of development norms in an intergovernmental development organization located in Bangladesh. Established theories like localization and sociological institutionalism would expect local actors to allude to a global norm but not to adhere to it. On the contrary, this study finds that, while development organizations may allude to local development norms and dismiss UN-led initiatives as Western, their practices remain in line with global concepts such as the Millennium Development Goals and the Human Development Index. These actors perform to localize, but the rhetoric is not matched by their everyday practices. The local therefore functions as a myth.","[Anderl, Felix] Goethe Univ Frankfurt Main, Cluster Excellence Format Normat Orders, Max Horkheimer Str 2, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Anderl, F (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt Main, Cluster Excellence Format Normat Orders, Max Horkheimer Str 2, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany.",Anderl@soz.uni-frankfurt.de,,"Anderl, Felix/0000-0002-3536-8898",Hans-Bockler-Foundation,Hans-Bockler-Foundation,"This research was enabled by a travel grant from the Hans-Bockler-Foundation.

This is the case of the municipality of El Ghrous in the region of Biskra, where for twenty years, palm tree monoculture and tunnel greenhouses have dramatically expanded on the margins of traditional oasis. In this article, we analyze the factors that promote and those which threaten this agricultural expansion. Four key factors of this development are analysed: public policies, local market development, dissemination of innovation and the water governance system. We show that the adaptability of this agriculture is mainly the result of a complex set of actors, at bilateral and collective level, who manage to reconfigure and adapt the institutional framework of water governance. Finally, we show that in the long term, this set of actors is also a source of vulnerabilities and inequities.","[Daoudi, Ali] Alger ENSA, Ecole Natl Super Agron, El Harrach, Algeria; [Daoudi, Ali] Biskra CRSTRA, Ctr Rech Sci & Tech Reg Arides, Biskra, Algeria; [Lejars, Caroline] CIRAD, UMR Geau Gest Eau Acteurs Usages, Montpellier, France; [Lejars, Caroline] IAV Hassan II, Rabat, Morocco",Ecole Nationale Polytechnique - Algeria; Centre for Scientific & Technical Research on Arid Regions (CRSTRA); CIRAD,"Daoudi, A (通讯作者)，Alger ENSA, Ecole Natl Super Agron, El Harrach, Algeria.",a.daoudi@ensa.dz,"DAOUDI, Ali/AAF-2148-2019",", ENSA (Agro.)- NHSA (agronomy) - Algiers/0000-0002-9443-6811",,,,,34,14,14,1,12,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2016,15,2.0,,,,,45,52,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,DS1TQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380384000006,0

However, beyond recent evidence that realtime transit arrival information reduces perceived waiting time, there is limited empirical evidence as to which other specific station and stop amenities can effectively influence user perceptions of waiting time. To address this knowledge gap, the authors conducted a passenger survey and video-recorded waiting passengers at different types of transit stops and stations to investigate differences between survey-reported waiting time and video-recorded actual waiting time. Results from the survey and video observations show that the reported wait time on average is about 1.21 times longer than the observed wait time. Regression analysis was employed to explain the variation in riders' reported waiting time as a function of their objectively observed waiting time, as well as station and stop amenities, weather, time of the day, personal demographics, and trip characteristics. Based on the regression results, most waits at stops with no amenities are perceived at least 1.3 times as long as they actually are. Basic amenities including benches and shelters significantly reduce perceived waiting times. Women waiting for more than 10 min in perceived insecure surroundings report waits as dramatically longer than they really are, and longer than do men in the same situation. The authors recommend a focus on providing basic amenities at stations and stops as broadly as possible in transit systems, and a particular focus on stops on low-frequency routes and in less safe areas for security measures.

Cap rate spread is the difference between the cap rate and the fixed coupon rate. The spread predicts performance risk in a sample of 24,951 commercial mortgage-backed securities loans during 1993-2011. We demonstrate that the cap rate spread includes crucial information about performance risk. The results arise from the role of the cap rate spread in generating positive or negative leveraged returns to equity in situations where additional equity is required. Incorporating simplistic cap rate spread requirements in commercial underwriting is expected to reduce loan performance risk.","[Seagraves, Philip A.] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Jones Coll Business, Box 27, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA; [Wiley, Jonathan A.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Real Estate, J Mack Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",Middle Tennessee State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Seagraves, PA (通讯作者)，Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Jones Coll Business, Box 27, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA.;Wiley, JA (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Dept Real Estate, J Mack Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",philip.seagraves@mtsu.edu; jwiley@gsu.edu,,,,,,,26,6,6,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SUM,2016,44,2.0,,,,,490,520,,10.1111/1540-6229.12100,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,DJ3ZF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374144500006,0

We study prospect-theory predictions of three other plausible reference points: par for recent holes, for the round, and for the tournament. A potentially competing force is momentum in quality of play, that is, the hot or cold hand. While prospect theory predicts negative serial correlation in better (worse)-than-average performance across holes, the hot (cold) hand implies the opposite. We find evidence that, for each of the reference points we study, when scores are better than par, hot-hand effects are dominated by prospect-theory effects. These effects can occur via two mechanisms: greater conservatism or less effort. We find evidence that the former (latter) dominates for scores closer to (further from) the reference point. We also find evidence of prospect theory effects (greater risk seeking) when scores are worse than par for the round in Round 1 and of cold-hand effects for scores worse than par for the tournament in Round 3. The magnitudes of some of the joint effects are comparable to those found by Pope and Schweitzer and other related papers. We conclude by discussing how, rather than compete, prospect-theory and cold-hand forces might also cause one another.","[Stone, Daniel F.] Bowdoin Coll, Econ, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Arkes, Jeremy] Naval Postgrad Sch, Grad Sch Business & Publ Policy, Econ, Monterey, CA USA",Bowdoin College; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School,"Stone, DF (通讯作者)，Bowdoin Coll, 9700 Coll Stn, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA.",dstone@bowdoin.edu,,,,,,,29,6,6,1,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

In doing so, we address an ongoing theoretical tension in the related party transaction (RPT) literature by focusing on real estate investment trusts (REITs) in Asia. The empirical evidence is mixed in the corporate finance literature on whether RPTs create or destroy firm value. On average, REITs in our sample engaged in RPTs amounting to 5.4 % of total assets, annually, between 2003 and 2010. This is not a trivial amount and is nearly double the 2.8 % RPT rate for U.S. industrial firms. We identify three main channels for REIT RPTs: real estate asset acquisitions from related parties (57.4 %), income earned from related parties (22.2 %) and management fees paid to related parties (14.8 %). The identification strategy we employ relies on two distinct methodologies when examining RPTs and firm value: a multivariate regression approach and, secondly, an exogenous wealth effects test for RPT announcements. Overall, the results suggest that REIT managers and sponsors do not expropriate wealth from their minority shareholders through RPTs. We find evidence that an ad hoc acquisitions pipeline from sponsor to REIT generally drives the value and wealth proposition, although the impact could be reversed in a credit crisis.","[Downs, David H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Kornblau Inst, Snead Hall,301 West Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Ooi, Joseph T.

But is this really so? This article argues that, while there is an increasing focus on comparative regionalism in scholarly debates, we have not yet developed frameworks for empirical comparative research in this field. This often leads analysts to draw general conclusions from cases of institutional isomorphism, thus neglecting other critical dimensions. By applying an integrated framework, which takes into account the multi-dimensional aspects of old and new regionalisms, this article shows that the most critical features of the European regionalization process, from the gradual stepwise approach towards shared sovereignty to the focus on trade integration and social cohesion, are largely absent from Africa's regionalism, which presents unique characters that are often overshadowed by traditional analyses.","[Fioramonti, Lorenzo; Mattheis, Frank] Univ Pretoria, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Fioramonti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Polit Sci, Ctr Study Governance Innovat, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",Lorenzo.fioramonti@gmail.com,"Mattheis, Frank/AAA-5172-2020","Mattheis, Frank/0000-0002-8533-5154",,,,,67,34,36,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Instead, I suggest that the effect of serfdom depended on market conditions.

The geopolitical standoff around Ukraine necessitated a joint response to a show of force. In both cases we saw a return of politics'. Geopolitical interests trumped economic ones; a need for government (and not just governance) made itself felt; European politics became more salient and intertwined with domestic politics. In the turmoil, notwithstanding calls for a big leap toward greater unity, the European Union also showed its dynamic in-between nature. The public perceives this politicisation perfectly, hence both its disenchantment and the calls for more democracy.

House Prices, Shadow Inventory, and the Nascent Housing Recovery",JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,House prices; Spatial econometrics; Foreclosures,SIMULTANEOUS SYSTEMS; IDENTIFICATION; GROWTH; MODELS,"Although a broad-based increase in house prices has been observed over the past year, not everyone is convinced the rise of house prices will persist and lead to a steady recovery of the economy. The main reason for this skepticism is uncertainty about the shadow inventory: foreclosed homes held by investors or as REOs, which have not yet hit the market but likely will as market prices rise. The volume of shadow inventory itself in local markets is largely unknown, as is its impact on the housing market. This study quantifies the size of the shadow inventory and investigates the spatial impact of the out-flow of shadow inventory. The scope of our study is a set of housing markets (AZ, CA, and FL) that vary in both their historic housing price volatility as well as institutional factors - such as foreclosure law statutes - that may influence the relationship between the shadow inventory and house price dynamics. To address the endogeneity that characterizes the spatial interaction of house prices and the out-flow of the shadow inventory, we utilize a simultaneous equation system of spatial autoregressions (SESSAR). The model is estimated using measures of the shadow inventory derived from DataQuick's national transaction history database and county-level house price indices provided by Black Knight. Lastly, because our estimate - as well as all other existing estimates - of the shadow inventory relies upon string matching algorithms to identify entry into and exit out of REO status, we validate the accuracy of our measures of REOs using loss mitigation data from the OCC Mortgage Metrics database.","[Kiefer, Hua; Mayock, Tom] Off Comptroller Currency, 400 7th St SW, Washington, DC 20219 USA; [Kiefer, Leonard] Freddie Mac, 8200 Jones Branch Dr, Mclean, VA 22102 USA",United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; Freddie Mac,"Mayock, T (通讯作者)，Off Comptroller Currency, 400 7th St SW, Washington, DC 20219 USA.",Hua.Kiefer@occ.treas.gov; leonard_kiefer@freddiemac.com; thomas.mayock@occ.treas.gov,"Mayock, Tom/HTP-2878-2023",,,,,,31,0,0,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

This paper assesses the results of applying a probabilistic simulation method - which isolates the individual contributions of changes in flight demand and changes in airport throughput performance to changes in flight delays - to diagnose how these different events may have caused operational changes at these airports, and in turn, how the results may be used to inform policies for appropriate countermeasures. The analysis revealed two key observations. Firstly, certain patterns in throughput performance shifts caused the most significant delays, and were more likely to have been caused by controller staffing issues rather than caps. Secondly, relatively constant average delays from one year to the next may result from significant demand drops accompanied by large throughput performance degradations at an airport. This suggests that not only operational limitations on capacity encourage airlines to reduce schedules, but that changed demands can also impact throughput performance. Overall, the analysis indicates that caps may not have provided their fully intended delay benefits. Although they successfully reduced overall flight demands at LGA and JFK, they also directly limited throughput performance at critical times, in turn limiting delay benefits. In addition, demands at the busiest times of the day appear to be relatively inelastic to these operational limitations, insofar as demand profiles at EWR and JFK remained peaky in 2008 and 2009. Also, the recession was largely responsible for reducing demands at the airports in 2009, but the delay benefits of this were dampened by a corresponding throughput performance degradation. Based on the above observations, a more direct demand management policy combined with policies that focus on maintaining high staffing capabilities at critical times of the day may be considered, to reduce the likelihood of major queue formation on days that do experience sustained demands. The results also suggest that a more flexible caps system, particularly during times of heavy queues, could be explored. Although airport practitioners have keen understandings of how their airports operate, without the support of quantitative analysis tools, it can be more difficult to argue the need for appropriate countermeasures. An analysis such as the one presented here can provide the detailed quantitative substantiation required to build cases for these targeted policy directives and infrastructure investments.

During recent decades, the level of remittances has increased dramatically, and the recent financial crisis has scarcely affected the trend. In the same period, the structure of international migration flows has changed. These flows are now characterised by a growing feminisation and by increasing skill levels. In this paper, we establish a link between these two facts and assess the effect of the change in the structure of migration on the level of remittances. We use a recent data set on bilateral remittances and estimate a gravity model in which the gender and education background of migration flows are accounted for. We find that remittances are positively associated with the share of female and college-educated migrants. In particular, we argue that the rising share of college-educated women has had a significant impact on the increase in remittances.","[Le Goff, Maelan] Banque France, Paris, France; [Le Goff, Maelan] CEPII, Paris, France; [Salomone, Sara] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Louvain, Belgium",European Central Bank; Bank of France; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Le Goff, M (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.;Le Goff, M (通讯作者)，CEPII, Paris, France.",,,,Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International (FERDI); programme 'Investissements d'Avenir' of the French Government [ANR-10-LABX-14-01],Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International (FERDI); programme 'Investissements d'Avenir' of the French Government(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We thank Frederic Docquier, Simone Bertoli and the two anonymous referees for their constructive comments.

Yet, with trade liberalization, governments have been forced to abandon these easy-to-collect taxes and to adopt modern hard-to-collect taxes, mainly internal income and consumption taxes. Surprisingly, we know little about how governments across the world have addressed this common challenge. In this paper, we analyze the rise of the most important present taxes: the personal and corporate income tax, the general sales tax and the value-added tax. Based on a self-coded dataset, we provide a historical-descriptive outline of the expansion of modern taxes since 1842 and test the effect of trade liberalization on the probability to adopt hard(er)-to-collect taxes. While trade is an important determinant for the legislation of modern taxes, we find that its influence is not universal but depends on the tax type. Only the personal income tax and the value-added tax have served as a revenue substitution to trade taxes, while the general sales tax and the corporate income tax were rather fueled by other factors such as spending pressures.","[Seelkopf, Laura; Schmitt, Carina] Univ Bremen, Ctr Social Policy Res, Ctr Social Policy Res, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Lierse, Hanna] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, D-28759 Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen; Jacobs University,"Seelkopf, L (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Ctr Social Policy Res, Ctr Social Policy Res, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",,"Schmitt, Carina/R-2411-2016","Seelkopf, Laura/0000-0002-2251-3830; Schmitt, Carina/0000-0003-0850-7407",German Research Foundation [CRC 597],German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was supported by the German Research Foundation [grant number CRC 597].,,73,19,21,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We also find that while practitioners can specify high lag order VARs to mitigate trend misspecification, relying on common information criterion such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Bayesian information criterion (BIC) may choose a lag order that is too low.","[Wong, Benjamin] Reserve Bank New Zealand, 2 Terrace, Wellington 6011, New Zealand; [Wong, Benjamin] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Wiriyawit, Varang] Mahidol Univ Int Coll, 999 Phutthamonthon 4 Rd, Salaya 73170, Nakhonpathom, Thailand",Reserve Bank of New Zealand; Australian National University; Mahidol University,"Wong, B (通讯作者)，Reserve Bank New Zealand, 2 Terrace, Wellington 6011, New Zealand.;Wong, B (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",benjamin.wong@rbnz.govt.nz,,"Wong, Benjamin/0000-0002-1665-6165",,,,,30,1,1,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Technology shocks and the geography of new jobs,REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,New jobs; Technological change; Urban development,POLARIZATION; GROWTH; TASKS,"This paper shows how the Computer Revolution of the 1980s shifted the economic trajectories of U.S. cities. Examining the emergence of new occupational titles in official census classifications, we document a sharp reversal in the skill content of new jobs. While technological change was biased towards routine skills throughout the 1970s, new job titles mainly appeared in occupations and industries that required abstract skills after 1980. This reversal is also reflected in the geography of new jobs. Following the Computer Revolution, the creation of new jobs shifted towards cities with endowments of analytical and interactive skills. Our results suggest that the recent divergence of U.S. cities can in part be explained by the complementarities between new technologies and skill endowments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A model that re-examines these questions is estimated for two panels of Asian and Latin American countries over the 1980-2008 period using a novel empirical approach that accounts for endogeneity as well as for the time series properties of the variables involved. From an econometric point of view, we apply recent panel co-integration techniques based on factor models that account for two additional elements usually neglected in previous empirical literature: cross-dependence and structural breaks. The results point to a positive impact of trade openness in both Asia and Latin America although the size is smaller in the second region. We associate this finding with the degree to which trade was managed in both regions of the developing world.","[Camarero, Mariam; Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Inteco Res Unit, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada; Nowak-Lehmann, Felicitas] Univ Goettingen, Ibero Amer Inst Econ Res, Gottingen, Germany; [Tamarit, Cecilio] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, Inteco Res Unit, Valencia, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; University of Gottingen; University of Valencia,"Camarero, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Inteco Res Unit, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",,"Camarero, Mariam/A-5047-2008; Tamarit, Cecilio/N-2017-2019; Tamarit, Cecilio/A-8178-2010; Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/K-1633-2014","Camarero, Mariam/0000-0003-4525-5181; Tamarit, Cecilio/0000-0002-0538-9882; Tamarit, Cecilio/0000-0002-0538-9882; Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/0000-0002-3247-8557","Spanish Ministry of Education [PRX12/00103]; Spanish MINECO project [ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R]; Generalitat Valenciana project [PROMETEOII/2014/053]; University Jaume I [P1-1B2013-06]; European Commission [542457-LLP-1-2013-1-ES-AJM-CL, 542434-LLP-1-2013-1-ES-AJM-CL, 542727-LLP-1-2013-1-ES-AJM-CL]",Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government); Spanish MINECO project(Spanish Government); Generalitat Valenciana project(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)); University Jaume I; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The paper was elaborated upon during a stay of C.

The binary evaluation framework was introduced as a general approach to aggregation by Wilson (J Econ Theory 10: 89-99, 1975). In this setting we characterize the mean rule, which we derive from properties similar to those Young (J Econ Theory 9: 43-52, 1974) used in his characterization of the Borda rule. Complementing our axiomatic approach is a derivation of the mean rule using vector decomposition methods that have their origins in Zwicker (Math Soc Sci 22: 187-227, 1991). Additional normative appeal is provided by a form of tension minimization that characterizes the mean rule and suggests contexts wherein its application may be appropriate. Finally, we derive the mean rule from an approach to judgment aggregation recently proposed by Dietrich (Soc Choice Welf 42: 873-911, 2014).","[Duddy, Conal; Piggins, Ashley] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Univ Rd, Galway, Ireland; [Duddy, Conal; Piggins, Ashley] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Whitaker Inst, Univ Rd, Galway, Ireland; [Zwicker, William S.] Union Coll, Dept Math, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Union College,"Piggins, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Galway, JE Cairnes Sch Business & Econ, Univ Rd, Galway, Ireland.;Piggins, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Whitaker Inst, Univ Rd, Galway, Ireland.",conal.duddy@nuigalway.ie; ashley.piggins@nuigalway.ie; zwickerw@union.edu,"Duddy, Conal/IYS-6034-2023","Duddy, Conal/0000-0002-7801-9305",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through MEC/FEDER grant [ECO2013-44483-P]; Irish Research Council - European Commission,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through MEC/FEDER grant; Irish Research Council - European Commission,"Financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through MEC/FEDER grant ECO2013-44483-P, and the Irish Research Council co-funding from the European Commission, is gratefully acknowledged.

It is well-known that insufficiently correcting these test scores for pupil characteristics may provide incentives for pupil selection. Building further on results from the theory of fair allocation, we show that the trade-off between reward and pupil selection is not only a matter of sufficient information. A school accountability scheme that rewards school performance will create incentives for pupil selection, even under perfect information, unless the educational production function satisfies an (unrealistic) separability assumption. We propose different compromise solutions and discuss the resulting incentives in theory. The empirical relevance of our analysis-i.e., the rejection of the separability assumption and the magnitude of the incentives in the different compromise solutions-is illustrated with Flemish data. The traditional value-added model turns out to be an acceptable compromise.","[Ooghe, Erwin; Schokkaert, Erik] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, Leuven, Belgium; [Ooghe, Erwin] ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [Schokkaert, Erik] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Universite Catholique Louvain,"Ooghe, E (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, Leuven, Belgium.;Ooghe, E (通讯作者)，ZEW, Mannheim, Germany.",Erwin.Ooghe@kuleuven.be; erik.schokkaert@kuleuven.be,,"Schokkaert, Erik/0000-0003-0981-3449",,,,,31,0,3,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2016,46,2.0,,,,,359,387,,10.1007/s00355-015-0917-0,0.0,,,29,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DH8CI,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373020700006,0

By the Pittman & Ivry (2009) was the value of the world's companies which has been wiped out by this crisis in the amount of $ 14.5 trillion, or 33%. The most common reason for the bankruptcies of global firms were poor quality risk management within these companies. One of the positive effects of this crisis was the creation of the ISO standard ISO 31000: 2009 Risk Management - Principles and guidelines (with supporting standard IEC 31010: 2009 - Risk Management - Risk assessment techniques). Corporate risk management has emerged as one of the most important corporate activities. Influence of ISO 31000 to the company was so fundamental that it published, in effect, there was also a significant change in the revised standard ISO 9001: 2015 - which in itself involves a new risk management system. Whether these measures will help in the future to help improve the financial health of companies is an important issue that deserves our attention in further research.","[Benetti, Karina] SKODA AUTO Coll Ops, Karmeli 1457, Mlada Boleslav 29301, Czech Republic",,"Benetti, K (通讯作者)，SKODA AUTO Coll Ops, Karmeli 1457, Mlada Boleslav 29301, Czech Republic.",benetti@is.savs.cz,"Benetti, Karina/HLP-4948-2023","Benetti, Karina/0000-0001-8250-7515",,,,,16,3,3,0,9,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,154,162,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100016,0

This provides a rare opportunity to study the under-appreciated role of monetary trust in the politics of central bank legitimacy which, for the first time in decades, appears fragile. While research on central bank communication with 'the markets' abounds, little is known about if and how central bankers speak to 'the people.' A closer look at the issue immediately reveals a paradox: while a central bank's legitimacy hinges on it being perceived as acting in line with the dominant folk theory of money, this theory accords poorly with how money actually works. How central banks cope with this ambiguity depends on the monetary situation. Using the Bundesbank and the European Central Bank as examples, this article shows that under inflationary macroeconomic conditions, central bankers willingly nourished the folk-theoretical notion of money as a quantity under the direct control of the central bank. By contrast, the Bank of England's recent refutation of the folk theory of money suggests that deflationary pressures and rapid monetary expansion have fundamentally altered the politics of monetary trust and central bank legitimacy.","[Braun, Benjamin] Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Paulstr 3, Cologne, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Braun, B (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Paulstr 3, Cologne, Germany.",,,"Braun, Benjamin/0000-0002-5186-5923",,,,,135,84,87,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We present the numerical method based on wavelets for an adaptive solution of the Black-Scholes equation. We use several quadratic and cubic spline wavelet bases. Wavelets are very-well known for their compression property. It means that the representation of the solution in a wavelet basis requires a small number of coefficients and the computation of the solution with desired accuracy can be performed with the small number of degrees of freedom. Furthermore, this method enables high-order approximation, the system of linear algebraic equation arising from discretization is well-conditioned and the number of iterations for computing the solution is relatively small.

The establishment of this model is a salutary attempt to Sinicize the global integrated assessment model that combines economy, energy, and environment systems. The simulation results indicate that: (1) for majority of regions, ETS is more effective in cutting CO, emissions than a harmonized carbon tax (HCT), but this might not be true for the entire country, which means that these two options have little difference in overall carbon reduction; (2) carbon tax policy is a more cost-effective option in curbing CO, with respect to ETS in the long run; (3) neither ETS nor pure carbon tax provide enough incentives for the breakthrough of carbon-free energy technologies, which illustrates that matching with some other support policies, such as subsidies and R&D investment, is essential to extend the niche market; and (4) In the context of ETS, the diffusion of non-fossil technologies in regions that act as sellers performs much better than this diffusion in the buyer regions.","[Duan, Hongbo] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Lei; Kumbaroglu, Guerkan; Fan, Ying] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Kumbaroglu, Guerkan; Fan, Ying] Bogazici Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Istanbul, Turkey","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Beihang University; Bogazici University","Zhu, L (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",hbduan@ucas.ac.cn; lions85509050@gmail.com; gurkank@boun.edu.tr; ying_fan@263.net,"Kumbaroglu, Gurkan S/M-5202-2018","Zhu, Lei/0000-0002-7501-4904; KUMBAROGLU, GURKAN SELCUK/0000-0001-7036-0720; Duan, Hongbo/0000-0001-5143-4413","Natural Science foundation of China [71210005, 71273253, 71503242]; Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences [14YJC630029]","Natural Science foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences","An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 4thInternational Association of Energy Economics (IAEE) Asian Conference, Beijing, China, September 19-21.

Therefore, staple food diversification as rice substitute is needed by promoting glutinous corn rice. Glutinous corn rice is consumable for human and can be made only from local waxy corn. The problem is that the production rate of waxy corn is still low that the availability of main ingredient of glutinous corn rice is limited. Therefore, the production of waxy corn should be increased while efficient application of fertilizer is maintained. The objectives of this research were to increase the production of waxy corn, make the usage of phosphate fertilizer more efficient and produce main ingredient of glutinous corn rice. The expected specific target was to make a recommendation about how to increase the production of waxy corn and produce main ingredient of glutinous corn rice. This study was performed using randomized two-factor factorial design. The first factor was phosphate solvent extraction (E) consist of without extraction (control, E0) and with extraction (10 L. ha-1, E1) while the second factor was SP-36 (P) fertilizer, consist of without SP-36 (control, P0), 50 kg SP-36. ha-1 (P1), 100 kg SP-36. ha-1 (P2), and 150 kg SP-36. ha-1 (P3). The results showed that the application of phosphate solvent extraction 10 L. ha-1 increased the length and diameter of cob and the combination of phosphate solvent extraction 10 L. ha-1 and 50 kg SP-36. ha-1 increased the production of dried seed per hectare. Moreover, application of phosphate solvent extraction decreased the usage of phosphate fertilizer. (C) 2016 The Authors.

But how successful is this concept of outcome-based social preferences for actually predicting out-ofsample behavior? We investigate this question by having 1067 human subjects each make 20 cooperation decisions, and using machine learning to predict their last 5 choices based on their first 15. We find that decisions can be predicted with high accuracy by models that include outcome-based features and allow for heterogeneity across individuals in baseline cooperativeness and the weights placed on the outcome-based features (AUC=0.89). It is not necessary, however, to have a fully heterogeneous model - excellent predictive power (AUC=0.88) is achieved by a model that allows three different sets of baseline cooperativeness and feature weights (i.e. three behavioral types), defined based on the participant's cooperation frequency in the 15 training trials: those who cooperated at least half the time, those who cooperated less than half the time, and those who never cooperated. Finally, we provide evidence that this inclination to cooperate cannot be well proxied by other personality/morality survey measures or demographics, and thus is a natural kind (or cooperative phenotype).","[Epstein, Ziv] Pomona Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Peysakhovich, Alexander] Yale Univ, Human Cooperat Lab, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Rand, David G.] Yale Univ, Inst Network Sci, Sch Management, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Peysakhovich, Alexander] Facebook News Feed, Menlo Pk, CA USA",Claremont Colleges; Pomona College; Yale University; Yale University; Facebook Inc,"Epstein, Z (通讯作者)，Pomona Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",ziv.epstein@pomona.edu; alex.peys@gmail.com; david.rand@yale.edu,"Rand, David G./B-3716-2009",,,,,,41,8,10,0,6,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,547,559,,10.1145/2940716.2940761,0.0,,,13,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300045,0

The class of circulant games contains well-known examples such as Matching Pennies, Rock-Paper-Scissors, as well as subclasses of coordination and common interest games. The best response correspondences in circulant games induce a partition on each player's set of pure strategies into equivalence classes. In any Nash Equilibrium, all strategies within one class are either played with strictly positive or with zero probability. We further show that, strikingly, a single parameter fully determines the exact number and the structure of all Nash equilibria (pure and mixed) in these games. The parameter itself only depends on the position of the largest payoff in the first row of one of the player's payoff matrix.","[Granic, Dura-Georg; Kern, Johannes] Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Kern, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",georg.granic@uni-koeln.de; j-kern@gmx.de,"Granic, Georg/AAG-8606-2020","Granic, Georg/0000-0001-9504-3545","German Research Foundation [AL-1169/1-1, AL-1169/1-2]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [AL-1169/2-1]",German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We would like to thank Carlos Alos-Ferrer, Tanja Artiga Gonzalez, Wolfgang Leininger, participants at the SAET13 conference in Paris and seminar participants in Cologne and Innsbruck for helpful comments and discussions.

Different risks are associated with uncertainty. This paper focuses on the investment risk. To minimize it the evaluation of projects is used based on the expected net present value of cash flows, which reflects two components of investment risk: 1) the possibility of different results; 2) the fact that an income of a particular project fluctuates randomly around its expected value. Both of these components relate to the economic side of things. This contribution is an extension of the standard investment risk for an additional non-economic component having the character of a political or environmental risk, and the transition from the investment risk to the comprehensive risk. As a part of a comprehensive risk an investment becomes a bet in the investment lottery differentiating from the standard lottery by a low probability not to win anything. The aim of this paper is to show how the transition from investment risk to comprehensive risk changes the standard decision criteria for accepting projects.","[Haskova, Simona] Sch Expertness & Valuat, Inst Technol & Business, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Hasková, S (通讯作者)，Sch Expertness & Valuat, Inst Technol & Business, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic.",haskovas@post.cz,"Hašková, Simona/N-3667-2019",,,,,,11,4,4,0,1,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,260,264,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500045,0

Aeration of 0.3 vvm did not affect the level of ethanol produced, yielded 0.338 gram of ethanol per gram of substrate used. Interestingly, the result showed that the New Aule baker's instant dry yeast produced higher ethanol compare to that of its alcohol yeast.

Indeed, the problem receives its modern terms in Modern Era, namely, during the second half of 19th and early 20th century. Growth of economy, commerce and crafts, as well as building of roads and slow industrialization faced the town of Osijek with problems of environmental protection in various ways. Since these industries started to endanger environment, in 1884 Croatian parliament brought a Law on crafts, wich, naturally, had to be put in effect in Osijek too. Articles 25-36 give ruling on environment and ecology issues, as well as possible ways to deal with problems. The paragraphs listed 45 crafts and trades, that provized hazard to the environment: slaughterhouse, tanning, lime and whitewash, brickyard, candle and foundary, mineral oil refinery, soap produce, brewery, oil mill, sugar mill, hard liquor, silk plan, etc. Beside, environmental protection and clean streets were needed, as in the late 19th century Osijek had a Town embellishment society wich tried to form and build up citizens' awareness of ecology issues and the need for environmental protection.","[Lachner, Visnja] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Lachner, V (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",vlachner@pravos.hr,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,202,209,,,,,,8,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400020,0

We apply the mixed integer model CCTS-Mod to compute a CCTS infrastructure network for Europe, examining the effects of different CO2 price paths with different regional foci. Scenarios assuming low CO2 certificate prices lead to hardly any CCTS development in Europe. The iron and steel sector starts deployment once the CO2 certificate prices exceed 50 (sic)/tCO(2). The cement sector starts investing at a threshold of 75 (sic)/tCO(2), followed by the electricity sector when prices exceed 100 (sic)/tCO(2). The degree of CCTS deployment is found to be more sensitive to variable costs of CO2 capture than to investment costs. Additional revenues generated from utilizing CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) in the North Sea would lead to an earlier adoption of CCTS, independent of the CO2 certificate price; this case may become especially relevant for the UK, Norway and the Netherlands. However, scattered CCTS deployment increases unit cost of transport and storage infrastructure by 30% or more.","[Oei, Pao-Yu; Mendelevitch, Roman] Berlin Univ Technol TU Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Oei, Pao-Yu; Mendelevitch, Roman] German Econ Res Inst DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Oei, PY (通讯作者)，Berlin Univ Technol TU Berlin, Berlin, Germany.;Oei, PY (通讯作者)，German Econ Res Inst DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",pyo@wip.tu-berlin.de,,"Mendelevitch, Roman/0000-0001-5054-109X; Oei, Pao-Yu/0000-0001-6638-0147",,,,,41,13,14,2,6,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2016,37,,,,3,,171,194,,10.5547/01956574.37.SI3.poei,0.0,,,24,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EF7OQ,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390519300009,0

This paper only concerns the impact of the economic cycle on total and long-term unemployment. However, unemployment affects different age groups with varying intensities. This article analyzes the impact of the economic cycle on different age groups in the countries of the Visegrad Group. The conclusions confirm that younger people (aged 15-24 years) are most affected by total and long-term unemployment. Among this group, unemployment and especially long-term unemployment carry strongly negative effects that may manifest in the rest of the lives of young people.

All the EU countries must be able compete internationally in reality of global knowledge economy. Thus, the QHC was analysed from the perspective of the knowledge-based economy. As the QHC is a multidimensional phenomenon in order to measure it and obtain time series for further econometric research, TOPSIS method was applied. To evaluate TFP the parameters of the Cobb-Douglas production function for the new EU members were estimated. Finally, it was possible to identify the relationship between the QHC and the level of TFP with application of dynamic panel model. The analysis was conducted for the years 2000-2010 based on Eurostat data.

The authors of this research have recently proposed several candidates for such measures. This article presents, in turn, a discussion about general properties that should be fulfilled by a risk measure in household financial planning. At the current stage of the discussion, the posited postulates are rather of a qualitative nature, but they may also serve in the future as a conceptual background of a set of more formalized ones. They may be a kind of analogue of the conditions set by Artzner, Delbaen, Eber and Heath (coherent measure of risk) or by Follmer and Schied (convex measure of risk). They should, however, better comply with the life-long household financial planning perspective. This means, amongst others, including multiple financial goals and their timing. Also threats to the aim of life standard preservation should be reflected.","[Pietrzyk, Radoslaw; Rokita, Pawel] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Financial Investments & Risk Management, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Pietrzyk, R (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Financial Investments & Risk Management, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",radoslaw.pietrzyk@ue.wroc.pl; pawel.rokita@ue.wroc.pl,"Pietrzyk, Radoslaw/S-2267-2016; Rokita, Pawel A./U-1101-2018","Pietrzyk, Radoslaw/0000-0002-6583-8424;",,,,,12,1,1,0,4,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,687,692,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500118,0

Its main argument is that in times of turmoil-perceived or real -analysis of actors ' strategies and cognitive frames is crucial for understanding the emergence of solutions proposed to remedy the problem. Starting from a sociological definition of crisis, the article illustrates through empirical examples how the cognitive frames in which actors evolve determine their analysis of problems as well as solutions. Sociological approaches to public policy, which reject the basic assumption of actors behaving solely according to a presumed material cost-benefit analysis, help us to better grasp the complexity of decision-making. The main reason for this is that they allow for linking the domestic and European levels when analysing cognitive and decision-making processes, instead of concentrating on either European citizens or European elites separately.","[Saurugger, Sabine] Sci Po Grenoble, F-38040 Grenoble, France",,"Saurugger, S (通讯作者)，Sci Po Grenoble, PACTE, BP 48, F-38040 Grenoble, France.",sabine.saurugger@sciencespo-grenoble.fr,,"Saurugger, Sabine/0000-0002-6256-6689",,,,,81,24,26,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

From a mathematical perspective, the PDE model is a system of non-linear differential equations characterized by slow-fast dynamics. This means that some of the system variables vary much faster than others. The existence of speed of dynamical in variables in model implies problems with numerical solution of models.

Another important character in this story was Lord Treasurer Lionel Cranfield, who led the investigative proceedings while openly favoring the 'balance of trade' party. The well-known pamphlets written by these authors thus emerge simply as the last stage in a process that saw economic doctrines emerge out of public controversy and confrontations.","[Suprinyak, Carlos Eduardo] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Cedeplar, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Suprinyak, CE (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Cedeplar, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",suprinyak@cedeplar.ufmg.br,"Suprinyak, Carlos Eduardo/A-6220-2015","Suprinyak, Carlos Eduardo/0000-0003-0360-8217",FAPEMIG; CNPq; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,FAPEMIG(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"The author would like to thank FAPEMIG, CNPq, and Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais for their financial support.",,59,2,2,0,2,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

It is frequently forgotten that a man is a part of the nature and that he should live in accordance with its laws. However, contrary to this idyll is the term risk society, which characterizes today's society. The consequence of this way of thinking and living has led to the fact that there is no synthesis between the natural and social life. They are seen as two sides of human existence. While on the one hand there is a tendency for the realization of a large wealth, on the other hand nature suffers. This problem was counteracted by the introduction of a comprehensive concept of sustainable development that should be the main guiding principle in contemporary business.","[Svetlacic, Robert] Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Opatija, Croatia; [Primorac, Dinko; Kozina, Goran] Univ North, Koprivnica, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University North - Croatia,"Svetlacic, R (通讯作者)，Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Opatija, Croatia.",rsvetlacic@gmail.com; dinko.primorac@unin.hr; goran.kozina@unin.hr,"Primorac, Dinko/IVH-5297-2023; Primorac, Dinko/AFQ-8288-2022",,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,732,742,,,,,,11,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400075,0
