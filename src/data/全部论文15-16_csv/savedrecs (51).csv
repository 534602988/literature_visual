Yet understanding public attitudes for this fledgling industry is important for future policy considerations, decision-making and for industry stakeholders. This study uses data collected from the University of Nottingham, UK nationwide online survey (n=3823) conducted in September 2014, to consider ten hypothesises about the UK public's attitudes towards shale gas. From the survey data we can see that 43.11% of respondents support shale gas extraction in the UK. Furthermore, our results show that women, class DE respondents, non-Conservative party supporters, and respondents who positively associate shale gas with water contamination or earthquakes are less likely to support the extraction of shale gas in the UK. We also discuss potential policy implications for the UK government arising from these findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The residential sector in Ireland accounts for approximately 25% of primary energy demand with roughly half of primary home heating fuelled by oil and 11% by solid fuels. Displacing oil and solid fuel usage with air source heat pump (ASHP) technology could offer household cost savings, reductions in emissions, and reduced health impacts. An economic analysis estimates that 60% of homes using oil, have the potential to deliver savings in the region of 600 per annum when considering both running and annualised capital costs. Scenario analysis estimates that a grant of 2400 could increase the potential market uptake of oil users by up to 17% points, whilst a higher oil price, similar to 2013, could further increase uptake from heating oil users by 24% points. Under a combined oil-price and grant scenario, CO2 emissions reduce by over 4 million tonnes per annum and residential PM2.5 and NOx emissions from oil and peat reduce close to zero. Corresponding health and environmental benefits are estimated in the region of 100m per annum. Sensitivity analyses are presented assessing the impact of alternate discount rates and technology performance. This research confirms the potential for ASHP technology and identifies and informs policy design considerations with regard to oil price trends, access to capital, targeting of grants, and addressing transactions costs.

This may impede (re)development of energy efficient affordable housing. In the Netherlands, affordable housing institutions regularly sell dwellings from their housing stock to individual households. If they can sell energy efficient dwellings at a premium, this may stimulate investments in the environmental performance of homes. We analyze the value effects of energy efficiency in the affordable housing market, by using a sample of 17,835 homes sold by Dutch affordable housing institutions in the period between 2008 and 2013. We use Energy Performance Certificates to determine the value of energy efficiency in these transactions. We document that dwellings with high energy efficiency sell for 2.0-6.3% more compared to otherwise similar dwellings with low energy efficiency.

In contrast to citizens' important role in financing renewable energies, the energy policy and economics literature has traditionally focused on other investors, such as incumbent energy firms. To close this gap, this paper reports on a large-scale survey of 1,990 German retail investors. Conducting a choice experiment with the subset of 1,041 respondents who expressed an interest in investing in community renewable energy projects, we present a unique dataset allowing for new insights in risk-return expectations of retail investors. We find that apart from return on investment, respondents are particularly sensitive to the minimum holding period and the issuer of community renewable energy investment offerings. A minimum holding period of 10 years implies a risk premium of 2.76% points. A subsequent segmentation analysis shows that two groups of potential community renewable energy investors with different risk-return expectations can be identified: local patriots and yield investors. In contrast to professional investors, a majority of retail investors use simple decision rules such as calculating payback time or relying on their gut feeling when making investments.

This paper sheds light on the evolution of China's interregional differences in CO2 emissions from coal by constructing a Gini coefficient and decoupling elasticity index for emissions from 1997 to 2012 and explains why emission differences deviate from economic growth differences. The study decomposed the Gini coefficient of CO2 emissions from coal by source, incremental source, and region. It also divided the decoupling elasticity of carbon emissions into two components: effects of environmental expenditure and effects of emission reduction policy. The findings of the study are as follows: First, interregional differences in China's overall CO2 emissions from coal are characterized by periodic fluctuation. Second, the differences in emissions from raw coal, the concentration effect of emissions, and the emission differences within regions are the three main factors in the overall difference changes in coal's carbon emissions in China. Last but not least, the decoupling between provincial CO2 emissions from coal and economic growth is on the whole weak. Based on the above findings, the author offers four suggestions for emission reduction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It then measures price spreads between oil and gas from 1998 to 2015 to identify the impact of the revolution on the relationship between oil and regional gas prices. The results show that the typical movement regime of Henry Hub prices changes from 'slightly upward' to 'sharply downward'. In addition, the clear seasonal effect of Henry Hub prices has disappeared after the shale gas revolution. The typical movement of national balancing point (NBP) prices has changed gradually from a 'sharply upward' regime to the alternative regimes between 'sharply downward' and 'slightly upward', tending to follow oil prices. This indicates that the shale gas revolution has had little impact on NBP price movement. Meanwhile, Henry Hub prices have decoupled from WTI prices, while NBP and Brent prices have continued to exhibit a long-term equilibrium level around which they have swung in the short time frame since the shale gas revolution. Pertinent energy policy makers and energy market participants should pay attention to these changes and adjust their trade, production and investment strategies accordingly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, off-grid Renewable Energy (OGRE) project financing faces significant challenges due to limited financing access, low affordability of consumers, high transactions costs and etc. Various supporting instruments have been implemented to facilitate OGRE investment. This study assesses the effectiveness of those instruments with a framework consists of three dimensions: feasibility, sustainability and replicability. The weights of each dimension in the framework and the scores of each instrument are assessed by expert surveys based on the Delphi method. It is suggested that all the three dimensions should be taken into consideration while assessing the instruments, among which feasibility and sustainability are considered as the most important dimensions in the assessment framework. Furthermore, the top-5 most effective instruments in facilitating OGRE investment are local engagement in operation and maintenance, loan guarantee, start-up grant, end user financing, and concessional finance. Developing countries that need to increase electrification, such as most of the ASEAN member states, could use these top scored instruments despite of their limited amount of public finance.

Prior experience suggests that price and quantity-based programs, such as feed-in tariffs, provide more efficient renewable adoption and use and lower program costs than programs that set quantity targets only. We also examine some cost-allocation issues raised by the use of DRE systems and fixed time-invariant retail pricing. This combination can result in customers with DRE systems paying a disproportionately small portion of system capacity costs. We suggest two retail-pricing schemes, real-time pricing and a two-part tariff with demand charges, to address these issues. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Selling over-allocated contracts effectively depreciates prices and negates the effect intended by the regulator to establish a stable price mechanism for CO2 assets. Our paper investigates mispricing and allocation issues by quantitatively analyzing variance risk premia of CO2 markets over the course of changing regimes (Phase I-III) for three different assets (European Union Allowances, Certified Emissions Reductions and European Reduction Units). The research paper gives recommendations to regulatory bodies in order to most effectively cap the overall carbon dioxide emissions. The analysis of an enriched dataset, comprising not only of additional CO2 assets, but also containing data from the European Energy Exchange, shows that variance risk premia are equal to a sample average of 0.69 for European Union Allowances (EUA), 0.17 for Certified Emissions Reductions (CER) and 0.81 for European Reduction Units (ERU). We identify the existence of a common risk factor across different assets that justifies the presence of risk premia. Various policy implications with regards to gaining investors' confidence in the market are being reviewed. Consequently, we recommend the implementation of a price collar approach to support stable prices for emission allowances. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, in this paper, we used alternative-specific conditional logit model (ASCLM) to examine the rural household energy choice behaviors in Sichuan Province of China from the perspective of revealed and stated preferences. The results show that the fuel switching in our study region is not a simple unidirectional process from traditional biomass energy to modern fuels as incomes improve. Household energy choice behaviors could be not only affected by energy -specific characteristics such as fuel price, smoky level and safety risk, but also influenced by household -specific factors such as income level, age and educational level of the decision maker, household demographic structure, number of people frequently eating at home, distance to the nearest biomass collecting spot and household location, suggesting that government should attach more importance to simultaneously improve energy quality, control energy price and enhance household socio-economic status.

The argument put forward in this paper is that this is possible to a large extent through a rebalancing of the surplus values of urban transformation between the public and private sectors, in favour of the former. Cities-the large and medium-large ones with their international projection and their resources of knowledge and creativity, and those of smaller size with their cultural, relational and environmental resources-assured, at least until the onset of the 2008 global crisis, the high, if not extremely high, profitability of urban transformation processes in the form of rents, capital gains and profits for potential entrepreneurs-developers. A more balanced distribution of these surplus values is not only possible but also highly desirable, and it is advocated by a number of large international agencies and important research centres. In the paper, the legal and economic rationale for a taxation of land rents is presented, and a first comparative assessment of these fiscal policies is carried out with reference to some European countries and to Italy in particular.

Using a large panel dataset of 140 countries covering the period from 1995 to 2009, we find an adverse effect of resource dependence on public education expenditures relative to GDP that is robust to controlling for a range of additional covariates. Furthermore, our findings indicate that this resource curse effect on the government prioritization of education mainly stems from point-source natural resources. These results are of particular importance for the sustainable management of natural resource wealth in developing countries, as they could achieve especially high returns by investing resource revenues in public goods such as education. While this paper underlines the importance of institutions and government accountability, our findings also raise questions on the role of the private sector as a partner in development, as the extractives industry could consider increasing funding for education through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.

To identify the most sustainable energy pathways to meet this demand, analysis of energy systems on which policy is based must move beyond the current primary focus on carbon to include a broad range of ecosystem services on which human well-being depends. Incorporation of a broad set of ecosystem services into the design of energy policy will differentiates between energy technology options to identify policy options that reconcile national and international obligations to address climate change and the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. In this paper we consider our current understanding of the implications of energy systems for ecosystem services and identify key elements of an assessment. Analysis must consider the full life cycle of energy systems, the territorial and international footprint, use a consistent ecosystem service framework that incorporates the value of both market and non-market goods, and consider the spatial and temporal dynamics of both the energy and environmental system. While significant methodological challenges exist, the approach we detail can provide the holistic view of energy and ecosystem services interactions required to inform the future of global energy policy.

The causal effect concerns how the outcome depends on the endogenous treatment variable. The outcome variable, treatment variable, other explanatory variables, and the instrumental variable can be essentially any combination of continuous, discrete, or other variables. In particular, it is not necessary to have any continuous variables, none of the variables need to have large support, and the instrument can be binary even if the corresponding endogenous treatment variable and/or outcome is continuous. The outcome can be mismeasured or interval-measured, and the endogenous treatment variable need not even be observed.

The empirical method used is the nonlinear cointegrating autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model of Shin et al. (2013) in which short-run and long-run nonlinearities are introduced via positive and negative partial sum decompositions of the explanatory variable(s). The results suggest evidence of asymmetries in all the cases. We find significant positive oil price changes in all the cases with the expected positive sign, implying that increases in oil price lead to increases in real GDP. Conversely, negative oil price changes are significant for only Kuwait and Qatar with the expected positive sign, suggesting that decreases in oil price lead to decreases in their real GDP. Further analysis implemented using panel data shows that positive oil prices changes increase real GDP and negative changes decrease real GDP. Overall, the results suggest that positive oil price changes have a considerably larger impact on real GDP than negative changes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Results reveal that Holt-Winter is the appropriate model for forecasting electricity consumption in Pakistan. It also suggests that electricity consumption would continue to increase throughout the projected period and widen the consumption-production gap in case of failure to respond the issue appropriately. It further reveals that demand would be highest in the household sector as compared to all other sectors and the increase in the energy generation would be less than the increase in total electricity consumption throughout the projected period.

The literature on within-firm organisational change and productivity suggests that firms can achieve higher productivity gains from adopting new technologies if they adapt their organisational structures. Such complementarity effects may be of particular importance for the adoption of greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement technologies. The adoption of these technologies is often induced by public authorities to limit the social costs of climate change, whereas the private returns are much less obvious. This study finds empirical support for complementarity between green technology adoption (either CO2-reducing or resources and energy efficiency-enhancing technologies) and organisational change. While the sole adoption of green technologies is associated with lower productivity, the simultaneous implementation of green technologies and organisational innovations is not.

In this paper, we examine the existing barriers that impact PEV diffusion. We argue that increased fuel efficiency standards coupled with declining gasoline prices conflicts with the implemented PEV incentives.

Town twinning and German city growth, Regional Studies. After the Second World War, town twinning became popular, notably in Germany. This was mainly a reaction to the war experience, and it was initially aimed at creating renewed international understanding and cooperation between former enemies. It also reduced transaction costs. The results show that counties that engage in town twinning grow faster than cities that do not have twinning partners. In particular, both the number and the intensity of twinning relations as well as town twinning with French cities positively affect city growth. Positive population growth effects of town twinning are also mostly confined to the larger German cities.","[Brakman, Steven; Garretsen, Harry; Oumer, Abdella] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Brakman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",S.Brakman@rug.nl; j.h.garretsen@rug.nl; a.oumer@rug.nl,,,,,,,26,10,11,7,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Production externalities are transmitted at the level of firms and not at the regional level. For workers in low-skilled jobs, consumption externalities dominate production externalities.

Energy policy and the behaviour of utilities companies in Spain should be understood in light of the following contexts: the energy and economic crisis in the 1970s; the political transition towards a democratic regime, and the incorporation of Spain into the European Union. As shown through the aspects analysed in this article, traditional regulation in the Spanish electrical sector did not obtain the desired levels of efficiency. This traditional regulation, which went against competitive regulation put into practice in leading nations, was widely questioned. Any explanation of current regulation deficiencies in the Spanish electricity market, however, should take into account not only the current regulation models but also the path dependence in the industrial organization of utilities companies, which historically has been very concentrated in Spain.","[Garrues Irurzun, Josean] Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Irurzun, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",,"Garrués-Irurzun, Josean/W-3635-2018","Garrués-Irurzun, Josean/0000-0002-9261-5138",,,,,41,0,0,2,9,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

The agricultural companies can not only lease the land but also purchase it and operate on it. Through net present value we quantify whether it is worth for the agricultural companies in each Counties of Slovakia to lease the land and based on which conditions. Net present value belongs to the basic indicators of investment decision. By its calculation it is important to define the capital expenditure as well the calculation of expected financial incomes.

It is expected that residential sector would become a major force that drives China's energy consumption after urbanization process. We estimate price and expenditure elasticities of residential energy demand using data from China's Residential Energy Consumption Survey (CRECS) that covers households at different income levels and from different regional and social groups. Empirical results from the Almost Ideal Demand System model are in accordance with the basic expectations: the demands for electricity, natural gas and transport fuels are inelastic in the residential sector due to the unreasonable pricing mechanism. We further investigate the sensitivities of different income groups to prices of the three types of energy. Policy simulations indicate that rationalizing energy pricing mechanism is an important guarantee for energy sustainable development during urbanization. Finally, we put forward suggestions on energy pricing reform in the residential sector based on characteristics of China's undergoing urbanization process and the current energy consumption situations.

Disparities in public service provision in Niger: cross-district evidence on access to primary schools and healthcare, Regional Studies. Depending on sector characteristics and infrastructure needs, marginal benefit incidence theory envisages that geographical disparities within a developing country may decline in some sectors, and persist or widen in others. In this study Tobit models with/without eligibility and spatial effects suggest mixed evidence for access to primary schools and healthcare across districts in Niger. With strict eligibility thresholds, these effects are relatively more relevant for healthcare. Once local population is accounted for, intermediate and southern zones of the country systematically lag behind northern districts in school access improvements. Both sectors register autonomous gains for worse-off districts. However, hardly any additional gain is found to accrue to these districts compared with districts targeted randomly after controlling for demographic and environmental features. In practice, this highlights the need to strengthen social service delivery and better target poverty in poorer districts.","[Mainardi, Stefano] Card S Wyszynski Univ, Dept Informat & Econometr, PL-01815 Warsaw, Poland",,"Mainardi, S (通讯作者)，Card S Wyszynski Univ, Dept Informat & Econometr, Ul Dewajtis 5, PL-01815 Warsaw, Poland.",stemaind@gmail.com,,"Mainardi, Stefano/0000-0002-4684-9857",,,,,93,3,3,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Our example of solar hot water systems highlights the complexity and variability of responses to low-carbon technologies. While SHW systems have the potential to provide the majority of household hot water and to lower carbon emissions, little research has been done to investigate how SHW systems are integrated into everyday life. We draw on cultural understandings of the household to identify passive and active users of SHW systems and utilize a model that illustrates how technology use is dependent on inter-relations between cultural norms, systems of provision, the material elements of homes, and practice. A key finding is that households can be ill-prepared to make the most of their SHW systems and lack post-installation support to do so. Thus, informed and efficient use of SHW systems is hit and miss. Current policy is largely aimed at subsidizing purchase and installation on the assumption that this is sufficient for emission reduction goals. Our analysis provides evidence to the contrary. Areas we highlight for policy and practice improvement are independent pre-purchase advice, installation quality, and practical guidance on system operation and interaction with patterns of hot water use.

In this paper we model the technological trajectory for a number of energy technologies by analysing technological change (characterised by unit-level capacity up-scaling) and diffusion (characterised by growth in cumulative deployed capacity) using sigmoidal 5 Parameter Logistic (5PL) functions, observed and reported as a function of unit deployment. Application of 5PL functions allows inference of technology development milestones, such as initiation of unit-level up-scaling or industry growth, with respect to the number of unit deployments. This paper compares the technological trajectory followed by mature energy technologies to that being attempted by those in the nascent wave and tidal energy sectors, particularly with regards to unit deployment within a formative phase of development. We identify that the wave and tidal energy sectors are attempting to bypass a formative phase of technological development, which is not in line with technological trajectories experienced by historic energy technologies that have successfully diffused into widespread commercial application, suggesting that demand-pull support mechanisms are premature, and a need for technology push focused policy support mechanisms is vital for stimulating economically sustainable development and deployment of wave and tidal stream energy.

These uncertainties are pervasive through the complex nature of the system, the long term consequences of decisions, and in the models and analytical approaches used. These greatly increase the challenges of informing robust decision making. Energy system studies have tended not to address uncertainty in a systematic manner, relying on simple scenario or sensitivity analysis. This paper utilises an innovative UK energy system model, ESME, which characterises multiple uncertainties via probability distributions and propagates these uncertainties to explore tradeoffs in cost effective energy transition scenarios. A linked global sensitivity analysis is used to explore the uncertainties that have most impact on the transition. The analysis highlights the strong impact of uncertainty on delivering the required emission reductions, and the need for an appropriate carbon price. Biomass availability, gas prices and nuclear capital costs emerge as critical uncertainties in delivering emission reductions. Further developing this approach for policy requires an iterative process to ensure a complete understanding and representation of different uncertainties in meeting mitigation policy objectives.

Accountability is promoted by both the UK government's environmental policy for housing design the Code for Sustainable Homes and local councils in their planning criteria. These accountability practices are key to how relationships between housing professionals and local planning authorities influence practices and outcomes of environmental sustainability. In this article, we examine how accountability is performed in housing design and development. We argue that accountability practices involve the management of making environmental sustainability visible through demonstrating the utilization of sustainable technologies. We contend that these 'visibility' practices are carried out to the detriment of an appreciation of how energy is both provided and consumed. We contend that using the installation phase of sustainable technologies as a point of adequate assessment of the environmental effectiveness of a building is short-sighted. Policy needs to look beyond this, and consult with professionals who develop and sell houses to understand better their working priorities and contexts that shape the provision of renewable energy in the planning phase and post-build.

A methodological contribution,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Cost of energy; Forecast accuracy; Electricity; Energy scenarios,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Forecasts of the cost of energy are typically presented as point estimates; however forecasts are seldom accurate, which makes it important to understand the uncertainty around these point estimates. The scale of the differences between forecasts and outturns (i.e. contemporary estimates) of costs may have important implications for government decisions on the appropriate form (and level) of support, modelling energy scenarios or industry investment appraisal. This paper proposes a methodology to assess the accuracy of cost forecasts. We apply this to levelised costs of energy for different generation technologies due to the availability of comparable forecasts and contemporary estimates, however the same methodology could be applied to the components of levelised costs, such as capital costs. The estimated forecast errors capture the accuracy of previous forecasts and can provide objective bounds to the range around current forecasts for such costs. The results from applying this method are illustrated using publicly available data for on- and off-shore wind, Nuclear and CCGT technologies, revealing the possible scale of forecast errors for these tedmologies.

Improving energy efficiency proves an effective way to reduce energy consumption in transport sector, whereas its effectiveness may be affected by the rebound effect. This paper proposes a dynamic panel quantile regression model to estimate the direct energy rebound effect for road passenger transport in the whole country, eastern, central and western China, respectively, based on the data of 30 provinces from 2003 to 2012. The empirical results reveal that, first of all, the direct rebound effect does exist for road passenger transport and on the whole country, the short-term and long-term direct rebound effects are 25.53% and 26.56% on average, respectively. Second, the direct rebound effect for road passenger transport in central and eastern China tends to decrease, increase and then decrease again, whereas that in western China decreases and then increases, with the increasing passenger kilometers. Finally, when implementing energy efficiency policy in road passenger transport sector, the effectiveness of energy conservation in western China proves much better than that in central China overall, while the effectiveness in central China is relatively better than that in eastern China.

We examine the role of specialization in driving these trade patterns by conducting a spatial index decomposition analysis on the embodied energy in net exports for 41 economies. The results reveal that industrialized countries have generally offshored energy intensive production, which many developing countries specialize in. We find that specialization, on average, makes the biggest contribution, accounting for roughly 50% of a country's embodied energy in net exports. However, other factors, namely energy intensity and the trade balance, combine to make an equally important contribution. In summary, specialization, despite its significant role, is not the only cause of the embodied energy trade patterns observed between industrialized and developing countries. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyze the time-evolution of radiative forcing from both natural gas and coal-based electricity generation by calculating average radiative forcing over an interval of time from greenhouse gas emissions under a range of assumptions for fugitive methane leakage, electricity generation efficiency, and delays in the adoption of near-zero carbon technologies. We find that leakage rates of between 5.2% and 9.9% are required for natural gas to result in greater mean forcing than coal over the next 100 years. We show that natural gas infrastructure with modest leakage could remain in place for 1.5-2.4 times the time interval that coal generation would have persisted prior to replacement with near-zero carbon technologies before the climate benefits of replacing coal with natural gas are negated. Natural gas can serve a viable bridge away from coal-based generation if avoiding longer-term climate impacts is prioritized, fugitive methane emissions are minimized, and the large-scale transition to near-zero carbon alternatives is unlikely to happen in the near-term.

We review econometric growth analyses that do not weigh the production factors capital, labor, and energy by their cost shares. Their reproduction of economic growth in Germany, Japan, and the USA during the second half of 20th century is good. According to these analyses, energy's output elasticity, which measures its economic power, is much larger than energy's share in total factor cost, while for labor's output elasticity and cost share the opposite is true. This is consistent with profit and welfare optimization, if hitherto ignored technological constraints are taken into account. Computing the motion of the German industrial sector in its cost mountain, employing empirical data on factor quantities and prices, supports these results. The pivotal role of energy in economic growth provides leverage to energy policies that care about social well being and climate stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To address the endogeneity, we exploit the presence of additional variables. Like conventional instrumental variables, these variables are correlated with the endogenous regressor. However, unlike conventional instrumental variables, they also have direct effects on the outcome, and thus are invalid instruments. Our novel identifying assumption is that the direct effects of these invalid instruments are uncorrelated with the effects of the instruments on the endogenous regressor. We show that in this case the limited-information-maximum-likelihood (liml) estimator is no longer consistent, but that a modification of the bias-corrected two-stage-least-square (tsls) estimator is consistent.

We recommend that empirical researchers carry out such tests and compare estimates based on liml and the modified version of bias-corrected tsls.

However, the UK has one of the least developed heat pump markets in Europe and renewable heat output from heat pumps will need to increase by a factor of 50 over the next 15 years to be in line with the scenario. Therefore, this paper explores what lessons the UK might learn from Finland to achieve this aim considering that its current level of heat pump penetration is comparable with that outlined in the CCC scenario for 2030. Despite the two countries' characteristic differences we argue they share sufficient similarities for the UK to usefully draw some policy-based lessons from Finland including: stimulating new-build construction and renovation of existing stock; incorporating renewable heat solutions in building energy performance standards; and bringing the cost of heat pumps in-line with gas fired heating via a combination of subsidies, taxes and energy RD&D. Finally, preliminary efforts to grow the heat pump market could usefully focus on properties unconnected to the gas-grid, considering these are typically heated by relatively expensive oil or electric heating technologies.

Based on city-level data, this paper analyzes the enabling factors and barriers to China's NGV development. We find that a shortage in natural gas supply and a relatively high price ratio of natural gas compared to gasoline are the main factors impeding China's NGV development. Imbalanced development between natural gas refueling stations and NGVs also hinder the popularity of these lower-carbon vehicles. While various policies have been implemented in recent years to promote NGVs in China, only those encouraging adoption of NGVs by the private sector appear effective. To promote further NGV development in China, the following strategies are proposed: (1) improve natural gas delivery infrastructure across the country; (2) reasonably reduce the relative price of natural gas compared to gasoline; (3) give priority to middle-income and medium-sized cities and towns, since siting natural gas refueling stations is easier in these areas; and (4) promote the use of NGVs in the private sector.

Major political parties, including the Green party of the coalition-government have recently strongly advocated for a policy to decommission the Swedish nuclear fleet prematurely. Here we examine the environmental, health and (to a lesser extent) economic impacts of implementing such a plan. The process has already been started through the early shutdown of the Barseback plant. We estimate that the political decision to shut down Barseback has resulted in similar to 2400 avoidable energy-production-related deaths and an increase in global CO2 emissions of 95 million tonnes to date (October 2014). The Swedish reactor fleet as a whole has reached just past its halfway point of production, and has a remaining potential production of up to 2100 TWh. The reactors have the potential of preventing 1.9-2.1 gigatonnes of future CO2-emissions if allowed to operate their full life-spans. The potential for future prevention of energy-related-deaths is 50,000-60,000. We estimate an 800 billion SEK (120 billion USD) lower-bound estimate for the lost tax revenue from an early phase-out policy. In sum, the evidence shows that implementing a 'nuclear-free' policy for Sweden (or countries in a similar situation) would constitute a highly retrograde step for climate, health and economic protection.

Traditionally, such out-of-sample forecasts have been largely judgmental, making them difficult to replicate and justify. An alternative is the use of real-time econometric oil price forecasting models. We investigate the merits of constructing combinations of six such models. Forecast combinations have received little attention in the oil price forecasting literature to date. We demonstrate that over the last 20years suitably constructed real-time forecast combinations would have been systematically more accurate than the no-change forecast at horizons up to 6 quarters or 18 months. The MSPE reductions may be as high as 12% and directional accuracy as high as 72%. The gains in accuracy are robust over time. In contrast, the EIA oil price forecasts not only tend to be less accurate than no-change forecasts, but are much less accurate than our preferred forecast combination. Moreover, including EIA forecasts in the forecast combination systematically lowers the accuracy of the combination forecast. We conclude that suitably constructed forecast combinations should replace traditional judgmental forecasts of the price of oil.","[Baumeister, Christiane] Bank Canada, Int Econ Anal Dept, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada; [Kilian, Lutz] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Bank of Canada; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Baumeister, C (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Int Econ Anal Dept, 234 Laurier Ave West, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",CBaumeister@bankofcanada.ca; lkilian@umich.edu,,,,,,,27,154,163,4,83,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

Identifying the location advantages that predict the repeat investment behaviour of foreign subsidiaries although important has not been studied in any systematic manner. Using a sample of 356 foreign subsidiaries operating in Australia, a multiple regression model is used to test the relationship between the location advantages and repeat investment across both national (Australia) and regional (New South Wales and Victoria) spatial domains. The different location advantages found to be predictive of repeat investment suggest that reliance in the literature on location being synonymous with the national domain is inadequate. The findings highlight the need for domain-specific policy responses if governments are to encourage repeat investment at the regional level.","Monash Univ, Dept Management, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia",Monash University,"Kalfadellis, P (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Management, 26 Sir John Monash Dr, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",paul.kalfadellis@monash.edu,,,,,,,109,2,2,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In this study, we propose a novel data-driven approach that uses symbolic regression to model oil production. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real data, and the results prove that symbolic regression could effectively identify the true models beneath the oil production data and also make reliable predictions. Symbolic regression indicates that world oil production will peak in 2021, which broadly agrees with other techniques used by researchers. Our results also show that the rate of decline after the peak is almost half the rate of increase before the peak, and it takes nearly 12 years to drop 4% from the peak.

A methodology for determining the minimum level of performance required for a parameter to have a statistically significant impact on CO2 abatement cost is developed and used to evaluate the impact of eight key parameters of low carbon energy supply technologies on the cost of CO2 abatement. The capital cost of nuclear technology is found to have the greatest impact of the parameters studied. The cost of biomass and CCS technologies also have impacts, while their efficiencies have little, if any. Sensitivity analysis of the results with respect to population, GDP, and CO2 emission constraint show that the minimum performance level and impact of nuclear technologies is consistent across the socioeconomic scenarios studied, while the other technology parameters show different performance under higher population, lower GDP scenarios. Solar technology was found to have a small impact, and then only at very low costs. These results indicate that the cost of nuclear is the single most important driver of abatement cost, and that trading efficiency for cost may make biomass and CCS technologies more competitive.

However, the European supply situation, regulation and infrastructure have changed, with better diversified import sources, EU member states being better connected and a common regulation on the security of supply has been introduced. Nevertheless, European dependency on natural gas remained high. This paper investigates different Russian natural gas export disruptions scenarios and analyses short- and long-term reactions in Europe. We use the Global Gas Model (GGM), a large-scale mixed complementarity representation of the natural gas sector with a high level of technical granularity with respect to storage and transportation infrastructure. While we find that most of the EU member states are not severely affected by Russian disruptions, some East European countries are very vulnerable. Prioritizing the removal of infrastructure bottlenecks is critical for securing a sufficient natural gas supply to all EU member states. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using CALGAPS, a new, validated model simulating GHG and criteria pollutant emissions in California from 2010 to 2050, four scenarios were developed: Committed Policies (S1), Uncommitted Policies (S2), Potential Policy and Technology Futures (S3), and Counterfactual (SO), which omits all GHG policies. Forty-nine individual policies were represented. For S1-S3, GHG emissions fall below the AB 32 policy 2020 target [427 million metric tons CO2 equivalent (MtCO(2)e) yr(-1)], indicating that committed policies may be sufficient to meet mandated reductions. In 2030, emissions span 211-428 MtCO(2)e yr(-1), suggesting that policy choices made today can strongly affect outcomes over the next two decades. Long-term (2050) emissions were all well above the target set by Executive Order S-3-05 (85 MtCO2e yr(-1)); additional policies or technology development (beyond the study scope) are likely needed to achieve this objective. Cumulative emissions suggest a different outcome, however: due to early emissions reductions, S3 achieves lower cumulative emissions in 2050 than a pathway that linearly reduces emissions between 2020 and 2050 policy targets. Sensitivity analysis provided quantification of individual policy GHG emissions reduction benefits. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Empirical accounts reveal how difficult such coordination often is due to contradictory views involved. How can we better understand related processes of searching and negotiation? What does this mean for the organization of decision making processes regarding long-term infrastructural change? We analyze a conflict which erupted in Freiburg, Germany when two strategies of reducing environmental impacts of space heating were to be applied in the Vauban 'model district': A) Efficient co-generation of heat and power (CHP) combined with district heating systems (DHS), and B) Reducing heat demand by low-energy designs and ambitious energy standards ('passive house standard'). In order to understand the politics of infrastructure development, we unravel 1) enabling factors and driving forces of the conflict, 2) normative content of opposing viewpoints, 3) resources tapped into for settling the disagreement, and 4) the institutional setup of such decision making about energy policy priorities in the municipality. We reflect on implications of such a perspective on how policies and how governance arrangements should ideally be shaped and take a brief outlook on further research needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The empirical results suggest the presence of spatial occupational neighbourhoods and a clear north-south divide in self-employment when the entire sample is considered; however, spatial variation in the non-agriculture sector disappears to a large extent when individual factors that influence self-employment choice are explicitly controlled.

Member States without any legislation regarding board-level representation often argue that introducing such participatory rights would become an obstacle to the freedom of establishment and, in addition, would hinder the performance of companies. There is no proof that giving workers the right to participate would have catastrophic results, because Member States with strong participation schemes have strong position in the global and European market.

Problem statement: The officer was clearly affected by both parallel and analog stressors both before and during his tour abroad. Sources of Evidence: When the officer returned home he revealed an over-determined reaction while being a passenger in a car. The officer clearly lacked an ability to process the accumulated stress that had been built up during many years, both in civilian life and as a result of taking part in several military operations abroad. His over-determined reaction may have been caused by a lack of mental preparation before and during his last mission as well as a lack of coping skills. Main Argument: This may have allowed the residual from different previous experiences and experiences from his latest mission to build up until his reaction became over-determined. Another possible explanation is that the officer did not have time to try to cope with the things that happened during his mission abroad. Conclusion: Although not much happened to the officer during his last mission abroad, he had a lot of fantasies and strong feelings attached to the mission after returning home. After a few weeks at home these fantasies and feelings slowly disappeared and the officer returned to a normal life.

The agreement has implications for the energy policies of all countries, not least major coal exporters like Australia. By contrast, the government's 2015 Energy White Paper lays out the vision for the country's future as a global energy superpower dominated by the export of fossil fuels for decades to come. Legislative frameworks around planning, land use, mining, heritage and environment have moved in synchrony with this agenda. Rural landowners in the big coal rich geological basins of Australia are directly impacted by current government policies on energy exports and on domestic supply. This article follows the coal value chain to rural communities in New South Wales where new mines are being built, and analyses the politics of land use, natural resources and energy from the vantage point of landowner engagement with government and corporations in the policy, legislative and regulatory domains. The need for more equitable, democratic and precautionary approaches to energy policy, heritage and environmental planning and agricultural land use is highlighted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study employs annual time series data of domestic oil consumption, real GDP, and oil price for the period 1966-2012. The empirical results indicate that both the income and price elasticities are in line with the theoretical expectations. However, the income elasticity is statistically significant while the price elasticity is statistically insignificant. The relatively high value of income elasticity (1.182) from this study suggests that crude oil import in Turkey is more responsive to changes in income level. This result indicates that imported crude oil is a normal good and rising income levels will foster higher consumption of oil based equipments, vehicles and services by economic agents. The estimated income elasticity of 1.182 suggests that imported crude oil consumption grows at a higher rate than income. This in turn reduces oil intensity over time. Therefore, crude oil import during the estimation period is substantially driven by income. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the first period, we observed that the domestication of energy resulted in an energy culture emphasizing comfort and convenience with respect to everyday life and the abundant supply of clean hydropower. In the second period, this culture seemed to have changed, making households more concerned about their energy consumption. Consumption of energy was linked to climate change, and many interviewees claimed to save energy. However, the dominant expectation was still to be able to manage everyday life in a convenient and comfortable way. Thus, climate change concerns produced some but not very radical changes in the practical domestication of energy, including energy saving. A main effect was feelings of guilt, tempered by arguments regarding why change is difficult and complaints about political inaction. Thus, public engagement with climate change issues may facilitate energy efficiency policy but to succeed, wider climate policy measures seem to be needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It contributes to the current discussion of the NMM in three aspects. First, this article attempts to streamline ideas about the NMM. The term NMM is considered to be an umbrella concept for emission trading systems which all Parties can engage in on a voluntary basis in the implementation of their intended nationally determined contributions, and which need to satisfy three criteria: (i) having a large scale scope; (ii) aiming to facilitate a net emission reduction; (iii) allowing flexibility for the host country. We also present a framework to clarify the NMM. Based on this framework, major options with a high implementation potential are identified. Second, we argue that the national-level operational framework determines the chance of successful implementation of the NMM. We identify different options based on a literature survey and evaluate them with respect to effectiveness and efficiency. Third, we choose China, a highly influential country regarding climate change polices, as a case to analyze the potential contributions and challenges of the NMM and its implementation at different stages of national development.

By estimating the model using panel data from the Mexican Migration Project, I find that Mexican migrants place substantial value on amenities in the United States, which are shown to fall precipitously with migrants' age. Simulation results from policy experiments indicate that Mexican immigrants are more responsive to a policy that reduces the amenity values related to unauthorized US residence than to an increase in the number of border patrol officers.","[Hong, Gihoon] Indiana Univ, Judd Leighton Sch Business & Econ, 1700 Mishawaka Ave, South Bend, IN 46634 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University South Bend,"Hong, G (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Judd Leighton Sch Business & Econ, 1700 Mishawaka Ave, South Bend, IN 46634 USA.",honggi@iusb.edu,,,Bankard Fund for Political Economy at the University of Virginia,Bankard Fund for Political Economy at the University of Virginia,"I am grateful to Steven Stern, Leora Friedberg, and John McLaren for their guidance and support.

Renewable energy (RE) technologies could thus have reached grid parity in various SIDS. Furthermore, the abundance of resources such as solar and wind provides ample potential for SIDS to switch from high cost diesel generators to renewables. Despite favourable conditions, RE remains a largely underinvested sector in these regions. This paper aims to undercover the reasons why grid parity does not necessary translate into private sector investments in RE. With a focus on SIDS, this paper presents an evidence that achieving grid parity based on LCOE estimates is an incomplete benchmark for decision making in the power generation industry. In particular, LCOE and grid parity do not take into account financing constraints of RE projects which are often more pronounced compared to conventional forms of power generation. This paper thus presents the business perspective of RE projects, by employing a discounted cashflow model that includes various profitability metrics and effects of taxation and depreciation. The study shows that financing conditions exert strong influence on the economic feasibility of solar projects, both in LCOE terms and profitability terms. Thus, key policies should be targeted at improving financing conditions to ensure mobilization of private sector finances in solar PV. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We suggest using a statistical model for the data as a device through which it is possible to adapt the econometric specification of the New Keynesian model such that the risk of omitting important propagation mechanisms is kept under control. A pseudo-structural form is built from the baseline system of Euler equations by forcing the state vector of the system to have the same dimension as the state vector characterizing the statistical model. The pseudo-structural formgives rise to a set of cross-equation restrictions that do not penalize the autocorrelation structure and persistence of the data. Standard estimation and evaluation methods can be used.

This study evaluates solar oven usage and wood consumption in northern Nicaragua during both the rainy and dry seasons, using surveys, temperature dataloggers, and direct measurements of fuelwood use. Solar oven owners reported usage on 79% of days during the dry season, and 41% of days during the rainy season. Comparison with oven temperature records confirmed usage on 50% of days during the dry season, and 16% of days during the rainy season. However, wood consumption measurements showed no statistically significant difference between days with solar oven usage and days without, suggesting that frequency of usage alone is not an appropriate proxy for fuel savings. Survey results suggest that a large part of solar oven usage came in addition to biomass cooking, as opposed to replacing it. These results suggest a need for further study of wood consumption in situ and more focus on the specific kinds of foods prepared in solar cookers, as well as local cultural and climatic conditions.

This paper investigates whether or not existing transmission capacities of cross-border interconnectors are sufficient to achieve this result and create vigorous competition in the market. A model with two decision levels is used. On the first level profit maximizing generators play Cournot game against each other. On the last level the system operator clears the market and determines flows in the network to maximize social welfare subject to a set of physical constraints. As each strategic generator anticipates her impact on equilibrium prices and congestion in the system, her optimization problem is subject to equilibrium constraints from the system operator's problem. The analysis demonstrates that interconnector capacities in Western Europe are insufficient for integration alone to reduce the exercise of market power. I compare several possible competition-enhancing policies: expansion of interconnectors and different scenarios of national markets' restructuring. I show that although increase of line capacity is a useful tool to stimulate competition in an integrated market, it is not a substitute for the restructuring of large players. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our study compares the economic returns of shallow water fields in the Gulf of Mexico applying the royalty and taxes due under the fiscal regimes of the U.S. and Mexico. The net present value (NPV) of the base case scenario is US$1.4 billion, assuming standard development and production cost (opex, capex), 10% discount rate accounting for the cost of capital and revenues computed using a reference oil price of $75/bbl. The impact on NPV of oil price volatility is accounted for in a sensitivity analysis. The split of the NPV of shallow water hydrocarbon assets between the two contractual parties, contractor and government, in Mexico and the U.S. is hugely different. Our base case shows that for similar field assets, Mexico's production sharing agreement allocates about $1,150 million to the government and $191 million to the contractor, while under U.S. license conditions the government take is about $700 million and contractor take is $553 million.

We assess whether renewable energy deployment in Europe can provide this triple dividend, at which ambition levels of 2030 RES targets and what the role of the support policy scheme for electricity is. We apply two types of models: a detailed techno-economic sector model of the deployment of RES and two macroeconomic models. Our findings suggest that up to 2030 our triple-dividend hypothesis holds even under a declining role of Europe as technology provider for the rest of the world. Additional emission reductions of up to 1040 Mt CO2, as compared to a baseline scenario in 2030, are possible. Demand for fossil fuels can likewise be reduced due to the deployment of renewable energy sources by up to 150 Mtoe. More ambiguous is the order of magnitude of the effects on GDP and employment, which differs noticeably depending on the economic theory applied in the different models. Nevertheless, both models predict slightly higher GDP and employment in 2030 when implementing ambitious RES targets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

These analyses, however, overlook a source of potentially large indirect emissions from natural gas transportation fuels, namely the emissions from incremental coal-fired generation caused by price-induced substitutions away from natural-gas-fired electricity generation. Because coal-fired generation emits substantially more greenhouse gases and criteria air pollutants than natural-gas-fired generation, this indirect coal-use change effect diminishes potential emissions savings from natural gas transportation fuels. Estimates from a parameterized multi-market model suggest the indirect coal-use change effect rivals in magnitude the indirect land-use change effect of biofuels and renders natural gas fuels as carbon intensive as petroleum fuels.

Using battery on PHEV to arbitrage electricity price is one of the potential benefits to PHEV owners. There is, however, disagreement on the magnitude of such profit. This study uses a stochastic optimization model to estimate the potential profit from electricity price arbitrage of two types of PHEVs (PHEV-10, and PHEV-40) under three scenarios with variant electricity tariff and PHEV owners over a five-year period. The simulation results indicate that under current market structure, even with significant improvement in battery technologies (e.g., higher efficiency, lower cost), the PHEV owners can't achieve a positive arbitrage profit. This finding implies that expected arbitrage profit solely is not a viable option to engage PHEVs larger adoption. Subsidy and combining PHEV arbitraging with alternative PHEV services are required.

Yet, its regional implications have received only limited attention. The highly cited seminal paper of Plane and Jurjevich (Prof Geogr 61(1):4-20, 2009) was demonstrated in a novel manner on the basis of US Census data that, when interregional migration flows are disaggregated by age, radically different patterns of net population redistribution are observable in the sense of upward and downward movements within the urban hierarchy of the USA. This study aims to demonstrate how interregional migration flows play out in a different geographic setting by replicating the methodological approach of Plane and Jurjevich (2009) in the case of the Netherlands, a country with a very different urban system and spatial population pattern to the USA. Our aim was to identify whether the differing geographical context leads to different upward and downward movements. The most notably marked flows or 'demographically effective' flows in the Netherlands are the movements made by young adults and older adults aged 75 and over. We also observe recently emerging differences in the migration patterns of retirees, with the '75 and older' age cohort oriented towards smaller towns and rural areas, while the '65-74' age cohort are increasingly oriented towards urban areas. In addition, we comment on the possible consequences of these differing patterns of age-articulated interregional flows when allied with the emerging demographic changes.","[de Jong, Petra A.; Brouwer, Aleid E.; McCann, Philip] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Geog, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"de Jong, PA (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Geog, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",p.a.de.jong@rug.nl,"McCann, Philip/C-6307-2013","Brouwer, Aleid/0000-0003-4024-5478",,,,,63,13,13,3,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Intermittency generates spikes in production, which need to be curtailed when exceeding consumption. Dispersion means electricity has to be transported over long distances between production and consumption sites. In the Directive 2009/28/EC, the European Commission recommends sustainable and effective measures to prevent curtailments and facilitate transportation of renewable electricity. This article explores the material constraints of storing and transporting surplus renewable electricity by conversion into synthetic methane. Europe is considered for its mix of energy technologies, data availability and multiple energy pathways to 2050. Results show that the requirements for key materials and land remain relatively low, respecting the recommendations of the EU Commission. By 2050, more than 6 million tons of carbon dioxide might be transformed into methane annually within the EU. The efficiency of renewable power methane production is also compared to the natural process of converting solar into chemical energy (i.e. photosynthesis), both capturing and reenergizing carbon dioxide. Overall, the production of renewable methane (including carbon dioxide capture) is more efficient and less material intensive than the production of biofuels derived from photosynthesis and biomass conversion.

Part of this deficit is arguably inherent to the process, whereas another part is caused by current risk information shortfalls on the processes and impacts associated with development. In the short and long terms, there are several conventional and unconventional methods by which industry level and governmental-level policy can insure against these risks. Whilst academic attention has been afforded to the potential risks associated with unconventional natural gas development, little consideration has been given to the lack of insurance opportunities against these risks or to the additional risks promulgated by the dearth of insurance options. We chronicle the ways in which insurance options are limited due to unconventional gas development, the problems caused by lack of insurance offerings, and we highlight potential policy remedies for addressing these gaps, including a range of government and industry-specific approaches.

For our assessment, we followed a qualitative approach, due to a lack of data. We reviewed the mix of policy instruments and used stakeholder surveys and interviews. We found that energy use is not very likely to decline fast enough to achieve the Dutch policy targets for 2020. For new buildings, the policy mix works well, but its contribution to the policy targets is limited. For non-residential buildings the current Act, which obliges enterprises to take cost-effective measures, could be enforced to a greater degree. For privately owned homes a more compelling policy is needed. An alternative policy option would be to make taxation dependent on the energy label of residential houses. This would stimulate residents to take action while retaining the desired autonomy. For rental housing, binding agreements between municipalities and housing corporations may lead to more energy saving measures. Finally, we conclude that the Dutch energy tax is an important pillar of the current policy. It provides higher cost-effectiveness of energy saving measures and legitimates more strict energy efficiency standards. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Focusing on France, this paper uses monthly data from January 2010 to November 2014, to study the challenge of the simultaneous integration of various sources of generation, and their relationship with economic growth. For the analysis of the dynamics of interaction between electricity sources, the auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test approach was shown to be appropriate, as it allows short- and long-run effects to be distinguished. The results showed that nuclear energy has been a huge driver of economic growth in France and, at the same time, leads to an environment with lower CO2 emissions. Renewables were shown to exert a negative effect on economic growth, which could be due to lack of investment in other sources of production, due to the resilient position held by nuclear sources. The substitution effect among sources is noticeable. The robustness of the results was checked using annual data, from 1970 until 2012, and the results were comparable to those from the monthly data.

The main results are: (1) energy consumption intensity plays a more important role than carbon emission density (CD) for a rapid decrease in CI during the research period, so a much room is left for a significant CD reduction through carbon emission reduction technology, energy structural reduction, and energy consumption proportional reduction. (2) The decrease in energy consumption technology and energy structure in secondary industries contributes the most reduction in energy consumption intensity. (3)The energy consumption proportions of secondary and tertiary industries are the two most important drivers to decrease CD.

As a result, the emphasis can be placed on the efficiency of budgetary processes. To evaluate the budgetary performance a series of financial-economic indicators can be used in order to quantify the method in which financial resources are used, as well as producing a plan for their application.

Methods Assumption was rested on the qualitative interview and theoretical research, and then regression analysis was adopted to analyze the mutual relationship among variables and verifies these assumptions. Results The point of external disturbance force of the village clinic doctors was 3.39 +/- 0.46, including 3.31 +/- 0.35 of disturbance from job, and 3.45 +/- 0.59 of disturbance from environment. The point of resilient of village clinic doctors was 3.43 +/- 0.40, the instrumental support was 2.57 +/- 0.59, the emotional support was 3.83 +/- 0.57, and the competency was 3.87 +/- 0.47. The village clinic doctors' vulnerability index was 0.50 +/- 0.06, which was in the moderate level on the whole. The regression coefficient of vulnerability to turnover and professional identity are 0.351 and -0.598; the regression coefficient of professional identity to turnover intention is -0.458; the regression coefficient of interaction between autonomy and professional identity to turnover was -0.517. Conclusion Vulnerability has a significant positive effect on the turnover intention of village clinic doctors, which is mainly through the role of professional identity.

With Kosovo's economic development, an increasing population has developed many branches of industry that have polluted the rivers with heavy metals, such as the Trepca' mine, and the treatment of agriculture products with pesticides and herbicides. The eutrophication of lakes transitions the metals from agricultural products causing ecological imbalance. Uncontrolled exploitation of natural resources, irresponsible treatment (industrial waste and sewage), has caused contamination above the permitted ecosystem thresholds for toxic elements, such as: Hg, Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Ni, and Mn. Heavy metals in natural waters that are unpolluted are in low concentration (approximately 1 mu g/l); some are essential for enzymatic reactions in living organisms. Increased concentrations as a result of industrial activities often exceed the allowable limit, causing serious changes to ecosystems, including tourist areas, and to living organisms in aquatic ecosystems. Ecological preservation of ecosystems from heavy metals is vital for the environment, food security, and protecting ecological habitats, and this represent an economic cost for the Republic of Kosovo.","[Dreshaj, Adem; Millaku, Bedri; Selimaj, Afrim; Kelmendi, Muhamet] Univ Haxhi Zeka, Peja, Kosovo; [Feka, Fidan] Univ Hasan Pristina, Pristina, Kosovo",,"Dreshaj, A (通讯作者)，Univ Haxhi Zeka, Peja, Kosovo.",adem.dreshaj@unhz.eu,"Millaku, Bedri/ABF-9740-2021; , Adem/E-3554-2017",,,,,,9,1,1,0,9,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,48,55,,10.12955/cbup.v4.743,0.0,,,8,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000010,0

The data and information are used by many companies as a source for creating knowledge in their sphere of business. The important part of the knowledge creating process is both adequate amount of relevant data, and an ability to transform this data to information. Various technologies are helpful, such as Big Data technology. Mostly big companies with sufficiency of money dispose of Big Data by reason of its complexity and significant expenses in terms of maintenance, specialized staff, technology infrastructure etc. Constantly changing demands of customers together with a strong competitive environment is forcing companies to innovate, for instance by designing new products, improving internal processes, or implementing new technologies. By obtaining such innovation is very helpful cooperation with research and development (R&D) institutions from academia. Universities are in a large extent dealing with R&D activities, on which companies don't have capacities, but the results from these R&D activities are for companies interesting and mostly usable in practice. The purpose of this paper is following findings obtained from analysis of the knowledge transfer and Big Data theory finding and describing the possibility of connecting these two areas in practice. The paper is focusing on knowledge transfer creation within cooperation of companies and universities through access for university to company's database during contract research with usage of Big Data.

A friendly business environment has a positive effect on job formation, thus helping with employment. A country encourages formation and development of large enterprises through various incentives that reduce regional disparities, especially in less-developed regions. Nevertheless, a huge majority of enterprises in the European Union are small- and medium-sized. Self-employed persons are considered a specific form of business. Their activity is strongly influenced by state policy. This paper analyzes the business environment in regions of the Slovak Republic. Its principal aim is to examine the development of regional disparities and the related quality of citizens' lives.

This connection is a dynamic link that is profitable for all parties involved. Currently, about 40% of the activity and profit is due to worldwide business travel and the event industry. This paper aims to highlight the efficient role of tourism events through the dynamic Convention Bureau, at both the international and Romanian level, in terms of global economic growth. We found from the study of this activity sector that one of the important directions of innovation and raising the competitiveness of the tourist offer of any country is given the additional service diversification by stimulating tourism dynamics of events. The advantages and benefits that may be mentioned in business events tourism are revenues from services such as accommodation, facilities conference, catering, leisure, transport and entertainment.

The UK government has put in place a raft of new policies that seek to promote new, low carbon investment and ensure security of supply. The traditional channel for financing the sector has been through large utility companies, but this now looks challenging for various reasons. The UK therefore offers an interesting case study on several counts; the scale of the challenge, effectiveness of new policies, and the availability of alternative finance. We find that the link between the finance sector and the electricity sector is not 'broken', but the flow of money to the sector is threatened by the current weakness of the utilities' business model. This paper compares estimates of the scale of investment required in the UK with historical investment rates. It summarises contemporary finance industry views of conditions and trends, and potential policy interventions that might be needed to bridge the investment gap. The potential for channelling institutional investor funds directly into energy assets is reviewed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In an economy with two areas, namely the center and suburb, households with different ethnic characteristics (termed the majority and minority), both of which have identical skill levels, endogenously choose their residential location in the long run. By analyzing stable residential equilibria, we show that, because of their ethnic clustering preferences, minority residents are more likely to cluster in one area than majority residents. In addition, when the commuting cost is low, minority residents always cluster, widening the population gap between areas. At the same time, majority households migrate to a less crowded area to avoid the residential congestion caused by minority clustering, thus reducing the population gap. In this sense, the majority acts as an equalizer of population sizes between the center and suburb under low commuting costs.","[Nakagawa, Mariko] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Nakagawa, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",mariko.ravenna@gmail.com,,,"Ministry of Education, Science and Culture in Japan [13J10130]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [13J10130] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Science and Culture in Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I would like to thank Takatoshi Tabuchi for the thoughtful comments and suggestions.

The papers add to the understanding of the geography of innovation and entrepreneurship by suggesting alternative ways of identifying spillovers, combing and integrating internal and external knowledge sources, and by estimating the impact on innovation, new firm formation and growth.","[Backman, Mikaela] Jonkoping Int Buisness Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Loof, Hans] Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Backman, M (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Buisness Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden.",mikaela.backman@ju.se; hans.loof@indek.kth.se,"Lööf, Hans/C-2137-2017; Lööf, Hans/AAN-5394-2020","Lööf, Hans/0000-0002-5871-8571;",,,,,8,15,18,3,59,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The data also include the smallest firms, which have been largely neglected in the existing literature on innovations. In the context of collaboration, however, small firms are of particular interest because external interactions and joint projects can be expected to play a very central role in innovation processes in firms where internal resources are very limited. The results show that the probability of innovation is higher among collaborating firms, yet not all types of collaborations matter. Extra-regional collaborations appear as most important in promoting firm innovation, and collaboration seems to be most favourable when the partners involved have some organizational or knowledge relatedness. Small firms, in particular, seem to gain from such extra-regional linkages.","[Bjerke, Lina; Johansson, Sara] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden",Jonkoping University,"Bjerke, L (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Box 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden.",Lina.Bjerke@ju.se; sara.johansson@ju.se,,"Bjerke, Lina/0000-0002-1221-1054",,,,,55,29,32,0,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Applying a data-driven independent component analysis, it shows how the regional dynamics of economic, research, innovation and educational activities affect each other instantaneously and over time. By matching differently classified data on employees, patents and graduates, the analysis is based on a unique database which embraces multi-dimensional aspects for five clearly separated industries. The findings on how industry specific growth processes unfold are explained by referring to the type of industry and its knowledge base. For instance, it is found that more engineering-oriented industries like machine tools show a success-driven pattern, whereas science-based industries show a stronger dependence on universities. Such knowledge on the causal relations is of utmost relevance to the design and implementation of policy instruments.","[Brenner, Thomas; Duschl, Matthias] Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Geog, D-35032 Marburg, Germany",Philipps University Marburg,"Brenner, T (通讯作者)，Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Geog, Deutschhausstr 10, D-35032 Marburg, Germany.",thomas.brenner@staff.uni-marburg.de; matthias.duschl@staff.uni-marburg.de,,,,,,,91,4,4,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

In order to rank possible measures marginal abatement cost curves have become a tool to graphically represent the relationship between abatement costs and emission reduction. This paper demonstrates how to derive marginal abatement cost curves for well-to-wheel GHG emissions of the transport sector considering the full energy provision chain and the interlinkages and interdependencies within the energy system. Presented marginal abatement cost curves visualize substitution effects between measures for different marginal mitigation costs. The analysis makes use of an application of the energy system model generator TIMES for South Africa (TIMES-GEECO). For the example of Gauteng province, this study exemplary shows that the transport sector is not the first sector to address for cost-efficient reduction of GHG emissions. However, the analysis also demonstrates that several options are available to mitigate transport related GHG emissions at comparable low marginal abatement costs.

Numerous empirical studies in various sectors suggest that there are cost-effective measures that are available but not always implemented due to existence of barriers to energy efficiency. Several cost-effective energy efficient options (technologies for new and existing ships and operations) have also been identified for improving energy efficiency of ships. This paper is one of the first to empirically investigate barriers to energy efficiency in the shipping industry using a novel framework and multidisciplinary methods to gauge implementation of cost-effective measures, perception on barriers and observations of barriers. It draws on findings of a survey conducted of shipping companies, content analysis of shipping contracts and analysis of energy efficiency data. Initial results from these methods suggest the existence of the principal agent problem and other market failures and barriers that have also been suggested in other sectors and industries. Given this finding, policies to improve implementation of energy efficiency in shipping need to be carefully considered to improve their efficacy and avoid unintended consequences.

The role of organized crime is a largely unexplored factor. Crime organizations such as the mafia are known to collude with local institutions to control waste markets. As a result, legal forms of waste disposal and socially preferable management options are often undermined primarily through an influence on policy enforcement. Given its high regional heterogeneity and local 'waste crises', Italy provides a compelling case for the study of crime's effects on local waste performance. Panel econometric analyses show that sorted collection of recyclable waste and legal forms of waste disposal are lower when the mafia's effect on the actions of local governments is more intense.

The study is performed, employing a dynamic high time-resolution optimal power generation mix model which is formulated as a large-scale linear programming model. Simulation results show that both complete nuclear phase-out and carbon reduction by 80% in 2050 from 2010 encourage VR expansion in the country's power system and cause a quadruple increase of power generation cost at 2050 compared with that under current nuclear capacity and no carbon regulation policy; long-term cost reduction of VR energy system is necessary if VR is positioned as a mainstream for future sustainable power supply. Secondly, higher levels of VR integration decrease the capacity factor of LNG combined cycle (LNGCC), which implies the challenge to assure LNGCC serving as a remunerated ramp generator for VR intermittency. Finally, as an economically optimal solution, electricity saving serves as an important option to integrate massive VR and to treat a seasonal imbalance of its power output in an efficient way.

It has the potential to increase the sustainability of the energy system and to help deal with supply problems. However, several factors make the future of biomethane production complex and uncertain, such as resource availability, demand, capacity installation, profitability and the competition between the biomethane and electricity sectors for sharing the available biogas and biomass resources. In this research, we study the dynamics of the Dutch biomethane production and analyze the effects of subsidization policy with a system dynamics model. The policy is tested under uncertainty with respect to three conflicting objectives, namely maximizing production and emission reduction, and minimizing costs. According to the results, the subsidization is crucial to develop biomethane production, and the performance of the policy is enhanced in terms of robustness and of meeting all three objectives satisfactorily when the policy is implemented for a long time, with relatively low subsidy prices. Besides, the subsidization policy is found to be most vulnerable to the producers' uncertain investment response to profitability. In future research, different policy options such as subsidizing other biomass-based renewable energy options and policies affecting the biomethane demand can be tested. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The estimated capital adjustment costs imply that if Chinese firms had faced a lower level of adjustment costs such as in the US, China's aggregate output would be 25% higher.","Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Singapore 637332, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Wu, GL (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore.",guiying.wu@ntu.edu.sg,,"Wu, Guiying Laura/0000-0002-5102-9837",New Silk Road research grant at Nanyang Technological University,New Silk Road research grant at Nanyang Technological University(Nanyang Technological University),I would like to thank the editor and anonymous referees for their constructive suggestions; my former supervisors Steve Bond and Mans Soderbom for their invaluable support and the economists at the Enterprise Analysis Unit of the World Bank for providing the data and explaining the survey.

M. Knowledge neighbourhoods: urban form and evolutionary economic geography, Regional Studies. This paper examines connections between the urban form of neighbourhoods in relation to the evolutionary economic geography of knowledge-intensive industries. The data presented show that firms in 'creative' industries tend to be located in dense, mixed-use neighbourhoods near the city core, while 'science-based' industries tend to be concentrated in low-density, single-use neighbourhoods in the suburbs. It is argued that these spatial patterns are related to the fact that inter-firm networks are more important in the 'creative' industries, while 'science-based' industries rely more heavily on intra-firm interactions and learning.","Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs, Toronto, ON M5S 3K7, Canada",University of Toronto,"Spencer, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs, 1 Devonshire Pl, Toronto, ON M5S 3K7, Canada.",greg.spencer@utoronto.ca,"Spencer, Gregory M/B-8179-2012; CORREA, RENATA/AAA-2417-2022",,Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Ontario Research Fund,Canadian Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for Innovation); Ontario Research Fund,Funding for this research was generously provided by the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and the Ontario Research Fund.,,44,64,71,1,75,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

A conditional frontier approach is proposed to capture the role of the technology gap in explaining labour productivity differences in 211 European regions in eighteen countries over the years 1995-2007. Labour productivity growth is driven by capital accumulation and technical change. In lagging behind regions, productivity growth is mainly driven by capital accumulation. The technology gap does not play a role in driving labour productivity growth and remains stable across regions in the considered period. Cohesion policy seems more effective in terms of fixed investment rather than technological capabilities, while technology gap remains a source of unused potential productivity growth.","[Filippetti, Andrea] Natl Res Council Italy CNR ISSiRFA, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Filippetti, Andrea] Univ London, Dept Management, London, England; [Peyrache, Antonio] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, CEPA, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Studi sui Sistemi Regionali Federali e sulle Autonomie Massimo Severo Giannini (ISSIRFA-CNR); University of London; University of Queensland,"Filippetti, A (通讯作者)，Natl Res Council Italy CNR ISSiRFA, Via Taurini 19, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",andrea.filippetti@cnr.it; a.peyrache@uq.edu.au,,"FILIPPETTI, ANDREA/0000-0002-1182-852X",,,,,35,34,34,5,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This article demonstrates that conventional decompositions, no matter whether linear or nonparametric, are equivalent to assuming a (probably too) simple model of mediation (aimed at assessing causal mechanisms) and may therefore lack causal interpretability. The reason is that decompositions typically control for post-birth variables that lie on the causal pathway from gender/ethnicity (which are determined at or even before birth) to wage but neglect potential endogeneity that may arise from this approach. Based on the newer literature on mediation analysis, we therefore provide more attractive identifying assumptions and discuss nonparametric identification based on reweighting.","Univ Fribourg, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland",University of Fribourg,"Huber, M (通讯作者)，Univ Fribourg, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",martin.huber@unifr.ch,,"Huber, Martin/0000-0002-8590-9402",,,,,46,26,28,0,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

We propose a two-stage procedure that naturally unifies the two existing approaches in the finance literature-the parametric approach and the nonparametric approach. Our combined approach possesses important advantages over both methods. Using our two-stage combined estimator, we derive new test statistics for investigating key hypotheses in the context of conditional factor models. Our tests can be performed on a single asset or jointly across multiple assets. We further propose a novel test to directly check whether the parametric model used in our first stage is correctly specified. Simulations indicate that our estimates and tests perform well in finite samples. In our empirical analysis, we use our new method to examine the performance of the conditional capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which has generated controversial results in the recent asset-pricing literature.","[Li, Yan] Temple Univ, Dept Finance, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Su, Liangjun] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore; [Xu, Yuewu] Fordham Univ, Sch Business, New York, NY 10019 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Singapore Management University; Fordham University,"Li, Y (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Dept Finance, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",liyanlpl@temple.edu; ljsu@smu.edu.sg; yuxu@fordham.edu,"SU, Liangjun/D-1445-2009; Li, Yan/Q-3776-2019","Su, Liangjun/0000-0002-0565-6928",Singapore Ministry of Education for Academic Research Fund [MOE2012-T2-2-021],"Singapore Ministry of Education for Academic Research Fund(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","The authors sincerely thank Rong Chen, the associate editor, and two anonymous referees for their many insightful comments and suggestions that lead to a substantial improvement of this presentation.

Negotiating regional creative economies: academics as expert intermediaries advocating progressive alternatives, Regional Studies. Academics who research the creative economy document and analyse the creative economy while participating in and promoting the creative economy itself. With this in mind, what role is there for academics as expert intermediaries in advocating for progressive alternatives? What kind of creative economy is being implicitly or explicitly promoted? This concluding article draws together threads of research towards a reflection about the role of academics as expert intermediaries. What matters less is that academics are expert intermediaries, and more that this position of privilege is acknowledged and productively negotiated. In the more intimate moments of narrative intermediation, researchers are active agents in making the creative economy 'known', drawing boundaries around the regional context, and translating discourses for and with policy-makers. This is a crucial point of intervention.","Univ Wollongong, Dept Geog & Sustainable Communities, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Gibson, C (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Dept Geog & Sustainable Communities, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",cgibson@uow.edu.au,"Gibson, Chris/A-7733-2011","Gibson, Chris/0000-0002-7242-8255",,,,,16,6,6,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This may affect decision making. This paper analyses the impact these uncertainties may have on investor, developer and policymaker decisions using an Irish case study. Calibrated to data present in the literature, a probabilistic methodology is shown to be an effective means to carry this out. Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) metrics are used to quantify the certainty of achieving a given cost or return on investment. We analyse the certainty of financial return provided by the proposed Irish Feed-in Tariff (FiT) policy. The influence of cost reduction through bulk discount is also discussed, with cost reduction targets for developers identified. Uncertainty is found to have a greater impact on the profitability of smaller installations and those subject to lower rates of cost reduction. This paper emphasises that a premium is required to account for cost uncertainty when setting FiT rates. By quantifying uncertainty, a means to specify an efficient premium is presented.

Yet, the demand for renewable electricity in liberalized markets has developed much more slowly than the demand for other green products. To date, research has mainly examined the willingness to pay for renewable electricity, but limited research has been conducted on the motivations behind it. The concept of identity signaling has proven to play a significant role in consumer behavior for green products. However, (renewable) electricity in the Swedish residential market typically lacks two important drivers for identity signaling: visibility and product involvement. A consumer choice simulation among 434 Swedish households compared consumer choices for renewable electricity contracts. The results show a positive effect of identity signaling on the demand for renewable electricity and yield suggestions for increasing the share of renewable electricity without market distorting measures.

It follows up the UK debate about 'localism'. UK policy localism has been cast as neoliberal, framing communities as competent and competitive actors, morally responsible and accountable for their destiny. In France, the emerging policy localism is surfing on an ongoing political structuration of innovative rural territories - 'Positive Energie Territories' (TEPOS). The paper presents and discusses the results of a rough census (undertaken in 2012) of significant experiences in this domain. It points to a few experiences and depicts them as risky, trial-and-error transcalar processes that endow locally emergent energy issues with a political dimension. To this extent, they amount to a different way of doing energy policy. The analysis points to an ambiguity in French policy localism. This localism may pave the way for an upscaling of the ongoing TEPOS political structuration, or tend to make TEPOS into demonstration territories within a neoliberal RTD policy approach. In the latter case, it may not necessarily fit territories to pursue their political structuration with a view to the energy transition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimating levels and changes (1992-2007) of localizations and colocalizations of selected functions (production, headquarter services, R&D) within 27 West German industries by means of densities, we identify two broad groups of industries. In fragmenting industries, which account for half of manufacturing employment, functions were more clustered with each other than the industry as a whole after the fall of the Iron Curtain but have, in accordance with regional theories of spatial fragmentation, been unbundled spatially from each other subsequently. In integrating industries, by contrast, which account for one-third of manufacturing employment, functions were initially dispersed from each other but have subsequently been rebundled spatially with each other. This spatial rebundling may be a consequence of offshoring, i.e., international fragmentation.","[Bade, Franz-Josef] Univ Dortmund, Fac Spatial Planning, Dept Econ, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany; [Bode, Eckhardt] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Cutrini, Eleonora] Univ Macerata, Dept Law, I-62100 Macerata, Italy",Dortmund University of Technology; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Macerata,"Bode, E (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",franz-josef.bade@uni-dortmund.de; eckhardt.bode@ifw-kiel.de; eleonora.cutrini@unimc.it,"Cutrini, Eleonora/B-7152-2012","Cutrini, Eleonora/0000-0001-7007-6076",,,,,49,3,4,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Due to its island setting, this project is a hybrid between onshore and offshore wind development. An undersea cable would carry the power from Maui County, which has high-quality wind areas, to the population center of Oahu, which has fewer sites for wind power. The project is additionally motivated by Hawaii's high electricity rates, which are nearly three times the national average, and a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) mandating that 40 % of the State's electricity sales be met through renewable sources by the year 2030. Using an economy-wide computable general equilibrium model coupled with a fully dynamic optimization model for the electric sector, we find that the 400- MW wind project increases gross state product by $2.2 billion (in net present value) and average annual per capita income by $60 per year. Although there are potentially near-term welfare losses if there are capital cost overruns, fuel costs are a dominant factor in determining the cost-effectiveness of the project. However, without upgrades to Hawaii's grid and/or its operations, there is a trade-off between investment in wind energy projects and solar PV. If higher levels of intermittent resources cannot be integrated into the system, higher-cost biofuels serve a more prominent role in meeting the RPS. Without upgrades, wind and solar PV generation are restricted, and hence, reduction in GHG emissions in excess of those present without the Big Wind project is negligible. With upgrades, the project is estimated to reduce GHG emissions by an additional from 2020 to 2040.","[Coffman, Makena] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Univ Hawaii Econ Res Org, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Coffman, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Univ Hawaii Econ Res Org, 2424 Maile Way,Saunders 107D, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",makenaka@hawaii.edu; paulbernstein2004@yahoo.com,,,US Department of Energy; Hawaii Natural Energy Institute; University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization; Center for Global Partnership,US Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Hawaii Natural Energy Institute; University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization; Center for Global Partnership,"We thank the two peer reviewers for their constructive comments and feedback.

This can result in water scarcity for different purposes. Besides others, agriculture and river ecosystems can be mentioned as those which can suffer from droughts. The retention of the landscape is therefore still more accented. Increase of landscape retention capacity is considered as a good way to keep water in the landscape which can be then available during dry periods. Despite the most retention capacity consists in the soil, the volume of small water reservoirs must be considered as important in conditions of the Czech Republic. This results in increased demand for building new small water reservoirs spread in the landscape. However, there is a lack of suitable profiles for that due to relatively high population density in the Czech Republic. The restoration of extinct ponds is considered therefore as a good option for this purpose. The paper presents the results of GIS analysis of the volume of water which would be available in case of the restoration of extinct ponds in the catchment of the river Blanice (543 km(2)). For this purpose, detail elevation data were used to avoid unacceptable error in volume estimates due to the sizes of considered areas. The results of analyses show that there is considerable retention volume available which could be used either to improve hydrologic conditions in stream network or for agricultural use consisting mainly in irrigations. Additionally, the results were compared to discharge data for three profiles on main major stream channels. In general, the results show how the building of new small water reservoirs can be used to mitigate droughts. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse the behaviour of the Romanian tourist regarding the participation in festivals, both in his town and also when he is travelling. Our objectives are to: find if Romanian people in general, and Romanian tourists, in particular, are interested in traveling with the purpose of attending a festival, identify the main motivations for attending a festival, the types of festivals that are preferred and the tourists' perception on Bucharest as potential international festival destination. The paper concludes that Romanian tourists tend to participate in one festival per year in average in their country and less than one festival per year in another countries, that music festival is the most appreciated type of festival and also we discovered that the most important motives for attending festivals in tourists' perception are psychological, cultural and emotional.

Cultural discovery not only served as aesthetic pleasure of discovering a new ethnographic culture, but in a way in the writings which was reflected the contact with the culture became responsible even for the recognition and perception of the Balkans and its peoples in Europe.

Active load management can increase capacity factors and thereby reduce the need for new capacity, improve reliability, and lower electricity prices. This paper conceptually and empirically explores barriers to load shift in industry from an end-user perspective. An online survey, based on a taxonomy of barriers developed in the realm of energy efficiency, was carried out among manufacturing sites in mostly Southern Germany. Findings suggest that the most important barriers are risk of disruption of operations, impact on product quality, and uncertainty about cost savings. Of little concern are access to capital, lack of employee skills, and data security. Statistical tests suggest that companies for which electricity has higher strategic value rate financial and regulatory risk higher than smaller ones. Companies with a continuous production process report lower barrier scores than companies using batch or just-in-time production. A principal component analysis clusters the barriers and multivariate analysis with the factor scores confirms the prominence of technical risk as a barrier to load shift The results provide guidance for policy making and future empirical studies.

This is corroborated by the actual rainfall and temperatures recorded in the local meteorological observatory. These factors exacerbated groundwater extraction for irrigation and domestic needs. In order to cope with the predicament, farmers shifted to late sowing varieties, dairying and adopted soil and water conservation measures such as farm ponds, ridges and dead-furrows and mulching. Those using conventional irrigation, shifted to drip irrigation, cultivating horticulture crops. Case study of a vulnerable woman farmers indicated that by participating in the groundwater market, the farmer purchased groundwater to cultivate vegetables and keeping three local cows which provided them with steady flow of income from milk. Thus, coping mechanisms were to sustain incomes and resilient due to climate change crisis.

Acknowledging the importance of the co-location of research and development (R&D) and manufacturing, this paper investigates the co-location rationale in three Italian industries. Drawing on a multiple case study, findings reveal that while innovation thrives on internationally dispersed functions, the execution of a specific bundle of development activities hinges on distinctive manufacturing knowledge. Evidence suggests that this innovation bundle is performed where industrial production occurs. Accordingly, this paper claims that it is the contiguity between development activities and production in manufacturing locales that ultimately supports innovation.","[Buciuni, Giulio] Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs, 1 Devonshire Pl, Toronto, ON M5S 3K7, Canada; [Finotto, Vladi] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Management, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy",University of Toronto; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Finotto, V (通讯作者)，Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Management, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",g.buciuni@utoronto.ca; vfinotto@unive.it,,"Buciuni, Giulio/0000-0003-2365-5643",,,,,48,40,41,4,93,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The objective was to offer a pragmatic and scientifically-acceptable approach that allows a wide group of users to prepare standardized, accurate, credible, comparable, and verifiable energy consumption and emission declarations. However, in its current form, EN 16258 contains gaps and ambiguities, and leaves room for interpretation, which makes comparisons of supply chains difficult. This research aims to overcome the shortcomings in the domain of allocating emissions from road freight transport operations to single shipments. Based on a discussion of emission drivers and the results of numerical experiments comparing the allocation vectors created by the EN 16258 allocation rules with those generated by the Shapley value, which is claimed to be the benchmark, 'distance' is identified as the single most useful unit for bridging the trade-off between accuracy and simplicity better than the other recommended allocation schemes. Thus, this paper claims that future versions of EN 16258 should only allow the allocation unit 'distance.' This will promote the accurateness, simplicity, consistency, transparency, and comparability of emission declarations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Proposed here distance-weighted improvement, DCL index, is to use its potential to become distance-based measure, resistant to MAUP and robust to space division.","[Kopczewska, Katarzyna] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Ul Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Kopczewska, K (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Ul Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland.",kkopczewska@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Kopczewska, Katarzyna/I-1339-2019","Kopczewska, Katarzyna/0000-0003-1065-1790",Polish National Science Centre [UMO-2013/11/B/HS4/01098],Polish National Science Centre,"The paper is financed by the Polish National Science Centre www.ncn.gov.pl as the research project in OPUS 6 call, contract No. UMO-2013/11/B/HS4/01098.",,7,2,2,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

A systematic approach does not exist yet and cities develop their plans individually, which is difficult for small and medium sized cities due to limited development capacities. Conventional city planning approaches do not integrate considerations on energy, economy and environment in transition plans in an easily comparable way, yet making decisions with regards to these parameters is vital to determine outcomes of planned developments on future sustainability of the city. The paper presents a framework model based on emergy synthesis which integrates energy, economic and environmental city systems in the decision making process, examining associated theoretical challenges and application limitations. The method is applied on the city of Sisals in Croatia which has developed plans to implement several initiatives geared towards creating a smart energy city. The model enables simulation and assessment of impacts of individual projects targeting the development of a smart energy city on city sustainability expressed through emergy performance, used as a tool for evaluating local development alternatives within the boundary of local resources.

To know how reducing residential energy demand could be achieved, this study develops a set of static and dynamic models to investigate and identify the impact of socio-economic and demographic characteristics, building age, energy prices, and weather conditions on residential energy demand at the state level from 2005 to 2013. Next, this study proposes two alternative scenarios to reduce residential energy demand based on the most precise model. For every 10,000 dollars of per capita income in each state: (1) increasing residential electricity price by 1 cent per kWh and (2) decreasing average building age by 1%. In the first scenario, the findings indicate that annual residential electricity demand would decrease by 7.3% on average, with the highest reductions in Washington (11.9%), North Dakota (10.9%), and Idaho (9.7%). In the second scenario, residential gas demand would decrease by an average of 15.8% annually, with the highest reduction in Connecticut (33.2%) followed by New York (33.0%) and Massachusetts (30.7%). These proposed scenarios assist policymakers in optimizing decisions and investments to reduce residential energy consumption. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

While there is consensus that generation technologies need to be low on greenhouse gas emissions, the question of whether to use renewables or nuclear to meet this power demand is highly controversial. Both options still require financial support and this is not going to change in the near future. This raises the question of where public money should be invested in order to achieve greater economic efficiency: into support for renewable energies (RE) or support for nuclear power plants? This paper sets out to answer this question. The detailed model-based prospective scenario assessment performed in this study provides the basis for estimating future cost developments. After discussing the existing support schemes for renewables, the paper compares these with a nuclear model. The comparison is conducted exemplarily for the United Kingdom (UK) at a country level and for the EU 28 overall. The recent state aid case for the construction of the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant (NPP) in the UK serves as the model for the nuclear option. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Case study of publicly funded projects in New York,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Combined Heat and Power; Energy efficiency gap; Capacity factor,SYSTEM; OPTIMIZATION; INCENTIVES,"We investigate lower than expected capacity factors of Combined Heat and Power plants using a publicly available dataset of hourly performance for plants in the state of New York. Low utilization of a CHP indicates underperformance. We examine possible causes of this underperformance including economic arbitrage, poor maintenance and operational practices, oversizing of plants, and reliability and resiliency needs. Based on seasonal and weekday/weekend capacity factor averages, we find that there is not enough evidence to support the economic arbitrage cause. Out of 99 plants in the dataset, 64 plants have average capacity factor below 60%, indicating they are either oversized and/or poorly maintained. This suggests that the current practice of one-time fixed incentive ($/kW) favors investment in capacity with no incentive for utilization (unlike a production credit which incentivizes generation $/kW h). From a policy perspective, this paper recommends better pre-engineering assessment for correct sizing, as well as revision of incentives based on performance. Additional information should be collected so that a more accurate ongoing analysis of the societal benefits of CHP projects can be made. Lastly, the energy efficiency gap, may be smaller than is commonly assumed and other options should be explored to meet energy efficiency goals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, emissions from motor vehicles have been found as one main source of air pollution in China, which consequently influences the residents' health. To better understand the environmental deterioration and health losses caused by the transport sector in China, in current circumstances, one must know how the changes in residents' travel demand and alternative transport modes affect environment and health co-benefits in China. We first of all calculate the demand from nearly all the residents' travel means, including road, rail, water, and air transport. Besides, based on the results, this paper further makes projections for a business-as-usual scenario for 2050 with several alternative transport scenarios to reduce harmful emissions and improve the welfare of the residents' health in China. Our integrated framework includes the harmful emissions models, the fixed box model and the exposure-response models, to link transport demand with possible environmental and health outcomes. The findings suggest that significant environment and health co-benefits are possible if alternative transport replaces. This research, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to estimate the total resident's travel demand under different scenarios and the consequent environment and health co -benefits in the transitional China.

We focus on two characteristics that are of importance for households: water hardness and aesthetic quality in terms of taste, smell and appearance. Our survey elicits expenditures on products that improve the overall experience of these characteristics of tap water quality, and administration targets a representative sample of the population in England and Wales. For water hardness, our results show that around 14% of households employ at least one water softener device or purchase products such as softening tablets or descaling agents. For the aesthetic quality of tap water, around 39% of households report some averting behaviour, the most common being the use of filtering devices, purchase of bottled water, or addition of squash or cordial. To study how expenditures on these products vary with the level of service quality, we match household data to highly disaggregated records on regional water hardness (in mg CaCO3/l) and aesthetic quality, as measured by the regional rate of complaints to the water service supplier. Our econometric analysis suggests that households' decision to incur averting expenditures varies with service quality in a statistically and economically significant manner, providing novel evidence that households actively respond to non-health related aspects of tap water quality.","[Lanz, Bruno] Univ Neuchatel, Dept Econ & Business, AL Breguet 2, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Lanz, Bruno] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Integrat Risk Management & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lanz, Bruno] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Provins, Allan] Eftec, London, England",University of Neuchatel; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Lanz, B (通讯作者)，Univ Neuchatel, Dept Econ & Business, AL Breguet 2, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",bruno.lanz@unine.ch,,,,,,,36,19,21,4,64,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4284,,,WATER RESOUR ECON,Water Resour.

The scheme closed in July 2015 after 30 months due to government concerns over low uptake and industry standards but additional factors potentially contributed to its failure such as poor scheme design and lack of understanding of the customer and supply chain journey. We explore the role of key delivery agents of GD services, specifically SMEs, and we use the LoCal-Net project as a case study to examine the use of networks to identify and reduce barriers to SME market engagement. We find that SMEs experienced multiple barriers to interaction with the GD such as lack of access to information, training, and confusion over delivery of the scheme but benefited from interaction with the network to access information, improve understanding of the scheme, increasing networking opportunities and forming new business models and partnerships to reduce risk. The importance of SMEs as delivery agents and their role in the design of market-led schemes such as the GD are discussed with recommendations for improving SME engagement in green sector initiatives.

A case study in the MISO region,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Wind power; Transmission; Variability; Decision making under uncertainty,POWER; ENERGY; ELECTRICITY; PRICE,"Wind speeds in remote areas are sometimes very high, but transmission costs to access these locations can be prohibitive. We present a conceptual model to estimate the economics of accessing high quality wind resources in remote areas to comply with renewable energy policy targets, and apply the model to the Midwestern grid (MISO) as a case study. We assess the goal of providing 40 TWh of new wind generation while minimizing costs, and include temporal aspects of wind power (variability costs and correlation to market prices) as well as total wind power produced from different farms. We find that building wind farms in North/South Dakota (windiest states) compared to Illinois (less windy, but close to load) would only be economical if the incremental transmission costs to access them were below $360/kW of wind capacity (break-even value). Historically, the incremental transmission costs for wind development in North/South Dakota compared to in Illinois are about twice this value. However, the break-even incremental transmission cost for wind farms in Minnesota/Iowa (also windy states) is $250/kW, which is consistent with historical costs. We conclude that wind development in Minnesota/Iowa is likely more economical to meet MISO renewable targets compared to North/South Dakota or Illinois. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This research project addresses this challenge by analyzing Chinese provincial carbon dioxide emission efficiencies and the energy consumption structure. The study applies the Slacks Based Measure (SBM) model to analyze the data from 30 regions in China from 2000 to 2011. The situation of provincial carbon dioxide emission efficiency, the characteristics of the energy consumption structure in each province, and the differences among these provinces are quantitatively analyzed. Based on the K-means cluster analysis, this research suggests that China be divided into five groups in the energy consumption structure: the inefficient and less reasonable group, the inefficient and more reasonable group, the efficient and less reasonable group, the efficient and more reasonable group, and the efficient and most reasonable group. The study offers recommendations for the government to develop policies to effectively and efficiently reduce carbon dioxide emission levels for each group. It also has profound implications for government administration in developing countries to guide the energy consumption and to control environmental pollution for the healthy development of the economy.

The coal-based energy mix in China will not change in the short term, and a means of delaying the coal resources depletion is therefore urgently required. The residual coal was exploited first with a lower recovery percentage and was evaluated as commercially valuable damaged coal. This approach is in comparison to past evaluations when the residual coal was allocated as exploitation losses. Coal recovery rates, the calculation method of residual coal reserves and statistics of its mines in China were given. On this basis, a discussion concerning the impacts on the delay of China's coal depletion, development of coal exploitation and sustainable developments, as well as technologies and relevant policies, were presented. It is considered that the exploitation of residual coal can effectively delay China's coal depletion, inhibit the construction of new mines, redress the imbalance between supply and demand of coal in eastern China, improve the mining area environment and guarantee social stability. The Chinese government supports the exploitation technologies of residual coal. Hence, exploiting residual coal is of considerable importance in sustainable development of the coal industry in China.

The European Commission is currently evaluating the directive. In support of this effort, we assess the status of car labelling in the EU. We find that all EU Member States have formally implemented national car labelling schemes. However, relevant information is not presented to consumers in a uniform manner. Only 13 Member States have implemented graphic labels that differ in their design, metrics, and classification of vehicles. The fuel consumption data displayed to consumers underrate yearly fuel costs in the order of several hundred Euros per car. We argue that car labelling can be made more effective if Member States adopt: (i) a uniform label that mirrors, as far as feasible, the design of the EU energy label, (ii) data and classification metrics that accurately reflect the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions observed by consumers, and (iii) a labelling scale that allows differentiation between efficient hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles. By following these recommendations, the European car labelling can receive wider recognition and foster well-informed consumer choices. (C) 2016 The Authors.

WTP was derived from a face-to-face survey of 564 recreational users of Plastira Lake, one of the most important constructed wetlands in Greece. Key elements in this research were the uses of adequate econometric models to tackle protest answers and of a scale for measuring the dimensions of Total Economic Value of a water resource. The results indicated relative importance of particular value components in determining water resources conservation preferences and individuals' willingness for protecting them. We extract four factors (water use, production, flora and fauna and quasi-option values) and explore their influence on respondents' WTP. Various demographic variables together with the extracted factors show a strong impact on WTP and the specific amounts stated. The study contributes to understanding of values underlying conservation decisions and help policy makers promoting strategies for protecting water resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Politics and investment: examining the territorial allocation of public investment in Greece, Regional Studies. This paper discusses how electoral politics shapes the regional allocation of public investment expenditures per capita in Greece. Using regional public investment data forten political periods (1975-2009), combined with electoral data by constituency, a model is proposed that captures the influence of politics on the regional distribution of public investment expenditures. The results of the analysis point to a strong relationship between electoral results and regional public investment spending. Greek governing parties have tended to reward those constituencies returning them to office. Moreover, an increase in both the absolute and the relative electoral returns of the governing party in a region has traditionally been followed by greater public investment per capita in that region. Regions where the governing party (whether Liberal or Socialist) has held a monopoly of seats have been the greatest beneficiaries of this type of pork-barrel politics.","[Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Psycharis, Yannis] Pante Univ Social & Polit Sci, Dept Econ & Reg Dev, 136 Syngrou Ave, GR-17671 Athens, Greece; [Tselios, Vassilis] Univ Thessaly, Dept Planning & Reg Dev, GR-38334 Volos, Greece",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Panteion University; University of Thessaly,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk; psycharis@panteion.gr; vtselios@prd.uth.gr,"Tselios, Vassilis/ISB-5776-2023; Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Tselios, Vassilis/0000-0001-6330-7278; Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",European Research Council under the European Union/ERC [269868]; European Union (European Social Fund); Greek national funds through the Operational Programme 'Education and Lifelong Learning' - Research Funding Program: THALES' [MIS 380421],European Research Council under the European Union/ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Union (European Social Fund)(European Union (EU)European Social Fund (ESF)); Greek national funds through the Operational Programme 'Education and Lifelong Learning' - Research Funding Program: THALES',The financial support of the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC [grant agreement number 269868] is thankfully acknowledged.

Extensive research has investigated the various determinants of electricity consumption. However, insights into how specific sociodemographic, behavioural, and attitudinal determinants influence residential electricity consumption are still scarce. In this study, we used hierarchical regression analysis to systematically investigate these determinants (including household engagement in electricity saving) along with a wide range of other measures in a sample of German households (N=763). Special attention was given to households with adolescents and children by analysing the influence of the number of adolescents on electricity consumption in a path model. Our results indicate that sociodemographic influences can be explained by the purchasing and use behaviours of residents. Our findings also suggest that the use of behavioural information provides a more detailed picture of the conditions of electricity consumption and thus allows for more appropriate policy planning.

Coping with change: the implications of e-commerce adoption for island consumers, Regional Studies. This paper examines the implications of e-commerce for retailers on three Scottish island groups. These locations are amongst the most economically fragile regions of the UK. The extensive use of e-commerce by residents has reconfigured traditional shopping patterns. The paper argues that this pattern of spending represents a form of 'trade leakage' with increased monies being spent off the island. The reaction from local retailers to this threat appears limited.

Border carbon adjustments (BCAs) figure prominently as instruments to address concerns arising from unilateral climate policy. Estimating the volume of emissions that could be potentially taxed under a BCA scheme has received little attention until now. This paper examines how a number of issues involved in the implementation of BCAs can affect their ability to cover emissions embodied in trade and thus address carbon leakage. These issues range from ensuring compliance with trade provisions and assumptions on the carbon intensity of imports, to determining which countries are included and whether intermediate and final demand are considered. Here we show that the volume of CO2 captured by a scheme that involved all Annex B countries could be significantly reduced due to these issues, particularly by trade provisions, such as the principle of 'best available technology' (BAT). As a consequence, the tariff burdens faced by non-Annex B parties could dwindle considerably. These findings have important policy implications, as they question the effectiveness and practicalities of BCAs to reduce carbon leakage and alleviate competitiveness concerns, adding further arguments against their implementation.

About 61 GW of demand appears unmet by the output of planned projects. In response, KACARE (King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy, the nation's energy policy maker) has announced the target of installing 41 GW of solar capacity by 2030 (24 GW by 2020). Deployment of so much solar power requires a substantial, locally trained, technical workforce. A lower bound estimate of 8.9 persons/MW of Solar PV and 3.04 persons/MW of Solar Thermal can be taken for manufacturing, operations and maintenance. This conservative figure would mean employment for 218,650 workers by 2030. This would require the 24 local universities to graduate 14,577 technically qualified workers annually for the next 15 years (607 graduates per year per university). Even assuming a 50% import of technical manpower, the above estimate can be revised as 303 graduates per university per year. The need for so many technical workers makes it imperative for local universities to immediately ramp up their capacity to graduate technical workforce. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Planning a suitable use of biomass for energy purposes call for the clear definition of the biomass potential, that has to be periodically updated by inventories for all EU countries. The aim of this paper has been the assessment of the available residual biomass, particularly lignocellulosic, in the Italian territory, to evaluate the potential for bioenergy, particularly for electricity and heat generation. The greenhouse gas savings according to the European target and indicators have been estimated on the national scale. Particularly, the total final energy which could be generated from 22,208,455 t/y of residual biomass assessed in Italy, is equal to 4.57 Mtoe, nearly 2.7% of the gross Italian energy consumption in 2013 and the total savings of GHG emissions coming from this bioenergy generation, are close to 52 Mt CO(2)eq for the entire Italian territory per year. The conclusions underline that an appropriate bioenergy policy can help decarbonise the economy, enhance the reliability of the energy supply and additionally it can revitalise rural areas.

This article presents an application of the economic input-output life cycle assessment (EIO-LCA) to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the life cycle of wind energy farms in a state. The EIO-LCA incorporates manufacturing, installation, operation and maintenance, and decommissioning of the wind turbine over its life cycle period. In doing so, the study demonstrates that O&M and decommissioning of infrastructure with a longer life period can be considered to assess the total environmental impacts. The life cycle costs of wind turbine installation in Indiana is used in this study. The uncertainty in wind energy production, and hence the variability in GHG emission intensities in metric tons per gigawatt hour (GWh), is demonstrated by using the Monte Carlo simulation. The research finds that wind energy production is not entirely GHG emission free if all the costs and life cycle stages are considered. Emission estimates have uncertainty, and O&M and decommissioning can add up to 200 metric tons of GHG emissions in CO2e per wind turbine life cycle. The regional EIO-LCA can be a helpful tool to determine strategies for state compliance to initiatives, such as the Clean Power Plan. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The research methods: the systemic, logical and comparative analysis of the scientific literature and panel regression. The results of this empirical study show that the households' saving behavior is more irrational especially during economic downturn and financial crisis periods.

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) lies at the heart of routing problems. One of the new variants of the TSP is named as TSP with Profits where the traveler must finish its journey within a predetermined time (cost, distance), by optimizing given objective. In this variant of TSP, all cities ought to not to be visited. The Orienteering Problem (OP) is the most studied case of TSP with Profits which comes from an outdoor sport played on mountains. In OP, traveler gets a gain (profit, reward) from the visited node and the objective is to maximize the total gain that the traveler collects during the predetermined time. The OP is also named as selective TSP. In this paper, we present two polynomial size formulations for OP. The performance of our proposed formulations is tested on benchmark instances. We solved the benchmark problems from the literature via CPLEX 12.5 by using the proposed formulations and existing formulation. The computational experiments demonstrate that; (1) both of the new formulations over estimates the existing one; and (2) the proposed formulations are capable of solving all the benchmark instances that were solved by using special heuristics so far.

The case study focuses on Alcoy, one of the towns that pioneered Spanish industrialisation in the nineteenth century. Based on anthropometric data for the height of military conscripts between 1860 and 1936 (cohorts born between 1840 and 1915), the study shows that average stature diminished among the generations born in the 1860s and 1870s, coinciding with the early stages of mechanisation in the textiles industry and accelerating urbanisation. However, poor diet among the inhabitants of Alcoy's rural hinterland was a further contributing factor to this decline in stature. The anthropomorphic evidence suggests that early industrialisation in Alcoy worsened health conditions and the net nutritional status of the town's working class.","[Puche, Javier] Univ Zaragoza, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain; [Canabate-Cabezuelos, Jose] Univ Murcia, E-30001 Murcia, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Murcia,"Puche, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain.",,,,"MEC-MICINN (Government of Spain) [HAR2010-20684-C02-02, ECO2012-33286, HAR2013-47182-C2-2-P, ECO2015-65582]; regional Government of Aragon [269187/2]; Foundation Seneca (Agency of Science and Technology of the Region of Murcia) [19512/PI/14]",MEC-MICINN (Government of Spain); regional Government of Aragon(Gobierno de Aragon); Foundation Seneca (Agency of Science and Technology of the Region of Murcia),"An earlier version of this study was presented at the 3rd Spanish Environmental History Conference (Carmona, 2006), and it was discussed at the 2011 Economic History Seminar held at the University of Zaragoza (Zaragoza, 2011).

Using data from China's Urban Household Income and Expenditure Survey data from 2007, this study quantified the distributional effects of the green electricity price subsidy policy among Chinese urban household and compared its effects by using lifetime income and annual income to classify households, respectively. The results show that total electricity subsidies are mainly driven by indirect electricity subsidies. By using lifetime income to classify households, subsidies to households in the poorest two groups accounted for less than 10.2% of the total subsidies, whereas money distributed to households in the top two deciles reached 35.4%. The comparison using annual income to group households also demonstrated the similar impact of the green electricity price subsidy policy. China's future market reforms should allow electricity prices to reflect pollution abatement costs.

However, recent years have realized little growth in actual deployments of grid-level storage and several high-profile storage companies and projects have failed. We hypothesize that falling natural gas prices have significantly reduced the potential profit from many U.S. energy storage projects since 2009 and quantify that effect. We use engineering-economic models to calculate the monthly revenue to energy storage devices providing frequency regulation and energy arbitrage in several electricity markets and compare that revenue to prevailing natural gas prices. We find that flywheel devices providing frequency regulation were profitable in months when natural gas prices were above $7/mcf, but face difficulties at current prices (around $4/mcf). For energy arbitrage alone, we find that the breakeven capital cost for large-scale storage was around $300/kWh in several key locations in 2004-2008, but is around $100/kWh in the same locations today. Though cost and performance improvements have been continually decreasing the effective cost of energy services from storage, fundamental market signals indicating the need for energy storage are at or near 10-year lows for both energy arbitrage and frequency regulation.

Knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) make a crucial contribution to regional innovation. Their relevance is potentially higher in peripheral territories, assisting small and medium-sized enterprises to access knowledge. Nevertheless, regions often concentrate research and development capabilities in the public sector, while highly specialized services provided by firms are scarce. Using data from 737 firms in Andalusia, Spain, this article connects the literatures of KIBS and university-industry interactions. This paper finds that absorptive capacity remains a central dimension in interactions with universities and the use of KIBS.

The controversy surrounding their development remains an unresolved issue in the energy policy debate. This study re-examines the cost issues associated with a portfolio of 58 dams that were financed by the World Bank from 1976 to 2005. Further, an estimate is made of the value of the benefits produced by these investments to determine the magnitude of economic rates of return for the individual projects and the overall portfolio of dams. Even though this portfolio of dams suffered substantially from cost overruns, the net contribution of these dams has been positive and substantial. The ex-post real economic rate of return for the entire portfolio is estimated to be greater than 17 percent. The important policy implication of this study is that each investment in a hydro dam needs to be appraised taking into consideration the distribution and probabilities of costs that might be incurred, as well as the potential benefits. Adequate margins must exist of ex-ante benefits over costs to account for the risks of cost overruns. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes an investigation of innovation in clean-tech using metadata provided by CrunchBase. Metadata reveal information on markets, products, services and technologies driving innovation in the clean-tech industry worldwide and for San Francisco, the leader in clean-tech innovation with more than two hundred specialised companies. A network analysis using metadata is the employed methodology and the main metrics of the resulting networks are discussed from an economic point of view. The purpose of the paper is to understand specifically specializations and technological complementarities underlying innovative companies, detect emerging industrial clusters at the global and local/metropolitan level and, finally, suggest a way to realize whether observed start-ups, SMEs and clusters follow a technological path of complementary innovation and market opportunity or, instead, present a risk of lock-in. The discussion of the results of the network analysis shows interesting implications for energy policy, particularly useful from an operational point of view. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using too large observational units risks hiding the interesting relationships within the regional boundaries. In this study, we aim to investigate and compare similar analyses performed on different geographical levels, with a special focus on innovative industries. Accessibility to markets, services and infrastructure is thought to be major determinants of the potential for economic development and welfare of a region. Earlier empirical research establishing the relationship between agglomeration forces and regional growth typically includes a measure for accessibility or market potential as an explanatory factor. The geographical scale that conventional accessibility measures operate on is usually on the level of municipalities or similar, even when theory suggests that a more disaggregated scale is desirable. Most often the reason for this is limitations in available data. In many cases, the researcher is left with a geographical level based on administrative borders. Analyses on more disaggregated levels allow the researcher to better pinpoint the actual accessibility that each firm faces. In order to shed light on the importance of these issues, this paper utilizes an exploratory approach to investigate the relationship between the spatial distribution and growth of knowledge-intensive services (KIS) and the accessibility to economic activity (market potential). We use regional employment growth in KIS as a proxy for regional innovativeness. The relationship is estimated on two different geographical levels using Swedish data. The more conventional model is estimated with the 290 municipalities in Sweden as the units of analysis. In the Swedish context, this represents the geographically smallest administrative level. In the more novel model, we use the 298 so-called SAMS areas of Jonkoping County in Sweden. Our results show that the detailed level is particularly important for the analysis of the growth of the more advanced sectors of the economy, in our setting, the high-tech knowledge-intensive services.","[Klaesson, Johan; Norman, Therese] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, CEnSE Ctr Entrepreneurship & Spatial Econ, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden",Jonkoping University,"Norman, T (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, CEnSE Ctr Entrepreneurship & Spatial Econ, POB 1026, S-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden.",johan.klaesson@jibs.hj.se; therese.norman@ihh.hj.se,,"Klaesson, Johan/0000-0001-8752-0428",,,,,34,4,5,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

A tiered hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) model was developed to calculate the planting-to-wire (PTW) energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and economic cost and profit of the SDPGS, including feedstock cultivation, power plant construction and operation, and on-grid price with/without government subsidies. The results show that the PTW energy consumption and GHG emissions of Salix are 0.8 MJ/kWh and 114 g CO2-eq/kWh, respectively, indicating an energy payback time (EPBT) of 3.2 years. The SDPGS is not economically feasible without government subsidies. The PTW costs are dominated by feedstock cultivation. The energy saving and GHG mitigation benefits are still robust, even when the power plant runs at only 60% design capacity. For future development of biomass power in China, scientific planning is necessary to guarantee a sufficient feedstock supply.

In this context, solar water heating (SWH) systems are notably prominent in Brazil, primarily because of the abundance of solar energy in the country. However, SWH designs have not always been perfectly developed. In most projects, the installation option of the solar system only considers the electric power economy aspects and not the particular characteristics of each climatic zone. Thus, the primary objective of this paper is to assess the potential of carbon dioxide reduction with the use of SWH in comparison with electric showers in social housing in several Brazilian climatic zones. The Brazilian government authorities have created public policies to encourage the use of these technologies primarily among the low-income population. The results of this paper indicate that hot climactic regions demonstrate a low reduction of CO2 emissions with SWH installations. Thus, solar radiation is not useful for water heating in those regions, but it does lead to a large fraction of household cooling loads, implying a demand for electrical energy for air conditioning or requiring the adoption of passive techniques to maintain indoor temperatures below threshold values.

In this paper, we analyze the role of supply and demand factors when accounting for these facts. We start by decomposing observed wage changes into changes in the composition of the labour force and changes in the returns of workers' and jobs' characteristics. The results indicate that the compression of the wage distribution between 1995 and 2006 is largely explained by changes in returns, and particularly, by a decrease in the returns to education. We show that both the increase in the supply of high-skilled workers and the increasing weight of low-skilled occupations are related to the decreasing trend in the skill premium over this period. In contrast, the widening of the wage distribution after 2006 is largely explained by an increase in the relative demand for high-skilled workers generating an increase in the school premium.","[Carrasco, Raquel] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid 28903, Spain; [Jimeno, Juan F.] Banco Espana, Madrid 28014, Spain; [Carolina Ortega, A.] Univ Nacl Tucuman, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Banco de Espana; Universidad Nacional de Tucuman,"Carrasco, R (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Calle Madrid 126, Madrid 28903, Spain.",rcarras@eco.uc3m.es,"Jimeno, Juan F/AAF-6141-2020; Carrasco, Raquel/H-5596-2015","Carrasco, Raquel/0000-0003-2550-6350","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2009-11165, ECO2012-31358]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),"We are grateful to Olympia Bover, Antonia Diaz, Joan Llull, Elena Martinez-Sanchis, Hipolito Simon, and two anonymous referees for comments on a previous draft of this paper and to participants in the XXXVI SAE and in Banco de Espana, Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona, and Universidad Autonoma de Madrid seminars for helpful comments.

Some authors use this finding to state that the current subsidies for renewable technologies cannot be considered as excessive. By carrying out a hybrid analysis (both simulation and ex-post empirical analyses) of the case of photovoltaic energy in Italy, this article demonstrates that this result cannot be generalised. Under market power, an increase in PV production can provide benefits in terms of a wholesale price decrease only beyond a specific threshold and especially if combined with other effects. Otherwise, it is likely that PV development could imply an increase in prices. Therefore, on the one hand, caution is necessary when using the estimated change in wholesale prices to evaluate the net cost for consumers of the supporting policies for renewables: either the simulation-based models or the full empirical analyses may be misleading. On the other hand, if decarbonisation is the main objective, the energy policies should be designed in order to assure a deep and balanced penetration of the clean technologies, regardless of their estimated transitory impact on wholesale prices (and in the meantime reviewing the organisation of power markets).

Applying a dynamic panel estimator to a large sample of African banks, we show that loan defaults are a major factor inhibiting bank lending when institutional quality is low.

Based on a 2014 survey of DG PV market and policy participants, we present cost and time breakdowns for installing DG PV projects in China, and we identify the main barriers to DG PV installation. We also use a cash flow model to determine the relative economic attractiveness of DG PV in several eastern provinces in China. The main factors constraining DG PV deployment in China include financial barriers resulting from the structure of the self-consumption feed-in tariff (FIT), ambivalence about DG PV within grid companies, complicated ownership structures for buildings/rooftops/businesses, and the inherent time lag in policy implementation from the central government to provincial and local governments.

Consequently, a large part of the installed photovoltaic systems in Germany have a southern orientation. This paper examines how the optional German market premium scheme incentivizes the installation of photovoltaic systems with a more demand-oriented electricity production. For this purpose, the measure 'energy yield elasticity (of market value)' was developed and calculated by using historical market data. The results show that some of the plant orientations that are deviating from the southern reference could have led to an increase in the market value in the last few years. However, these would not have been high enough to more than compensate for the financial losses that were formed as a result of the annual energy yield declines.

Education-job (mis)match and interregional migration: Italian university graduates' transition to work, Regional Studies. This paper analyses the micro-level determinants of the education-job (mis)matches of recent university graduates in Italy. As the Italian graduate population has experienced increasing internal migration, this paper focuses in particular on the role of interregional migration in driving education-job match. The methodology takes into account both the endogenous relationship between migration and employment, and the self-selection bias between employment and education-job (mis)match. Using a survey on Italian graduates' entry into the labour market, it is found that whilst migration at the national level is confirmed to have a positive role in both finding a job and decreasing the probability of over-education, robust differences emerge when looking at the sub-national dimension. Indeed, the Northern regions by receiving inflows of Southern graduates who manage to attain a good education-job match in the recipient labour markets are apparently reaping part of the return to the investment in university education borne in the South.","[Iammarino, Simona; Marinelli, Elisabetta] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Marinelli, Elisabetta] European Commiss JRC IPTS, E-41092 Seville, Spain",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; European Commission Joint Research Centre,"Iammarino, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",S.Iammarino@lse.ac.uk; Elisabetta.MARINELLI@ec.europa.eu,,"Iammarino, Simona/0000-0001-9450-1700",European Community [266959],European Community,The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) [grant agreement number 266959].,,86,51,53,2,53,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

We estimate a model based on the knowledge-capital theory of the multinational enterprise over the period 1995-2008 by using a sample of five EU countries and 24 partner countries. Explanatory variables include an index of applied bilateral tariffs, a dummy to capture the presence of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and a variable to take into account the impact of the participation of host countries to free trade agreements (FTA) with other than EU countries. The paper checks the third country effects by testing whether there is spatial lag dependence in bilateral FDI. The results show that trade costs play a key role in explaining the pattern of FDI in the manufacturing sector as a whole and in four out of six disaggregated industries. The impact of tariffs varies across industries, suggesting the predominance of horizontal FDI in some industries, and the existence of export-platform FDI in others. BITs and the participation of the host country in other FTAs positively affect the outward stock of EU FDI, while we find no empirical evidence to support the hypothesis of spatial lag dependence in bilateral FDI.","[Cardamone, Paola] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [Scoppola, Margherita] Univ Macerata, Dept Studies Econ Dev, I-62100 Macerata, Italy",University of Calabria; University of Macerata,"Cardamone, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",paola.cardamone@unical.it; margherita.scoppola@unimc.it,,,,,,,30,3,3,1,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

We conduct our analysis in a standardized set of apartments with similar appliances, which allows us to identify behavioral differences in electricity use. The Results show that households' estimations of appliance-level consumption are inaccurate and that they overestimate lighting use by 75% and underestimate plug-load use by 29%. We find that similar households using the same major appliances exhibit substantial variation in appliance-level electricity consumption. For example, households in the 75th percentile of HVAC usage use over four times as much electricity as a user in the 25th percentile. Additionally, we show that behavior accounts for 25-58% of this variation. Lastly, we find that replacing the existing refrigerator with a more energy-efficient model leads to overall energy savings of approximately 11%. This is equivalent to results from behavioral interventions targeting all appliances but might not be as cost effective. Our findings have important implications for behavior-based energy conservation policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Although water is a renewable source, it is not inexhaustible, neither of continuous quality. Good quality water reserves decline globally due to wasteful consumption or mismanagement and thus water is becoming a source in demand among the several consumers ( agriculture, industry, civil systems etc). In Greece, about 70-80% of water is used for agricultural purposes. Irrigation and drainage brought about significant changes in the landscape of Ioannina basin. A brief review and evaluation of irrigation and drainage practices in the basin of Ioannina makes obvious that there is a need to address issues related to water use and management in the context of sustainability, climate change and water deficiency. Therefore, the present paper aims to provide an overview of the challenges involved in applying landscape management regarding the use and management of water and discuss solutions, proposals or recommendations in the context of sustainability of the lake ecosystem and generally the protected area. Emphasis is given to the integration of ecosystem services in landscape management. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The field experiments were carried out during the eggplant season of 2013, in the experimental fields of Soil and Water Resources Research Unit in Tarsus. In the study, two irrigation systems (surface drip (DI) and subsurface drip systems (SDI)) in main plots; two irrigation intervals in sub-plots (IF3: 3-day; IF6: 6-day) and four irrigation levels in sub-sub plots (Full irrigation, FI; deficit irrigation, DI-50; deficit irrigation, DI-75; and Partial Root-zone drying PRD-50% of full irrigation treatments) were tested in split-split plot design with four replications. Canopy temperatures were measured throughout the growing season with an infrared thermometer (IRT), and vapor deficit of air (VPD) was used for calculating empirical the CWSI. The effect of irrigation treatments on yield, crop growth and juice quality differed. Irrigation methods, irrigation intervals and irrigation levels resulted in significantly different yields. Surface drip performance was superior to subsurface drip considering yield and quality of eggplants. Full irrigation treatment with 3-day interval under the surface drip (IF3 FI) produced the highest yield (78.7 t ha(-1)), the lowest yield was obtained in subsurface drip IF6 PRD-50 treatment plots (40.9 t ha(-1)). The highest water use efficiency (WUE) was found in subsurface drip IF6 DI-50 (21.9 kg m(-3)) and the lowest in subsurface drip IF6 PRD-50 (12.2 kg m(-3)). The results revealed that eggplant should be irrigated at CWSI values between 0.18-0.20 for high and good quality yields. CWSI can be used for irrigation scheduling for eggplant.

The ETFs market represents one of the most dynamic developing markets with new financial instruments. Since 1993, when the first ETF called Spider was introduced in dual listing in US and Canada, this market has grown to more than 3.200 ETF products at the end of 2013. About one third of these ETFs are traded in the United States in markets of NYSE that is dominating, Nasdaq or BATS. In the US market there are traded ETFs in the asset value more than 1.150 billion. Despite its fast growth and significant size, there is very little research on the structure of the ETFs market. The usage of network structure helps to fully identify relation between particular ETFs. In the analysis the most important ETFs (measured with their asset value) will be analysed on the individual and the provider basis. The provider basis is chosen because the US ETFs market is concentrated and three main providers (iShares, State Street Global Advisory and Vanguard) represent more than 80 percentage of the ETFs market. The application of the graph theory contributes to particularized understanding relations between these ETFs. Network modelling of ETFs market offers a powerful tool, because it provides much view on dependences of ETFs's behaviour. (C) The Authors.

Subjective performances has been widely investigated in academic literature where various streams of research have been developed. A prominent field of research focuses on the constructs of EO orientation and their ability to prompt performances through innovative attitude, risk taking behaviour, aggressiveness, autonomy and competitive energy. Another established field of research focuses on the impact of financial structure (i.e. leverage) on performances, although with ambiguous results.. We find support to the hypothesis that competitive energy might have a significant and positive impact in driving performance, which has obvious implications for managers and theoreticians. We also find that leverage might have a significant moderating role through interactions with EO dimensions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The article deals with the presentation of the Quality Mark SK and conditions for its granting of Slovak products. It informs about the results of the marketing research, which tried to find out the level of knowledge and satisfaction of Slovak consumers with Quality Mark SK. Based on the research, it was found out that the Slovak consumers considered the quality as important impact on their final purchasing decision, but Quality Mark SK had no important impact on their shopping behaviour. The reason may be poor mediatisation of this mark, thereby the author outlines proposals, which could help to increase knowledge of Slovak consumers about the Quality Mark SK and improve their awareness of the mark.

Second, by applying econometric models, we examine whether and which type of knowledge externalities contribute to region-industry dynamics and to the formation of the detected growth cluster. As a methodological contribution, following Porter's (Reg Stud 37:549-578, 2003) widely recognized cluster concept, we incorporate spatial dependence caused by the geographical proximity between regions and the technological proximity between industries into the empirical models. Combining the information obtained from the ESDA and econometric analysis enables us to assess the role of knowledge externalities for regional growth from a cluster perspective. The empirical results identify the presence of a growth cluster mainly driven by the automobile and associated industries. The core of the cluster is made up of manufacturing industries, but also includes several service sectors. The periphery of the cluster has less variety, mainly including the transportation equipment and electrical machinery industries. We find that intra-industry externalities that diffuse over a broader area within the cluster help the steady growth of the transportation equipment industry. In the core of the cluster, the diversified interrelated structure also contributes to the growth of the auto-related manufacturing sectors.","[Yamada, Eri] Kinki Univ, Fac Appl Sociol, Higashiosaka, Osaka 5778502, Japan; [Kawakami, Tetsu] Kinki Univ, Fac Econ, Higashiosaka, Osaka 5778502, Japan",Kindai University (Kinki University); Kindai University (Kinki University),"Kawakami, T (通讯作者)，Kinki Univ, Fac Econ, 3-4-1 Kowakae, Higashiosaka, Osaka 5778502, Japan.",yamada@socio.kindai.ac.jp; tekawaka@kindai.ac.jp,,"Yamada, Eri/0009-0003-2802-8072","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25885046, 22730195]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25885046, 24730231, 22730195] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors would like to thank the two anonymous referees, Jiro Nemoto and Yoshihiro Kameyama, for insightful comments.

This paper captures the major structural and organisational elements of institutional governance in place for promoting energy efficiency. Looking at Croatia - one of the most successful cases of energy efficiency programming of the past decade - the paper zooms in on governance coordination (metagovernance) between actors from different sectors and operating at multiple levels. By showcasing the positive implications of the programme, the authors contribute to the debate concerned with identifying better institutional frameworks to attain sustainable development. The programme showed effective governance through vertical and horizontal coordination among institutions and stakeholders resulting in simultaneous social and economic development and improved energy efficiency in public buildings. Through the case of Croatia, this study identifies how metagovernance has supported coordination among actors aiming to create sustainable development in general and how metagovernance functions in energy efficiency related projects, in particular. The paper also sheds light on communication frameworks of governance coordination and institutional constraints lying at the heart of the vagueness of sustainable development.

Contracting out is a mechanism through which the delivery of public services can be made more efficient. However, the process has yielded conflicting results. This paper presents a dynamic, mixed approach, incorporating an intertemporal frontier and a matching technique, to measure the short- and long-term effects of the implementation of contracting out on the efficiency of local public service delivery. The study demonstrates the existence of temporary inefficiency arising from the change in service management when contracting out takes place, followed by an increase in efficiency among municipalities that contract out, with respect to comparable municipalities that do not do so.","[Manez, Juan] Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ II, Valencia, Spain; [Perez-Lopez, Gemma; Luis Zafra-Gomez, Jose] Univ Granada, Dept Accounting & Finance, Granada, Spain; [Prior, Diego] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Business Dept, Barcelona, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Granada; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Zafra-Gómez, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Accounting & Finance, Granada, Spain.",jamc@uv.es; gemmapl@ugr.es; diego.prior@uab.es; jlzafra@ugr.es,"Zafra-Gomez, José/C-4536-2019; Manez, Juan/K-6780-2014; Pérez-López, Gemma/AAA-1534-2019","Zafra-Gomez, José/0000-0001-7191-6591; Manez, Juan/0000-0003-1105-0815; Pérez-López, Gemma/0000-0003-3569-8261; Prior, Diego/0000-0002-4669-2861","Spanish Ministry of Science and Education [ECO201348413- R, ECO2013-44115-P]; Fundacion Centro de Estudios Andaluces, Junta de Andalucia (Spain) [PRY139/14]","Spanish Ministry of Science and Education(Spanish Government); Fundacion Centro de Estudios Andaluces, Junta de Andalucia (Spain)(Junta de Andalucia)","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Education [grant numbers ECO201348413- R and ECO2013-44115-P] and by the Fundacion Centro de Estudios Andaluces, Junta de Andalucia (Spain) [grant number PRY139/14].",,55,25,25,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

These groups - farmers, residents and environmentalists share concerns about the impact on the unique black soil and aquifer, of fossil fuel more broadly. While these shared alliances across class, gender and generations are emergent, Aboriginal citizens are uniquely placed in this contest over land, environment and resources. This paper sets out to show the historical and contemporary significance of the place of Aboriginal people in the debate over land use, arguing that, for the first time in history, Aboriginal worlds are central to community futures. In this space, new relationships are being forged and new discourse is required to comprehend the complex position Aboriginal citizens have as custodians of place and at the same time, the responsibility to provide for families and communities, otherwise excluded from the prevailing modern economy. With reference to the history of both relationship to land and land usage over Gomeroi country, and drawing on ethnographic along with archival research, this article seeks to contribute to a critical understanding of Aboriginal people's dealings in relation to their land, their cultural and economic interests with in an emerging regional coal economy, and in turn how they are redefining the context for energy resource extraction, and energy policy.

The implications are supposed to affect the generation mix of utilities, distribution grid utilization, and electricity price. Using a techno-economic optimization model of a household system, we endogenously dimension PV system and stationary battery storage (SBS). The results of the reference scenario show positive net present values (NPV) for PV systems of approx. 500-1,800 EUR/kW(p) and NPV for SBS of approx. 150-500 EUR/kWh. Main influences are the demand of the households, self-consumption rates, investment costs, and electricity prices. We integrate electric vehicles (EV) with different charging strategies and find increasing NPV of the PV system and self-consumption of approx. 70%. With further declining system prices for solar energy storage and increasing electricity prices, PV systems and SBS can be profitable in Germany from 2018 on even without a guaranteed feed-in tariff or subsidies. Grid utilization substantially changes by households with EV and PV-SBS. We discuss effects of different incentives and electricity tariff options (e.g. load limits or additional demand charges). Concluding, solar energy storage systems will bring substantial changes to electricity sales. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Changes in economic, energy, and environmental policies as well as regulatory and technological advancement over time, cause changes in the relationship among the variables. We use a novel approach i.e. time-varying Granger causality and find that economic growth is the cause of CO2 emissions in Bangladesh and Egypt. Economic growth causes energy consumption in the Philippines, Turkey, and Vietnam but the feedback effect exists between energy consumption and economic growth in South Korea. In the cases of Indonesia and Turkey, we find the unidirectional time-varying Granger causality running from economic growth to CO2 emissions thus validates the existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis, which indicates that economic growth is achievable at the minimal cost of environment.

The goal of this paper is to investigate the effects of empirical social networks and different behavioral rules on farmers' irrigation adoption under drought risk and its impacts on several macroeconomic indicators such as the rate of adaptation, water demand and regional agricultural income. We present an application of a spatial economic ABM which is able to simulate the effect of droughts on crop production, farm income and farm decision-making. The agents' population is parameterized using survey data, including data on social networks. Four experiments are conducted combining two climate scenarios with two behavioral scenarios (maximizers vs. heuristic-based agents). The results show that the adoption process follows a different path in the scenario with heuristic-based farmers. The adoption of irrigation is slower in the short run due to reliance on information from social networks and farmers' uncertainty regarding drought events. This results in agricultural income loss and a lower water demand in the short run compared to the scenario with maximizing agents.","[van Duinen, Rianne; van der Veen, Anne] Univ Twente, Dept Water Engn & Management, Drienerlolaan 5,POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [van Duinen, Rianne; Filatova, Tatiana] Deltares, Dept Econ Scenarios & Innovat, Daltonlaan 400,POB 85467, NL-3508 AL Utrecht, Netherlands; [Filatova, Tatiana] Univ Twente, Ctr Studies Technol & Sustainable Dev, Drienerlolaan 5,POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Jager, Wander] Univ Groningen, Univ Coll Groningen, Dept Social Sci, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands; [van der Veen, Anne] Univ Twente, Dept Urban & Reg Planning & Geoinformat Managemen, ITC, Hengelosestr 99,POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",University of Twente; Deltares; University of Twente; University of Groningen; University of Twente,"van Duinen, R (通讯作者)，Univ Twente, Dept Water Engn & Management, Drienerlolaan 5,POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.;van Duinen, R (通讯作者)，Deltares, Dept Econ Scenarios & Innovat, Daltonlaan 400,POB 85467, NL-3508 AL Utrecht, Netherlands.",riannevanduinen@hotmail.com; t.filatova@utwente.nl; w.jager@rug.nl; A.vanderVeen@utwente.nl,"Jager, Wander/AGX-6970-2022; Filatova, Tatiana/K-8233-2016","Filatova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3546-6930",,,,,106,48,53,3,64,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Regression analysis of,data from a fall 2013 national telephone survey of United States residents reveals that as respondents' geographic distance from areas experiencing significant development increases, political ideology becomes more strongly associated with issue support, with the liberal-partisan divide widening.

Drawing on the recent pumping experiments in the Swedish archipelago (Lannerstasundet) and in the Finnish archipelago (Sandofjarden), we generalize the findings to the anoxic coastal areas of the Gulf of Finland. For nutrient policies we find that under the current abatement levels and abatement costs in WWTPs, reduction of external loads produces higher annual net benefits and higher present value than oxygenating anoxic bottoms by pumping in the coastal areas of the Gulf of Finland. For pumping a means of speeding up the recovery after a hypothetical heavy reduction in nutrient loads we find that it might provide positive net benefits in the coastal anoxic bottoms in the Gulf of Finland but not in the open Gulf of Finland.","[Ollikainen, Markku] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, POB 27, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Zandersen, Marianne] Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Bendtsen, Jorgen] Vituslab, Symbion Sci Pk,Fruebjergvej 3,Boks 98, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Lehtoranta, Jouni; Pitkanen, Heikki] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, Mechelininkatu 34a,PL 140 Helsinki, Helsinki 00260, Finland; [Saarijarvi, Erkki] Vesi Eko Oy Water Eco Ltd, Yrittajantie 12, Kuopio 70150, Finland",University of Helsinki; Aarhus University; Finnish Environment Institute,"Ollikainen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, POB 27, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",markku.ollikainen@helsinki.fi,"Zandersen, Marianne/AAF-1323-2020","Zandersen, Marianne/0000-0002-3827-3990; Ollikainen, Markku/0000-0003-3333-4683; Lehtoranta, Jouni/0000-0003-0853-7331",Swedish EPA (Naturvardsverket) [802-0301-08],Swedish EPA (Naturvardsverket),This paper is a part of the project Controlling benthic release of phosphorus in different Baltic Sea scales (PROPPEN) funded by the Swedish EPA (Naturvardsverket) (802-0301-08).

Based on an examination of historical East-West gas trade and by revisiting energy security concepts, the paper analyzes how problems with dependency on energy imports can be reduced. The paper discusses how the positions of Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC), where security challenges are especially evident, and the positions of countries in Western Europe, where they are less acute, interact and conflicts in making a common energy security policy as part of the Energy Union. The paper argues that the mainly confederative structure of the EU, and diverging national situations, make it difficult to unify positions into an effective common energy policy. However, with the CEEC in the EU, the EU is also changing, and an increased focus on energy security may be accepted. Extended interconnectedness within and to the CEEC appears to be the central issue that would mitigate, albeit not solve, contemporary security-of-gas-supply problems. As it would also bring the internal energy market closer to reality, it could in addition help the Energy Union to become a unifying project merging the interests in the East and the West despite their different security-of-gas supply concerns with Russian gas.

The most popular solution to date has been peaking plant, usually in the form of open-cycle-gas-turbines (OCGT). Energy storage technologies have so far been considered too expensive, however technology development, as well as challenging renewable targets could potentially make storage economically viable. Although new advanced flexible combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGT) have been developed by some manufacturers, they have not yet been investigated in electricity market models. This paper describes a techno-economic assessment of the most suitable flexible technologies for the wind-dominated all Ireland electricity market (the Single Electricity Market (SEM)). The analysis is conducted by considering the impact of a series of policy scenarios which are compared in an electricity market model. The comparison is quantified using three primary metrics: technical benefits to the system, economic advantages to the consumer and investment viability. Modelling results suggest that advanced CCGT and energy storage solutions are the most advantageous, however they need strong governmental support to attract potential investors and guarantee deployment in the market.

First, primary products account for the majority of their export earnings, and they are unable to diversify from primary production. Second, many economies have a substantial share of their rural population located on less favored agricultural land and in remote areas, thus encouraging geographic poverty traps. If green growth is to be a catalyst for economy-wide transformation and poverty alleviation in developing countries, then it must be accompanied by policies aimed directly at overcoming these two structural features. Policies and reforms should foster forward and backward linkages of primary production, enhance its integration with the rest of the economy, and improve opportunities for innovation and knowledge spillovers. Rural poverty, especially the persistent concentration of the rural poor on less favored agricultural lands and in remote areas, needs to be addressed by additional targeted policies and investments, and where necessary, policies to promote rural-urban migration.

Environmental Impact Assessments, a legal requirement for nearly all energy projects in Iceland since 1994, have played an important role in identifying the environmental impacts of energy projects, and proposing mitigation measures. However, a purely qualitative description of environmental impacts is insufficient to ensure that they are accounted for equivalently with all of the other costs and benefits of a proposed project. Instead, as monetary information concerning the welfare gains or losses of proposed projects is not currently required to be provided to the licensing body, Orkustofnun, there is the potential for sub-optimal decision-making to occur. As this paper sets out, a broad variety of non-market valuation techniques already exist and could be applied to estimate the value of environmental benefits sacrificed to accommodate such developments. These methods and their outcomes could be incorporated within mandatory cost-benefit assessments for proposed Icelandic energy projects, communicating an estimate of the full welfare implications of approvals to decision-makers and the public alike, and fulfilling an OECD demand for the country to commence such processes.

Specific types of solar PV panels are known to respond to climate factors differently. Mono-, poly-, and amorphous-silicon (Si) PV technologies are known to exhibit varying degradation rates and instantaneous power losses as a function of operating temperature, humidity, thermal cycling, and panel soiling. We formulate an extended LCOE calculation, which considers PV module performance and lifespan as a function of local climate. The LCOE is then calculated for crystalline and amorphous Si PV technologies across several climates. Finally, we assess the impact of various policy incentives on reducing the firm's cost of solar deployment when controlling for climate. This assessment is the first to quantify tradeoffs between technologies, geographies, and policies in a unified manner. Results suggest crystalline Si solar panels as the most promising candidate for commercial-scale PV systems due to their low degradation rates compared to amorphous, technologies. Across technologies, we note the strong ability of investment subsidies in removing uncertainty and reducing the LCOE, compared to production incentives. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the use of different methods and models, the outcome was the same whereby GDP growth, urbanization, and trade openness increase the water and land footprint. Moreover, renewable energy production increases the water and land inefficiency because of its positive effect on ecological footprint. Additionally, based on the square of GDP it is concluded that the EKC hypothesis does not exist while the square of renewable energy production indicates that renewable energy production will continue to increase water and land footprint in the future.

However, RE sources differ in many important ways from fossil fuels, particularly in that they are energy flows rather than stocks. The most important RE sources, wind and solar energy, are also intermittent, necessitating major energy storage as these sources increase their share of total energy supply. We show that estimates for the technical potential of RE vary by two orders of magnitude, and argue that values at the lower end of the range must be seriously considered, both because their energy return on energy invested falls, and environmental costs rise, with cumulative output. Finally, most future RE output will be electric, necessitating radical reconfiguration of existing grids to function with intermittent RE. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

One promising technology is the geothermal heat pump. Despite its undoubted advantages compared to fossil fuels in terms of RES production, CO2 reduction and primary energy savings, there are still significant barriers for the creation of sustainable local markets. Many regions present similar conditions in terms of climate, geology, hydrogeology, infrastructure and political conditions. Because of the context-driven nature of shallow geothermal systems, similarities should be taken into account and strategies shared across borders to foster the introduction and exploitation of shallow geothermal energy. Focusing on the results of the LEGEND Project, this paper presents an attempt at creating an inter-regional strategy for the widespread introduction of geothermal heat pumps in the Adriatic area, which includes EU and non-EU countries. The multi-level approach adopted (a combination of desk studies on the transferability potential, pilot plants across the regions and programs to involve, educate and train stakeholders) allowed to set up the strategy. Therefore, different actions are proposed to stimulate the development of the market, whose interconnection across the Adriatic can accelerate the achievement of the main energy and climate targets for all the countries involved.

The first question is timely and relevant because if the merit-order effect estimates are small, California's renewable energy development is of limited help in cutting electricity consumers' bills but also has a lesser adverse impact on the state's investment incentive for natural-gas-fired generation. The second question is related to the efficient market hypothesis under which the hourly RTM and DAM prices tend to converge. Using a sample of about 21,000 hourly observations of CAISO market prices and their fundamental drivers during 12/12/2012-04/30/2015, we document statistically significant estimates (p-value <= 0.01) for the DAM and RTM merit-order effects. This finding lends support to California's adopted procurement process to provide sufficient investment incentives for natural-gas-fired generation. We document that the RTM-DAM price divergence partly depends on the CASIO's day-ahead forecast errors for system loads and renewable energy. This finding suggests that improving the performance of the CAISO's day-ahead forecasts can enhance trading efficiency in California's DAM and RTM electricity markets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

While there has been a great deal of research on climate change performance at the country/region level, our research focuses on the study of firm-level environmental efficiency as a proxy for firms' climate change management. Using a unique data set on U.S. S&P 500 firms for the period 2012-2013 and DEA slack-based models, we obtain firms' environmental efficiencies in six sectors. The results show significant performance dispersions both across and within the sectors. We highlight each sector's pros and cons in the environmental performance and propose guidelines for policy makers to further improve climate change performance. We also evaluate firms' operational performance and propose a unified performance measure by integrating operational and environmental efficiencies. Overall, we find there is no significant relationship between operational and environmental efficiencies in any of the six industrial sectors under study. The unified performance measures are more driven by the environmental efficiency than the operational efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It models employment outcomes for individuals for 2002-08 and generates counterfactual outcomes for 2010 for individual-level employment assuming there is no recession. A resilience index, based on the difference between employment outcomes assuming actual economic conditions and a no recession counterfactual, is generated. Resilience varies substantially and is higher in German and French regions than in peripheral regions.

We show that when identification is weak (i.e., when the discontinuity is of a small magnitude), the usual t-test based on the FRD estimator and its standard error suffers from asymptotic size distortions as in a standard instrumental variables setting. This problem can be especially severe in the FRD setting since only observations close to the discontinuity are useful for estimating the treatment effect. To eliminate those size distortions, we propose a modified t-statistic that uses a null-restricted version of the standard error of the FRD estimator. Simple and asymptotically valid confidence sets for the treatment effect can be also constructed using this null-restricted standard error. An extension to testing for constancy of the regression discontinuity effect across covariates is also discussed.

One of the reasons is that the performance of buildings and its components degrade over the years. In recent years, energy benchmarking for government office buildings, large scale public buildings and large commercial buildings is one of the key energy saving projects for promoting the development of building energy efficiency and sustainable energy savings in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Benchmarking would increase the purchase of energy efficient equipment, reducing energy bills, CO2 emissions and conventional air pollution. This paper focuses on energy benchmarking for shopping centers in Gulf Coast Region. In addition, this paper will analyze a sample of shopping centers data in Gulf Coast Region (Dubai, Ajman, Sharjah, Oman and Bahrain). It aims to develop a benchmark for these shopping centers by highlighting the status of energy consumption performance. This research will support the sustain ability movement in Gulf area through classifying the shopping centers into: Poor, Usual and Best Practices in terms of energy efficiency.

Spanish SMEs' subsidized and guaranteed credit during economic crisis: a regional perspective, Regional Studies. This study analyses the effects of two Spanish public programmes that provide financial support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs): (1) subsidized credit by the Official Credit Institute and (2) bank credit guaranteed by a mutual guarantee society. The study was conducted from a regional perspective and it compares the effects of the two programmes during normal times with the effects during economic crisis. During stable periods, these programmes affect the growth of assets, sales and the sales to assets ratio. However, during recession, the effects extend to the growth of employment and the sales to employee ratio. Moreover, there are significant regional differences.","[Briozzo, Anahi] Univ Nacl Sur, Dept Business Adm, CONICET, 12 Octubre 1198,8th Floor, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Cardone-Riportella, Clara] Pablo Olavide Univ, Dept Financial Econ & Accounting, Carretera Utrera,Km 1 S-N, E-41013 Seville, Spain",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of the South; Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Briozzo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Sur, Dept Business Adm, CONICET, 12 Octubre 1198,8th Floor, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.;Cardone-Riportella, C (通讯作者)，Pablo Olavide Univ, Dept Financial Econ & Accounting, Carretera Utrera,Km 1 S-N, E-41013 Seville, Spain.",abriozzo@uns.edu.ar; ccardone@upo.es,"Briozzo, Anahi/AAK-9940-2021","Briozzo, Anahi/0000-0002-7865-2821",Regional Government of Andalusia [P09-SEJ-4467],Regional Government of Andalusia(Junta de Andalucia),The authors also would like to thank the Regional Government of Andalusia [Project of Excellence number P09-SEJ-4467] for the financial support.,,46,10,11,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

We employ an EGARCH model to take into account the high volatility of oil prices and some stylized facts characterizing this volatility. We find that the impact of OPEC's announcements on oil prices (i)evolves over time and among decisions, (ii) is more significant for production cut and maintain, (iii) is different for WTI and Brent prices, and (iv) is sensitive to the benchmark index.

This paper explores whether this is due to the rise of city network economies', leading to processes of borrowed size as well as the rise of agglomeration shadows in networks of cities. The spread of metropolitan functions over Western European cities is analysed. It is found that network connectivity positively enhances the presence of metropolitan functions, but local size remains the most significant determinant for most types of functions. The importance of size and network connectivity differs across metropolitan functions and across cities.

Se analiza la propagacion de las funciones metropolitanas en las ciudades de Europa occidental. Se ha encontrado que la conectividad de las redes mejora de manera positiva la presencia de las funciones metropolitanas, pero el tamano local sigue siendo el factor determinante mas significativo para la mayoria de tipos de funciones.

The buying in the shop accelerated and some customers spend less time in the shop, because before buying in the store, some of them have done detailed research on the Internet. The process of buying decisions, and factors which affecting on consumer preferences, the purchase itself to shopping evaluation of the usefulness of a product or service are a part of theory, which is called consumer behavior. The decision about the purchase of goods depends on the number of various cases of individual factors, of consumer's perception, environmental factors, the environment in which he lives, or on the people with them he meets. To the factors that have a dominant influence on the decision-making process and ultimately on the purchase of goods also belong the situational factors too, such as time spent for buying. Time is a factor that is important, as for the seller, as well as for the customer. The customer satisfaction plays an important role for the seller, which is a defined by living up to his needs and wishes and whose achievement is nowadays becoming more and more challenging. On the one side, he must constantly expand the product range and create conditions for cultural, experiential purchase, which is a form of relaxation and on the other side, he adjusts the location of daily consumption goods, so that their purchase has been possible to realize as soon as possible and also to operate the cash register systems in such a way, that the more hurried customers were discouraged from other purchases. The aim of this paper is through questionnaire survey and time experiments to evaluate the importance of time by selecting of food shops in chosen retail food stores. Based on the results, in conclusion of this paper we suggest the possible solutions that could contribute to greater customer satisfaction and customer loyalty to individual food stores depending on the form of purchase.","[Bercik, Jakub; Paluchova, Johana; Horska, Elena] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Mkt & Trade, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Bercík, J (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Mkt & Trade, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",jakub.bercikxx@gmail.com; johana.paluchova@gmail.com; elena.horska@gmail.com,"Bercik, Jakub/HGA-0102-2022; Horská, Elena/AAQ-6137-2020",,,,,,16,0,0,0,11,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,859,865,,10.15414/isd2016.s11.01,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500103,0

This paper analyses the determinants of spatial distribution of foreign technological activities across 96 regions in Germany. It identifies foreign technological activities by applying the cross-border ownership concept to patent applications. The main proposition is that regions with higher related variety of technological activities between sectors attract more foreign technological activities. The estimations show that this is the case in regions characterized by a high overall technological strength.

Results show that, on average, suburban households consume more energy in residential buildings than their city-dweller counterparts. This variation in energy consumption is due to differences in: (1) characteristics of the household and the housing unit, independently, and (2) interactions between the household and housing characteristics in the city and suburban households. Findings of this study provide new insights into how regional policies can be implemented differently in suburbs and cities to reduce energy consumption.","[Estiri, Hossein] Univ Washington, Dept Urban Design & Planning, 410 Gould Hall,Box 355740, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Estiri, H (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Urban Design & Planning, 410 Gould Hall,Box 355740, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",hestiri@uw.edu,,"Estiri, Hossein/0000-0002-0204-8978",,,,,66,7,8,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

A review of measures related to management of agricultural development at the national level was conducted, and sustainability of farms depending on specialization was assessed. Analyses pertain to 2013. Conducted analysis indicates that the factor with the greatest impact on the sustainability of farms is the production profile. In specialized farms, the economic objective is prioritized, often at the expense of the environment. Animal production poses a particular threat to the environment, which is the result of the concentration and large scale of production. Simplification of plant production occurred in farms specializing in field crops and swine. This is also an unfavorable practice, because it leads to disruption of the ecological equilibrium of agrocenoses. Economic sustainability was achieved by farms conducting intensive production, and this occurred thanks to the large contribution of funds from the EU budget.","[Koloszko-Chomentowska, Zofia] Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Management, Dept Finance & Accounting, Ul Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Koloszko-Chomentowska, Z (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Management, Dept Finance & Accounting, Ul Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",z.koloszko@pb.edu.pl,,,,,,,19,1,1,1,6,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,447,454,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500052,0

In addition, we study the effect of environmental topology (toroidal grid and clique graph). In the study of population dynamics, logarithmic returns are generally applied. The resulting distributions display a fat tail form of the power law: the more complex the logic function (in terms of NAND components), the broader the full width at half a maximum of the histogram. The power law exponents were in sound agreement with those of real-life populations and distributions. The distributions of evolutionary times, as well as post-extinction recovery periods, were very broad, and presumably had no standard deviations.

However, there has been insufficient research into the early assessments for detecting the risk of developing disordered eating. We report preliminary results from a project aiming to assess the prevalence of eating attitudes and behaviors that heighten the risk of eating disorders. The study examines a non-clinical sample of adolescents and adults from two cities of South Bulgaria. METHODS: In this cross-sectional epidemiological study, a total of 1285 volunteers of 828 females and 453 males, aged 14 to 59 years, were surveyed to assess disordered eating attitudes and behaviors. For this purpose, the study used the 'SCOFF' questionnaire, the Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale (EDDS), and the Eating Attitudes and Behaviors Questionnaire (EABQ), which was developed for this study. RESULTS: The proportion of these volunteers underweight (body mass index below 17.5) was 9.8%. Of the total subject, 34.7% provided two or more positive answers for the SCOFF questionnaire (two being the upper threshold for indicating 100% sensitivity to anorexia and bulimia). The results differed between males and females: 21.6% and 42.1%, respectively, in this regard. A factor analysis (oblimin rotation) of EABQ items revealed four main factors: body shape and weight concerns, personal control over eating and calorie intake, dieting, and preoccupation with food and binge eating. A Spearman's correlation analysis showed moderately significant correlations (p < 0.001) between the total scores of the SCOFF questionnaire, EABQ, and the scores for three groups of items in the EDDS for assessing eating attitudes and behaviors. CONCLUSION: We found a greater ED risk in adolescents compared with the older groups and in females compared with males. One fifth of males studied were at high risk of ED and ages between 19 and 39 years also appeared at risk.

The goal of the study was to evaluate the use of antithrombotic medication stroke prevention and assess long-term stroke outcome. METHODS: This study involved 531 cardio embolic stroke patients of the Paul's Stradins Clinical University Hospital, Riga, Latvia, in 2014. After discharge the patients or their relatives were interviewed by phone after 30, 90, 180, and 365 days. Standardized questions were asked about the patients' abilities and use of prescribed secondary prevention medication. The results were compared between patient groups, assigned according to prescribed medications. RESULTS: Of all the patients included in the study, 8.9% were using oral anticoagulants before stroke onset. One year after discharge, 1.44% of patients were not using any preventive medication, 23.56% were using antiplatelet agents, 43.27% warfarin, and 31.73% target-specific oral anticoagulants. The one-year mortality rate was 40.7%. The mortality rate was significantly higher in the patient group using no secondary preventive medication or antiplatelet agents compared to the patient group that used oral anticoagulants. CONCLUSION: Cardio embolic stroke primary and secondary prevention in Latvia is lacking. The study outcomes suggest that action is needed to increase the use of oral anticoagulants in primary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. Poor function outcomes, dementia, and patients' incompliance limits the use of oral anticoagulants in secondary prevention.","[Pucite, Elina; Jurjans, Kristaps; Miglane, Evija; Millers, Andrejs; Priede, Zanda] Pauls Stradins Clin Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Riga, Latvia; [Pucite, Elina; Miglane, Evija; Millers, Andrejs; Priede, Zanda] Riga Stradins Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Riga, Latvia; [Lurina, Baiba; Kalejs, Oskars] Pauls Stradins Clin Univ Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Riga, Latvia; [Kalejs, Oskars] Riga Stradins Univ, Dept Internal Dis, Riga, Latvia",Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital; Riga Stradins University; Pauls Stradins Clinical University Hospital; Riga Stradins University,"Pucite, E (通讯作者)，Pauls Stradins Clin Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, Riga, Latvia.;Pucite, E (通讯作者)，Riga Stradins Univ, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Riga, Latvia.",elina.pucite@rsu.lv; Kristaps.jurjans@gmail.com; evija.miglane@stradini.lv; baiba.lurina@gmail.com; okalejs@gmail.com; zada.priede@stradini.lv,"Miglane, Evija/AAZ-9103-2020; Miglane, Evija/ABC-9630-2021; Jurjans, Kristaps/C-4890-2016","Miglane, Evija/0000-0003-4862-6726; Jurjans, Kristaps/0000-0003-1730-8354",,,,,18,1,1,0,1,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,615,621,,10.12955/cbup.v4.821,0.0,,,7,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000091,0

A questionnaire study was conducted on a sample of residents near the Haiyang Nuclear Power Plant, which is under construction in Shandong Province, China (N=487). Results show that, as expected, perceived knowledge is vital in predicting people's information insufficiency, information seeking, systematic processing, and risk perception. Moreover, the inverted U relationship between perceived knowledge and anti-nuclear behavioral intentions is indicated in the study. Information insufficiency and information seeking also significantly predict systematic processing. Furthermore, people's behavioral intentions are motivated by risk perception but fail to be stimulated by systematic processing. Implications and recommendations for future research are discussed.

A huge amount of researches about renewable energy sources has emerged recently in response to these issues. However, the amount of researches considering the effects of various influential parameters on the efficiency and performance of PV systems remains small, and is still limited to some specific parts of PV systems. In particular, researches considering thoughtfully the influence of government subsidies on PV financial assessment are still in development. This paper proposes an approach to analyze the benefit of installing a PV system under the impact of government financial subsidies, focusing especially on feed-in-tariff (FIT) and tax abatement policies for industrial users in Taiwan. In addition, a method for selecting the most appropriate policies is proposed for the government through the analysis of both user demand and the government's PV installation capacity target.

This paper aims to contribute to the empirical literature on well-being indicators and dispersion across regions in terms of both quality of life and economic progress. Italian regions are used as case studies and 10 different multidimensional determinants of well-being are considered: culture and free time; education; employment; environment; availability of essential public services; health; material living conditions; personal security; research and innovation; and the strength of social relations. We calculated, by applying principal component analysis, synthetic indicators for each well-being determinant and for each region so as to generate-again, by means of the same methodology-an index of overall well-being. The study was conducted for every year over the period 2004-2010. Results clearly show that differences in well-being between regions are not necessarily in line with those based on per capita GDP, suggesting a need to give more attention to quality-of-life features of economic progress in public policy goals and design. Furthermore, the paper looked at dispersion across regions and regional rank mobility over the same period. Italian regions have tended to become more similar in terms of well-being over time, but no evidence of significant intra-distributional mobility emerges.","[Ferrara, Antonella Rita; Nistico, Rosanna] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",University of Calabria,"Nisticò, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, Cubo 1-C, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.",antonellarita.ferrara@unical.it; rosanna.nistico@unical.it,,"FERRARA, Antonella Rita/0000-0002-3161-8845",,,,,94,28,31,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Its application provides a hierarchical organization of handicaps from the most critical to the less critical and then, from the easiest to the most difficult to overcome. This makes possible to determine which barriers would be a priority, which may indicate the direction of regulatory changes to properly address these handicaps and so, stimulating a higher participation of the demand side in electricity markets. After applying the methodology to three European countries, 34 handicaps have been identified, analyzing which of these handicaps affect such stakeholders as grid operators, retailers and customers and how these stakeholders are affected. For each handicap, the criticality and difficulty to overcome the different handicaps have been studied, based on detailed information coming from personal interviews to experts representing the different stakeholders in the electricity trading chain. Regulatory barriers have been identified as the most critical and difficult to overcome. Together with regulatory changes, the promotion of aggregators and the training of customers on DR applications are some of the most significant initiatives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As for the labour markets, Overman and Puga (2002) showed that a progressive polarization of unemployment was in fact occurring among the European regions in 1986-1996, causing a phenomenon of cross-border clusterization. Here we propose to analyse the evolution of the unemployment rates of the EU 27 regions in the last two decades assuming that the unemployment rates evolve according to a Gompertz stochastic process. The estimated parameters of the process - intrinsic growth rate, deceleration factor, volatility - represent the evolutionary path of the unemployment rate and allow for estimating the steady state of the process. A cluster analysis is performed on the steady state values of the unemployment rates. The analysis confirms the emergence of several convergence clubs' among the European regional labour markets, which are compared to the clusters resulting from the more traditional clusterization on the current unemployment rates.

Electricity makes up an important component of rural development and so increasing access can have positive socioeconomic benefits. In this study, we use contingent behavior analysis to quantify the potential benefits of electricity in rural Rwandan villages which currently do not have electricity. The proposed method allows for calculation of net benefits as well as electricity bills. We find that even relatively poor, isolated households would pay for electricity, though amounts vary across households and this affects the financial viability of electrification. Common uses for electricity include lighting, battery charging, and agricultural processing. Despite heterogeneity, opportunities exist to improve rural economic welfare through increased electricity access.

Furthermore, the log of the determinant is argued to relate to a likelihood ratio test and is proven to be more powerful than other tests that are asymptotically equivalent under the null hypothesis. Additionally, matrix-based tests are presented for the purpose of inferring the location or direction of the causality existing between the two series. A simulation study is provided to explore the efficacy of the proposed methodologythe methods are shown to offer improvement over existing techniques, which include the famous Granger causality test. Finally, data examples involving U.S. inflation, trade volume, and exchange rates are given.

Besides assessing the role of labor market and housing market factors in driving a region's net migration rate, we particularly focus on agglomeration factors identified by new migration theories related to regional growth models and the new economic geography. The work contributes to the field in the following way: we extend the scarce literature on the different channels through which agglomeration economies act as an attractor for mobile labor. Moreover, we account for the role of space-time dynamic adjustment processes and simultaneity among migration and labor market variables and finally test for heterogeneity in the migration response to regional labor market disparities among low- and high-skilled migrants. Our results support the view that agglomeration economies are indeed key drivers of internal migration flows in Denmark. That is, while we obtain mixed evidence with regard to the role of traditional labor and housing market variables, most of the included proxies for agglomeration economies such as the region's population density, patent intensity, endowment with human capital as well as the region's employment share of knowledge-intensive services are positively correlated with the region's net in-migration rate. Regarding the regional implications of internal migration flows, the results hint at a process of cumulative causation for the time period of analysis running from agglomeration economies to the inflow of mobile labor and subsequent regional income development.","[Mitze, Timo; Schmidt, Torben Dall] Univ Southern Denmark SDU, Dept Border Reg Studies, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Mitze, T (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark SDU, Dept Border Reg Studies, Alsion 2, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark.",tmitze@sam.sdu.dk; tds@sam.sdu.dk,,"Mitze, Timo/0000-0003-3799-5200",,,,,67,14,15,0,60,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Electoral support for major parties is influenced by judgements of economic performance. This helps account for electoral geographies, as economic conditions vary spatially. Past work, concentrating on objective economic indicators or on voters' personal economic evaluations, suggested that contextual effects work most powerfully when very local, suggesting that regional voting trends are artefacts of more intimate geographies. This paper extends that work by examining how voters' decisions are influenced by the economic evaluations of others in their communities and demonstrates that some contextual effects, at least, really are more powerful at the regional than at more local scales.","[Pattie, C.

Implicit in the concept of specialist housing is the notion of 'special' occupants, imagined older people. Adopting a socio-technical approach, this paper considers how ideas about ageing inform those aspects of extra-care-housing-design that relate to thermal comfort. The paper draws on semi-structured interviews with 13 people involved in the design, development and management of UK-based extra-care housing. Participants characterised imagined occupants as vulnerable to cold, at risk from fuel poverty and liable to be burned by hot surfaces or fall from high windows. These user representations were reportedly inscribed into the design of extra-care housing schemes through the inclusion of building features such as communal heating, under-floor heating, restricted window opening and heated corridors. The utilisation of stereotypical user representations of older people raises questions, given that older people's thermal comfort needs can be highly diverse. The paper explores the implications for energy demand. (C) 2015 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Theory suggests a trade-off between agglomeration economies (peer effects) and diseconomies (peer crowding). I test this hypothesis using historical data on composers and employ a unique instrumental variable - a measure of birth centrality, calculated as the average distance between a composer's birthplace and the birthplace of his peers. I find a strong causal impact of peer group size on the number of important compositions written in a given year. Consistent with theory, the productivity gain eventually decreases and is characterized by an inverted U-shaped relationship. These results are robust to a large series of tests, including checks for quality of peers, city characteristics, various measures of composers' productivity, and across different estimations in which also time-varying birth centrality measures are used as instrumental variables.","[Borowiecki, Karol J.] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark; [Borowiecki, Karol J.] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ Hist, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",University of Southern Denmark; Lund University,"Borowiecki, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark.",kjb@sam.sdu.dk,"Borowiecki, Karol J./ABE-1387-2021","Borowiecki, Karol J./0000-0003-4959-181X",,,,,39,20,21,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

However, most DSR is provided by large industrial and commercial consumers, and little research has been directed to the quantification of the value that small (below 100 kW) commercial and residential end-users could accrue by providing DSR services. In particular, suitable models and studies are needed to quantify potential business cases for DSR from small commercial and residential end-users. Such models and studies should consider the technical and physical characteristics of the power system and demand resources, together with the economic conditions of the power market. In addition, the majority of research focuses on provision of energy arbitrage or ancillary services, with very little attention to DSR services for network capacity support. Accordingly, this paper presents comprehensive techno-economic methodologies for the quantification of three capacity-based business cases for DSR from small commercial and residential end-users. Case study results applied to a UK context indicate that, if the appropriate regulatory framework is put in place, services for capacity support to both DNOs and TSOs can result into potentially attractive business cases for DSR from small end-users with minimum impact on their comfort level.

Does devolution increase accountability? Empirical evidence from the implementation of European Union Cohesion Policy, Regional Studies. The period from the late 1990s to the early 2000s witnessed trends of decentralization, deconcentration or devolution of competencies from the national to the sub-national levels in a variety of countries. Implicit or explicit in many of the discussions about devolution is the assumption that by bringing the design and delivery of policy 'closer to the people', it increases accountability. The main proposition of this paper is to test this common assumption. Focusing, as a test case, on the implementation of European Union Cohesion Policy in two meso-level territorial units with recent experience of devolution, the paper investigates empirically whether the new, devolved institutional framework within which the policy operates is indeed more conducive to accountability.","Univ Strathclyde, European Policies Res Ctr, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, Glasgow G1 1QE, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Polverari, L (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, European Policies Res Ctr, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, 40 George St, Glasgow G1 1QE, Lanark, Scotland.",laura.polverari@strath.ac.uk,"Polverari, Laura/AAL-7630-2020",,,,,,44,21,21,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Retail electric companies can offer dynamic pricing to residential electricity customers via smart meter-enabled tariffs that proxy the cost to procure electricity on the wholesale market. Current investments in the smart metering necessary to implement dynamic tariffs show policy makers' resolve for enabling responsive demand and realizing its benefits. However, despite these benefits and the potential bill savings these tariffs can offer, adoption among residential customers remains at low levels. Using a choice experiment approach, this paper seeks to determine whether disclosing the environmental and system benefits of dynamic tariffs to residential customers can increase adoption. Although sampling and design issues preclude wide generalization, we found that our environmentally conscious respondents reduced their required discount to switch to dynamic tariffs around 10% in response to higher awareness of environmental and system benefits.

These migrant workers have limited access to subsidies and the local collective forest due to the household registration system in China called hukou. To assess how these policy-based restrictions on access affect wood consumption and local communities, a case study was conducted in Manlin village, Xishuangbanna, undertaking a household and weight survey with local and immigrant households. The results show no significant difference in firewood consumption between the subpopulations, despite predominantly more local than immigrant households have access to subsidised alternative energy sources. On the other hand, limited access to the collective forest is found to influence the choice of housing materials and living standards in immigrant households as they cannot access timber or afford brick houses. This paper highlights rural issues connected to the hukou system and suggests that rural energy and resource policies should take the growing population of immigrant workers into consideration in future to expand the reach of the polices to the de facto and not only de jure rural population and thus optimise policy efficiency.

Using a novel combination of datasets and a longitudinal research design, we investigate the influence of different policy measures in a sample of OECD countries to suggest an effective policy mix which could tackle failures in the market for clean energy. The results call for technology-specific policies which take into account actual market conditions and technology maturity. To improve the conditions for institutional investments, advisable policy instruments include economic and fiscal incentives such as feed-in tariffs (FIT), especially for less mature technologies. Additionally, market-based instruments such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emission trading systems for mature technologies should be included. These policy measures directly impact the risk and return structure of RE projects. Supplementing these with regulatory measures such as codes and standards (e.g. RPS) and long-term strategic planning could further strengthen the context for RE investments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the recent proliferation of expert elicitation studies raises questions about the reliability and comparability of the results. In this paper, we standardize disparate expert elicitation data from five EU and US studies, involving 65 experts, of the future costs of photovoltaics (PV) and evaluate the impact of expert and study characteristics on the elicited metrics. The results for PV suggest that in-person elicitations are associated with more optimistic 2030 PV cost estimates and in some models with a larger range of uncertainty than online elicitations. Unlike in previous results on nuclear power, expert affiliation type and nationality do not affect central estimates. Some specifications suggest that EU experts are more optimistic about breakthroughs, but they are also less confident in that they provide larger ranges of estimates than do US experts. Higher R&D investment is associated with lower future costs. Rather than increasing confidence, high R&D increases uncertainty about future costs, mainly because it improves the base case (low cost) outcomes more than it improves the worst case (high cost) outcomes.

Two popular methodologies are applied - stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) - to measure productive efficiency. The empirical findings are summarized as follows: (1) agglomeration economies improve productive efficiency; (2) fiscal transfer negatively influences productive efficiency; (3) those two findings are observed for aggregated manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries, and for sectors in manufacturing industries; and (4) the importance of agglomeration economies for regional industries has increased in recent years.

Based on this motivation it develops a multisector framework to derive the growth impact of energy from first principles. The structural model is empirically estimated for a sample of 37 developed countries with five-year average data over the period 1975-2009. Estimations of both separate equations and simultaneous systems of equations are performed. The empirical results show a negative impact of energy use on investments in physical capital and knowledge formation. The estimations of simultaneous equations exhibit a dynamic effect of energy use: decreasing energy input and increasing energy prices induce additional investments fostering long-run growth. The growth effect counteracts the negative static effects of lower energy use. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Huge improvements in energy consumption intensity can be made by improving this technology. To evaluate the potential for energy-saving and CO2 emissions reduction in China's cement industry between 2010 and 2020, a model was developed based on the Asian-Pacific Integrated Model (AIM). Three scenarios (S1, S2 and S3) were developed to describe future technology policy measures in relation to the development of the cement industry. Results show that scenario S3 would realize the potential for CO2 emissions mitigation of 361.0 million tons, accounting for 25.24% of the predicted emissions, with an additional energy saving potential of 39.0 million tons of coal equivalent by 2020. Technology promotion and industrial structure adjustment are the main measures that can lead to energy savings. Structural adjustment is the most important approach to reduce the CO2 emissions from the cement industry; the resulting potential for CO2 emissions reduction will be increasingly large, even exceeding 50% after 2016.

The present study attempts to conduct an overview on the state of the higher education national system with the purpose of making improvements to it. Firstly, the paper consists of presenting the general data of the context in which the Romanian higher education is situated. The SWOT analysis conducted in various universities from Romania, are summarized, following with the broad shaping of the elements that define the quality of higher education. Secondly, the study aims to conduct a statistical survey among Romanian students for the assessment of general trends in their opinion upon the discussed topic. As the actual beneficiaries of the services offered by the Romanian universities, the students have a significant importance and thus, based on the answers, we prepare from their perspective a SWOT analysis of the Romanian higher education quality.

Residential building energy performance certificates indicate a theoretical energy use based on standardised assumptions about occupancy and energy service demand and are a market signal about the energy performance of a property. This paper quantifies the empirical relationship between households' expenditure on fuel and building energy performance using household expenditure survey data from the Republic of Ireland. The extent of this relationship, i.e. the size of the elasticity parameter, is of direct relevance to policy makers in the context of energy efficiency and climate policy targets.

The following thesis is widely popular: higher propensity to exchange knowledge (in the range of open innovation conception) contributes to improving innovation potential. Therefore, the main purpose of this article is to determine the existing relations between openness to innovation (open innovation) and innovation potential. The specific objectives include: examining the level of openness of SMEs (measured by propensity for cooperation with the environment), taking into account a number of variables. as well as the correlation (and its strength) between these two elements. The research was conducted in 2013/2014 in the framework of research project: The concept of open innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises - models, trends and determinants of development (UMO-2012/07/B/HS4/03085). In order to implement the objectives and verify the research hypotheses, diagnostics was based on conducting direct interviews with selected companies by means of the CATI method using a survey form. The study encompassed the companies which over the last three years conducted innovation activities involving the implementation of innovative solutions in different areas.(C) 2015 The Authors.

Governments in both over-developed and under-developed countries are forced to square the circle between climate crisis and energy policy. Across these contexts the policy imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions cascades into energy policy, and into wider fields of social and political life. The article investigates this process, advancing the concept of a 'climate dialectic' in policy change. From this perspective, the article develops a critique of climate policies as they have emerged in Germany and India. This positions Germany, a high income post-industrial society, with India, a low-income industrialising country. Key climate and energy initiatives from each country are compared and discussed in terms of a common effort at expanded development opportunities. In this respect, with the key objective of maintaining 'growth as usual', the persistence of coal-fired power and coal extraction becomes highly politicised. Energy policies are found to be increasingly embedded in the wider 'climate dialectic', forcing new, more transformative possibilities onto the agenda.

We focus on the contrasting roles of different trader types. We find evidence of a positive and significant trading activity-volatility relation, which appears to be stronger when accounting for trader type. The positive relation can be mainly attributed to energy providers. in contrast, industrial companies seem to have traded more frequently when volatility levels were lower. Finally, the non-liable players, represented by financial intermediaries, appear to have acted as a flexible counterparty, trading more with the energy sector when volatility was higher, and more with the industrial firms when volatility was lower. We discuss possible explanations for these contrasted positions. Understanding the trading activity-volatility link is relevant for evaluating the efficiency of the EU ETS. Although the relation is generally positive, many players remained often inactive and traded mostly when volatility levels were lower. Policies targeting the engagement of less active players could lead to a smoother incorporation of information into prices and to an increase in market efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using proprietary data from nearly 1.8 million leases, we estimate that the six major shale plays generated $39 billion in private royalties in 2014. There is limited pass-through of resource abundance into royalty rates. A doubling of the ultimate recovery of the average well in a county increases the average royalty rate by 1-2 percentage points (a 6-11 percent increase). Thus, mineral owners benefit from resource abundance primarily through a quantity effect, not through negotiating better lease terms from extraction firms. The low pass-through likely reflects a combination of firms exercising market power in private leasing markets and uncertainty over the value of resource endowments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the coming decades, several regions of the world are expected to experience a decrease in water resource availability, in part due to climate change. The dependence of the energy sector on water resources calls for an active effort to adapt to the possible scenarios. This paper presents a novel model that addresses the direct impacts of regional and temporal water shortages on energy operation and investment decisions. The paper investigates the costs and benefits of adapting the energy sector to climate-induced water scarcity. The results show that the increase in costs for an energy plan that considers future water stress is relatively small as compared to one which ignores it. A plan which ignores water constraints, however, may lead to significant economic damages when actually exposed to water shortages. The results also highlight the value of the availability of water for the energy sector, which is significantly higher than existing prices. The paper concludes that the potential benefits to be gained by integrating energy and water models can be considerable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We measured homeowners' perceptions about water quality using the water quality ladder discussed by Mitchell and Carson in a stated preference mechanism to estimate the value of water quality changes and their linkage to property values. We used a pivot-style experimental design approach and two different design methods in developing the choice experiment. In empirical estimation we applied econometric approaches that permit flexible structures in error components of the utility function. The results indicate the presence of heteroscedasticity across choice alternatives. We found no influence of experimental design methods on the unobserved components of the utility function for the hypothetical choice alternatives. We find that the economic impacts of improvement and stabilization of water quality in the lake are substantial and that the additional property tax benefits generated by the water quality improvements would be sufficient to cover the costs of creating the improvement.,"[Kim, Hyun No] Korea Environm Inst, Environm Policy Res Grp, Bldg B,370 Sicheong Daero, Sejong 30147, South Korea; [Boxall, Peter C.; Adamowicz, W.

The main objective was twofold: to evaluate the performance gap in these dwellings before and after the renovation and to establish what renovation measures achieve the highest reduction of consumption, particularly in practice (actual savings). The results showed large performance gaps in dwellings with low R and high U values, local heating systems, changes from a non-condensing into a condensing boiler and upgrades to a natural ventilation system. Regarding the actual effectiveness of renovation measures, replacement of old gas boilers with more efficient ones yields the highest energy reduction, followed by deep improvements of windows. Installing mechanical ventilation yields a small reduction compared to other measures, but still much larger than theoretically expected. The paper shows once more that the calculation method currently in use cannot be considered accurate if compared to actual consumption. The study demonstrated that unrealistic theoretical efficiencies of heating systems and insulation values are causing a part of the performance gap. Nowadays, large datasets of buildings thermal performance and actual consumption offer an opportunity to improve these misconceptions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

China also adopts feed-in tariff policy to attract greater investment in solar photovoltaic power generation. This study employs real options method to assess the optimal levels of feed-in tariffs in 30 provinces of China. The uncertainties in CO2 price and investment cost are considered. A method that integrates the backward dynamic programming algorithm and Least-Squares Monte Carlo method is used to solve the model. The results demonstrate that the feed-in tariffs of 30 provinces range from 0.68 RMB/kWh to 1.71 RMB/kWh, and the average level is 1.01 RMB/IcWh. On this basis, we find that the levels of sub-regional feed-in tariff announced in 2013 are no longer appropriate and should be adjusted as soon as possible. We have also identified the implications of technological progress and carbon emission trading schemes, as well as the importance of strengthening electricity transmission. It has been suggested that the Chinese government takes diverse measures, including increasing research and development investment, establishing and improving a nationwide carbon emission trading scheme and accelerating the construction of electricity-transmission infrastructure, to reduce the required feed-in tariff and promote the development of solar photovoltaic power generation.

This paper examines the impact of a change in East Asia's pricing benchmark and contract flexibility on the regional and global gas markets. The paper uses the Nexant World Gas Model, a linear program with global cost minimization as the objective. To our knowledge, this study on hub competition, price benchmark change and contract flexibility improvement in East Asia will be the first in the literature and have real policy relevance. The results show that both price benchmark change and contract flexibility improvements will create an overall benefit for the world and East Asia importers, but the impacts are different among exporters and importers. However, there is no evidence of competition among different benchmark hubs and no evidence that destination restrictions cause the Asia Premium. It implies that removal of destination clauses has higher priority than the change to hub indexation for Japan, Korea and Chinese Taipei, but both should be treated equally in China. The study also suggests that East Asian importers should cooperate among themselves and with exporters to facilitate the hub creation and contract changes in East Asia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The results from several panel unit root tests indicate that electricity consumption and output are stationary process at their levels for overall panel and the two specific groups. By using the OLS with regional fixed effects, this study finds that coefficient estimate of electricity consumption on output is statistically significant and positive for overall regions, coastal regions and non-coastal regions. In addition, the results from the Dumitrescu-Hurlin Granger causality test show that there is unidirectional causality running from agricultural output to electricity consumption for non-coastal regions, and there is bidirectional causality between agricultural electricity consumption and output for overall panel and coastal regions.

It claims that hybrid policies may combine distinct mechanisms to drive desirable objectives better than traditional policies. A policy cycle helps to frame the United Kingdom's Contracts for Difference and Capacity Market (CFD & CM) scheme as a case study. The CFD & CM policy emerged to address environmental and energy challenges through the deployment of renewable energy (RE) in a low-carbon economy, employing liberalization: Environmental protection is foremost in this scheme. The policy combines and improves on the elements of feed-in tariff (FIT) and quota obligation (QO), and strives to solve the problems of these traditional policies. It addresses regulatory uncertainty under FIT by employing private law mechanics to guarantee above-loss reward for low carbon generation, and addresses market uncertainty under QO by incentivizing the capacity to supply future low carbon energy based on projected demand, hence creating a predictable and stable market. It also accommodates other important commitments. Overall, the CFD & CM scheme is a hybrid policy that engages the energy market mainly for advancing the end goal of environmental protection. To thrive however, it needs to meet private sector interests substantially. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, annual new construction is growing fast, representing half of the world's total. The trend is expected to continue through the year 2050. Impressive demand for new residential and commercial construction, relative shorter average building lifetime, and higher material intensities have driven massive domestic production of energy intensive building materials such as cement and steel. This paper developed a bottom-up building stock turnover model to project the growths, retrofits and retirements of China's residential and commercial building floor space from 2010 to 2050. It also applied typical material intensities and energy intensities to estimate building materials demand and energy consumed to produce these building materials. By conducting scenario analyses of building lifetime, it identified significant potentials of building materials and energy demand conservation. This study underscored the importance of addressing building material efficiency, improving building lifetime and quality, and promoting compact urban development to reduce energy and environment consequences in China.

Community cohesion and village pubs in Northern England: an econometric study, Regional Studies. Pubs in England represent an important locus for regional development and rejuvenation, particularly in rural areas where they act as hubs for social aggregation and economic activity. Generally, village pubs are regarded as complementarities to other local services and amenities that exist within the area, such as sporting events, volunteering and charity initiatives, as well as business activities. This paper provides empirical support for this proposition by estimating the impact of pubs on an index measure of community cohesion. Using data from 715 rural parishes located across Northern England, the paper demonstrates the importance of pubs for maintaining rural areas in these regions.","[Mount, Matthew] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds LS6 1AN, W Yorkshire, England; [Cabras, Ignazio] Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",University of Leeds; Newcastle University - UK; Northumbria University,"Mount, M (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds LS6 1AN, W Yorkshire, England.;Cabras, I (通讯作者)，Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",m.p.mount@leeds.ac.uk; ignazio.cabras@northumbria.ac.uk,,"Cabras, Ignazio/0000-0002-3418-8553",British Academy/Leverhulme Trust [112786],British Academy/Leverhulme Trust,This work was supported by the British Academy/Leverhulme Trust [grant number 112786].,,46,29,30,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

However, empirical studies focusing on non-Western nations are limited. To fill this gap, this study intends to examine the electricity-saving potential of rural households in China using a unique data set from the China Residential Electricity Consumption Survey (CRECS) in collaboration with the China General Social Survey (CGSS), conducted nationwide at the household level in rural China. We use a stochastic frontier model, which allows us to decompose residential electricity consumption into the minimum necessary amount of consumption based on physical characteristics (e.g. house size, house age, number of televisions or refrigerators) and estimate the consumption slack (i.e. the amount of electricity consumption that could be saved), which depends on various factors. We find that rural households in China are generally efficient in electricity saving and the saving potential is affected by (fast) information feedback and social-demographic characteristics, instead of by the (averaged) electricity price, or energy efficiency labelling signals. In addition, we find no evidence of regional heterogeneity on electricity saving potential for rural households. Policy implications are derived. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, current energy markets can exhibit a phenomenon of investment cycles, which generate phases of under and over-capacity, and hence additional costs and risks for generation adequacy. To cope with these issues, new mechanisms, called capacity remuneration mechanisms (CRM), have been (or will be) implemented. This paper assesses the dynamic effects of two CRMs, the capacity market and the strategic reserve mechanism, and studies to what extent they can reduce the investment cycles. Generation costs and shortage costs of both mechanisms are also compared to conclude on their effectivity and economic efficiency. A simulation model, based on system dynamics, is developed to study the functioning of both CRMs and the related investment decisions. The results highlight the benefits of deploying CRMs to solve the adequacy issue: shortages are strongly reduced compared to an energy-only market. Besides, the capacity market appears to be more beneficial, since it experiences fewer shortages and generation costs are lower. These comparisons can be used by policy makers (in particular in Europe, where these two CRMs are mainly debated) to determine which CRM to adopt. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Including this factor decreased the economic potential considerably depending on the level of supply cost considered (at least 37% and 16% for an economic potential below 10 and 14 US cents/kWh, respectively). Its importance compared to other factors was secondary below 15 US cents/kWh. At higher costs it was secondary only to land use, and was more important than economic and technical factors. The impact of this factor was mixed across all regions of the world, given the heterogeneity of wind resources in remote and proximal areas. Regions where available resources decreased the most included the European Union, Japan, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The supply cost chosen to evaluate the economic potential and uncertainties influencing the estimation of distance to the closest urban area are critical for the assessment.

An econometric analysis of US public opinion,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,BP oil spill; Environmental belief; Offshore drilling; Ordinal probit; Binary probit,SAVING BEHAVIOR; ATTITUDES; POLICY; OIL; GENDER,"Offshore drilling in the United States (US) has been the subject of public and political discourse due to multiple reasons which include economic impact, energy security, and environmental hazard. Consequently, several polls have been conducted over time to gauge public attitude towards offshore drilling. Nevertheless, the economic literature on this issue is sparse. This paper contributes to the literature and analyzes support for offshore drilling based on demographic, economic, social, belief, and shock (e.g. spill) factors. The data is taken from ten nationwide surveys conducted before, during and after the British Petroleum (BP) oil spill and analyzed within the framework of discrete choice model. The results from an ordinal probit model demonstrate that age, annual household income, affiliation to Republican Party, and residence in oil-rich states positively affect the probability of strong support and reduce the probability of strong opposition for offshore drilling. In contrast, the female gender, higher education, association to Democratic Party, and environmental concern affect opinion in opposite direction. Marginal effects show that belief about environmental consequences of drilling has the highest impact on opinion. Binary probit model also yields a similar result and suggests that BP oil disaster resulted in a transient decrease in support for offshore drilling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Headquarter tasks agglomerate in major cities in developed countries, whereas labour-intensive tasks are shed to developing countries where off-shored tasks are geographical concentrated. The entire international supply chain is productivity and welfare-enhancing, raising the efficiency of human resource use. An international supply chain can also be a route for inclusive globalization. Such benefits are offset by potential risk of volatility deriving from idiosyncratic supply shocks triggered by powerful natural disasters and other reasons and from final demand shocks. This case study of East Asia illustrates these points. Resumen La internacionalizacion de la cadena de suministro esta promoviendo una nueva cascada de aglomeracion y dispersion. Las tareas de la sede central se aglomeran en las ciudades principales de los paises desarrollados, mientras que las labores mas intensas se dejan para los paises en desarrollo, donde las tareas externalizadas se concentran geograficamente. La totalidad de la cadena de suministro internacional mejora la productividad y el bienestar social, lo que aumenta la eficiencia del uso de los recursos humanos. Una cadena de suministro internacional puede ser tambien una via para la globalizacion inclusiva. Tales beneficios se ven contrarrestados por el riesgo potencial de la volatilidad derivada de perturbaciones idiosincraticas de la oferta, provocadas por grandes desastres naturales u otros motivos, y por perturbaciones finales de la demanda.

The diversity approach is advocated as a most appropriate planning methodology for the optimal energy mix (Hickey et al., 2010). Shannon Wiener Index (SWI), which is the most cited diversity metric has been used to assess power systems diversity mainly from an energy perspective. To our best knowledge, there is no rigorous justification why energy has been the main variable used in diversification exercises rather than other variables such as capacity. We use a stylized power generation framework to show that diversity based on energy or capacity could lead to different outcomes in terms of vulnerability to fuel exposure, among others. We also introduce a Shannon Wiener Index ratio (SWIR) that we believe captures better the diversity of a power system compared to the standard SWI. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that nonrenewable energy promises greater benefits for ECOWAS economic transition, with output elasticities averaging between 0.052-0.579 and -0.055 to 0.223 for nonrenewable energy and renewable energy respectively. Overall estimated technological progress is low (-0.5% to 2.6%); the bulk coming from input efficiency. Substitution elasticities (0.02-0.94) suggest potential for switching towards renewable energy. Notwithstanding, scale, economics and sitting problems inherent in renewable power generation challenge the opportunities for energy substitution. A sustainable policy solution, therefore, appears to be one favoring scaled and efficient electricity generation from fossil energy in the short-run with a gradual switch towards renewable power in the long-run. In general, the applied model provides insights that energy efficiency enhances sustainable growth by propelling technological advancement especially when technical change is scale-biased and factor-augmenting. The study also provides insights that impacts of exogenous shocks to inputs are temporary, and hence, do not jeopardize efforts aimed at scaling output through increased and efficient use of labor, capital and energy; especially nonrenewable energy.

Analysis of primary usage information from 1000 rural households revealed that electricity majorly replaced Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), generally used as a secondary cooking fuel, but did not influence a similar shift from traditional mud stoves as the primary cooking technology. Likewise, the shift from firewood to electricity as a primary cooking fuel was observed in only 5% of the households studied. Country level analysis indicates that rural households falling in lower monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) classes have lesser access to electricity and clean cooking options than those falling in higher MPCE classes. Again, only three states in India with high levels of rural household electrification report consumption statuses more than 82 kWh per month (the estimated mean for electricity consumption by induction stoves). Overall, the results of the study indicate that induction stoves will have limited potential in reducing the consumption of firewood and LPG if included in energy access programmes, that too only in regions where high levels of electrification exist (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In terms of structure, the paper goes back to the origins of regulation in the sector in Spain, before focusing on the formation of the monopoly and the peculiarities of regulation by contract, a process far removed from the general European PTT model.

This study, focussing primarily on aspects of economic impact analysis, estimates the development costs of shale gas extraction in both Australia and Europe, based on both direct and fiscal costs, and also suggests policy initiatives. The increasing liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments in Australia are already straining domestic gas supplies. Hence, the development of more natural gas resources has been given a high priority. However, a majority of the Australian shale resources is non-marine in origin and significantly different to the marine-type shales in the US. In addition, the challenges of high development costs and the lack of infrastructure, service capacity and effective government policy are inhibiting shale gas development. Increasing the attractiveness of low risk investment by new, local, developers is critical for Australian shale gas success, which will simultaneously increase domestic gas security. In the European context, unconventional gas development will be challenged by direct, rather than fiscal costs. High direct costs will translate into average overall gas development costs over $13/Mcf, which is well over the existing market price. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[De Silva, P. N.

This means that when we decide to visit a destination we have to rely on a set of images, descriptions, videos and information from which we extrapolate a mix of probably interesting elements able convince us and bring us towards the chosen place. For this purpose, is it possible to consider the search for a particular gastronomic product - presumably already experienced anywhere else - as a factor that could partially break down the intangibility of the destination? It is clear that the methods of territory tourist attraction don't work exclusively through the traditional communication levers but, in recent years, there are many alternative forms that allow the development of destinations. Among the most diffused ones, we can certainly consider food and beverage events, which more and more - are closely linked to other concepts today extremely popular, like the streetfood and craft beers. We are witnessing a rediscovery of traditional food values, together with the discovery of a new market segment dedicated to craft beer, which today is experiencing one of the maximum growth periods, reaching to touch quota 1000 in Italy, between microbreweries, brewpubs and beer firm. The matching with the streetfood is the piece that makes up the puzzle of this new model of tourism management. The objective of the study is to investigate about the economic value generated by these events, by measuring what are the material and immaterial benefits of which an area can benefit when it becomes the venue of these events.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the basic economic secondary data retrieved from the official NACE business statistics in the tourism industry and its individual sectors, specifically applied to the conditions of the Czech Republic. With this analysis, the reader will be informed about the concrete structure of tourism entities in a given state and the importance of identifying the economy of tourism on a national scale. Initially, the paper theoretically discusses the NACE classification, the importance of recording economic activities in various sectors and their further division. Theoretical knowledge is then applied using a practical example based on collection of statistical data. The practical layer of this paper deals firstly with primary findings from NACE statistics in selected European countries and their tourism structures. Subsequently, this data will be analyzed and processed in the conditions of the Czech Republic as to ascertain the sustainability of each tourism sector.

Although the average height had a rising trend in the long term, its evolution was irregular due to the influence of environmental and socioeconomic factors. The decline of height is particularly evident at three stages: firstly, during the pre-industrial boom and once the process had been initiated in the 1880s; secondly, from the end of the First World War until 1925 and, finally, during the years of the Civil War and its aftermath.

This paper describes the money illusion phenomenon and reviews current literature on this topic. The second half deals with a so-called Euro illusion, which is a form of money illusion suffered by economic agents during a transition period of change from national currencies to the single currency Euro. After analysis of empirical research conducted in major Euro-area countries the paper concludes that economic agents in Euro-area countries were in transitory period confused by the new nominal values of the Euro currency and made sub-optimal economic choices.

Based on the salient regions, the fixations are generated in sequence combined with the competition mechanism of WTA and inhibition of return mechanism. The fixations reflects the intensity of each salient region in the advertisement, which determines the priority of the visual effect on each visual element.

The abatement potentials estimated for these measures have been further used by many organizations to project future GHG emission reductions and plot Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC). However, the abatement potentials estimated for many of these measures can be highly uncertain as many of these measures are new, with limited sea trial information. Furthermore, the abatements obtained are highly dependent on ocean conditions, trading routes and sailing patterns. When the estimated abatement potentials are used for projections, these 'input' uncertainties are often not clearly displayed or accounted for, which can lead to overly optimistic or pessimistic outlooks. In this paper, we propose a methodology to systematically quantify and account for these input uncertainties on the overall abatement potential forecasts. We further propose improvements to MACCs to better reflect the uncertainties in marginal abatement costs and total emissions. This approach provides a fuller and more accurate picture of abatement forecasts and potential reductions achievable, and will be useful to policy makers and decision makers in the shipping industry to better assess the cost effective measures for CO2 emission reduction.

The typical Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) practice of modeling a pathway by reducing what is known about a model parameter to a single value to produce a single-point GHG emissions estimate has led to reports in literature on the GHG emissions differences between Electric Vehicles (EV) and conventional Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) to range significantly from below 10% to above 60%. In this study we performed a LCA, combined with a Monte Carlo stochastic simulation, to determine the uncertainty in GHG emission differences between EVs and gasoline ICEs, by taking into account of all the possible variations that may affect the lifecycle GHG emissions estimates for EVs and ICEs based on the technologies-already available in the market today. This study provides insights into the relative importance of the factors driving the lifecycle GHG emissions difference between the EVs and ICEs, and a measure of the probability for EVs providing benefits over ICEs globally today and projected to 2040.

Meeting the 80% greenhouse gas emission reduction target by 2050 is likely to require that heat related emissions of CO2 from buildings are near zero by 2050, and there is a 70% reduction in emissions from industry (from 1990 levels). Though it is clear that the use of the natural gas network will reduce over time, recent modelling suggests a limited residual role for gas by 2050 to help meet peaks in heat demand. High levels of uncertainty about the way in which heat will be decarbonised present a number of challenges to policy makers. This paper will explore the risks and uncertainties associated with the transition to a low carbon heat system in the UK as outlined by the 4th carbon budget review. The potential impact of key uncertainties on the levelised costs of heat technologies and the development of energy networks are explored using a sensitivity analysis approach. Policy changes required to decarbonise the heat sector are also examined. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Using a survey of German firms combined with time series information on patent applications obtained from the European Patent Office, we apply a comparison-group approach and estimate different treatment effect models to assess the notion of causality underlying this relationship. Besides accounting for observed and unobserved firm-specific heterogeneity, we thereby also control for the likely endogeneity of R&D collaboration as a strategic choice in the course of research and innovation activities. Our results for the period 2001-2007 indicate that engaging in R&D collaboration vis-a-vis a non-collaborative research strategy is related to higher outcome levels for a firm's key research and innovation indicators such as R&D and patent intensity. We also find that this latter link varies by firm size and the organizational type of cooperating partner, and especially those firms that simultaneously engage in research collaborations with other private businesses and research institutes/universities show above average innovation performance. In contrast, the notion of spatial proximity to research partners is shown to be of less importance. Our results may be of help for the future design of regional policies supporting the research and innovation activity of small firms in peripheral and remote locations outside large metropolitan areas.","[Mitze, Timo] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark; [Mitze, Timo] RWI, Essen, Germany; [Mitze, Timo] RCEA, Rimini, Italy; [Alecke, Bjorn] Gesell Finanz & Reg Analysen GEFRA, D-48143 Munster, Germany; [Reinkowski, Janina] Bayer Staatsministerium Finanzen Landesentwicklun, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Untiedt, Gerhard] Tech Univ Clausthal, Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany",University of Southern Denmark; TU Clausthal,"Mitze, T (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Alsion 2, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark.",tmitze@sam.sdu.dk; alecke@gefra-muenster.de; Janina.Reinkowski@stmflh.bayern.de; untiedt@gefra-muenster.de,,"Mitze, Timo/0000-0003-3799-5200",,,,,69,12,12,3,65,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

An argument often made is that rural households are more likely to be fuel poor due to the nature of rural housing stock and the more limited choice of energy sources in rural areas. This paper uses panel data to compare the level and dynamics of fuel poverty in rural and urban areas of the UK. In addition to descriptive analysis, discrete hazard models of fuel poverty exit and re-entry are estimated and used to assess the influence of housing and personal characteristics on the time spent in fuel poverty. The results indicate that, on average, the experience of fuel poverty in urban areas is longer with a higher probability of fuel poverty persistence. However, on average the rural fuel poor appear more vulnerable to energy price increases while living in private accommodation or a flat increases their probability of remaining fuel poor relative to their urban counterparts. These results indicate policy effectiveness may differ across rural and urban space. However, they also emphasise the limits of spatial targeting. Monitoring the dynamics of fuel poverty is important for ensuring that policy targets are effective and reaching those most in need. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To do so, we have developed a novel data set by linking company-level information from the German Renewable Energy Federation with administrative establishment-level data from the Institute for Employment Research. Descriptive evidence shows significant differences in wages and several other characteristics between renewable energy establishments and their sector peers. Our estimates give evidence that human capital and other establishment-level characteristics mostly explain the wage differential among manufacturers and energy providers. However, we find a persistent 'renewable energy wage premium' of more than ten percent in construction/installation activities and architectural/engineering services. We interpret this premium as a positive indirect effect of the promotion of renewable energies for the benefit of employees in renewable energy establishments within these two sectors.

Despite generous financial incentives the adoption rate is low. We use the option value framework, which takes into account the benefit of delaying investment in response to uncertainty, to examine the decision by households to invest in solar PV. Using a simulation model, we determine optimal adoption times, critical values of discounted benefits, and adoption rates over time for solar PV investments using data from Massachusetts. We find that the option value multiplier is 1.6, which implies that the discounted value of benefits from solar PV needs to exceed installation cost by 60% for investment to occur. Without any policies, median adoption time is eight years longer under the option value decision rule compared to the net present value decision rule where households equate discounted benefits to installation cost. Rebates and other financial incentives decrease adoption time, but their effect is attenuated if households apply the option value decision rule to solar PV investments. Results suggest that policies that reduce the uncertainty in returns from solar PV investments would be most effective at incentivizing adoption. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet an understanding of the processes, determinants, and consequences of household energy demand remains elusive. Conventional energy policy has overwhelmingly focused on improving energy efficiency of the buildings. This research applies a non-linear methodology and an interdisciplinary approach to household energy demand. Using data from the US residential sector (2009 Residential Energy Consumption Survey), this research performs Covariance Structure Analysis to isolate direct and indirect effects of household and housing characteristics on total annual domestic energy use. Outcomes uncover some of households' indirect effects on energy demand, which in this research mainly happen through household effects on building characteristics, highlighting the indirect role of household choices in shaping residential energy demand patterns. To maximize its efficiency in reducing energy demand and GHG emissions, this paper suggests that in addition to investing in energy efficient technologies, energy policy should incorporate indirect effects of household choices on the configuration of their future homes.

We develop a nine-region spatial equilibrium model for Japan's power market and simulate two-part situations: (a) none of the nuclear power plants can operate any longer and (b) gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) power plants are installed to cover the lost nuclear capacity. When all the nuclear power plants are shut down, the average power prices would rise by 1,5-3 yen/kWh. By replacing that lost capacity with GTCC power plants, we could compress the average price rise as high as 0.5-1.5 yen/kWh compared with the status quo. Their impact would differ by region on the basis of the share of nuclear power in their plant portfolios. After the nuclear power plant shutdown, regions with abundant nuclear capacity would not be able to afford to sell their power to other regions, which would cause less serious congestion at the inter-regional transmission links. The installation of GTCC power plants would make the plant portfolios more similar among regions and, thus, reduce inter-regional transmission further, which would very rarely cause congestion.

Econometric analysis shows that there is heterogeneity in steady-states across regions, and regional growth in per capita GDP and labour productivity are converging to these region-specific steady-states. Time-series approach to convergence confirms stochastic trend convergence in both indicators for several regions.

Our findings suggest that price adjustment lags vary in line with the predictions of optimal price setting models. Moreover, we find that the firms' reactions are asymmetric, and that these asymmetries cannot be fully explained by any single theoretical model of asymmetric price adjustment. Overall, these results suggest that the reaction to monetary policy shocks may depend on which firms or sectors are particularly affected by them and, therefore, that richer models are needed to fully understand the effects of monetary policy.","[Dias, Daniel A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Dias, Daniel A.] CEMAPRE, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Marques, Carlos Robalo] Banco Portugal, P-1150012 Lisbon, Portugal; [Martins, Fernando] Univ Lisbon, ISEG, Banco Portugal, P-1150012 Lisbon, Portugal; [Martins, Fernando] Univ Lusiada Lisboa, P-1150012 Lisbon, Portugal; [Silva, J.

This study investigates the role and utility of opinion leadership in photovoltaic (PV) system diffusion. Specifically, the study proposes, examines, and considers the implications of the hypothesis that there is a positive relationship between willingness to pay (WTP) for a PV system and opinion leadership on PV-system adoption. The investigation employed an internet-based questionnaire to assess the use of interpersonal communication in decision-making on adoption, to identify opinion leaders on adoption, and to characterize their WTP. The response pool consisted of 488 individuals who lived in a detached house, owned a residential PV system, and were responsible for making the decision to adopt the system. The results support the hypothesis. Considering that subsidization preferentially incentivizes households with greater WTP to adopt PV systems, this suggests that subsidization is more effective than purchases of PV power under feed-in tariffs in promoting the diffusion of residential PV systems through interpersonal communication.

This paper is concerned with the links that exist between the control of inter-organizational relationships and effects of proximity. It proposes a theoretical framework that explains how geographical and organizational proximities reinforce formal and informal control mechanisms. This framework is then used to analyse mechanisms of control by proximity in a French aerospace cluster. It is observed that formal and informal control is concentrated in a small number of groups located near the majority of the establishments' members of the cluster. It is also shown that informal control mechanisms require a stronger geographical proximity than formal control mechanisms in order to operate.","[Levy, Rachel] Univ Toulouse, LEREPS, Manufacture Tabacs, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Talbot, Damien] Univ Bordeaux, GREThA, CNRS, UMR 5113, F-33608 Pessac, France",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Toulouse (SciencePo Toulouse); Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Levy, R (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, LEREPS, Manufacture Tabacs, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",rachel.levy@iut-tlse3.fr; damien.talbot@u-bordeaux4.fr,,,,,,,46,27,27,2,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Rapid urbanisation and accompanying motorisation has created some of the most polluting cities in India and rising demand for oil is leading to higher imports, besides causing more CO2 emissions. The government of India wants to achieve the climate goals through a sustainability approach that simultaneously addresses other environment and developmental challenges. This paper analyses a sustainable low carbon transport (SILT) scenario based on sustainable strategies for passenger and freight mobility, vehicle technologies and fuel using global CO2 prices that correspond to 2 degrees C global stabilisation target. The scenarios span from years 2010 to 2050 and are analysed using the energy system model-ANSWER MARKAL. The SLCT scenario has improved energy security (cumulative oil demand lower by 3100 Mtoe), improved air quality (PM 2.5 emissions never exceed the existing levels) and the cumulative CO2 emissions are lower by 13 billion t CO2 thereby showing that achieving development objectives with CO2 co-benefits is feasible.

We use nonparametric two-stage data envelopment analysis technique to derive the efficiency scores, with a subsequent analysis of slacks associated with the optimization exercise which quantifies the extent of mis-utilization of resources. The main findings suggest that the city governments can provide the same levels of services by using resources lesser by 27 % of what they currently use. We also find that the extent of unproductive spending and under-provision of services are more pronounced in smaller cities. Mis-utilization of resources in factors like establishment and laborcost is more pronounced as the establishment expenditures and contractual payments in the laborcost component involve more leakages.","Shiv Nadar Univ, Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, India",Shiv Nadar University,"Bandyopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，Shiv Nadar Univ, Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, India.",simantib@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

California recently adopted an energy storage mandate to support its renewable portfolio standard, which requires 33% of delivered energy from renewables by 2020. The objective of this paper is to estimate the amount of energy storage that could be provided by residential thermostatically controlled loads, such as refrigerators and air conditioners, and the amount of revenue that could be earned by loads participating in ancillary services markets. We model load aggregations as virtual energy storage, and use simple dynamical system models and publicly available data to generate our resource and revenue estimates. We find that the resource potential is large: 10-40 GW/8-12 GWh, which is significantly more than that required by the mandate. We also find that regulation and spinning/non-spinning reserve revenues vary significantly depending upon type of load and, for heat pumps and air conditioners, climate zone. For example, mean regulation revenues for refrigerators are $11/year, for electric water heaters are $24/year, for air conditioners are $0-32/year, and for heat pumps are $22-56/year. Both consumer choices, such as appliance settings, and policy, such as the design of ancillary service compensation and appliance standards, could increase revenue potentials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Over the last several decades, Montreal has built an international reputation as a 'circus city'. This reputation is tied to the tremendous success of Cirque du Soleil, but also related to the presence of a number of intermediaries in the city. This paper examines the role of one such intermediary - the ecole nationale de cirque (National Circus School). The National Circus School is one of the only schools in North America offering an accredited programme in circus arts. It is argued that the school plays an important role in the development of the local circus arts cluster and circus arts conventions by providing training and skill development, and by forging important networks. In particular, this paper examines how the school fosters 'know-how', 'know-who' and 'know-what'.","[Rantisi, Norma M.] Concordia Univ, Dept Geog Planning & Environm, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [Leslie, Deborah] Univ Toronto, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada",Concordia University - Canada; University of Toronto,"Rantisi, NM (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, Dept Geog Planning & Environm, 1455 Maisonneuve Blvd West, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",norma.rantisi@gmail.com; deborah.leslie@utoronto.ca,"Rantisi, Norma/AHC-3681-2022",,,,,,68,14,18,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In 2000, the Delhi government privatized electricity distribution to three private distribution companies. Most research was concerned with the impact of privatization on energy reliability, tariff settings and regulation issues. This paper looks at two under-researched themes: the expansion of services to poorer neighborhoods and the rollout of clean energy policies. This focus allows to unpack the materiality of socio-technical systems, to analyze how energy infrastructures are being technically deployed on the ground and to identify which social approach is used. To detail the specific practices of each company provides a more nuanced and accurate understanding of the reform. In-depth analysis of the three private utilities show that they interpret the reform mandate differently: they use a varied range of technical tools; they respond differently to social concerns in poorer neighborhoods; and they have distinctive internal management choices and corporate cultures. All these four factors can strengthen or undermine the transition towards increased access and clean energy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies have primarily focused on a hybrid policy of emission regulation that included an emission cap and permit price ceiling in a single period model, we extend this literature by developing such an optimal hybrid model in a multi-period framework where banking and borrowing of emission permits is allowed. In our model, we compare the case of a regulator who sets the emission cap and price ceiling to be consistent with a long run emission objective with the case of a regulator who occasionally is motivated to deviate from the optimal long run regulatory policy in order to correct for unexpected but exceptionally high emissions.

When the dimension of response variables is considerably larger than the sample size, it is a nontrivial task to assess whether there are linear relationships between the variables. It is even more challenging to determine whether a set of explanatory variables can explain those relationships. To this end, we develop a bias-corrected test to examine the significance of the off-diagonal elements of the residual covariance matrix after adjusting for the contribution from explanatory variables. We show that the resulting test is asymptotically normal.

These businesses, which tended to integrate spinning -specially since the diffusion of the jenny - and weaving, operated in the markets of raw cotton and unbleached calicoes. The former was very competitive and the commodity was mainly paid in cash or on short-term credit. In the latter, manufacturers sold the unbleached calicoes to merchants or printing-manufacturers and they were paid on medium-term credit. According to our findings, in both the markets, cotton-weaving manufacturers were not constrained significantly by the market power of agents that acted at the same time as suppliers of raw cotton and buyers of grey calicoes.","Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Berenguer, JMB (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,4,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

In Germany, the public administrations have to declare their detected individual chances and threads for a sustainable allocation of services to the citizens in the annual status report. A theoretical introduction considering risk management and risk awareness in public administration shows the asymmetries between public and private sector. A relationship between recognized risks and the financial status is presented to show the different estimations of the support by risk management. The findings show a spectrum from complains about the entire financial situation to a very clear and distinct description of roots, causes and possible countermeasures for threats and chances. As one result it has to be accepted that a public entrepreneur has to cope with risk and uncertainty as component of the environment of public management; decisions and their developments have to be observed, evaluated and, in the case of adverse expectations measures, established to minimize the negative consequences for sustainable execution of operations in public administration.

It was conditioned by the semiperipheral relation of Russia to Western Europe.(1) The idea that Russia is neither East nor West but a peculiar East-West (Vostok-Zapad) area was one of the cherished ideas of Russian philosophy of history.(2) The Russian ruling classes always experienced some pressure from expansion of the Western countries which were more developed economically and stronger militarily. The fear of falling behind its European competitors haunted the Russian state and prompted regular attempts at modernization. These attempts required great efforts to concentrate resources in the hands of the state. From this followed the need to organize the population of the vast territories that constituted the Russian Empire or the Soviet state. Modernization, in response to pressures from the core, has thus been the major reason for Eurasian integration, but its effectiveness has depended on the inner properties of the social system of the region. This chapter is mainly focused on the major institutional obstacles to integration of the former Soviet Union republics, with some attention being paid to the international circumstances of that process.","[Dzarasov, Ruslan] Russian Acad Sci, Cent Inst Econ & Math, Moscow, Russia; [Dzarasov, Ruslan] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Lab Market Econ Studies, Moscow, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences; Central Economics & Mathematics Institute RAS; Lomonosov Moscow State University,"Dzarasov, R (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Cent Inst Econ & Math, Moscow, Russia.",,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,0,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN,LONDON,"4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, LONDON, ENGLAND",,,978-1-137-47296-0; 978-1-137-47295-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,153,168,,,,,,16,Area Studies; Economics; International Relations; Political Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,BQ9SG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000626723600010,0

The trend analysis shows that invention in this field has experienced enormous growth and also diversification over the past 22 years. The co-occurrence network of burst technology domains reveals that technology domains constantly burst, and innovative progress in nanotechnology has tremendously contributed to energy production, storage, conversion and harvesting and so on. Nano-energy patented inventions mainly come from a combinatorial process with a very limited role of developing brand-new technological capabilities. Reusing existing technological capabilities including recombination reuse, recombination creation and single reuse is the primary source of inventions. For the impacts of technology networks' embeddedness, we find that network tie strength suppresses the growth of technological knowledge domains, and network status and convergence both facilitate the growth of technological knowledge domains. We expect that this study will provide some enlightenment for inventing or creating new knowledge in emerging fields in complex technological environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

One of these developments is local government empowerment to administrate several activities. West Sulawesi was launched as new a province to improve people service in Sulawesi Island. An evaluation of the establishment in this region was needed after decades. Therefore, this study will explore the practices conducted in West Sulawesi Province in Indonesia to realize clean government and good governance. The research employed a qualitative approach. In-depth interviews and observations were performed for collecting data. Manual interviews and observations served as instruments during data collection. This study shows that there are nine steps completed in empowering administration. It started from paradigm shifting to encourage people to work in new conditions. In addition, when paradigm is changed, it is easier to enhance the transformation and moving forward to create improvement. Finally, bureaucracy movement shows an improvement in institutional capacity to encourage administrator in expanding service. (C) 2015 The Authors.

During the Mexican revolution, hundreds of national petroleum companies were organized in the country, the majority of modest capital and limited organizational structure. In the context of an industry controlled by monopolies, several dozen small companies produced sufficient levels to take part in the market. Surprisingly, however, the most dynamic generated millions of barrels of oil and enormous earnings, temporarily surpassing production levels of the large foreign corporations. Their participation in the sector, nevertheless, often was ephemeral and rather unorthodox, with little possibility of long-term survival and development into larger companies.","Univ Autonoma Tamaulipas Mexico, Tamaulipas, Mexico",,"Elizondo, RH (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Tamaulipas Mexico, Tamaulipas, Mexico.",,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,5,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

This is because workers might not always view appraisals as a positive measure. When the employees perceive appraisals to be fair, it emits positive attitude and vice versa. This study aimed to understand the perceptions of employees towards performance appraisals. Data (n=100) was gathered through questionnaires and administered to workers in the banks of Northern Cyprus. An overall perception of respondents shows a positive rating towards interpersonal justice, distributive justice and procedural justice in performance appraisal (PA). While the respondents agreed to rating PA system positively, metrics that define high satisfaction with the PA system was statistically low and non-significant. This can be due to the fact that the majority of these staff perceives PA to be compulsory or organizational routines, and did not evidently see how it affects their job or their career. Furthermore, satisfaction with PA system can only be translated when the employees see that a positive appraisal results in pay rise, promotion, training and development, awards, other monetary incentives such as benefits and insurance.

The SNC carried out new bookkeeping rules concerning the way government grants related to assets. While in the past these grants were treated as liabilities during the economic life of the asset, now the Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards n.degrees 22 (NCRF n.degrees 22) report them as an item of equity capital. This procedure is an exception to the rules stated in IAS. The aim of this study is to analyze whatever the accounting for government grants impact on equity capital and, consequently on financial ratios, of Portuguese companies in the agricultural sector. We collect financial information of 2009, from 124 enterprises operating in the agricultural sector, which had report subsidies for investment. The sample was draw from SABI data base. Our model used the amounts reported as Accrued and deferred income - Income taxes - Subsidies for Investments (old bookkeeping rules), at 31/12/2009, and estimates the values of the equity capital and financial ratios. We found a positive variation in equity capital, which corresponds to an increase of nearly 4.5%. Consequently it caused an increase of 4.7% in the indicator of financial autonomy, and also had a positive impact on the solvency ratio, with an average variation greater than 11%. Our research shows that the new bookkeeping rules have important implication in the values of some financial ratios of Portuguese companies. Even though the new bookkeeping procedures are different from those stated in IAS n degrees 20, Portugal opted by the same rules as those that Spain and France follow since long time ago and thus Portuguese companies are in equal competition condition to apply European Programs for financial support of investment projects, since it requires some minimum values at certain ratios.

Its energy-related CO2 emissions have been growing and in 2013 amounted to 3.6% of total global emissions. About 40% of ASEAN's energy-related CO2 emissions are currently attributable to electricity production. In view of this high share, we study the CO2 emissions of ASEAN's electricity production sector with a focus on the aggregate emission intensity (ACI) given by the level of CO2 emissions for each unit of electricity produced. Drivers of ACI are analysed for individual countries and spatial analysis is conducted by comparing factors contributing to differences between the ACIs of individual countries and that of the ASEAN average. Arising from these analyses and in light of the current developments, it is concluded that drastic actions need to be taken both at the national and regional levels in order to reduce growth in the region's electricity-related CO2 emissions. Two key policy issues, namely overcoming national circumstances to improve electricity generation mix and improving power generation efficiency, are further discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

An energy conservation policy was implemented in 1995 to require industries to reduce their energy intensity (EI) and consumption immediately. This study investigates the effectiveness of the policy between 1995 and 2010 using the hybrid input-output approach. Surprisingly, El improvement was observed in only a few sectors, such as transportation, non-metallic, paper, and textile. An embodied energy decomposition analysis revealed that while households were the largest energy consumer in 1995, energy consumption in exports exceeded that of households in 2000, 2005 and 2010. In addition, structural decomposition analysis revealed the final demand effect was the strongest factor in determining the efficacy of energy conservation, whereas the energy efficiency effect was not an effective factor as expected for decreasing energy consumption. Policy barriers and conflicting economic plans were factors that affected the outcome of these energy policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The setting allows the number of time-varying regressors to be larger than the sample size. To make informative estimation and inference feasible, we require that the overall contribution of the time-varying variables after eliminating the individual specific heterogeneity can be captured by a relatively small number of the available variables whose identities are unknown. This restriction allows the problem-of estimation to proceed as a variable selection problem. Importantly, we treat the individual specific heterogeneity as fixed effects which allows this heterogeneity to be related to the observed time-varying variables in an unspecified way and allows that this heterogeneity may differ for all individuals. Within this framework, we provide procedures that give uniformly valid inference over a fixed subset of parameters in the canonical linear fixed effects model and over coefficients on a fixed vector of endogenous variables in panel data instrumental variable models with fixed effects and many instruments.

We show that this impact can be predicted from the spatial structure of the settlements. Applying this approach to Germany, we identify those regions where the energy potential very sensitively reacts to a change in the minimum distance. In relative terms the reduction of the energy potential is maximal in the north-west and the south-east of Germany. In absolute terms it is maximal in the north.

The explanatory variables considered were the number of households, effective consumption of families as a proxy for family income, and electricity tariff for households. To deal with the power generation crisis of 2001 we have introduced a dummy variable in the form of a step function. With such explanatory variables, we were able to account for the reduction of household electricity consumption caused by the policies conducted in 2001 and their permanent consequences. The regression presented coefficient of determination of 0.9892, and the several statistic tests conducted assured the existence of long-term relation between the electricity consumption in residences and the explanatory variables. The obtained elasticities for the household consumption of electricity with respect to number of residences, family income and residential tariff of electricity were 1.534 +/- 0.095, 0.189 +/- 0.049, and -0.230 +/- 0.060, respectively. These results allowed understanding the evolution over time of the household consumption of electricity in Brazil. They suggest that the electric sector in Brazil should pursue an active policy to manage demand of residential electricity using tariffs as a means to control it. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The existing literature has shown some factors that have driven the improvement in China's energy productivity. However, these studies do little to tackle the role of Chinese local officials. Political promotions can be seen as the most important career incentive for Chinese local officials. Hence, we intend to study whether energy productivity affects Chinese local officials' promotions in this paper. The data of position changes for the 31 provincial governors during 1978-2012 are utilized. We adopted probit models to empirically examine the correlation between provincial governors' political promotions and energy productivity. The empirical results demonstrate that (1) energy productivity has a significantly positive impact on provincial governors' political promotions in China, meaning that the provincial governors have the momentum to improve energy productivity; and (2) the effect of energy productivity on provincial governors' political promotions has evolved, dynamically changing along with the transformation of the economic growth mode and the adjustment of the local officials' promotion mechanism.

A panel data analysis from 1998 to 2007 across 20 Italian regions identifies the primary drivers of renewable energy patenting activity. As expected, the localised stock of knowledge, local researchers and regional public research subsidies contribute significantly to the development of innovation activities. Additionally, regional characteristics, such as regional energy dependence and hydroelectric resources, are effective in determining the RET innovation patterns. Specifically, regional hydroelectric power acts as a substitute input and hence hampers the innovation activities in the field of RET. Finally, RET innovation activities depend to a limited extent on the political orientation of regional councils, thereby confirming prior research on the role of social acceptance of and political support for technology development. Highlighting the role of local resources and local policies for RET innovation activities, the present research has potential implications for economies that strive to become more self-reliant and less import intensive in the knowledge sector.","[Corsatea, Teodora Diana] JRC, Inst Energy & Transport, Petten, Netherlands; [Corsatea, Teodora Diana] ICER, Turin, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Energy & Transport (IET),"Corsatea, TD (通讯作者)，JRC, Inst Energy & Transport, Petten, Netherlands.;Corsatea, TD (通讯作者)，ICER, Turin, Italy.",Teodora.Corsatea@ec.europa.eu,,,"International Centre for Economic Research (ICER), Turin, Italy","International Centre for Economic Research (ICER), Turin, Italy","I thank Silvana Dalmazzone for her valuable support during the three-month fellowship financed by the International Centre for Economic Research (ICER), Turin, Italy.

The project attempted to strand these oil assets in order to protect biodiversity, respect the territory of indigenous peoples, combat climate change, and encourage more sustainable economic development The Yasuni-ITT proposal would have had the international community pay Ecuador $3.6 billion roughly half the value of the oil found there in exchange for not developing the Ishpingo Tambococha Tiputini (ITT) oilfields. Funds would have been placed into social and environmental development programs and the promotion of domestic renewable energy. Instead, the project collected only $13 million and succumbed to a series of challenges including limited financing, intense political pressure, a national commitment to oil, and carbon leakage. This article summarizes the history, benefits, and insurmountable obstacles facing the Yasuni-ITT Initiative and presents six broader lessons and implications for climate and energy analysts, practitioners, and policymakers. It questions the political viability of and serves as a stark warning against those promoting and advocating policies centered on carbon budgets, stranded assets, negative emissions, and carbon revenue streams.

We adopt the basic concepts of between-group difference (or alienation) and within-group similarity (or identification) from the income [bi]polarization literature; but we allow for asymmetric degrees of between-group antagonism in the alienation function, and construct a more effective identification function using both the relative degree of within-group clustering and the group size. To facilitate statistical inference, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the proposed measure using results from U-statistics. As the new measure is general enough to include existing income polarization indices as well as the Gini index as special cases, the asymptotic result can be readily applied to these popular indices. Evidence from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data suggests that, while the level of social tension shows an upward trend over the sample period of 1981 to 2005, government's taxes and transfers have been effective in reducing the level of social tension significantly.","[Lee, Yoonseok] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Lee, Yoonseok] Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Shin, Donggyun] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 130701, South Korea",Syracuse University; Syracuse University; Kyung Hee University,"Lee, Y (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.;Lee, Y (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",ylee41@maxwell.syr.edu; dgshin@khu.ac.kr,,"Lee, Yoonseok/0000-0002-8379-0700",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean government [NRF-2014S1A3A2044456],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean government,"The authors acknowledge valuable comments from the editor, the associate editor, and anonymous referees.

The study aim to establish whether the EKC exist in period of energy disaster and deteriorating income. To ensure this, data from 1961 to 2012 was used while the Zivot-Andrew structural break test, the ARDL bounds test were applied, and these were validated using the innovation accounting test. The finding of the study established the existence of inverted-U shape, suggesting the presence of EKC despite the deteriorating income of the country. With the discovery of the existence of EKC in this study despite the dwindling productivity and revenue in Japan, this study challenged the EKC hypothesis and all existing studies on EKC, by establishing that natural disasters are in themselves strong causative agents for the EKC to unfold and it is immaterial whether the economic fortunes of a country is increasing or decreasing. The study further discovered energy consumption to be the major contributor of environmental degradation in Japan, while exports declines CO2 emissions, but imports adds to environmental degradation. On the growth prospects of the Japanese economy after the crisis, the study discovered how energy consumption, exports, and imports contribute 33.55%, 1.027% and 7.126% to the country's economic growth respectively; in return a minimum of 16.24%, 23.89% and 44.18% of CO2 emissions was discovered.

This article uses concepts from Bayesian inference and the maximum entropy principle to estimate the prior probability distribution, uncertainty, and correlations of source data when such information is not explicitly provided. In the absence of additional information, an isolated datum is described by a truncated Gaussian distribution, and if an uncertainty estimate is missing, its prior equals the best guess. When the sum of a set of disaggregate data is constrained to match an aggregate datum, it is possible to determine the prior correlations among disaggregate data. If aggregate uncertainty is missing, all prior correlations are positive. If aggregate uncertainty is available, prior correlations can be either all positive, all negative, or a mix of both. An empirical example is presented, which reports relative uncertainties and correlation priors for the County Business Patterns database. In this example, relative uncertainties range from 1% to 80% and 20% of data pairs exhibit correlations below -0.9 or above 0.9.

China has experienced a remarkable explosion of designated eco-cities since the year 2000, with Tianjin-Binhai becoming the best-practice model. Embedded in broader political economic changes, shifting multi-scalar regimes of environmental governance have shaped this efflorescence. Applying eco-state restructuring, this paper argues that eco-city construction became a new strategic project after the 2000s, driven by central state-driven model cities and assessment initiatives. This also led to a very different kind of best practice' eco-city model: Tianjin-Binhai, a China-Singapore collaboration in which greenness is manufactured rather than adapted. Notwithstanding significant implementation problems, Tianjin-Binhai's status as best practice persists, raising questions about what it means to claim eco-city status.","[Chang, I-Chun Catherine] Macalester Coll, Dept Geog, 1600 Grand Ave, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Leitner, Helga; Sheppard, Eric] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, 1255 Bunche Hall,Box 951524, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",Macalester College; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Chang, ICC (通讯作者)，Macalester Coll, Dept Geog, 1600 Grand Ave, St Paul, MN 55105 USA.",ichang@macalester.edu; hleitner@geog.ucla.edu; esheppard@geog.ucla.edu,"Sheppard, Eric/U-4097-2019","Sheppard, Eric/0000-0002-6635-0965","National Science Foundation (NSF) Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant [1234033]; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1234033] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF) Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",The research was funded by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant [number 1234033].,,62,52,57,4,81,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

For example, in Ontario, Canada, residential customers are charged higher prices during peak times, while large industrial and commercial customers pay heavy surcharges that depend on their load during Ontario's five peak-demand days. Reducing these surcharges is a challenging problem for large consumers due to the difficulty of predicting peak days in advance. We study the impact of this peak reduction program, called 5 Coincident Peaks (5CP), on consumers by analyzing the difficulty of predicting peak-demand days and peak hours on those days. We find that even the state-of-the art peak-prediction algorithms require consumers to curtail load ten or more times, and even then, they may not identify all five peak-demand days. We also analyze alternative policies that cold help reduce peak demand in Ontario. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To evaluate its magnitude, a spatial decomposition at the regional, provincial and county levels is proposed. The decomposition indicates that between 1992 and 2009, 21% of the total inequality is attributable to geographical scale.

In the framework of static agglomeration effects, we investigate the industrial scope of agglomeration economies in Brazil. On the basis of identified registration data which cover the whole formal labour market in three particular years (2004, 2008 and 2012), we estimate separate models for the logarithm of the hourly individual wage for five broad economic sectors (S1-Manufacturing low-tech; S2-Manufacturing medium-tech; S3-Manufacturing high-tech; S4-Services less-knowledge; and S5-Services high-knowledge). Different estimation strategies are considered in a two-stage model: with and without individual fixed effects in the first stage; and with and without instrumental variables for population density in the second stage. The main results indicate that there is no unique optimal local industrial mix to foster productivity in different technological sectors. Comparing possible theoretical approaches (Marshall-Arrow-Romer, Jacobs, Porter) related to combinations of diversity, specialisation and competition, we find that for S5 only diversity is significant (and positive), suggesting that Jacobs's perspective is adequate. However, for S1, S2 and S4, the MAR framework seems better able to explain the underlying patterns. In the case of S3, there are elements from both Marshall's and Jacobs's perspective. These results seem to be robust to different specifications and estimation strategies. Finally, the urbanisation economies coefficient appears to be positive and significant for all sectors, ranging from 0.0511 to 0.0940 in different specifications, under the simplest estimation (OLS in the first and the second stages). Ordering these effects between the sectors from the highest to the lowest, we find the following sequence: S3, S1, S5, S4 and S2. This can be considered as evidence that high-tech and low-tech manufacturing sectors benefit more from the urban or metropolitan scale in Brazil, followed by services associated with higher knowledge intensity.","[Bonomi Barufi, Ana Maria; Haddad, Eduardo Amaral] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, Av Prof Luciano Gualberto 908, BR-05508010 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Bonomi Barufi, Ana Maria; Nijkamp, Peter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nijkamp, Peter] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Fac Geog & Earth Sci, Poznan, Poland",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Barufi, AMB (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, Av Prof Luciano Gualberto 908, BR-05508010 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.;Barufi, AMB (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",ana.barufi@gmail.com,"Haddad, Eduardo/H-2762-2012","Haddad, Eduardo/0000-0001-6564-6716; Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132; kourtit, karima/0000-0002-7171-994X",Brazilian government through the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [229708/2013-7]; Brazilian government through Coordination for Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) [BEX 2501/14-7]; CNPq; FAPESP,Brazilian government through the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Brazilian government through Coordination for Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),This contribution of Ana Maria Bonomi Barufi had the financial support of the Brazilian government through the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) Process 229708/2013-7 and the Coordination for Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) Process BEX 2501/14-7.

The unplanned flows are modeled using a multivariate model that is a function of time series of wind- and solar-generated electricity, power demand and commercial power flows. It is shown that for the case of Poland there is a 25% higher loading on sections of transmission grid in Poland due to the unplanned flows. The unplanned power flows are largely a consequence of the wind-generated electricity in northern Germany that must be routed to southern Germany through the grid in Central Eastern Europe region due to an inadequate grid capacity along the north-south German corridor.

To address this concern, we constructed new journal rankings based on the intellectual influence of research in 8 specialty fields using a sample consisting of 26,401 articles published across 60 economics journals from 1998 to 2007. We made various comparisons between the newly constructed journal rankings in specialty fields and the traditional overall journal ranking.

In recent decades, downstream water shortages have become increasingly common and inflows into the Aral Sea have become very limited. Meanwhile, water losses are enormous both at conveyance and field levels because of outdated infrastructure and the dominance of highly inefficient basin and furrow irrigation methods. Intensification and modernization of irrigation systems, while requiring investment of scarce capital resources, could thus substantially reduce non-beneficial water consumption and help in coping with increasing water scarcity. This study applies a hydro-economic model that solves for the investment in improved irrigation efficiency across the various irrigation sites in the ASB that delivers the highest economic gains. Improvement of the efficiency of irrigation canals and implementation of field efficiency investments and practices, such as drip irrigation, and alternate dry or short furrow irrigation (for rice), would substantially improve economic outcomes. Conveyance efficiency investments are particularly worthwhile in downstream regions where sandy soils are common and return flows largely feed saline lakes in tail-end depressions. Meanwhile, field-level efficiency should be fully upgraded in all rice-producing regions through the use of drip and alternate wet and dry irrigation, as well as with drip irrigation in the cotton-producing Ferghana Valley of the Syr Darya Basin. The value of these improvements increases with reduced water availability. Implementation of an optimal set of investments could increase basinwide benefits by 20% (from US$ 3.2 to 3.8 billion) under normal water availability and by 40% (from US$ 2.5 to 3.5 billion) under dry conditions (80% of normal supply).

Both of these public financial instruments are supposed to support company's investment but are these tools able to compansate costs that companies have to spend for them? In the research there are four types of investment costs defined: costs of completing application, investment costs, costs of subsidy management and sustainability costs. All of these costs are explained for each instrument with respect of application process. The presented results show that European subsidies are less expensive for the examinated company in spite of fact that application process is a heavy administrative burden. Appart from investment incetives that have easier application process, the investment costs are compansated by minority part of the investment incentives. The great item of investment incentives represents sustainability costs that might be covered by provided amount of tax relief. The investment incentives are certain risk that the invested costs may not be entirely covered by the investment incetives. At the end the paper compares costs of two companies defined as small and medium enterprises. Each company applied for one of the examinated financial instruments. The used methods for this paper are search inquiries, expert estimates, comparison and explanation. Theoretical approaches are examinated in a case study of two companies that have received EU subsidies and investment incentives in the Czech Republic.

This paper shows KIBS as important for innovation processes provided by institutions, such as universities, where the most important part involves research and development. Low support in services such as KIBS may cause decreases in availability of highly qualified employees and output of knowledge for innovation. Productivity and economic growth are largely dependent on fast growing technological progress and transfer of knowledge. Innovation can lead to a reduction in manual workers on one hand, while on the other qualified employees will be needed for processes in the new applied technology.

The reasons that are defended here are the inefficient administration of the colony and the economic interests of the Spanish trading elite on the island. The change in circumstances that came about in the 1870s namely, the abolition of slavery and the international economic crisis led to a change of attitude among the stakeholders and to the founding of the first commercial bank, the Sociedad Anonima de Credito Mercantil (Commercial Credit Company Ltd.), in 1877.

However, the recent turmoils in the major financial centers in USA, China, etc. raise the question about the possible transmission of the global shocks to the CEECs stock markets despite the low degree of financial integration. The main research questions are: can the spillover effect transmit from the major stock markets on the CEECs stock markets and what type of shocks cause the cross-border contagion risk transmission to the CEECs stock markets? The objective of this study - to identify the transmission of global shocks through stock markets channel in the CEECs. The research methods: the systemic, logical and comparative analysis of the scientific literature and statistical methods: Dynamic Conditional Correlation Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (DCC-GARCH) model. The empirical results of this study suggest that the highest degree of global and regional integration of the stock markets was observed in Poland's, Czech Republic's, and Hungary's stock markets that can be explained by higher development level of these stock markets comparing to other CEECs. The collapse of Lehman Brothers bank in United States in 2008 was the most significant shock transmitted to CEECs stock markets. The empirical results also suggest that the transmission of other systemic shocks (e.g. the Middle East financial markets crash (May 2006), Greek debt crisis (April 23, 2010), Portugal's debt crisis (May 16, 2011)) was also observed on some of the CEECs countries.

The diffuse hotel model enables the village or specific selected area to become a hotel with one reception, offering overnight accommodation, gastronomic services and including other providers into a network of activities, featuring tour guiding, selling of traditional food products, wine and souvenirs, horse riding, visiting of local museums and collections, bike rental and the other services. The purpose of a diffuse hotel is to provide new workplaces and to promote employment and self-employment. Permanent and seasonal employment enable the locals to work in the reception and doorman service, at the information centre, in the field of tour guiding or in the services of hotel housekeeping and maintenance. Placing a scattered hotel in a specific place stands for an increase of tourist inflow and additional income of existing business entities as a consequence. Such a hotel also makes an important contribution in maintaining the countryside vividness and population, progress of other tourist activities and products, while it enables revitalisation of old abandoned houses. Agricultural households in Dubrovnik-Neretva County very often offer just a part of the service.

Results suggest a negative effect of credit rationing on firms' productivity, while a positive relationship exists between short-run localization economies and productivity. It emerges that location in an industrially concentrated area reduces firms' investment-to-cash flow sensitivity, and that it positively moderates the negative effect of credit rationing on productivity. Moreover, the positive moderation effect seems to be increasing in the density of the local banking system.","[Ganau, Roberto] Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Ganau, R (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",roberto.ganau@studenti.unipd.it,,,,,,,55,10,10,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Such methods are used for diagnosing pores in dental material that can lead to premature failure of dental material. Diagnosis by X-ray provides an objective analysis. However, repeated radiation from X-rays can cause biological damage to human tissues. From this point of view, there is a significant need to progress to quantitative non-invasive and non-destructive testing (NDT) methods to measure dental material and improve treatment options. This article focuses on applying microwave technology to characterize teeth and teeth replacements. Knowledge of microwave propagation in biomaterial with no defects, using a defined microwave frequency range, and subsequently comparing the result with defective material could provide a means of dental diagnosis without the risk of radiation for the patient, i.e. without Xray. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to examine microwave technology in the field of dental medical diagnosis as a new NDT method. METHODS: The basic concept of applying microwave technology to characterize teeth in dental diagnosis was examined using a basic algorithm designed in the MATLAB programming language. Tests used dielectric properties of tooth and tooth decay and propagated electromagnetic (EM) waves to show different characteristics of chosen materials. RESULTS: The analyses of frequency dependent reflection and transmission coefficients of the chosen material, specifically teeth, at frequency range 0 GHz to 30 GHz, computed differences between healthy and defective dental material. CONCLUSION: Thus, this could be used in providing a dental diagnosis without exposing patients to radiation, i.e. without X-ray. The next stage will involve creating a complete model of a jaw with teeth, and designing a sensor for crack detection for comparisons using this basic algorithm.","[Papezova, Maria; Faktorova, Dagmar] Univ Zilina, Fac Elect Engn, Dept Measurement & Appl Engn, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Papezova, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Elect Engn, Dept Measurement & Appl Engn, Zilina, Slovakia.",maria.papezova@fel.uniza.sk; dagmar.faktorova@fel.uniza.sk,,,,,,,7,1,1,0,2,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,658,661,,10.12955/cbup.v4.828,0.0,,,4,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000098,0

In this context, pandemics are an important case study given their exogenous nature, which makes identification of the impact of diseases on development clearer than in other cases such as malaria or smallpox. This paper focuses on Spanish flu in Italy, one of the countries with the highest mortality rate due to the pandemic. By exploiting the regional variation in mortality and focusing on the hypothesis of the foetal origins of cognitive abilities, the long-run consequences of influenza exposure in terms of human capital accumulation are estimated. An average reduction of 0.3-0.4 years of schooling for the cohort born in 1918-20 is found. This result points to a small but persisting effect of health shocks on regional productivity through a variation in the rate of accumulation of human capital.","[Percoco, Marco] Univ Bocconi, CERTeT, PAM, Via Rontgen 1, I-20121 Milan, Italy; [Percoco, Marco] Univ Bocconi, Dondena Ctr, Via Rontgen 1, I-20121 Milan, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Percoco, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, CERTeT, PAM, Via Rontgen 1, I-20121 Milan, Italy.;Percoco, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Dondena Ctr, Via Rontgen 1, I-20121 Milan, Italy.",marco.percoco@unibocconi.it,,,Italian Ministry of Education and Research through the Futuro in Ricerca di Base (FIRB) grant 'Social and Spatial Interactions in the Accumulation of Civic and Human Capital',Italian Ministry of Education and Research through the Futuro in Ricerca di Base (FIRB) grant 'Social and Spatial Interactions in the Accumulation of Civic and Human Capital',Financial support from the Italian Ministry of Education and Research through the Futuro in Ricerca di Base (FIRB) grant 'Social and Spatial Interactions in the Accumulation of Civic and Human Capital' is gratefully acknowledged.,,35,22,25,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Methods: We compared plasmid CTX-M, TEM, and SHV ESBL gene combinations in ESBL producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Altogether, 136 ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae isolation cases were analyzed. Results: The ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae, mostly K. pneumoniae (n = 66; 48.53%), E. coli (n = 36; 26.47%), were isolated from 52 (38.2%) female and 84 (61.8%) male patients from Riga East Clinical University Hospital. Overall, 132 isolates (97.06%) registered positive for the plasmid CTX-M gene, 97 isolates (71.32%) for the plasmid TEM gene, and 87 isolates (63.97%) for the plasmid SHV gene. Patients with the three ESBL plasmid gene (CTX-M+ TEM+ SHV+) combination were significantly older (67.11 +/- 14.16 years) than patients with other gene combinations (59.63 +/- 18.14 years; p = 0.047).

Teaching content of economic management course is relatively complicated, therefore, there are some difficulties in the teaching which the students to grasp the understanding, which will inevitably lead to the students' learning effect is not ideal. To analyze this phenomenon can be found that, on the one hand, the course of economics is far from our real life, so students in real life to the consciousness of problem for economics course is poorer, coupled with the economics course content is boring, students' interest in learning would be much less; on the other hand, because the traditional classroom teaching pattern is quite inflexible, teaching method is single, lack of interactive, students listen to sleep in class, there is no learning motivation. With the development of Internet technology, new teaching approaches to the teaching of economics courses.

The long run effect is less clear because there will be a change in new capacity investment in response to the wind penetration. In this paper we examine the interaction between capacity investment, wind penetration and market power by first using a least-cost generation expansion model to simulate capacity investment with increasing amounts of wind generation, and then using a computer agent-based model to predict electricity prices in the presence of market power. We find the degree to which firms are able to exercise market power depends critically on the ratio of capacity to peak demand. For our preferred long run generation scenario we show market power increases for some periods as wind penetration increases however the merit order counteracts this with the results that prices overall remain flat. Returns to peakers increase significantly as wind penetration increases. The market power in turn leads to inefficient dispatch which is exacerbated with large amounts of wind generation.

We applied an ordered logit model to determine the overall trend of the determinant factors, and then we performed a more detailed analysis in order to understand the reasons why the determinant factors changed between the two periods. Results from the ordered logit model reveal that electricity and gas consumption was primarily determined by such factors as household income, number of family members, the number of home appliances, and the perceptions of energy savings; there was not much difference between the two years, although in 2013, household income did not affect the perception of energy savings. Detailed analysis demonstrated that households with high energy consumption and those with moderate consumption are becoming polarized and that there was a growing gap between consumption behavior and the perception of conservation. The implications derived from the analyses provide an essential insight into the design of a municipal policy to induce lifestyle changes for an energy-saving society. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Some of this can be attributed to a lack readiness or financing. However, when uncertainty is high, a developer may choose to delay a project until more is known. The option to delay has value for a company. This study applies the real option valuation model to an investment in a 10 MW array of in-stream tidal energy conversion devices at the Fundy Ocean Research Centre for Energy (FORCE) in the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, Canada. The values of investing and the option to delay are calculated. A sensitivity analysis of key drivers and scenarios with various input values to the option model are constructed to observe the impact on the 'invest versus delay' decision. The analysis suggests there is value in owning the option to develop, by leasing a FORCE berth, but waiting while uncertainty is resolved. Implications for policy-setting are discussed.

Households' WTP is estimated using the payment ladder contingent valuation (CV) data from 350 in-person interviews in North Cyprus. In order to avoid the cost of outages, households are willing to incur a 13.8% increase in their monthly electricity bill. A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) indicates that the annualized economic benefits of improved reliability of the electricity service would be approximately USD 35.6 million for the residential sector. This figure is more than enough to finance the investments needed to completely eradicate any electricity outages. In addition, the fuel savings from substituting the generation of the new plants for the old plants would yield about USD 32.9 million per year in fuel savings. Hence, a change from the current low-reliability policy to one of providing a high-quality service would yield an economic net present value to the residents of North Cyprus of twice the investment costs, or USD 173.3 million, within five years.

Yet these estimates are often highly uncertain, frequently incommensurable, and regularly contested. This paper explores how the uncertainties surrounding estimates of the availability of fossil fuels, biomass and critical metals are conceptualised and communicated. The contention is that a better understanding of the uncertainties surrounding resource estimates for both conventional and renewable energy resources can contribute to more effective policy decision making in the long term. Two complementary approaches for framing uncertainty are considered in detail: a descriptive typology of uncertainties and a framework that conceptualises uncertainty as alternative states of incomplete knowledge. Both have the potential to be useful analytical and communication tools. For the three resource types considered here we find that data limitations, inconsistent definitions and the use of incommensurable methodologies present a pervasive problem that impedes comparison. Many aspects of resource uncertainty are also not commonly captured in the conventional resource classification schemes. This highlights the need for considerable care when developing and comparing aggregate resource estimates and when using these to inform strategic energy policy decisions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The salt-chemical industry is resisting to restructure to a sustainable, environmental-friendly economic system by spilling over in the form of pro-growth political-economic coalition in local society. Theories of the Logan and Molotch's growth machine, Stone's urban regime, together with the extension of Unruh's thesis concerning the characteristics of lock-in in the technological or institutional economics approach were used to propose an enlarged lock-in political-economic framework and pro-growth Institutional Industry Complex (IIC). It is further used to explain the consensus building of the pro-growth governance. A study of the Salt-chemical and New Material Industry Park in the Huai'an Metropolitan Area, China, serves as an illustrative case. The article also suggests that the path-dependence followed in constructing a pro-growth coalition could serve as a program to unlock the pro-growth Institutional Industry Complex of salt-chemical industry and foster the anti-coalition needed.

G. Regional heterogeneity and interregional research spillovers in European innovation: modelling and policy implications, Regional Studies. In agglomeration studies the effects of various regional externalities related to knowledge spillovers remain largely unclear. To explain innovation clustering, scholars emphasize the contribution of localized knowledge spillovers (LKS) and, specifically when estimating the knowledge production function (KPF), of (interregional) research spillovers. However, less attention is paid to other causes of spatial heterogeneity. In applied works, spatial association in data is econometrically related to evidence of research spillovers. This paper argues that, in a KPF setting, omitting spatial heterogeneity might lead to biased estimates of the effect of research spillovers. As an empirical test, a spatial KPF is estimated using EU-25 regional data, including a spatial trend to control for unexplained spatial variation in innovation. Accounting for geographical characteristics substantially weakens evidence of interregional research spillovers.","[Guastella, Gianni] Univ Cattolica, Dept Math & Phys, I-25121 Brescia, Italy; [van Oort, Frank G.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Inst Housing & Urban Dev Studies IHS, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Oort, Frank G.] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Econ Geog, Utrecht, Netherlands",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Utrecht University,"Guastella, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica, Dept Math & Phys, Via Musei 41, I-25121 Brescia, Italy.",giovanni.guastella@unicatt.it; f.g.vanoort@uu.nl,"Van Oort, Frank/ABA-9504-2020; Guastella, Gianni/Q-6653-2016","Van Oort, Frank/0000-0003-0614-768X; Guastella, Gianni/0000-0002-1333-4718",,,,,59,18,20,5,66,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The explanation for these increases includes the quantity of conventional oil (i.e. oil in fields) discovered, combined with the decline in production of this oil that occurs typically once 'mid-point' is passed. Many past explanations of oil price have overlooked these two constraints, and hence provided insufficient explanations of oil price. Reliable data on conventional oil discovery cannot come from public-domain proved (1P') oil reserves, as such data are very misleading. Instead oil industry backdated proved-plus-probable ('2P') data must be used. It is recognised that accessing 2P data can be expensive, or difficult. The 'mid-point' peak of conventional oil production results from a region's field-size distribution, its fall-off in oil discovery, and the physics of field decline. In terms of the future price of oil, estimates of the global recoverable resource of conventional oil show that the oil price will remain high on average, unless dramatic changes occur in the volume of production and cost of non-conventional oils, or if the overall demand for oil were to decline. The paper concludes with policy recommendations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Galvin, R",,,,"Galvin, Ray",,,"The rebound effect, gender and social justice: A case study in Germany",ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rebound effect; Social justice; Gender and energy consumption,ENERGY EFFICIENCY; CONSUMPTION; GAP,"Energy efficiency increases are essential in reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Policy is therefore rightly concerned about rebound effects, which cause energy and CO2 emission reductions to be less than anticipated. A policy dilemma is emerging in that less economically privileged groups tend to show the highest rebound effects. Some studies suggest policymakers may therefore be reluctant to support energy efficiency upgrades among such groups. This paper argues this is based on a misunderstanding of the conceptual structure of the rebound effect. Firstly, a mathematical analysis confirms that the rebound effect is merely a comparison of proportions, not a measure of absolute levels of energy consumption, which are the real cause of increased CO2 emissions. Secondly, an empirical study of commute distances in North-Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's largest state, reveals that female commuters show considerably higher rebound effects than male commuters, both in time and cross-sectional analyses. However, male commuters consume the most energy and produce the most CO2 emissions, by every measure. This resonates with recent studies showing the same disjunction between rebound effects and absolute consumption, in home heating among poorer and wealthier households. Policy needs to focus on absolute consumption levels and be cautious in interpreting rebound effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We examine the willingness to adopt prepayment metering (PPM) for a sample of Nigerian households that were not prepayment users. Double-hurdle models were estimated to account for households' decisions concerning billing system switching behaviour and households' willingness to pay (WTP). The estimated results revealed that decisions to adopt a prepayment meter are significantly affected by current electricity spending, current billing method and the split incentive problem. Whereas current electricity spending significantly increased the tendency to adopt PPM, the split incentive problem reduced the probability of adoption. Although unmetered consumers were more likely to express a willingness to adopt a PPM system than post-paid customers, they did not intend to pay a significantly higher amount to obtain the prepayment service. Income did not play a significant role in decision-making concerning PPM adoption and the corresponding WTP amount. These results cast doubt on the validity of the widely held belief that low income may be responsible for PPM adoption, reflecting the widespread usage of PPM by low-income households.

The most prevalent model form, called a learning curve, or experience curve, is a log-linear equation relating the unit cost of a technology to its cumulative installed capacity or electricity generated. This one-factor model is also the most common method used to represent endogenous technical change in large-scale energy-economic models that inform energy planning and policy analysis. A characteristic parameter is the learning rate, defined as the fractional reduction in cost for each doubling of cumulative production or capacity. In this paper, a literature review of the learning rates reported for 11 power generation technologies employing an array of fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewable energy sources is presented. The review also includes multi-factor models proposed for some energy technologies, especially two-factor models relating cost to cumulative expenditures for research and development (R&D) as well as the cumulative installed capacity or electricity production of a technology. For all technologies studied, we found substantial variability (as much as an order of magnitude) in reported learning rates across different studies. Such variability is not readily explained by systematic differences in the time intervals, geographic regions, choice of independent variable, or other parameters of each study. This uncertainty in learning rates, together with other limitations of current learning curve formulations, suggests the need for much more careful and systematic examination of the influence of how different factors and assumptions affect policy-relevant outcomes related to the future choice and cost of electricity supply and other energy technologies.

However bioenergy, transport biofuels in particular, has faced considerable environmental and social controversies. Biorefining has been proposed in the UK and Denmark to address these concerns by using biomass efficiently for multiple purposes (food, feed, fuel, chemicals). Drawing from frameworks on responsible innovation, this paper opens up the implicit assumptions within the biorefinery concept about how biomass should be produced. Stakeholder interviews show that the biorefinery concept is framed within an industrial agricultural paradigm that aims to overcome controversies through large-scale production stimulated by biotechnology innovation. By contrast, an alternative agriculture paradigm envisions sustainable multipurpose biomass production in terms of on-farm nutrient and energy cycling and local, smaller scale production. However, there is a potential overlap through the concept of quality industrial biomass production. These three visions provide different perspectives on the bioeconomy in terms of the differences between biomass and fossil fuels; and where biomass should come from. Policy development for bioenergy must reckon with these different visions in innovation pathways for multipurpose biomass. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Shortall, O.

Improved electricity access can power rural industries, enhance agricultural productivity, and provide households with more productive time for study and work at night. Brazil's national rural electrification program has promised to target poor and remote rural communities, but has this goal been met? We analyze statistically representative data from Brazil's Census of 2000 and 2010. While Brazil has reached municipalities with low initial electricity access rates, rural electrification has not targeted the least developed municipalities. Furthermore, we find that the government has not reached the most remote and sparsely populated rural communities. Primary policy implications include more precise targeting of the least developed municipalities, complementary interventions to promote rural development, and increasing investments into distributed energy, such as off-grid solar power. With these strategies, Brazil and other countries facing similar issues can enhance the socio-economic benefit of rural electrification. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A double-bounded dichotomous choice method estimates consumer value for convenience, in a hypothetical market. Higher-income more-educated consumers in more expensive apartments prefer DH. Cost-conscious consumers, who use more electrical heating appliances and more actively adjust separate room temperatures, prefer IH. With willingness-to-pay (WTP) defined as the price ratio between IH and DH, 800 survey respondents indicate a WTP of 4.0% for DH over IH. IH users unfamiliar with DH expect little greater convenience (0.1% WTP), whereas the WTP for DH users runs to 7.9%, demonstrating consumer loyalty. Quantified estimates of consumer preference and convenience can inform design of a full-cost-plus pricing system with a price cap. Results here indirectly predict the effect of abolishing regulations that exclusively establish district heating zones. Strategies to foster the many external benefits of DH systems should stress not their lower cost, but convenience, comfort, and safety. Higher installation costs still hamper DH expansion, so policy-makers could set policies to lower cost barriers to entry. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the introduction of the metafrontier in our analysis puts into our discussion the role of heterogeneous technologies and its effect on the above-mentioned measures. Employing a directional distance function, we investigate whether there is an actual difference, in terms of environmental efficiency and efficiency performance, among European countries considering the technological frontiers under which they operate. The construction of individual frontiers has been realized employing a large number of variables that are highly correlated with countries' learning and absorbing capacity, new technological knowledge and using economic theory and classical frontier discrimination like developed vs. developing, North vs. South and participation in the Eurozone or not. The overall results indicate a crucial role of heterogeneous technologies for technology gaps in both periods. Moreover, a significant decrease for both measures, although in different percent, has been recorded emphasizing the key role of knowledge spillovers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, these national initiatives seem to aim at energy autarky rather than seeking a wider regional coordination. This situation can significantly affect the potential benefits of an integrated long-term expansion of the European power system. In this paper the regulatory basis for the effective participation of foreign agents in national CRMs is discussed. The authors support that two pillars are required: (1) stronger coordination among TSOs1 and respect for the Security of Supply Directive and (2) introduce a particular type of firm cross-border nominations associated to the CRMs commitments. These proposed nominations are to be considered only in situations of system stress. As discussed here, this allows not requiring any type of ex-ante cross-border capacity reservation, thus avoiding many of the inefficiencies associated to traditional physical bilateral contracts.

The energy efficiency of Korea, however, is still relatively low due to the large portion of energy intensive industry (Ell) in its manufacturing sector. To improve energy efficiency in Korea, from an EII perspective a new approach has to be taken because restructuring entire industries would take too much time and be too costly. This study aims to emphasize the importance of innovation and analyze the effects of R&D on product and process innovations in Ell in Korea. The Probit model is adopted to estimate the effects of eight determinants in the Korea Innovation Survey 2008 data. The results of this study demonstrate that one of the most important determinants, the R&D personnel ratio, has a strong positive effect on both product and process innovation, while another determinant, R&D intensity, only has a strong and positive effect on process innovation in Ell. Because of the resulting innovation, energy policies should be enacted to enhance energy efficiency. Thus, the Korean government should keep providing incentives for firms in Ell to invest more financial and human resources in their R&D activities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We elicit public support for an existing LCFS in British Columbia and a hypothetical (proposed) LCFS for the rest of Canada using survey data collected from a representative sample of Canadian citizens (n=1306). Specifically, we assess: (1) citizen awareness of British Columbia's LCFS, (2) stated citizen support for the LCFS, and (3) how individual characteristics relate to levels of citizen support. We find that British Columbia's LCFS is almost unknown among British Columbia respondents, but once explained, 90% of respondents support it. We refer to this combination of low knowledge and high support as passive support. We find similarly broad support in all other Canadian provinces, implying that citizen opposition is unlikely in jurisdictions considering an LCFS.

Due to budgetary constraints, local authorities want to capture a higher part of the rent, thought to be considerable. At the same time, the renewal procedure entails the implementation of environmental mitigation measures, as set forth in the water framework directive. Hence, rent-seizing and environmental protection generate a major trade-off. We focus our analysis on the County of Sondrio, home to 18% of the overall hydropower capacity, where the first renewals will take place. We obtain the highest rent ever estimated for hydropower production, averaging from 30.3 (sic)/MWh to 82.4 (sic)/MWh. These high values explain why local authorities are pushing for the introduction of a 30% revenue sharing fee, as they would earn almost 90% of the rent, much more than the 50% currently seized. Albeit satisfying the rent-seizing objective, the proposed fee hinders the implementation of costly mitigation measures. In this paper, we advocate the adoption of a resource rent tax, as we show that it would reduce the trade-off between rent-seizing and environmental protection. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To circumvent these problems, antifouling paints or coatings, i.e. matrices containing biocidal species, are used to protect the submerged surfaces and objects. Polymers containing quaternary phosphonium or quaternary ammonium groups are promising biocidal materials. Such a biocidal polymeric material is the polymeric salt PSSAmC16 formed between the polystyrene sulfonate anion and the cetyltrimethylammonium cation. When embedded into a paint or a polymeric matrix, the cation of PSSAmC16 is gradually dissolved in the surrounding water through an ion exchange mechanism, offering the biocidal protection of the surface. In the present work, the release of PSSAmC16 from the synthetic polymeric matrix poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, was evaluated, as a function of the contact time with the surrounding aqueous environment. The PSSAmC16 content in the matrix varied from 0 up to 40 % (wt/wt), while aqueous NaCl solutions with a salt concentration up to 2M were investigated. The release of the polymeric biocidal was quantified through Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and Total Nitrogen (TN) measurements. Both methods reveal that the major part of the polymeric biocidal is released within a few days, while release increases with the PSSAmC16 content and it is enhanced by the salinity.

It comprised research-oriented activities for knowledge and technology creation, and development-oriented activities for information sharing and capacity building. The main purpose of the CALESA project was to develop sound adaptation strategies for future temperature increases associated with greenhouse gas emissions using analogue locations, both as learning- and technology-testing sites. This was meant to improve the ability of rainfed farmers in the semi-arid tropics of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular Kenya and Zimbabwe, to adapt to progressive climate change through crop, soil and water management innovation, and appropriate crop genotype choices. Another key feature of the CALESA project was the development and implementation of tailor-made capacity-building activities specifically designed to fulfil the needs of local scientists in the field of climate change adaptation and climate-smart agriculture. To achieve its objectives, the CALESA project used a combination of model-based ex ante analyses and iterative field-based research on station and in farmers' fields. This facilitated the evaluation of potential agricultural adaptation strategies for rainfed agriculture in the semi-arid and dry sub-humid tropics. In this line, four important crop production zones (two in Kenya and two in Zimbabwe) were identified. Subsequently, the corresponding 'spatial analogue locations' for each production zone, providing eight study locations in all, were identified. A strong element of participatory research with small-scale farmers ensured that the perceptions of current and future climate risk and their preferred climate change adaptation strategies was effectively taken into account. In addition, this also ensured that the project activities and outputs remained relevant to their needs and expectations. The main outputs of the CALESA project are as it follows. Firstly, the identification and fully characterisation of four important crop growing areas in Kenya and Zimbabwe which comprise cool/dry, cool/wet, warm/dry and warm/wet growing conditions, and their temperature analogue locations. Secondly, through the combined use of long-term daily climate data, crop growth simulation models and participatory surveys with farmers, the identification and quantification of the implications of both current and future climate change production risk at the study locations. Thirdly, through iterative field research both on station and in farmers' fields over more than 2 years, the evaluation of potential crop, soil and water management, and crop genotype adaptation options. This was followed by the formulation of adaptation strategies for the target locations. Finally, through the overall implementation of the project activities, the institutional capacity in understanding climate change impacts and the development of effective adaptation responses in Kenya and Zimbabwe was fostered.","[De Trincheria, J.; Mannke, F.; Leal Filho, W.] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Fac Life Sci, Ulmienlet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany; [Craufurd, P.; Harris, D.; Rao, K.

For this reason, in the last decades, the relevance of measuring SC has rapidly increased. Therefore it is important to come up with a model that focuses on the constituents of structural capital, which will help in the measurement of the SC.

Energy literacy was high and positive, with greater impact as expected by grade (senior high school students outscored junior high school ones) and there were some effects due to gender and socioeconomic status. Students' performance on energy knowledge was acceptable (over 60% correct across grades) while a notable discrepancy between affect and behavior was identified indicating that there might not be a correspondence between what people say they would do and what they actually do. Energy saving behavior was more closely associated with the affect than other variables. Reasons for the findings and implications for energy education in the future are discussed.

Local destinations have to offer only their best in order to satisfy tourists. In that respect, tourist guides represent an important part of the tourism industry. Local tourist guides should represent the local community and show the most important and the most interesting sights of a given destination. In order to become a tourist guide one must obtain proper education and an appropriate certificate. Taking into account the tourist market needs and incoming tourist groups, tourist guides should be adequately prepared. The purpose of this study is to define the importance of education within the tourism industry and particularly tourist guides. The educational program should provide the necessary knowledge and practices in order to ensure a high quality of future employees in the tourism sector. The education program, the institutions where the program can be attended as well as the criteria for exam are prescribed by law. Croatia is a tourism-oriented country and has an increasing number of tourist arrivals. The total contribution of tourism in the GDP is around 30%. It can therefore be concluded that tourism is a very important industry for Croatia. The present research is carried out by the case study method. The main findings of this study are showing a strong disagreement between the theoretical findings and given government and organizational efforts in the education program. There are several possible reasons for this situation: belated development, an inadequate approach to tourism development etc. Recommendations for further studies are focused on finding reasons for the current situation and forming suitable procedures to overcome these limitations, in order to form a high quality education and ensure high quality service of local tourist guiding.

This paper presents an evaluation of the ecological impacts of SHP based on an emergy analysis of a plant located in Guizhou Province in southwest China. The results suggest that periodic downstream drying-up of the river is the largest contributor to the induced ecological impacts in terms of emergy cost. In 2010, the ecosystem service losses caused by downstream ecosystem degradation totaled 235E+18 seJ, which accounts for 38% of the total emergy utilized in the annual operation of this plant. If such losses could be avoided, i.e., if the SHP operated as designed, SHP projects would produce relatively modest impacts on the environment. When the reaches downstream of the SHP plant are not affected, the environmental loading ratio (ELR) is 2.20 and the emergy sustainability index (ESI) is 0.93; however, the ELR increases to 3.82 and ESI decreases to 0.38 when river drying-up occurs. These results indicate that China should rigorously investigate potential ecological problems of SHP development and proceed with caution rather than readily believing unjustified assumptions.

The growth of Arthrocnemum macrostachyum and Halimione portulacoides in an extensive green roof system under two watering regimes (30% ET0 and 15% ET0) was investigated. The substrates used consisted of soil (S), pumice (Pum) and grape marc compost (C) or peat (P), at various volumetric proportions indicated by the subscripts: S-15: Pum(70):C-15, S-15:Pum(70):P-15 and S-15:Pum(70):P-7.5:C-7.5. Biometric measurements to determine plant growth included plant height and diameter, growth index, dry weights and ground cover. The growth of both plant species was similar under both watering regimes until elevated summer temperatures lead to plant loss in the reduced watering regime (15% ET0). Both shoot and root dry weights of both plant species at the end of the experiment were greater under the 30% ET0 watering regime.

The Paper gives a different vision of the future of European labour law, one which helps increasing flexibility combined with employment security and reduces labour market segmentation. As an effect of this, a number of member states reconsidered their regulation and started legislation to reach a better level of flexibility. In Hungary the new Labour Code came into force in 2012, modified the rules of the employer's liability for damages, namely the causes for justification and created different grounds for the rules of liability for damages in labour law. The Act also gave rise to a number of new legal institutions, mostly in the field of atypical types of employment that result in a considerably more flexible employment, thus providing employers with what is necessary for flexible employment. In the paper it is observed how the EU directives in the field of working conditions narrow the flexible employment through the example of Hungary. As a conclusion it can be stated, that the EU must broaden its legislative activities in order to protect the employees. In addition, extending unified labour law regulations to most legal institutes possible can be justified, as it creates a unified framework for employers and contributes to the promotion of equality within the European Union.

This contribution describes how potted weeping figs were grown in a greenhouse with one, two, or four emitters (1.2 L.h(-1)) per pot and irrigated with water of 3 dS.m(-1) and two irrigation volumes (control or high). The aim was to determine the effect of the number of emitters, irrigation volume, and their interaction on plant growth, water application efficiency and the concentration of saline ions in plants. The horizontal distribution of roots and the concentrations of root saline ions were determined in four quadrants (south, west, north, and east) in the substrate. In the case of the control irrigation volume, the use of four emitters per pot reduced the total of water applied compared with the use of one or two. Irrigation volume increased the leaching fraction, while the number of emitters per pot reduced it. Increasing the number of emitters per pot or/and irrigation volume increased the shoot/root ratio. With the two irrigation volumes applied, the use of one emitter led to a heterogeneous horizontal distribution of roots. The same was true for the saline ion content of the roots. Both behaviors were attenuated as the number of emitters per pot increased. Weeping fig accumulated higher a concentration of chloride than sodium. In relative terms, roots retained about 95% of the sodium and about 76% of the chloride in plants. The data suggest that both irrigation volume and the numbers of emitters per pot should be considered together when developing a water management strategy for container-grown plants.

Initially, the statistical test shows the possibility of the structural change from the late 2000s. Therefore, we developed the energy demand model to forecast the energy demand by 2030 that considers the structural change. The results show that there may be a 12% reduction in the energy demand in 2030 compared to the reference case in the Japanese government's outlook, which is equal to about 86.0% of the effect of the planned policy measures by the government, but also that it is difficult to achieve energy-originated CO2 emissions in the national target. Our analysis suggests that mitigation policies are required, but those in the planned policy measures are not completely required to achieve the goal. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper: (i) compares transportation fuel carbon policies in terms of their economic efficiency, fuel price impacts, greenhouse gas emission reductions, and incentives for innovation; (ii) discusses key regulatory design features of LCFS policies; and (iii) provides an update on the implementation status of LCFS policies in California, the European Union, British Columbia, and Oregon. The economics literature finds that an intensity standard implicitly taxes emissions and subsidizes output. The output subsidy results in an intensity standard being inferior to a carbon tax in a first-best world, although the inefficiency can be corrected with a properly designed consumption tax (or mitigated by a properly designed carbon tax or cap-and-trade program). In California, from 2011 to 2015 the share of alternative fuels in the regulated transportation fuels pool increased by 30%, and the reported AFCI of all alternative fuels declined 21%. LCFS credit prices have varied considerably, rising to above $100/credit in the first half of 2016.

An aggregate spatial interaction network is constructed based on a large mobile phone data set including 431 million mobile calls made by 10 million anonymous customers over one month and the geographic locations of the mobile base towers involved in each call. We use Thiessen polygons (termed cells') as the unit of analysis to approximate the service area of each mobile base tower. Major findings encompass the following three aspects. First, cells with high betweenness centrality are linearly distributed in space, which closely aligns with major transportation corridors. We find that this pattern can be explained by analysing the characteristics of calling activities on transportation networks. Second, we detect a two-level hierarchy of communities that correspond well to county and prefecture-level administrative unit boundaries. Lastly, almost every community identified at the two hierarchical levels contains a cell with high betweenness. These cells are located near the political and economic centres and play the role of hubs in the regional socio-economic system. This research demonstrates that networks built from mobile phone data provide new understandings of spatial interactions and regional structures.","[Chi, Guanghua; Shi, Li; Liu, Yu] Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & Geog Informat Syst, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Thill, Jean-Claude] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Tong, Daoqin] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",Peking University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; University of Arizona,"Chi, GH (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & Geog Informat Syst, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",guanghuachi@gmail.com; Jean-Claude.Thill@uncc.edu; daoqin@email.arizona.edu; shili1133@126.com; liuyu@urban.pku.edu.cn,"Liu, Yu/D-4022-2012; LI, SHI/GQB-3193-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41271386, 41428102]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 41271386 and 41428102).

Using a case study in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, this paper quantifies the economic viability of off-grid PV+battery-FCHP adoption and evaluates potential implications for grid-based utility models. The analysis shows that already some households could save money by switching to a solar hybrid off-grid system in comparison to the effective electric rates they are currently paying. Across the region by 2020, 92% of seasonal households and 75% of year-round households are projected to meet electricity demands with lower costs. Furthermore, 65% of all Upper Peninsula single-family owner-occupied households will both meet grid parity and be able to afford the systems by 2020. The results imply that economic circumstances could spur a positive feedback loop whereby grid electricity prices continue to rise and increasing numbers of customers choose alternatives (sometimes referred to as a utility death spiral), particularly in areas with relatively high electric utility rates. Utility companies and policy makers must take the potential for grid defection seriously when evaluating energy supply strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper explores how China inserted itself into global clean energy innovation systems by examining the case of the solar PV industry. The paper decomposes the global PV industrial value chain, and determines the main factors shaping PV technology transfer and diffusion. Chinese firms first entered PV module manufacturing through technology acquisition, and then gradually built their global competitiveness by utilizing a vertical integration strategy within segments of the industry as well as the broader PV value chain. The main drivers for PV technology transfer from the global innovation system to China are global market formation policy, international mobilization of talent, the flexibility of manufacturing in China, and belated policy incentives from China's government. The development trajectory of the PV industry in China indicates that innovation in cleaner energy technologies can occur through both global and national innovation processes, and knowledge exchange along the global PV value chain.

We conclude, therefore, that neither of these SPMs was useful for energy policy makers and energy managers, and they were misleading due to their many key omissions. Finally, we recommend several improvements that can be made to integrated assessment modeling methodologies so that the macroeconomic analysis of mitigating climate change resulting from the use of such models can be more relevant and useful to energy policy makers in the future, and can be communicated to them better.

For example, proposed operational changes on highly-engineered river systems to implement environmental considerations (e.g., experimental flow regimes in a river stretch) may connect to social disruption and green-vs-green tradeoffs elsewhere in the larger connected system. Non-use value estimates for the same proposed operational changes may be sensitive to the presentation of multiple dimensions of effects in the coupled system, which may be perceived as either positive or negative by different population segments. Using an internet survey mode and a national sample, and essentially replicating a prominent prior contingent valuation study of non-use values (Welsh et al., 1995) [67] as the starting point, we illustrate such considerations within an exploratory setting involving operational changes altering both downstream environmental flows and hydroelectricity production from the Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River. We use a referendum-style voting format, and a set of split-sample information treatments including: (i) social disruption impacts to Native American and rural western communities that depend on hydroelectric production; and (ii) hypothetical increases in air pollution by switching to non-renewable fossil fuels in the electric power grid. Empirical results show respondents may make non-use value trade-offs, as preferences for or against operational changes are highly sensitive (e.g., reversing majority support) to information about additional value dimensions, beyond downstream environmental flow impacts.

Spin-offs created at Catalan universities are analysed and it is found that many efficient spin-offs have formal technology transfer agreements, and emerge from technology-oriented universities. It is also found that higher innovation levels and experience from the parent university are associated with higher efficiency, which is positively related to future fundamental profitability.

For a realistic model set up, bounded rationality, stochastic characteristics, and learning-by-doing are considered in our search processes. Marginal abatement cost parameters are obtained from Yoo et al. (2010), which is an experimental study on the emissions trading in the Korean power sector. Sensitivity analyses are performed on market performance indices with regard to transaction cost parameters, which represent scales and the learning elasticities of transaction costs. A total of 960 simulations were run in this sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis results consistently show that higher transaction costs worsen market performance. The most remarkable finding in these results is that welfare performance of all the transactions decreases by up to 50% as the scale parameters of transaction costs increase, implying that welfare gain from introducing emissions trading disappears significantly. However, with learning curve effect, welfare performance could be regained by up to 26%. In sum, although transaction costs significantly encroach upon trade gains at the early stage, based on our simulation results, the welfare loss by way of transaction costs is lessened as the knowledge of market participants progresses.

This study analyzes the effects of R&D investment activities, economic growth, and energy price on energy technology patents in 30 provinces of China over the period 1999-2013. Several unit root tests indicate that all the above variables are generated by panel unit root processes, and a panel cointegration model is confirmed among the variables. In order to ensure the consistency of the estimators, the Fully-Modified OLS (FMOLS) method is adopted, and the results indicate that R&D investment activities and economic growth have positive effects on energy technology patents while energy price has a negative effect. However, the panel error correction models indicate that the cointegration relationship helps to promote economic growth, but it reduces R&D investment and energy price in the short term. Therefore, market-oriented measures including financial support and technical transformation policies for the development of low-carbon energy technologies, an effective energy price mechanism, especially the targeted fossil-fuel subsidies and their die away mode are vital in promoting China's energy technology innovation.

The prospect of carbon taxes being implemented in the future induces resource owners to extract more rapidly which increases present carbon dioxide emissions and accelerates global warming. However, our results suggest that future carbon taxes may decrease present emissions if resource owners face increasing marginal extraction costs and if there is a clean energy source that is a perfect substitute and exhibits learning-by-doing (LBD). If the marginal extraction cost curve is sufficiently flat, resource owners respond to a future carbon tax by lowering total extraction and only slightly increasing present extraction. Moreover, taxation leads to higher energy prices which induces renewable energy firms to increase output not only in the future, but also in the present because of the anticipated benefits from LBD. This crowds out energy from the combustion of fossil fuels and may outweigh the initial increase in present extraction, leading to less emissions in the present. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In order to quantify the potential economic and environmental benefits from connecting power grids and developing renewables in NEA, we build an NEA-wide multi-region power system model using linear programming techniques. Our analysis considers power system characteristics, such as the seasonal and daily electric load curves of the various NEA economies. Compared to a no grid extension scenario, increased access to renewables contributes significantly to emissions reductions and fuel cost savings. However, the results imply modest benefits in lowering total cost because of the large initial investments needed in developing the renewables and the transmission lines. These limited total cost savings are likely to pose an implementation challenge for NEA grid interconnections. Our results also suggest that grid interconnections become more economically attractive in higher fuel price or lower initial cost situations. The relevant planning organizations should carefully consider the initial cost and future fuel price trends when considering how to interconnect power girds in an economical manner.

In some regions governmental modernization strategies led to the predominance of a 'family welfare model' that guaranteed generous welfare entitlements on the basis of labour contracts by large firms or the civil service. In other regions a 'family business model' prevails, which has evolved due to the decision of the male breadwinner to sacrifice social rights for less protected (small firm) employment opportunities. This choice leads family members to strive for higher educational attainment and formal labour participation causing better economic performance compared with regions where the 'family welfare model' persists.","[Glassmann, Ulrich] Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, D-50931 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Glassmann, U (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, Herbert Lewin Str 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany.",ulrich.glassmann@uni-koeln.de,,"Glassmann, Ulrich/0000-0002-3491-6274",,,,,44,6,7,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The management of resource allocation was highly efficient. Firms operating in the electricity sector were the major beneficiaries of the introduction of the new technology. After the Civil War, regulation in the strict sense was conditioned by other objectives of economic policy, such as autarky and fast development. This led to the adoption of mechanisms and creation of incentives that distorted the logic of the market, by pursuing rapid expansion of the sector, affecting the choice of resources to be used and the allocation of electricity, its price and the quantities produced. After a period of shortages, the need to have abundant and cheap electricity led to the design of a system of pricing and compensation that did not reflect the actual costs, also causing instances of overproduction. Resource management was poor during this period. However, the market power and profits of electricity companies remained unaffected, since the companies themselves were in charge of the new regulatory model.","[Antolin Fargas, Francesca] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Fargas, FA (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,1,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

Technological progress has led to an on-going increase in the output of wind turbines. The size of wind farms is also gradually increasing, which leads overall to larger financing volumes that the small regionally organized cooperative banks can only muster with assistance from a cooperative central bank. The local banks are support by experts in the field of renewable energy from the cooperative central bank - irrespective of whether one wind turbine or an entire wind farm is to be financed. For example, large-size wind-farm financing packages -and in the case of five turbines this can swiftly exceed 20 million euroscan be handled as a financing consortium consisting of the cooperative bank and the central bank. Alongside long-term loan financing and reliance on the relevant government subsidies, the range of services also includes variable financing forms, and this extends to interest and exchange-rate hedges. Financing individual wind farms tends to be structured as project financing, meaning that a closed-end investment project is launched that constitutes a single economic and legal entity. The debt is exclusively serviced from the wind plant's cash flow. Depending on the expertise and needs of the regional cooperative bank, the central bank supports it in all project phases as regards financing one or several wind plants or farms. Rural cooperative banks can only manage to finance large-size wind projects through collaboration between the decentralized cooperative banks and the cooperative central bank. Financing large-size wind farms by cooperative banks will be compared below to other private-sector or government-supported forms of bank financing in Germany and the differences identified.","[Hansen, Sven] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Fullerstr 62, D-60431 Franlfurt, Germany",,"Hansen, S (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Fullerstr 62, D-60431 Franlfurt, Germany.",sven-christian.hansen@t-online.de,,,,,,,13,0,0,1,1,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,339,349,,10.15414/isd2016.s5.04,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500040,0

The Study is mainly concerned with calculating the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). The LCOE calculations are based on a levelised average life time cost approach using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. The analysis was this year, and for the first time, performed using three discount rates (3%, 7%, and 10%). The LCOE can serve as a tool for calculating the cost of different generation technologies. However the Study's usefulness is affected by its narrow base of a limited set of countries that are not necessarily representative. It ignored the negative role of subsidies and did not provide a methodology for selective application of the discount rates and costing of carbon. The global power generation scene is changing. Generation growth in OECD countries has become very limited; simultaneously there is rapid growth of varying renewables (VRE) generation which needs special criteria for assessing its system cost. All this demands a rethinking of the application and usefulness of the LCOE in future generation planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The safety of vaccines is ensured during clinical studies before the licensure of the vaccine. However, clinical trials have limitations, such as, rare events that cannot be detected and events occurring in specific groups of people. The consequences of AEFI influence public health policies and the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases, although these might not be related directly to vaccines themselves. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this article is to examine the evolution of vaccine safety issues in Albania by mapping stakeholders involved in vaccine safety control and analyzing the different periods when changes in the vaccine safety system has taken place METHODS: A grey literature review, by searching the archive of IPH, provided a list of different stakeholders involved in vaccine safety in Albania. By reviewing all documents of the various organizations included in vaccine safety, we differentiated and characterized the roles of each in this area. RESULTS: The main stakeholders involved in AEFI and vaccine safety in Albania are; the Institute of Public Health (IPH), which manages the National Immunization Program (NIP), the Directorate of Public Health (DPH) at the Ministry of Health (MoH), the 36 District Public Health Directories each with a microbiological laboratory for the assessment of AEFI, the pharmacovigilance center and National Regulatory Authority in the National Agency for Medicines and Medical Devices (NAMMD), National Immunization Safety Expert Committee in MoH and the Secretariat that supports the national AEFI committee CONCLUSIONS: Despite huge progress over the last decade in Albania regarding vaccine safety, much remains to be achieved. The changes in the vaccine safety system have enforced and increased public trust on vaccination, leading to a strengthened National Immunization Program.","[Mehmeti, Irsida] Catholic Univ Our Lady Good Counsel, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Tirana, Albania; [Bino, Silva] Inst Publ Hlth, Control Infect Dis Dept, Tirana, Albania",,"Mehmeti, I (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Our Lady Good Counsel, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Tirana, Albania.",irsida.mehmeti@gmail.com,"Mehmeti, Irsida/GWV-2624-2022","Mehmeti, Irsida/0000-0002-6899-2590",,,,,21,0,0,0,2,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,634,641,,10.12955/cbup.v4.824,0.0,,,8,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000094,0

Water storage systems (WSSs) have been proposed to supplement rain-fed irrigation and augment domestic water services in these communities. We evaluate household preferences for WSSs using a choice experiment and latent class modeling techniques. Results indicate the presence of three classes. The majority of households (92%) belong to two equally-sized classes, a relatively privileged group (i.e. wealthier, better educated, etc.) with strong preferences for supplemental irrigation and a less privileged group that is mainly interested in improved domestic water services. The remaining class' preferences are dominated by the cost attribute and are consistent with households facing severe cash constraints. Estimated welfare effects reveal that WSSs disproportionately benefit the privileged, although this disparity is mitigated with the provision of domestic water. These findings highlight the potential welfare gains from WSS investments, but stress the need for multi-purpose water resource development and the potential for elite capture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The use of novel efficiency-improving approaches based on DEA originates from the so-called Distance Friction Minimisation (DFM) method. To design a feasible improvement strategy for low-efficiency DMUs, we develop here a Target-Oriented (TO) DFM model. However, in many real-world cases input factors may not be flexibly adjusted in the short run. In this study, we integrate the TO-DFM model with a fixed (inflexible) factor (FF) approach to cope with such more realistic circumstances. Super-efficiency DEA is next used in our comparative study on the efficiency assessment of energy-environment-economic targets for the EU, APEC and ASEAN (A&A) countries, employing appropriate data sets from the years 2003 to 2012. We consider two inputs (primary energy consumption and population) and two outputs (CO2 and GDP), including a fixed input factor (viz. population). On the basis of our DEA analysis results, EU countries appear to exhibit generally a higher efficiency than A&A countries. The above-mentioned TO-DFM-FF projection model is able to address realistic circumstances and requirements in an operational sustainability strategy for efficiency improvement in inefficient countries in the A&A region.

One of the crucial factors of competitiveness is the quality of the manufactured products and services. Quality as the compliance with the requirements of the customers should therefore be the focus of each company because it crucially affects customer satisfaction, loyalty, and the end result is the prosperity of a company. Quality management as a summary of approaches to quality management has undergone many years of development from a simple inspection of the product through quality control of the product, later through quality assurance already committed to preventing defects to complex quality management that fundamentally changing the way the companies in all areas are being managed. Customer demands for quality are reflected in the prices of individual products or services. Each producer must ensure its products having not only the appropriate level of quality but the quality must be also continually assured and demonstrated in the long run. It is important to note that the quality management system nowadays is not a luxury matter but a necessity and it must be said that the introduction of such a system does not automatically improve the company. It is a long process that would ultimately lead to improving customer satisfaction and stakeholder efficiency, to lowering costs, reduced risk, increased productivity, clear identification of responsibilities and of course last but not least to the improvement of the product quality itself. Each company will certainly benefit if the quality management system is certified by a third party certification authority. The best is if this authority is an organization also accepted abroad. A very important factor is also the attitude of the company's leadership towards how the quality management system is used to benefit the organization and whether the principles of the system are regularly used in the practice.","[Svitova, Emilia; Mrazikova, Maria Kecskes] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Trieda A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Svitová, E (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Trieda A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",esvitova@gmail.com; maria.mrazikova@eurosvit.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,2,20,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,1074,1083,,10.15414/isd2016.s13.09,0.0,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500128,0

In addition to the three aspects of promoting access, renewables, and efficiency, the dimension of resilience in energy systems should also considered. The implementation of resilient energy systems requires a quantitative understanding of the socio-economic practices underlying such systems. Specifically, in line with the increasing globalization of trade, there remains a critical knowledge gap on the link between embodied energy in the production and consumption of traded goods. To bridge this knowledge gap, we investigate the resilience of global energy systems through an examination of a diversity measure of global embodied electricity trade based on multi-regional input-output (MRIO) networks. The significance of this research lies in its ability to utilize high resolution MRIO data sets in assessing the resilience of national energy systems. This research indicates that secure and responsible consumption requires the diversification of not only energy generation but also energy imports. This research will lay the ground for further research in the governance of resilience in global energy networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To gain a better understanding of the changes in carbon intensity in China's industrial sector, this study first utilized logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition analysis to disentangle the carbon intensity into three influencing factors, including the emission coefficient effect, the energy intensity effect, and the structure effect. Then, the analysis was furthered to explore the contributions of individual industrial sub-sectors to each factor by using an extension of the decomposition method proposed in Choi and Ang (2012). The results indicate that from 1996 to 2012, the energy intensity effect was the dominant factor in reducing carbon intensity, of which chemicals, iron and steel, metal and machinery, and cement and ceramics were the most representative sub-sectors. The structure effect did not show a strong impact on carbon intensity. The emission coefficient effect gradually increased the carbon intensity, mainly due to the expansion of electricity consumption, particularly in the metal and machinery and chemicals subsectors. The findings suggest that differentiated policies and measures should be considered for various industrial sub-sectors to maximize the energy efficiency potential. Moreover, readjusting the industrial structure and promoting clean and renewable energy is also urgently required to further reduce carbon intensity in China's industrial sector.

In a survey study based on a random sample of residents of the state of Maine, USA, we find that citizens have preferences for specific types of renewable energy but these preferences do not yield significantly different allocation of investment funds between renewable energy and energy efficiency. We find that preferences are generally consistent regardless of presentation of options (i.e. limited ordering effects). Our results also indicate that personal characteristics that are understudied in the energy literature, including promotion/prevention focus and social/fiscal leanings, influence both willingness to support energy policies and also their allocation of fund choices, but in different ways. This suggests the importance of including multiple options in energy policy proposals, and that targeted messages regarding the components of such policies is key for optimal communication.

Through the presence of options, the downside risk resulting from low carbon prices and/or low achieved emission reductions on projects can be limited, while any upside resulting from high carbon prices and/or high achieved emission reductions can be taken advantage of. It is demonstrated that the presence of options improves the financial attractiveness of CDM projects, and this is at no detriment to any stakeholder. The flow-on from the proposal is that more CDM projects should be realisable if options are available, and this in turn will lead to reduced global emissions and improved sustainability. The proposal is supported by the necessary theory and is demonstrated on two registered CDM projects, one on hydropower and one on wind power. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Policies to incentivize energy savings are however disparate between countries. Taking into account environmental aspects and consumer surplus, the paper uses a stylized economic model to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of three economic instruments: subsidies for renovation, subsidies for demolition and reconstruction projects and subsidies for building new houses on virgin land. The assessment also relates to differentiated value added taxes and other financial incentives such as green loans. In a counter-intuitive way, the model highlights that subsidies for renovations with minor energy gains worsen the overall energy consumption of housing due to the inducement of lock-ins with energy inefficient houses. Structural changes are needed in the use of policy instruments. First, commonly applied support schemes for renovations with minor energy savings should be abolished. Second, scarce public resources should incentivize deep renovation and demolition and reconstruction. Finally, taxes should apply on the use of virgin land to persuade households with a high willingness to pay for a new house, to invest in demolition and reconstruction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This article examines their impact on collaboration patterns between collective actors in policy processes. It argues that external shocks create both behavioral uncertainty, meaning that actors do not know about other actors' preferences, and policy uncertainty on the choice and consequences of policy instruments. The context of uncertainty interacts with classical drivers of actor collaboration in policy processes. The analysis is based on a dataset comprising interview and survey data on political actors in two subsequent policy processes in Switzerland and Exponential Random Graph Models for network data. Results first show that under uncertainty, collaboration of actors in policy processes is less based on similar preferences than in stable contexts, but trust and knowledge of other actors are more important. Second, under uncertainty, scientific actors are not preferred collaboration partners. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

I find that the introduction of the steam shovel, which enabled open-pit mining, was the most important technological breakthrough. Revisions of expectations of success were statistically significant but economically less important. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, concentration of ownership encouraged entry. Finally, depletion was primarily responsible for the decline in entry in later years. However, the same forces that led to success also contributed to decline. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using choice experiments and a mixed logit model, this study quantitatively analyzes customers' preferences and their marginal willingness to pay for improved residential electricity services. The study provides an ex ante evaluation of customers' acceptance of hypothetical electricity services. According to the results, customers consider the electricity bill and the electricity mix as the two most important attributes when choosing their electricity services. Customers are willing to pay 2.2% more in the average electricity bill (an additional monthly electricity bill of KRW 1,064; USD 0.96) for a significant increase in the share of renewable energy, which is far less than the actual cost of achieving this renewable target. Therefore, it is better to maintain the current electricity mix in principle, and the renewable share should be gradually expanded instead of making a sudden change in the electricity mix. In addition, customers are willing to pay KRW 6,793 (USD 6.15) more to reduce blackouts once in a year and KRW 64/year (USD 0.06/year) to reduce a minute of each blackout. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 1797 patents filed in Russia, 8282 in Germany and 20,549 in China were retrieved from the European Patent Office database through 2012. We identify four collectively representative measures of a knowledge base (size, growth, cumulativeness, and interdependence), which are observable from biofuel patent citations. Furthermore, we define the exploratory-exploitative index, which enables us to identify the nature of learning embedded in the knowledge base structure. Our citation network analysis of the biofiiel knowledge base trajectory by country, in conjunction with policy milestones, shows that Russia's biofuel knowledge base lacks both the increasing technological specialization of that in Germany and the accelerated growth rate of that in China. The German biofuel citation network shows a well-established knowledge base with increasing connectivity, while China's has grown exceptionally fast but with a sparseness of citations reflecting limited connections to preceding, foundational technologies. We conclude by addressing policy implications as well as limitations of the study and potential topics to explore in future research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the urban infrastructure to support sustainable mobility can produce a substantial environmental burden if no life cycle environmental criteria are applied in its design and management. This paper demonstrates the potential to support energy-efficient and CO2-free pedestrian and electric bike (e-bike) mobility through the ecological design (eco-design) of urban elements. An eco-design approach is applied to reconceptualize a conventional pergola toward an eco-product (solar pergola). The solar pergola generates surplus photovoltaic electricity that provides a multifunctional character. According to the end-use of this energy, different scenarios are analyzed for robust decision-making. The deployment of solar pergolas can contribute to save from 2,080 kg to over 47,185 kg of CO2 eq. and from 350,390 MJ to over 692,760 MJ eq. in 10 years, depending on the geographic emplacement (solar radiation and electricity grid system). These savings are equivalent to charging 2-9 e-bikes per day using clean energy. Instead of maximizing infrastructure deployment to shift to environmentally friendly modes of mobility, the implementation of multifunctional urban elements represents a key area of action in the context of smart city development.

Elevated ground-level temperatures could increase electricity demand during the ozone season, altering the generation mixes and ultimately changing emissions. A sequence of load forecasting, supply investment and operation, and facility siting models is used to project spatial and temporal distributions of NOx emissions. Under a worse-case scenario with no renewable additions or other interventions, the results indicate that even if total NOx is limited by cap-and-trade policies, climate-warming-induced changes in the timing of pollution emissions can be significant, especially under warmer or high-load conditions. This suggests that a continued reliance on fossil-fuel together with a temperature sensitivity of generation efficiency and peak electricity demands increases the likelihood that emissions will be greater during the warm days when ozone episodes also occur. The paper advances the integrated assessment by identifying ways at which climate-change-derived energy demand can impact generation mixture, operations and local air pollution. The downscaled emissions can be used in regional air quality models such as the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) to project changes in tropospheric ozone due to climate change.

Global processes and local consequences of decentralization: a sub-national comparison in Mexico, Regional Studies. This paper argues that through decentralization policies, the imperatives of neoliberal rules of competition have been diffused into the local level, generating different development patterns depending upon characteristics of the local economy and its insertion into global processes. Therefore, implications of decentralization policies can be analysed by focusing on prevailing local economic activity and a particular pattern of class forces that arise from it. The paper attempts to make the case that how each local economy integrates into global economic processes, and which economic and social groups are empowered and/or disempowered in that integration, shape the pattern of local development.","Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Cankaya, Turkey",Middle East Technical University,"Topal, A (通讯作者)，Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, METU Univ Mah,Dumlupinar Blv 1 06800, Cankaya, Turkey.",taylin@metu.edu.tr,"Topal, Aylin/ABA-3416-2020",,,,,,51,4,4,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The first one describes the creation of mainstream frames of technologies in policymaking. The second one explains the effects of a hegemonic frame, namely the weakening of evaluation criteria and the increased salience of blind spots. On this basis, this paper explains the global mainstreaming of a CCS frame and its transformation into a hegemonic frame in the EU.

Traditionally, energy companies have had strong role in providing Demand Side Management (DSM) measures. However, after energy market liberalization in Europe, energy companies' DSM activities declined. In response, the EU issued Directive (2006/32/EC) on energy end-use efficiency and energy services (ESD) to motivate energy companies to promote energy efficiency and conservation, closely followed by Directive (2012/27/EU) on energy efficiency (EED), requiring the setting up energy efficiency obligation schemes. Despite strong political and economic motivation, energy companies struggle to develop energy efficiency services in liberalised energy markets due to conflicting institutional demands, which arise from contradicting policy requirements and customer relations. The main challenges in developing new innovative energy efficiency services, evidenced by an in-depth case study, were (1) the unbundling of energy company operations, which makes it difficult to develop services when the contribution of several business units is required and (2) the distrust among energy end-users, which renders the business logic of energy saving contract models self-contradictory. On the basis of the research, avenues out of these dilemmas are suggested. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This difference in employment patterns is explored within a real options analysis (ROA) for possible U.S. utilization of wood pellets, considering fuel-price series from 2009 to 2014. For analysis, these series are divided into two sub-periods based on different market conditions: Infancy (2009-2011) and Substitution (2012-2014). ROA indicates co-firing wood pellets with coal is feasible considering adoption during wood pellets' infancy, under low discount rates, and long power-plant lifespans. A portfolio effect of employing multiple fuels underlies this result. However, co-firing is not currently economically feasible. The different adoption decisions are likely a consequence of recent cheap and abundant U.S. natural gas. For co-fired wood pellets to be feasible, government incentives and/or a market increase in natural gas prices appear necessary. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

D. and Rodriguez-Pose A. Interaction and innovation across different sectors: findings from Norwegian city-regions, Regional Studies. This article examines how different types of interaction are related to the capacity of firms to innovate in different sectors. Using a sample of 1604 Norwegian firms with more than ten employees, it analyses how interactions within the business group, with industry partners, and with research institutions and consultancies impinge on the probability of innovation for firms in six different economic sectors - manufacturing; construction; retail; accommodation and food; transport; and professional and business services - and six sector-by-skill categories - high- and low-skilled manufacturing, construction, and services. The results of ordinal regression analyses for product and process innovation show that the drivers of innovation differ widely across sectors. While exchanges internal to the firm tend to be disconnected from innovation across the board, those with scientific and industrial partners prove to be important drivers of innovation not only for firms in sectors, such as manufacturing, traditionally deemed to benefit from these partnerships, but also for sectors regarded as less innovative, such as construction. This pattern even holds for low-skilled firms in the manufacturing and construction sectors.","[Fitjar, Rune Dahl] Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, Stavanger, Norway; [Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",Universitetet i Stavanger; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England.",rune.d.fitjar@uis.no; a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008; Fitjar, Rune Dahl/C-2580-2013","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856; Fitjar, Rune Dahl/0000-0001-5333-2701",Research Council of Norway under the programmes Demosreg [209761/H20]; FORFI [212275/D00]; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [269868],Research Council of Norway under the programmes Demosreg(Research Council of Norway); FORFI; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)),"The financial support from the Research Council of Norway under the programmes Demosreg [project number 209761/H20] and FORFI [project number 212275/D00], and of the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [(FP7/2007-2013)/ERC Grant Agreement Number 269868] is also gratefully acknowledged.",,41,7,7,3,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Using the global Malmquist-Luenberger (GML) index method, this paper estimates and decomposes the total factor CO2 emission performance (TFCEP, i.e., the environmentally sensitive productivity growth considering CO2 emissions as an undesirable output) of 32 industrial subsectors in Shanghai (China) over 1994-2011 for the first time. Furthermore, it adopts the system generalized method of moments (SGMM) to investigate the determinants of the TFCEP. We find that the environmentally sensitive productivity of overall industry in Shanghai keeps improved in recent years. Technical progress rather than efficiency promotion is the main contributor to ameliorate the TFCEP. Enhancing R&D intensity, optimizing energy consumption structure, and improving energy efficiency and labor productivity are beneficial to enhance the TFCEP, while capital deepening is the detriment of the TFCEP. Encouraging green technological innovation and adoption by combining the government intervention with market mechanism is significant to promote the TFCEP. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Three common approaches to LA ESCo model engagement are outlined including the: (1) LA owned 'arm's-length' model; (2) private sector owned concession agreement model; and (3) community owned and run model. The LA's decision to establish its own ESCo, or alternatively enter into a partnership with another, predominantly depends on: its willingness to expose itself to risk, the level of strategic control it desires and the resources it has at its disposal. However, the business case is contingent on the extent to which the national policy and regulatory framework facilitates and obligates LAs to play an active energy governance role. Stronger alignment of local and national energy agendas through communication and coordination between different governance actors could help to remove critical barriers to LA ESCo engagement and their wider energy governance activities.

We extend the unobserved components model, which divides asset price returns into permanent and transitory components, to investigate the interrelations across housing assets, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and stocks in the USA. After 1984, which is the estimated break point in cross-asset interactions, many metropolitan statistical area-level housing markets display vulnerability to housing bubbles due to high permanent-transitory ratios, which suggests weak monetary policy effectiveness in stabilizing the housing boom-bust cycles. Households can diversify long-run risks by establishing stock-housing and REIT-stock portfolios after 1984, but they have fewer diversification opportunities in the post-1984 subperiod than in the pre-1984 subperiod.","[Huang, MeiChi] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Business Adm, New Taipei City 23741, Taiwan; [Wang, Tzu-Chien] Yuan Ze Univ, Coll Management, Discipline Finance, Taoyuan, Taiwan",National Taipei University; Yuan Ze University,"Huang, MC (通讯作者)，Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Business Adm, 151 Univ Rd, New Taipei City 23741, Taiwan.",meichihuang@mail.ntpu.edu.tw; wangzi421@gmail.com,,,National Science Council of Taiwan,"National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This paper is partially supported by a grant from the National Science Council of Taiwan.

With total cost of ownership being on average lower for NGVs than for gasoline and diesel vehicles this raises the question of the existence of market failure in the German NGV-market. We use a case study approach where we combine quantitative data with insights from a multi-industry expert panel and in-depth interviews with experts from industry, government and civil society in order to examine whether and how different types of market failure contribute to the status quo in the German market for NGVs. We conclude that coordination failure in complementary markets, an artificially created monopoly of service stations at motorways, imperfect information, bounded consumer rationality, and principle-agent-problems are the most prominent market failures inhibiting the development of a functioning market for NGVs. Our results are instructive for the design of effective public policies and investor strategies aiming to create markets for alternative fuel vehicles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, we compare the efficacy of the most widely used information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) , with the commonly used sequential approach of Johansen [Likelihood-based Inference in Cointegrated Vector Autoregressive Models (1996)] based around the use of either asymptotic or wild bootstrap-based likelihood ratio type tests. Complementing recent work done for the latter in Cavaliere, Rahbek and Taylor [Econometric Reviews (2014) forthcoming], we establish the asymptotic properties of the procedures based on information criteria in the presence of heteroskedasticity (conditional or unconditional) of a quite general and unknown form. The relative finite-sample properties of the different methods are investigated by means of a Monte Carlo simulation study. For the simulation DGPs considered in the analysis, we find that the BIC-based procedure and the bootstrap sequential test procedure deliver the best overall performance in terms of their frequency of selecting the correct co-integration rank across different values of the co-integration rank, sample size, stationary dynamics and models of heteroskedasticity. Of these, the wild bootstrap procedure is perhaps the more reliable overall as it avoids a significant tendency seen in the BIC-based method to over-estimate the co-integration rank in relatively small sample sizes.","[Cavaliere, Giuseppe; De Angelis, Luca] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, I-40124 Bologna, Italy; [Rahbek, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Taylor, A.

We based this research on the assumption that the perception of these activities by Slovak customers will be arising from long-term exposure to mechanisms of centrally planned economy different in comparison with other countries.

The shortages occurred because of the economic collapse has larger social consequences, the risk of social exclusion has increased noticeably, the society suffered a loss of human resources. This may involve a high level of social exclusion which leads to increased social tensions. A nation with higher levels of social exclusion means a nation with a declining economy in which it can be readily seen a decreasing level of education, productivity and innovation, as well as an increasing unemployment rate.

Typical estimation is of a reduced form model relating per capita emissions to per capita GDP (and sometimes to energy consumption) with an eye toward determining whether a country's per capita emissions increase or decrease with per capita GDP. In this article, we consider a number of practical issues in estimating and using the EKC for energy policy analysis. Proper estimation procedures should be used if the empirical work is to provide valid estimates of the EKC's shape. In addition, policymakers should proceed with caution when crafting policy on the basis of reduced form estimates of the EKC because the reduced form model provides limited insight into the policy implications of the relationship between income, energy consumption and emissions.

Econometric theory suggests that the between estimator might generate the best estimates of long-run elasticities but no existing estimates of elasticities of substitution have used it. Alternatively, Chirinko et al. argued in favor of estimating long-run elasticities of substitution using a long-run difference estimator. We provide estimates of China's interfuel and interfactor elasticities of substitution using the between and long-run difference estimators. To address potential omitted variables bias, we add province level inefficiency and national technological change terms to our regression model. The results show that demand for coal and electricity in China is very inelastic, while demand for diesel and gasoline is elastic. With the exception of gasoline and diesel, there are limited substitution possibilities among the fuels. Substitution possibilities are greater between energy and labor than between energy and capital. The results are quite different to some previous studies for China but coincide well with the patterns found in meta-analyses for long-run estimates of elasticities of substitution.

We lay out a general methodology to estimate an effect of interest based on the construction of an instrument that immunizes against model selection mistakes and apply it to the case of logistic binary choice model. More specifically we propose new methods for estimating and constructing confidence regions for a regression parameter of primary interest alpha(0), a parameter in front of the regressor of interest, such as the treatment variable or a policy variable. These methods allow to estimate alpha(0) at the root-n rate when the total number p of other regressors, called controls, potentially exceeds the sample size n using sparsity assumptions. The sparsity assumption means that there is a subset of son controls, which suffices to accurately approximate the nuisance part of the regression function. Importantly, the estimators and these resulting confidence regions are valid uniformly over s-sparse models satisfying s(2) log(2) p = o(n) and other technical conditions. These procedures do not rely on traditional consistent model selection arguments for their validity. In fact, they are robust with respect to moderate model selection mistakes in variable selection. Under suitable conditions, the estimators are semi-parametrically efficient in the sense of attaining the semi-parametric efficiency bounds for the class of models in this article.","[Belloni, Alexandre] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Chernozhukov, Victor] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Wei, Ying] Columbia Univ, Dept Biostat, New York, NY 10032 USA",Duke University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Columbia University,"Belloni, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",abn5@duke.edu; vchern@mit.edu; yw2148@columbia.edu,,,,,,,31,78,95,1,17,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

The results show that social capital effects on growth are nonlinear. Parameter heterogeneity could also be examined, showing heterogenous effects across regions and over time. In particular, social capital is mostly negative in regions from Eastern and Central Europe during the first years of transition from socialism to market economies.

Regimes of low and high uncertainty are identified in a threshold VAR model in which the effects of structural oil demand and supply shocks are estimated. The results show that higher macroeconomic uncertainty, as measured by global industrial production volatility, significantly increases the sensitivity of oil prices to shocks in oil demand and supply. This occurs as uncertainty lowers the price elasticity of oil demand and supply. The difference in the estimated oil price elasticities is economically meaningful as the price impact of a similar change in oil production might double when it hits the economy in uncertain times. As such, varying uncertainty can explain why oil price volatility is typically higher during periods such as financial crises and recessions, and why oil price volatility changes over time more generally.","[Van Robays, Ine] European Cent Bank, Sonnemanstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Van Robays, I (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Sonnemanstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",ine.van-robays@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,48,91,94,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

We find that changes in both variables are now linked by a negative relationship, going from the dollar exchange rate to the real oil price. However, the same relationship is found positive when ending the sample in the mid-2000s, in line with the previous literature. To understand and investigate this evolution, we rely on a nonlinear, smooth transition regression model in which the oil price-dollar nexus depends on the dynamics followed by the U.S. currency. Our results show that the relationship is negative most of the times but turns positive when the dollar hits very high values, as in the early eighties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Legislation to tax plug-in vehicles has been proposed or implemented in several states. Those propositions are contrary to policies to promote fuel efficient vehicles. This paper assesses (1) the magnitude of the decline in federal fuel tax revenue caused by plug-in vehicles and (2) quantifies the revenue that could be generated from a federal plug-in vehicle registration fee. We find that the contribution of plug-in vehicles to the decline of the federal fuel tax revenue is at most 1.6% and the majority of the shortfall can be attributed to the non-adjustment of the fuel tax rate and the increase in vehicle fuel efficiency by 2040. An additional tax of $50-$200 per plug-in vehicle per year in the reference case would generate $188 -$745 million in 2040 which represents an increase of 1.69-6.71% in federal fuel tax revenue compared to no tax. The lesson for policy makers is that plug-in vehicles do not contribute significantly to the funding shortfall in the short- and medium-run and a supplemental tax would generate a small percentage of additional revenue.

Forty-three entrepreneurs were interviewed in 28 developing countries and secondary information about country and regional conditions was analysed. We chose the Business Model Canvas as an analytical tool and the findings shed new light on established renewable energy business types. Three different types of businesses were identified- Consultants, Distributors, and Integrators; yet, there is also some overlap between these types. These business types appeared to parallel the life cycle progression of the business, but this requires further research. A key component of the study was to assess whether the types of businesses were related to country-level conditions to assess the impact of regional differences. These comparisons revealed consistencies between country-level characteristics and the entrepreneurs' choice of business model. Conclusions suggest that different regions may support certain business models more than others due to differing levels of government interest in renewables, governance and policy support and the relative ease of doing business.

At the same time, there is some tentative evidence suggesting that oil rich nations tend to under-report data on income inequality, which can potentially influence the estimated empirical relationships between oil richness and income inequality. In this paper we contribute to the literature in a twofold manner. First, we explore in depth the empirical relationship between oil and income inequality by making use of the Standardized World Income Inequality Database the most comprehensive dataset on income inequality providing comparable data for the broadest set of country-year observations. Second, this is the first study to our knowledge that adopts an empirical framework to examine whether oil rich nations tend to under-report data on income inequality and the possible implications thereof.

We derive parameter estimates from a 105-year time series of U.S. population mortality data using a simulated maximum likelihood approach based on a particle filter. Relying on the resulting parameters, we calculate loss profiles for a representative catastrophe mortality transaction and compare them to the official loss profiles that are provided by the issuers to investors and rating agencies. We find that although the loss profiles are subject to great uncertainties, the official figures fall significantly below the corresponding risk statistics based on our model. In particular, we find that the annualized incidence probability of a mortality catastrophe, defined as a 15% increase in aggregated mortality probabilities, is about 1.4%compared to about 0.1% according to the official loss profiles.","[Bauer, Daniel] Georgia State Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Kramer, Florian] Allianz Investment Management SE, D-80802 Munich, Germany",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Allianz SE,"Bauer, D (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",dbauer@gsu.edu; florian.kramer@allianz.com,,"Bauer, Daniel/0000-0001-6425-3769",German Research Foundation (DFG Research Training Group 1100),German Research Foundation (DFG Research Training Group 1100),"The authors are grateful for helpful comments from participants at the Mid-Term Conference on Advanced Mathematical Methods in Finance 2007; the 2008 Workshop on Prospective Mortality Tables, Longevity and Mortality Linked Securities; the Fifth International Longevity Risk and Capital Markets Solutions Conference as well as seminar participants at Ecole Polytechnique, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia State University, Queens University, and Ulm University.

To reconcile the mixed evidence, this paper examines the nonlinear relationship between the agglomeration of exporters and export decisions. In brief, the results show that the former positively affects the latter. Furthermore, the squared term of agglomeration calculated only by the number of skilled workers is negatively and significantly associated with export decisions, which can be explained by congestion costs in a local labor market for the skilled worker. As a result, these findings suggest an inverted U-shaped relationship between the agglomeration of exporters and the probability of being an exporter.","[Kang, Youngho] Soongsil Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Soongsil University,"Kang, Y (通讯作者)，Soongsil Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",yhkang@soongsil.ac.kr,,,Soongsil University Research Fund,Soongsil University Research Fund,"I would like to give thanks to Robert McNown, Jin-Hyuk Kim, anonymous referee and the Editor Martin Andersson for valuable comments and suggestions.

The system Better Place proposed had two novel prongs; first, to reduce the cost of batteries, and second, to reduce range anxiety, public infrastructure concerns, and long charging times. Yet, despite this seemingly strong combination, Better Place failed to make any progress in Denmark and Israel, the first two markets it operated in, and subsequently declared bankruptcy, selling off its collective assets for less than $500,000. Drawing from science and technology studies and the notion of interpretive flexibility, this paper posits several reasons to explain the failure of Better Place, including that Denmark is not as green as it seems nor is the Israeli market as attractive as believed, and that Better Place's solution to charging time and range anxiety resolved a psychological, not a functional, barrier of the general public to adopt electric vehicles. Before investigating these two reasons, the paper presents a short history of Better Place and explores the contours of its operations in Denmark and Israel. It then discusses why Better Place failed across both countries before concluding with implications for energy planning, policy, and analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This thermal intensive use of electricity has a high load factor and is a contributory factor of electricity demand outstripping supply at peak demand periods. The government has promoted liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as an alternative thermal energy source for household cooking and heating. This study evaluates the long-term successes, challenges and social impacts of an LPG intervention project that was piloted in Atteridgeville Township, a typical low-income suburb. The data was gathered through one-on-one household interviews with a sample of the beneficiaries. The results indicate that seven years after the LPG intervention, about 70% of the beneficiaries continue to use LPG and report that the intervention has improved their welfare. Fast cooking is cited as the key tangible benefit of LPG technology in households, followed by saving on electricity bills. The project would have achieved more success through better community engagement, including strict beneficiary selection criteria; a long-term LPG distribution and maintenance plan; and inclusion of recurring monthly LPG subsidies for indigent households. The study discusses the subset of factors necessary for successful rollouts of similar energy projects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using our unique measures of proximity of Chinese firms and industries to the world technology frontier, we find that despite vast sectoral heterogeneity, Chinese manufacturing industries have undergone rapid technological upgrading over the period of 2000-06. The distance to the world production frontier of firms and industries plays an important role in shaping the nexus between the competition pressure from foreign imports and domestic firms' growth and innovation behaviour. Our results support the theoretical predictions of Aghion etal. (2005, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, pp. 701-728) that import competition stimulates the domestic firms' productivity growth and R&D expenditure if firms and their industries are close to the world frontier, but discourages such incentives for laggard firms and industries. The two forces highlighted by the model operate for imports under the ordinary-trade regime, for collective and private firms, and for imports originated from high-income countries. Our findings are robust after controlling the influence of foreign investment, the reverse causality of regressors and the short-term business cycle fluctuations.","[Ding, Sai] Univ Glasgow, Dept Econ, Adam Smith Business Sch, Gilbert Scott Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Sun, Puyang; Jiang, Wei] Nankai Univ, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",University of Glasgow; Nankai University,"Ding, S (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Dept Econ, Adam Smith Business Sch, Gilbert Scott Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.;Sun, PY; Jiang, W (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",sai.ding@glasgow.ac.uk; puyangsun@nankai.edu.cn; weijiang923@gmail.com,,"Ding, Sai/0000-0003-1621-8656",,,,,53,19,20,3,74,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

The core element of the methodology is a linear optimization model with a total cost objective function, which includes financial, as well as external costs and benefits. Altitude proves to have decisive influence on energy optimization results, because it affects energy demand. The improvement of local energy systems provides greater-socioeconomic benefits in mountainous settlements, due to the high shares of renewables and energy efficiency interventions in the optimal solutions. Energy poverty can be alleviated by redesigning local energy systems and the structure of the energy market. However, spatial and aesthetic restrictions, presented often in mountainous settlements, may affect the operational costs of energy systems, which is a crucial parameter for confronting energy poverty. Furthermore, the study indicates that it could be better to electrify remote areas, far from electricity grids, by decentralized systems than by grid expansion. The results of this study and the assumptions made about the way in which energy market should function, could be utilized for reconsidering energy policy measures, aiming at supporting sensitive societies to improve their development perspectives.

To decrease objections from local residents, previous studies identified factors that evoke negative attitudes. However, little research has focused on the acceptance of people who remain silent. Therefore, the situation in which there is no marked opposition has been regarded as a success for the project. This research focused on the acceptance of people who are not objecting to a wind farm in their backyard and clarifies the implications of the silent situation. One of the principal findings is that while most of the respondents accept the existing local wind farm, they have negative attitudes towards a new wind farm. This result means that the silent situation does not support further wind development. We conclude that the purpose of consensus building needs to be set to encouraging local residents to express their opinions instead of simply aiming for the absence of opposing opinions. Finally, we discuss a council model through a budgetary provision, eliciting opinions from people who remain silent, and adaptable management as the policy implications for sustainable wind development.

In particular, forced outages or blackouts have enormous consequences on society, one of which is loss of economic surplus. The society relies on having a continuous supply of electrical energy. Some customers may willingly risk this continuous supply and participate in demand management programs for electrical power. If the power system grid is in trouble, electric utilities need to have demand relief. Customers willing to reduce their demand to help the system can receive an incentive fee for helping the utilities. Demand relief can be system wide or location specific. Sometimes it can be more effective to fix the electrical demand vs. supply imbalance from the demand side. The value of demand management contracts is greatly affected by customer location. Inclusion of locational attributes into the contract design procedure increases the effectiveness of the contracts by helping a utility get more value from its demand management programs. Independent System Operators and regulators, among others, can also benefit from effective demand management. This paper will investigate how this type of demand management contracts can help the electricity sector both in regulated and deregulated environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, the energy return on investment (EROI), net-to-gross energy output ratio (NTG) and non-renewable cumulative energy demand (nr-CED) indicators were calculated for coal, oil, gas, biomass, nuclear, hydro, wind and PV electricity. Results point to wind, and to a lesser extent PV, as the most recommendable technologies overall in order to foster a transition towards an improved electricity grid mix in the UK, from both points of view of short-term effectiveness at providing a net energy gain to support the multiple societal energy consumption patterns, and long-term energy sustainability (the latter being inversely proportional to the reliance on non-renewable primary energy sources). The importance to maintain a sufficient installed capacity of readily-dispatchable gas-fired electricity is also recognised. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Data were available on the usage of charging infrastructure for the entire island of Ireland since the rollout of infrastructure began. This study provides an extensive analysis of this charge event data for public charging infrastructure, including data from fast charging infrastructure, and additionally a limited quantity of household data. For the household data available, it was found that EV users prefer to carry out the majority of their charging at home in the evening during the period of highest demand on the electrical grid indicating that incentivisation may be required to shift charging away from this peak grid demand period. Car park locations were the most popular location for public charging amongst EV users, and fast chargers recorded the highest usage frequencies, indicating that public fast charging infrastructure is most likely to become commercially viable in the short- to medium-term.

Furthermore, wage inequality explains only 15% of income inequality across metros. Income inequality is more closely associated with unionization, race and poverty.

The efficiency of innovation is a conglomerate of organizational and leadership aspects, macro- and microeconomic backgrounds, technology access and more. The idea generation, the deployment and the development process is dependent on the corporate culture, management style but mainly of the employees in general. The author has undertaken a market investigation to find out, which group of human resources in a company the main innovation impulses are generated from. The analysis discloses the fact, that a huge mass of unused potential can be awaked by a more active management, leadership and motivation of the existing sources! Potential for impulses for efficient innovation are many. Also the use of external knowledge and development resources offer the chance to reduce time to market and to get a higher degree of differentiation. Networking in a proactive and constructive result oriented way be a part or getting inspiration, ideas and solutions. The successful path leads over the proper management of human resources, including shaping a mix of persons of various characters, selection of leaders, enabling and integrating more staff towards an active role in the innovation process and generous sponsorship by the top management.

The paper presents a research project aimed at encouraging rehabilitation researchers, theoreticians, and practitioners to engage with humor as a site of resistance that offers juveniles a springboard to achieve expected levels of social adjustment. The study aims to identify and compare humor styles in socially maladjusted girls (n(1) = 56) and boys (n(2) = 72). The research problem included the level (intensity) and gender-related differences in particular humor types (styles) across the juvenile sample. The research tool involved an adaption of the Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ). The findings suggest a greater intensity of adaptive rather than non-adaptive humor styles in both studied subsets of the sample. Furthermore, a statistically significant gender-related difference was found for self-defeating humor, with significantly higher scores in girls than in boys (p < 0.05). Although the findings do not confirm the research hypotheses conclusively, they shed light on the viability of using humor in juvenile rehabilitation and thus, encourage further systematic research in this area.","[Karlyk-Cwik, Anna] Univ Lower Silesia Wroclaw, Fac Educ, Dept Special Pedag, Wroclaw, Poland",,"Karlyk-Cwik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lower Silesia Wroclaw, Fac Educ, Dept Special Pedag, Wroclaw, Poland.",anna.karlyk-cwik@dsw.edu.pl,,,,,,,42,1,1,1,7,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,464,470,,10.12955/cbup.v4.799,0.0,,,7,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000068,0

This technology enables one to observe the voltage generated by a neuromuscular system and to interpret body movements. Over time, it has been proved highly difficult to precisely determine the beginning of a muscle contraction. A relatively low signal to noise ratio, which is even smaller in case of a surface electromyography (sEMG), complicates this task, and more advanced onset detection algorithms were proposed. Despite the existence of statistically advanced algorithms, proposed in recent years, in many cases a manual onset detection performed by an EMG specialist remains in use, mainly due to lack of reliable solutions. This paper presents a hidden factor, not found in the literature until now, which directly relates subsequent voltage values with muscle activity. Observation of this parameter helps detect muscle onset precisely. Combined with other statistical factors, it can shed light on a totally new, enhanced branch of muscle onset estimators. This study conducts a numerical comparison to follow the hypothesis that the examined factor is correlated with a muscle contraction state.","[Magda, Mateusz] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Comp Sci & Management, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Science & Technology,"Magda, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Comp Sci & Management, Wroclaw, Poland.",mateusz.magda@pwr.edu.pl,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,7,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,873,878,,10.12955/cbup.v4.867,0.0,,,6,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000134,0

It is specially the retailing industry where huge changes are in progress with respect to the development of information and communication technologies. The basic trends of retail trade can be divided into two groups. First one includes those that are inspired by the past and logically in the other there are trends that are formed based on current technological solutions and future consumer behaviour estimates. In constantly intensifying competitive environment of the current retail business it is necessary both to perceive and be interested in the customer needs and desires on one hand, and on the other to follow modern technological capabilities, as well as any competitor activities. In addition to knowing the needs and desires of your customers is for business success necessary to also focus on how these customers are transforming in relation to the lifestyle changes, which was among other things initiated by smart mobile devices, internet access or access to information and not least the social networking phenomenon. This article is discussing a comprehensive review of trends in utilization of selected technologies and their reception by customers/perception in Slovak grocery stores.

A combination of new and powerful linear and nonlinear stationarity tests are employed to achieve the objectives of the study. We find that the oil consumption series in 21 countries follow a nonlinearity path while those in the other countries are linear in nature. Evidence of the presence of a unit root is found for the total oil consumption series in 38 countries while the series is stationary in the remaining 19 countries. An important insight is that the blueprints that were designed to reduce oil consumption are likely to have a permanent effect in most of the countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective is to shed light on the implementation of currently employed policy mechanisms that aim to achieve the 2020 energy savings targets and beyond, providing useful information to policy makers for future policy (re-) formulations. In this framework, policy instruments were evaluated against process-related criteria, such as implementation costs, distributional effects, and coherence of policy processes, so as to highlight successful policy practices during their implementation phase as well as to unveil cases of policy under-performance or unintended policy outcomes. To hedge uncertainties related to policy instrument selection, the method employs probabilistic evaluations of every alternative against each criterion. The MCA results showed that the country is still missing significant energy saving opportunities that could be reached through more streamlined implementation practices and political support. In times of fiscal crisis, the Greek government should also revitalize the implementation of alternative funding mechanisms and support policy alternatives such as green public procurement, voluntary agreements, and energy performance contracting.

In this paper, we first evaluate how much unconventional gas might be available based on an analysis of technically recoverable resources for three types of unconventional gas resources: shale gas, coalbed methane and tight gas. We then develop three alternative scenarios of how this extraction might proceed, using the Geologic Resources Supply Demand Model. Based on our analysis, the medium scenario, which we would consider to be our best estimate, shows a resource peak of 176.1 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2068. Depending on economic conditions and advance in extraction techniques, production could vary greatly from this. If economic conditions are adverse, unconventional natural gas production could perhaps be as low as 70.1 bcm, peaking in 2021. Under the extremely optimistic assumption that all of the resources that appear to be technologically available can actually be recovered, unconventional production could amount to as much as 469.7 bcm, with peak production in 2069. Even if this high scenario is achieved, China's total gas production will only be sufficient to meet China's lowest demand forecast. If production instead matches our best estimate, significant amounts of natural gas imports are likely to be needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Its focus on agricultural production can not only makes people relax physically and mentally, but also can carry out the corresponding harvest. At the same time, it is different from the traditional landscape of the aesthetic and the ecological environment of the city to improve the ability to obtain people's favors. Based on the above, this paper analyzes the application of the productive landscape in the urban environment design. The research of this paper has a positive significance to promote the development and application of the productive landscape in urban environment. No. 1 Concept of Productive Landscape Productive landscape is based on agricultural productive work. It's a kind of landscape architecture built on the basis of agricultural production and industrial production. It is based on the production of material, including productive activities, such as farming, forestry, animal husbandry, side-line production and fishery, etc, and some output of resource. It mixes traditional agricultural activities up with urban natural landscape, which can get resources and please people at the same time. Thus, it is an aesthetic and enjoyable city landscape. Since its emergence, productive landscape has been applied in different cities and has come out from traditional city landscape. Not only does it have aesthetic function, but it also has brought its special productivity into city landscape. In productive landscape, people can do relevant agricultural productive activities, during which people can get some fruit and vegetables, and citizens can get some new mental experience different from traditional landscape. People can feel the turns of seasons more clearly. At the same time, productive landscape has active influence on the improvement of air quality and conservation of water and soil. No. 2 Necessity of Productive Landscape Integrating into Urban Environment With the development of society and the progress of urbanization, in cities full of high-rise buildings, the loading capacity of lands is amplified. For some landscapes, simplicity and aesthetic characters become their main features. In high-speed-life cities, people expect to do relevant natural productive activities, such as planting and managing crops, after their busy work.

Regional variations in emergency service performance: does social capital matter?, Regional Studies. The relationship between social capital and the performance of public organizations is currently at the top of the UK policy agenda and elsewhere. This paper examines whether social capital is associated with improved regional emergency service performance by exploring its relationship with the achievements of ambulance trusts in England. Drawing on a six-year panel dataset, ambulance response times are modelled using an index of social capital, incorporating measures of community organizational life, political efficacy and social trust, in the regions served by National Health Service (NHS) ambulance trusts.

To account for the diverse dimensions of skills, we measure workers' skills using disaggregated measures of occupational skills requirements from the Korea Network for Occupations and Workers data. Using factor analysis, we identify three broad occupational skills categories: cognitive, technical, and physical. The multilevel analysis yields several important empirical results. First, the average occupational wage tends to be higher in occupations that are associated with higher cognitive skills and lower levels of technical and physical skills. Second, the gender effect on wages is larger in occupations requiring higher levels of physical skills and lower levels of technical skills, when controlling for individual- and occupation-level variables. However, the wage penalty associated with technical skills is more severe for women than it is for men, suggesting a significant wage disadvantage for women in occupations associated with technical skills. Finally, in addition to the main effect of the three dimensions of occupational skills, the effect of a greater proportion of female workers within an occupation is significant and negative for all workers, but this effect is less pronounced for men.","[Lim, Up; Choi, Ye Seul] Yonsei Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea; [Lee, Heonyoung] Korea Environm Inst, Sejong 339007, South Korea",Yonsei University; Korea Environment Institute (KEI),"Lim, U (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",uplim@yonsei.ac.kr; yeseul.choi@yonsei.ac.kr; leehy@kei.re.kr,"Lim, Up/G-7971-2012",,,,,,51,3,4,0,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

System operators therefore need to rely increasingly on the active control of the transmission network. Transmission topology control is a fast and economical option to add flexibility to the transmission system. We model the current methodology for controlling congestion in the Central Western European (CWE) market and quantify the benefits of topology control. We also compare the results with a nodal pricing model. Our computational results suggest that topology control can significantly reduce congestion management costs under the current market coupling regime whereas the benefits of topology control are limited under nodal pricing. Topology control emerges as an attractive and implementable means of managing congestion as it provides a significant percentage of the cost savings that would be achieved by overhauling the existing European market design and shifting to a nodal pricing regime.

The extensive body of literature on affordability measures has little overlap with the existing literature on poverty measurement. A comprehensive assessment of the response of affordability measures as a result of changes in the distribution of income or expenditure (the dynamic properties) is missing. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a conceptual discussion on the 'dynamics' of both energy affordability measures and fuel poverty measures. Several types of measures are examined in a microsimulation framework. Our results indicate that some measures exhibit odd dynamic behavior. This includes measures used in practice, such as the low income/high cost measure and the double median of expenditure share indicator. Odd dynamic behavior causes the risk of drawing false policy recommendations from the measures. Thus, an appropriate response of affordability measures to changes in relevant variables is a prerequisite for defining meaningful measures that inform about affordability or deprivation in certain domains of consumption.

Many empirical studies explain the nexus between carbon dioxide emissions and economic growth with such models as the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) theory. However, the assumptions of these models have never received strict verification with a large available data set and therefore may not be appropriate to describe the relationship. In this study, the nexus is modeled for 67 countries from 1971 to 2010 using a novel symbolic regression method. From the experimental results, several conclusions as follows could be reached. Firstly, there is no universal model fitting every country, and symbolic regression could discover a set of reasonable models for a specific country or region. Secondly, four models, including the inverted N-shaped, M-shaped, inverted U-shaped and monotonically increasing, are frequently found without domain experts' intervention in these countries, whereas the M-shaped model has received little attention in previous studies but exhibits promising performance. Thirdly, the relationship is diversified due to the difference of regions and economic development, where developed countries generally follow the inverted N-shaped and M-shaped models to explain the relationship, whereas developing countries are more likely to refer to the inverted N-shaped, inverted U-shaped and monotonically increasing models. Finally, several policy suggestions are presented. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis takes into account national end-use data from the residential and tertiary sector that had not been exploited up to now. Four final energy demand scenarios with diverging assumptions were defined in this study, offering a wide range of possible outcomes up to 2040; in addition, four alternative scenarios were applied for sensitivity analysis. Two of these scenarios can be regarded as those continuing the trends of the recent past in Cyprus (prior to the economic and financial downturn of years 2011-2014). However, a more rigorous implementation of energy efficiency measures in buildings and transport, as defined in the fourth scenario of this study, is also realistic; despite its potential costs, it might allow Cyprus both to decrease its carbon emissions in line with the long-term EU decarbonisation targets, and to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, thereby promoting energy efficiency as an important climate change adaptation measure.

Unlike the existing algorithm, our algorithm can achieve reasonably fast convergence to the posterior distribution even when the latent regime-indicator variable is highly persistent or when there exist absorbing states. Another goal is to appropriately investigate the dynamics of the latent ex-ante real interest rate (EARR) in the presence of structural breaks, by employing the econometric tool developed. We show that excluding the theory-implied moving-average terms may understate the persistence of the observed EPRR dynamics. Our empirical results suggest that, even though we rule out the possibility of a unit root in the EARR, it may be more persistent and volatile than has been documented in some of the literature.","[Kim, Chang-Jin] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Kim, Jaeho] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Kim, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",changjin@uw.edu; jaeho@ou.edu,"Kim, Chang-Jin/AAN-4657-2020","Kim, Jaeho/0000-0003-4949-9925","National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-R1303501, KRF-2008-342-B00006]; Bryan C.

The incidence is calculated with respect to both income and expenditure distributions in order to consider the potential differences between transitory and permanent income. The Suits Index is estimated as a measure of the degree of progressivity of the tax, and confidence intervals are calculated using a bootstrap methodology to statistically compare changes in the incidence given changes in the tax. The results show that the tax, contrary to the evidence for several developed countries, is slightly or moderately progressive, with a lower degree of progressivity observed in the calculations based on income than those based on expenditure. The simulation of the 25% reduction in the tax rate implemented in 2008 shows that, in terms of incidence, its effect is to reduce the progressivity of the gasoline tax, which is the opposite of what was sought by the government with this policy.

Iberia stands as an ideal case-study, where the high level deployment of wind power is observed, together with the implementation of the market splitting arrangement between the Portuguese and the Spanish spot electricity markets. Logit and non-parametric models are used to express the probability response for market splitting of day-ahead spot electricity prices as a function of the explanatory variables representing the main technologies in the generation mix: wind, hydro, thermal and nuclear power, together with the available transfer capacity and electricity demand. Logit models give preliminary indications about market splitting behaviour, and then, notwithstanding the demanding computational challenge, a non-parametric model is applied in order to overcome the limitations of the former models. Results show an increase of market splitting probability with higher wind power generation or, more generally, with higher availability of low marginal cost electricity such as nuclear power generation. The European interconnection capacity target of 10% of the peak demand of the smallest interconnected market might be insufficient to maintain electricity market integration. Therefore, pro-active coordination policies, governing both interconnections and renewables deployment, should be further developed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In 2030, this target will increase to 15%, expanding to include the construction of electricity highways to connect MS and non-EU neighbouring countries in order to fulfil energy and climate goals. While most cross-borders interconnections are envisaged as regulated lines, private players will play a significant role in increasing interconnection via the Merchant Transmission Investment (MTI) exception. By reviewing the procedural and substantive treatment of the existing five MTI interconnectors, this paper evaluates whether the existing legal and regulatory framework adopted in the EU represents a suitable model for the development of cross border interconnections. Further, the paper explores the MTI exception as a potential model for cross-border interconnection with non-EU neighbouring countries. This analysis demonstrates that MTI's potential contribution would not significantly impact the achievement of the 2020 target. Moreover, the existing regulatory framework for merchant lines among MS is not apt for MTI developed between MS and non-EU countries, since the interconnection developed with non-EU neighbouring countries to date has necessitated non-market characteristics too extraordinary to be practical on a continuing basis.

Energy efficiency improvements can have significant micro- and macroeconomic effects that hamper the positive effect on real energy savings. To assess the size of the overall rebound effect in the Swedish economy, we apply a computable general equilibrium model. The results show that the economy-wide rebound effect depends on a number of factors, e.g. the extent of the energy efficiency improvement, how the labour market is modelled as well as whether the increase in energy efficiency is combined with a cost or not. We find that the rebound effect following a five per cent increase in energy efficiency in the Swedish industry lies in the 40-70 per cent range. When energy efficiency is only improved in energy-intensive production, the rebound effect becomes even higher. These findings are in line with the results in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We assume asymmetric information, in that the firms' abatement costs with the new technology are either high or low. Environmental policy is set either before the firms invest (commitment) or after (time consistency). Under commitment, the welfare comparison follows a modified Weitzman rule, featuring reverse probability weighting for the slope of the marginal abatement cost curve. Both instruments can lead to under- or overinvestment ex post. Tradable permits lead to less than optimal expected new technology adoption.

A decomposition approach is developed based on multilevel Poisson migration models. Multilevel Poisson migration models are estimated for migration in China for the periods 1985-1990 and 1995-2000. Overall, the total inter-provincial migration was increased by 22 million in China from 1985-1990 to 1995-2000. The decomposition result shows that 62.28% of this increase was due to changes in the value of explanatory variables, while 37.72% was due to changes in the value of model parameters.","[Shen, Jianfa] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Shen, Jianfa] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Res Ctr Urban & Reg Dev, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Shen, JF (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jianfa@cuhk.edu.hk,"Shen, Jianfa/H-8142-2013","Shen, Jianfa/0000-0003-4110-0561",Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR (RGC) [450107]; Chinese University of Hong Kong [2021070]; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR (RGC) [450107]; Chinese University of Hong Kong [2021070],Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR (RGC); Chinese University of Hong Kong(Chinese University of Hong Kong); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR (RGC); Chinese University of Hong Kong(Chinese University of Hong Kong),The work described in this paper was supported by a research grant from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR (RGC Project Number 450107) and a Direct Research Grant from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Project Code Number 2021070).

The analysis focuses on the competition between traditional diesel trucks, natural gas vehicles (NGVs), and ultra-efficient powertrains. Underlying the study is a vehicle choice and stock model of the U.S. heavy-duty vehicle market. The model is segmented by vehicle class, body type, powertrain, fleet size, and operational type. We find that conventional diesel trucks will dominate the market through 2050, but NGVs could have significant market penetration depending on key technological and economic uncertainties. Compressed natural gas trucks conducting urban trips in fleets that can support private infrastructure are economically viable now and will continue to gain market share. Ultra-efficient diesel trucks, exemplified by the U.S. Department of Energy's SuperTruck program, are the preferred alternative in the long haul segment, but could compete with liquefied natural gas (LNG) trucks if the fuel price differential between LNG and diesel increases. However, the greatest impact in reducing petroleum consumption and pollutant emissions is had by investing in efficiency technologies that benefit all powertrains, especially the conventional diesels that comprise the majority of the stock, instead of incentivizing specific alternatives.

This paper investigates how variety affects the innovation output of a region. Borrowing arguments from theories of recombinant innovation, it is expected that related variety will enhance innovation as related technologies are more easily recombined into a new technology. However, it is also expected that unrelated variety enhances technological breakthroughs, since radical innovation often stems from connecting previously unrelated technologies opening up whole new functionalities and applications. Using patent data for US states in the period 1977-99 and associated citation data, evidence is found for both hypotheses.

To address the increasing socio-economic problems associated with the energy subsidies, the government embarked on an aggressive energy price reform through which energy subsidies were removed and cash handouts were given to all households in 2010. In this paper, I analyze the effectiveness of the energy price reform in Iran by estimating energy demand elasticities for households in different income groups. I apply a two-stage consumer optimization model and estimate the system of energy expenditures shares using the household budget survey data for the period 2001-2008. The results show that the overall price elasticities of demand are small, but income elasticities are close to one. The results also indicate heterogeneous responses to energy price and income changes in different income groups. Specifically, the urban households show stronger response to price changes, but rural households, particularly mid-income households, to income changes. These findings suggest that the current policy of price increases would not solely be able to reduce energy consumption and, therefore, it should be geared towards increasing energy efficiency through a series of price and non-price measures.

A recursive pseudo-out-of-sample forecasting experiment using quarterly data is conducted.

Specifically, we draw on existing quantitative and qualitative evidence to outline three key problems with feedback, namely: (a) the limited evidence of efficacy, (b) the need for user engagement, and (c) the potential for unintended consequences. We conclude by noting that, in their current form, existing in-home-displays may not induce the desired energy-reduction response anticipated by smart metering initiatives. Instead, if smart metering is to effectively reduce energy consumption there is a clear need to develop and test innovative new feedback devices that have been designed with user engagement in mind.

Estimating the marginal abatement costs of CO2 emissions for the industrial sectors covered in Shanghai's emission trading scheme provides the government and participating firms useful information for devising compliance policies. This paper employs multiple distance function approaches to estimating the shadow prices of CO2 emissions for Shanghai industrial sectors. Our empirical results show that the overall weighted average of shadow price estimates by different approaches ranges between 394.5 and 1906.1 Yuan/ton, which indicates that model choice truly has a significant effect on the shadow price estimation. We have also identified a negative relationship between the shadow price of CO2 emissions and carbon intensity, and the heavy industries with higher carbon intensities tend to have lower shadow prices. It has been suggested that Shanghai municipal government take various measures to improve its carbon market, e.g. using the marginal abatement costs of participating sectors/firms as a criterion in the initial allocation of carbon emission allowances.

This paper investigates the extent to which innovative firms in peripheral regions compensate for the lack of access to local knowledge spillovers by collaborating at other geographical scales. So far, the literature predominantly suggests that collaborations complement rather than compensate for local knowledge spillovers. Using data on the collaboration patterns of innovative firms in Sweden, this paper provides evidence that firms with low access to local knowledge spillovers tend to collaborate more. This effect, however, depends on firm size and in-house capabilities. Our findings suggest that firms with strong in-house capabilities do indeed compensate for a lack of local knowledge spillovers with collaborations while firms with weaker in-house capabilities depend more on the regional knowledge infrastructure.","[Grillitsch, Markus; Nilsson, Magnus] Lund Univ, CIRCLE Ctr Innovat Res & Competence Learning Econ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Nilsson, Magnus] Lund Univ, Dept Business Adm, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University,"Grillitsch, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE Ctr Innovat Res & Competence Learning Econ, POB 117, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",markus.grillitsch@circle.lu.se,"Grillitsch, Markus/AAS-9067-2021","Grillitsch, Markus/0000-0002-8406-4727; Nilsson, Magnus/0000-0002-8769-8266",VINNOVA; FORMAS,VINNOVA(Vinnova); FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas),"This work was supported by VINNOVA and FORMAS.

Through an effectiveness of infrastructure management can improve industrial policy and gain national competitiveness. According to research of the World Bank there are several factors influencing the economy growth effectiveness and national competitiveness, including institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic environment, health and primary education, technological readiness, market size, etc and also, there are various frameworks, models, and analytical tools that can be used in studying the causal relationships between some key infrastructure factors and national competitiveness. Based on existing models, this study aims to identify and discuss the key infrastructure factors that determine national competitiveness, which in turn influence positively on the total results of industrial policy. The results of study showed that national competitiveness is influenced basically by the level of institutional development and other seven factors, including infrastructure, in turn infrastructure factor is determined mainly by the quality of roads, railroad infrastructure, air transport and electricity supply. The key institutional traps were singled out that prevent the development of the national economy. These findings contribute to an understanding of the key factors that determine economic growth, help to explain what infrastructure factors allows to be more successful in raising income levels and offer policymakers and business leaders an important tool in the formulation of improved economic policies and institutional reforms.

This paper seeks to frame model results for policymakers and other consumers of model outputs. In this analysis we compare three models: GCAM, MERGE, and EPPA. We apply diagnostic carbon price scenarios, such as ramps and shocks, to identify key differences in model behavior that drive inter-model variability in projected policy impacts on the U.S. energy system. We report model results using several economic parameterizations and find that variation in carbon emissions across models results primarily from differences in carbon intensity of energy supply. These differences arise because models include different low-carbon energy technology options and vary widely in how flexible the electricity supply sector is at adapting to a change in policy. The timing of emissions abatement is also strongly influenced by whether the model is a simulation or an inter-temporal optimization scheme and the amount of foresight exhibited in the model. Our analysis demonstrates the usefulness of novel IAM diagnostic indicators and clarifies model features that are highly relevant for consumers of model results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The two margins of global engagement we consider, namely, exports and sales via foreign affiliates (horizontal foreign direct investment), have both a positive and economically significant effect on firm-level volatility. We find, however, that increasing the intensity of sales through foreign affiliates has a stronger effect on volatility than a similar change in export intensity. We also uncover evidence consistent with the notion that firms' need to use external finance to cover the substantial costs involved in reaching foreign consumers can be an important channel through which firms' participation in international markets increases their exposure to economic uncertainty.","[Girma, Sourafel] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, GEP, Sir Clive Granger Bldg, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Girma, Sourafel] Univ Nottingham, CFCM, Sir Clive Granger Bldg, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Lancheros, Sandra] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Maurice Kenworth Bldg, Leeds LS6 1AN, W Yorkshire, England; [Riano, Alejandro] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, GEP, CFCM, Sir Clive Granger Bldg, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Riano, Alejandro] Univ Nottingham, CESifo, Sir Clive Granger Bldg, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham; University of Leeds; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Girma, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, GEP, Sir Clive Granger Bldg, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.;Girma, S (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, CFCM, Sir Clive Granger Bldg, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",sourafel.girma@nottingham.ac.uk; s.p.lancherostorres@leeds.ac.uk; alejandro.riano@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Girma, Sourafel/0000-0001-5815-1619; Riano, Alejandro/0000-0002-8824-4055",,,,,54,5,5,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

The aim of this paper is to analyze whether joining the CM is reducing municipalities' electricity consumption, and therefore their emissions. For this purpose, the evolution of total, household and public administration electricity consumption from 2001 to 2012 is analyzed by using panel data econometric techniques. This analysis is made for municipalities in Andalusia, the region of Spain with more signatories. Obtained results show that the CM is having a positive effect on the electricity consumption reductions, since the municipalities have greater rates of reduction of electricity consumption after signing the CM. Therefore, it may be considered appropriate to promote policies which incentivize the municipalities to join the CM and develop their action plans, as this can reduce their electricity consumption.

According to the analysis results, from 1975 to 2006 the fuel efficiency technology improvements were largely offset by vehicles' increased weight, engine size, and consumer amenities such as acceleration capacity. After 2006, downsizing in weight and engine capacity was observed in new car fleet, while fuel consumption decreased by 32% between 2006 and 2015. We adopt a statistical method and find that from 1975 to 2015, a 1% increase in weight would result in 0.3 to 0.5% increments in fuel consumption per 100 km, and a 1% reduction in 0-100 km/h acceleration time would increase fuel consumption by about 0.3%. Impacts of other attributes on fuel consumption are also assessed. To meet the European Union's 2021 fuel consumption target, downsizing of cars, as well as at least maintaining fuel efficiency technology growth trend observed between 2005 and 2015, are needed. Government policies on controlling improvement in acceleration performance or promoting alternative fuel vehicles are also important to achieve European Union 2021 target.

We focus on the trade-off between operating costs and quality improvement, hypothesizing a positive relationship. Operating costs include maintenance and repair expenses. The regulator sets limits for service continuity and non-technical energy losses in each regulatory period. Service continuity refers to the average length of interruptions in electricity distribution. Non-technical losses refer to losses due to factors specific to the distribution segment. Quality incentives' include peer-pressure and penalties/rewards for compliance with minimum quality standards. We model operating costs using a GMM framework to acknowledge endogeneity,of variables. The model is dynamic given the inclusion of regulatory lags to recognize past cost behavior. Findings reveal a small trade-off between costs and quality. We conclude that quality improvements are not costly relative to the potential savings from complying with quality standards. We also find that the impact on operating costs is larger when energy losses increase compared to the cost effect due to increases in duration of outages. These findings suggest areas of attention in managerial decision making, and serve as valuable information to the regulator in tailoring quality incentives for this sector. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Second, it will be publicly accessible, facilitating comparison of related research and replication of empirical work. Third, it will relieve researchers from having to manage data changes and revisions. We show that factors extracted from our dataset share the same predictive content as those based on various vintages of the so-called Stock Watson dataset.

As greater uncertainty is expected from growing distributed energy resources in distribution networks, there is an increasing risk of investing in too much or too little network capacity and hence causing the stranding and inefficient use of network assets; these costs are then passed on to the end-user. An alternative emerging solution in the context of smart grid development is to release untapped network capacity through Demand-Side Response (DSR). However, to date there is no approach able to quantify the value of 'smart' DSR solutions against 'conventional' asset-heavy investments. On these premises, this paper presents a general real options framework and a novel probabilistic tool for the economic assessment of DSR for smart distribution network planning under uncertainty, which allows the modeling and comparison of multiple investment strategies, including DSR and capacity reinforcements, based on different cost and risk metrics. In particular the model provides an explicit quantification of the economic value of DSR against alternative investment strategies. Through sensitivity analysis it is able to indicate the maximum price payable for DSR service such that DSR remains economically optimal against these alternatives. The proposed model thus provides Regulators with clear insights for overseeing DSR contractual arrangements. Further it highlights that differences exist in the economic perspective of the regulated DNO business and of customers. Our proposed model is therefore capable of highlighting instances where a particular investment strategy is favorable to the DNO but not to its customers, or vice-versa, and thus aspects of the regulatory framework which may need altering. The case study results indicate that DSR can be an economical option to delay or even avoid large irreversible capacity investments, thus reducing overall costs for networks and end customers. However, in order for the value and benefits of DSR to be acknowledged, a change in the regulatory framework (currently based on deterministic analysis) that takes explicit account of uncertainty in planning, as suggested by our work, is required.

One of the cardinal assumptions of the liberalized and competitive electricity markets is the rational actor, and decision-makers are assumed to make the best decisions that maximize their utility. However, a vast literature on behavioral economics has shown the weakness of economic theory in explaining and predicting individuals' decision-making behavior. This issue is quite important for competition in electricity markets in which consumers' preferences have a significant role. Despite its importance, this issue has almost been neglected in Turkey, which has taken major steps in electricity sector restructuring. Therefore, this paper aims to examine switching and demand response behavior in Turkish electricity market by using multiple correspondence and panel data analysis, and findings are discussed in light of the neoclassical and behavioral economics literature. Analyses' results show that consumers' switching and demand response behavior is consistent with the neoclassical literature to some extent; however, behavioral factors are also affecting consumers' decisions. Furthermore, there are systemic problems that hinder effective functioning of the electricity market and restrict competition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The particular case study selects involved consumer choice between a vehicle with high initial acquisition cost but low ownership cost (e.g., an Electric Vehicle, EV) and one with a low initial acquisition cost but high ownership cost (e.g., a conventional Internal Combustion Engine Vehicle, ICEV). To test our theoretical analysis, we conduct an empirical study on how time discounting rates affect consumer choice between ICEVs and EVs with different initial cost ratios. From the survey results, we find that individuals with higher present bias showed irrational purchase behavior even when controlling for wealth level. Specifically, people making some stronger bias to present' decisions chose higher total cost ICEVs with lower initial cost but higher ownership cost over lower total cost EVs with higher initial cost and lower ownership cost. However, people's long-term discount is not correlated with irrational vehicle purchase behavior. Furthermore, we study the present bias and long-term discount rate in one scenario and found present bias to be correlated with irrational behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

On-road exceedances of regulated NOx emission limits for diesel passenger cars have also been documented. The current study investigated the LCV characteristics and CO2 and NOx emissions in the European Union. A vehicle market analysis found that LCVs comprise 17% of the diesel LDV market and while there were some data for CO2 emissions, there were hardly any data publicly available for NOx emissions. Monitoring the divergence in CO2 emissions revealed that it increased from 14% in 2006 to 33% in 2014, posing an additional annual fuel cost from 120(sic) in 2006 to 305(sic) in 2014, while a significant percentage of Euro 5 vehicles exceeded NOx emission standards.

For the first time in empirical literature, an econometric analysis includes the relative prices for several energy sources. The paper provides strong evidence on the relevance of energy prices to CO2 emissions. Accordingly, one reason for the lack of agreement in the EKC literature may be the absence of energy prices in empirical exercises. The presence of relative energy price changes in the econometric specification confirms a monotonic and positive relationship between CO2 and gross domestic product (GDP). Therefore, we may conclude that there is a decoupling process but without reaching any turning point on that relationship. The policy implications are straightforward. Direct climate action by policy makers is required to break the positive relationship between CO2 and GDP. That conclusion has been reinforced by the reduction of energy prices since the middle of 2014. Otherwise, the trend in energy prices may reverse the relative decarbonisation processes accounted for in recent years in major developed countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

At the same time, one of the main EU policy goals has been the creation of a common internal energy market for Europe. In this paper, we focus on these two issues previously studied separately, considering their possible interactions. We first analyze the long-run relationship between day-ahead electricity prices and fuel prices (natural gas and coal) looking at two samples of years characterized by low and high RES penetration, then we explore the integration of EU markets. We show that the electricity-fuel nexus found over 2006-2008 changed dramatically over 2010-2014 for the majority of countries considered. In particular, the long-run dependence of electricity from gas and coal prices is much lower in recent years. Furthermore, our results confirm that the considered EU countries are becoming less integrated as RES-E increases. Our findings suggest that nationally implemented policies to support renewables are successful in increasing RES penetration, but they have lessened the linkage among EU markets, then making integration more difficult to obtain.

Carbon intensity has the largest explanatory power for EPI rankings and consistently produces the correct, anticipated, negative sign in its relationship to EPI. Second in importance are the renewable energy sources, which also produce consistent results with respect to their impact on the EPI but with much lower explanatory power. Our results suggest that advanced countries should, as they are doing already, implement measures of high quality environmental content while measures for increasing economic growth, while controlling emissions, are appropriate for developing countries.

Therefore, the missing money problem in energy-only electricity markets is more likely to occur in systems with high renewable shares. Nevertheless, renewables are supported in many countries due to their expected benefits. The kind of support instrument can however influence the degree to which renewables influence the market. While fixed feed-in tariffs lead to higher market impacts, more market-oriented support schemes such as market premiums, quota systems and capacity-based payments decrease the extent to which markets are affected. This paper analyzes the market impacts of different support schemes. For this purpose, a new module is added to an existing bottom-up simulation model of the electricity market. In addition, different degrees of flexibility in the electricity system are considered. A case study for Germany is used to derive policy recommendations regarding the choice of support scheme.

Pricing waste has been one of the most important tools used for that purpose, and the literature on the demand for household waste disposal shows a wide diversity of price elasticity calculations. We explore this issue by means of a meta-analysis on a database of 25 studies. This allows us analyzing which is the effect on the results of different data, model specification and (statistical) methods. We find no evidence that either treating prices as exogenous or including curbside recycling effects in the model influence price elasticity. There are some indications that price elasticities in the USA are more elastic, and that municipal data provide higher estimates than household data. We find that much of the variation in elasticities is associated with Substantial methods; in particular it can be explained by the use of a weight based system and by the pricing of compostable waste. In contrast, the bag-based system does not present a significant relation with elasticity. Finally, our results do not find evidence of publication bias, while they do indicate some evidence of the existence of a true empirical effect. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Meeting this objective requires knowledge about determinants of adoption, particularly in rural areas where the cost of traditional cooking technologies and fuels are non-monetary, and where people have limited capacity to purchase an ICS. We conducted a discrete choice experiment with 383 households in rural Malawi asking them if they would chose a locally made ICS or a package of sugar and salt of roughly equal value. Six months later, we assessed adoption and stove use patterns. Sixty-six percent of households chose the ICS. We find that having a larger share of crop residues in household fuel supply, awareness of the environmental impacts of woodfuel reliance, time the primary cook devotes to collecting fuelwood, and peer effects at the village-level increase the odds of choosing the ICS. Having a large labor supply for fuelwood collection and experience with a non-traditional cooking technology decreased the odds of choosing the ICS. In a rapid assessment six months after stoves were distributed, we found 80% of households were still using the ICS, but not exclusively. Our findings suggest considerable potential for wide-scale adoption of low cost ICS in Malawi. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

When invasions impact commodity markets and control decisions are made by many producers, a spatial externality arises due to market-level impacts and delaying the invasion on neighboring parcels. We illustrate how the intrinsic spread rate and the spatial configuration of producers interact to determine the public benefits of private control decisions and the ultimate outcome of species invasions on private property. To coordinate responses to invasions at the market level, a corrective mechanism is suggested in which invaded producers are compensated by all other producers for control actions that alleviate impacts to other producers.

We derive the asymptotic distributions of the test statistics for testing the existence of a single variance change-point under the null and local alternatives. We also study the consistency of the change-point estimator. Within the proposed class of the WDA test statistics, a standardized WDA test is shown to have the best consistency rate and is recommended for practical use. An iterative binary searching procedure is suggested for estimating the locations of possible multiple change-points in variance, whose consistency is also established. Simulation studies are conducted to compare detection power and number of wrong rejections of the proposed procedure to that of a cumulative sum (CUSUM) based test and a likelihood ratio-based test. Finally, we apply the proposed method to a stock index dataset and an unemployment rate dataset.

Energy efficiency interventions, such as facade retrofitting, address the problem from a structural and long-term perspective. Despite evidence of the health benefits of insulation, little is known about the political and social contexts that contribute to social inequalities in receiving and experiencing health benefits from these interventions. We used a realist review methodology to better understand the mechanisms that explain how and why variations across different social groups appear in receiving energy efficiency facade retrofitting interventions and in their impact on health determinants. We considered the four stages of the policy implementation framework: public policy approach; policy; receiving intervention and impact on health determinants. We found strong evidence that certain social groups (low-income, renters, elderly) suffering most from fuel poverty, experience more barriers for undertaking a building retrofitting (due to factors such as upfront costs, presentism thinking, split incentives, disruption and lack of control), and that some public policies on housing energy efficiency may exacerbate these inequalities. This can be avoided if such policies specifically aim at tackling fuel poverty or social inequities, are completely free to users, target the most affected groups and are adapted to their needs.

Further, damages have decreased significantly since 2002, even as energy production increased, suggesting that, among other factors, policies that have driven reductions in emissions have reduced damages. The results of this analysis highlight the spatial heterogeneity of the impacts associated with the emissions of a given pollutant. In the past, environmental regulations have assumed that the benefits of air emissions reductions are homogenous across source location. This analysis suggests that policy designs that account for spatial differences in the impacts of air emissions could result in more effective environmental regulation. Accounting for such spatial heterogeneity in the benefits of policies would be akin to accounting for differences in compliances costs across states, which the EPA did when establishing the state emissions standards for the Clean Power Plan rule.

Recent research suggests that disappointing results in sporting fixtures relative to prematch expectations play an important role in triggering domestic violence (Card and Dahl, 2011), consistent with the idea of loss aversion around expectations-based reference points. This paper seeks to investigate whether such behaviour is exhibited by football fans in Glasgow by looking at the relationship between match outcomes relative to expectations and levels of domestic violence using a data set that contains every domestic violence incident in Glasgow over a period of more than eight years. Whilst we find that when the 'Old-Firm' Glasgow rivals Celtic and Rangers play there are large increases in domestic violence (regardless of the outcome of the match), in other matches disappointing results relative to expectations are not linked to increased domestic violence, except when those matches occur at the very end of the season where the title is still being contended.","[Dickson, Alex; Koop, Gary] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Jennings, Colin] Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of Strathclyde; University of London; King's College London,"Dickson, A; Koop, G (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland.;Jennings, C (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, London WC2R 2LS, England.",alex.dickson@strath.ac.uk; colin.jennings@kcl.ac.uk; gary.koop@strath.ac.uk,"Jennings, Colin/HIR-3150-2022","Koop, Gary/0000-0002-6091-378X; Jennings, Colin/0000-0002-5554-3825",,,,,18,5,8,1,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

Although electric vehicles (EVs) provide benefits for the society as a whole, there are a number of hurdles for their widespread adoption, mainly the high investment cost for the EV and for the infrastructure. Therefore, a sound business model must be built up for charging service operators, which allows them to recover their costs while, at the same time, offer EV users a charging price which makes electro-mobility comparable to internal combustion engine vehicles. For that purpose, three scenarios are defined, which present different EV charging alternatives, in terms of charging power and charging station ownership and accessibility. A case study is presented for each scenario and the required charging station usage to have a profitable business model is calculated. We demonstrate that private home charging is likely to be the preferred option for EV users who can charge at home, as it offers a lower total cost of ownership under certain conditions, even today. On the contrary, finding a profitable business case for fast charging requires more intensive infrastructure usage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis shows that China's state energy investment is (1) driven by demand for energy, (2) mostly unrelated to energy efficiency, (3) undertaken with the consideration of reducing negative externalities associated with energy production, (4) used by central government to subsidize some local governments, and (5) directed to heavy industries. Policy impacts (4) and (5) are more profound in provinces in which the state's ownership of the provincial industry is high. In addition, results (4) and (5) are stronger at the earlier stage of China's domestic reform and before China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), which suggests that these policy impacts weaken along with the progress of China's market transition. In sum, China's state energy investment responds to demand signals, but state ownership enables the government to implement its policy objectives, possibly at the cost of economic efficiency.","[Bo, Hong; Oughton, Christine] Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Financial & Management Studies, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Zhang, Baoshan] Huaxia Bank, Small & Medium Sized Enterprises Credit Dept, Beijing 100005, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Xiaoling] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Xian, Peoples R China; [Ma, Jun] Toyama Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm, Toyama, Japan",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Xi'an Jiaotong University; University of Toyama,"Bo, H (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Financial & Management Studies, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",hb22@soas.ac.uk; baoshanzhang315@gmail.com; co12@soas.ac.uk; yuan_xiaoling@126.com; majun@eco.u-toyama.ac.jp,,"Oughton, Christine/0000-0002-4637-6412","Center for Far Eastern Studies, University of Toyama, Japan","Center for Far Eastern Studies, University of Toyama, Japan","Hong Bo thanks the Center for Far Eastern Studies, University of Toyama, Japan, for partial financial support during the writing of this paper.",,23,0,0,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This is, at least in part, motivated by an expectation of subsequent employment growth in low carbon and renewable energy technologies; however there is no official data source to track employment in these areas. This has led to a variety of definitions, methodologies and alternative estimates being produced. Building on a recent study (Bishop and Brand, 2013) we develop a hybrid approach which combines the detail of bottom-up surveys with top-down trend data to produce estimates on employment in Low Carbon Environmental Goods and Services (LCEGS). We demonstrate this methodology to produce estimates for such employment in Scotland between 2004 and 2012. Our approach shows how survey and official sources can combine to produce a more timely measure of employment in LCEGS activities, assisting policymakers in tracking, consistently, developments. Applying our approach, we find that over this period employment in LCEGS in Scotland grew, but that this was more volatile than aggregate employment, and in particular that employment in this sector was particularly badly hit during the great recession.

Mr Lu jingren referred to in the calligraphic art asks: books design is a kind of tectonics is to build the external books formative physical ideas and rational thinking on the inner information of comprehensive knowledge, after the designer accurately grasp the content would then understanding of the subject from perceptual initiation, savvy and intellectual and overall, and after careful calculation, elaborate structure and logistically of rhythm and process steps such as organized and orderly construct designers' construct ' in the heart. Books design, therefore, is to build a whole structure, the concept of form a complete books are supposed to be external modelling of the structure of the building as well as the internal thoughts of emotional rendering, both through the analysis of rational conveys the connotation of books, finally to achieve the perfect fusion of books to read aesthetic and function, so that the content and form, art and function to achieve unification. So many books as designers started to explore in the field of theory and practice of these problems, will rise to the definition of the overall book design level, no longer the superficial appearance, to interpret the concept of overall structure, contents and forms of the dialectical relationship between the theory and practice together throughout the entire process of design, the design theory of functional seems to play the biggest role here, lead the books design changes, thus in the great majority of the population of concern books design should not only have the beautiful external form, have coordinated with the internal emotional thought, the content of the book to the external form, the unity of form and content reflect the beauty of the books of the whole and the overall design concept of the trinity.","[Guo, Yuchuan] Univ Jingdezhen, Ceram Art Inst Design, Jingdezhen 333403, Peoples R China; [Fan, Yuanyuan] Tsinghua Univ, Acad Fine Arts, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Guo, YC (通讯作者)，Univ Jingdezhen, Ceram Art Inst Design, Jingdezhen 333403, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-288-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,87.0,,,,,,799,803,,,,,,5,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8WB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392733200165,0

In this article we study how low-carbon energy transitions might be governed in line with broader sustainability goals. We identify conflicts and synergies between low-carbon strategies and the attainment of longer-term environmental objectives by examining the Swedish environmental quality objectives as a governance arrangement. Our analysis indicates that low-carbon strategies might be compatible with preserving other aspects of ecological sustainability. However, this requires relevant flanking policies and measures for non-climate objectives, e.g. systems that control the expansion of biomass and ensure the use of sustainable methods. For such a governance system to be credible and capable, it needs to be flexible in terms of adapting to specific and changing contexts, and reflexive enough to factor in new knowledge on requirements for sustainable development and potentially changing values of future generations.

The conclusions were somewhat remarkable, with the Fiat 500, a product combining reliability and beautiful design, continuing to be immensely popular. In addition, the cooperation of both brands has brought large profits and a significant increase in awareness of both companies. Undoubtedly, the innovative marketing method of designing a new car model, in collaboration with a luxury brand, brings awareness to both brands.

However, the deviation between electricity consumption and economic growth in China during the Asian Financial Crisis and Global Economic Crisis sparks intense debates. We attempt to explain the deviation from the perspective of inventory investment adjustment in the business cycle using the SVAR model in this paper. The results show that the effects of inventory investment adjustment shock and electricity consumption structure shock on the deviation are positive but tend to be negative for electricity efficiency shock. The results of historical decomposition of these shocks also show that the inventory investment adjustment shock is the main factor that influences the deviation during the Global Economic Crisis. Economic fluctuation in the short term can not change the economic development pattern and the characteristics of electricity demand. Once the economy returns to stable growth, the deviation between electricity consumption and economic growth will shrink and disappear soon. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Assuming that plants fail independently, we find that PJM's 2010 reserve margin of 20.5% was sufficient to achieve the stated reliability standard of one loss of load event per ten years, with 0.012 expected loss of load events per year. PJM could reduce reserve margins to 13% and still achieve adequate levels of reliability as measured by the 2.4 Loss of Load Hours metric and the 0.001% Unserved Energy metric, which are used by other U.S. and international systems. A reserve margin of 13-15% would minimize long-run system costs. Reducing reserve margins from 20.5% to 13% in 2010 would have reduced PJM's capacity procurement by 11 GW, the same amount of coal capacity that PJM has identified as at high risk of retirement, We also investigate the risk posed by correlated failures among generators, a risk traditionally not modeled by system planners.

In a world of multiple interdependencies, the relationship between individuals and between the individual and his environment proves that life occupies a central role. One of the important aspects of social life takes into account all kinds of interactions between individuals. Besides establishing and maintaining functional human relationships, life within a group leads to situations of conflict. Given that the main group component in an average daily life is manifested most strongly on the job, this paper aims to examine issues related to the management of conflict in the work environment. The management of conflicts are multiple, depending on the nature of the causes that led to the conflict, this paper focuses on highlighting the role of communication in the conflict management process, specifically, the role of communication which is regarded as the common denominator of all organizational arrangements for managing conflicts. Conflicts are endemic to society as a whole. They are directly related to the scarcity of resources, division of functions and tasks, power of relations, differentiation and organization roles in society. Any organization, regardless of its type (public institution, state-owned commercial organization or private non-profit organization, etc.), face daily conflicts that are based on different causes of internal and external organization. Organizations are living systems, which consist of units that interact, each having their own defined roles, interdependent and are expected to operate in a structured environment with clearly defined resources, if the context is such, conflict becomes inevitable.

The automatic generation of questions allows us to create a large set of equivalent questions of a certain topic based on a small amount of input values. This reduces authoring time during test creation, avails application of equal criteria and a fair assessment, and decreases the influence of subjective factors. In our previous work, we proposed methods for automatic generation of English language test questions. These were aimed at evaluating the students' knowledge of lexical and grammatical structures found in the text using test questions that involved matching words and their meaning, matching parts of the whole, and finding synonyms, antonyms, and generalizations or specializations of words. This paper provides new methods for the automatic generation of English language test questions. This includes generating questions for testing the students' knowledge of adverbs and adjectives, as well as word formation, especially with negative forms of adjectives.","[Malinova, Anna] Univ Plovdiv Paisii Hilendarski, Fac Math & Informat, Plovdiv, Bulgaria; [Rahneva, Olga] Univ Plovdiv Paisii Hilendarski, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Plovdiv, Bulgaria",Plovdiv University; Plovdiv University,"Malinova, A (通讯作者)，Univ Plovdiv Paisii Hilendarski, Fac Math & Informat, Plovdiv, Bulgaria.",malinova@uni-plovdiv.bg; olga.rahneva@gmail.com,"Malinova, Anna/A-1896-2016","Malinova, Anna/0000-0002-1266-4782; munjishvili, tea/0000-0002-7417-8501","project of the Scientific Fund of the University of Plovdiv Paisii Hilendarski, Bulgaria [IT15-FMIIT-004]","project of the Scientific Fund of the University of Plovdiv Paisii Hilendarski, Bulgaria","This work is partially supported by the IT15-FMIIT-004 project of the Scientific Fund of the University of Plovdiv Paisii Hilendarski, Bulgaria.",,10,4,4,0,8,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,906,909,,10.12955/cbup.v4.794,0.0,,,4,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000139,0

Innovations and changes of this kind are more than necessary. Whether it is the need to maintain the attractiveness of the store in the competition of new operations with similar focus, or it is a necessity to implement some changes to update the technical infrastructure and reduce operation energy consumption. Functionality of retail operation has to do largely with its architectural and design solution that the customer must first reach and attract to the store, and then motivate them to purchase. Even shopping atmosphere has recently become more important. Many stores are based on the fact to have the most comfortable atmosphere that forces the customer to stay in the store as long as possible. Sellers are also trying to make from the shopping an experience. It is necessary that the customer feels in the store satisfied. Just shopping atmosphere and its control could help to higher customer satisfaction. It is therefore very important to monitor the fundamental factors that affect the atmosphere in the store. The paper deals with the examination of selected elements of the shopping atmosphere and its impact on consumers in grocery stores operating in Slovakia. Research integrates the questionnaire survey and observation in real terms of selected retail operations. Based on the findings we suggest in paper conclusion proposals concerning the adaptation of selected factors affecting the atmosphere in order to improve the overall well-being of customers and hence their satisfaction during shopping.","[Paluchova, Johana; Bercik, Jakub; Neomaniova, Katarina] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Mkt & Trade, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Paluchová, J (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Mkt & Trade, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",johana.paluchova@gmail.com; jakub.bercikxx@gmail.com; katarinakleinova@gmail.com,"Bercik, Jakub/HGA-0102-2022",,,,,,23,0,0,0,17,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,804,811,,10.15414/isd2016.s10.05,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500097,0

Globalization favors the expansion of the supply chain across national borders; a fact that can transform even much smaller incidents to organizational crises (Manuj & Mentzer, 2008). More and more, stakeholders are being implicated in contemporary supply chains and when a crisis occurs it has to be faced timely, otherwise the consequences can get out of proportions (Randall & Farris, 2009). Lately, organizations try to make proactive planning to enhance decision making in the time of a crisis, but still no specific guidelines, either from literature or practitioners, exist about supply chain crisis management (Hittle & Leonard, 2011). In this paper, we try to identify specific processes and practices that make enterprises successfully confront supply chain crises or drive them to failure by studying major crises incidents as reported in the literature.

Because a significant part of Russian-speaking communities accepted these efforts, questions were raised concerning the effectiveness of previous integration policies to strengthen the national identity and invoke a feeling of political togetherness. Thus the factors fostering and triggering integration and the relations between civic and ethnocultural components of integration are of wide interest. This paper presents a case study of Latvia, as a country with the highest share of Russian-speaking citizens among the EU member states and a clear prevalence of ethnocultural components in its integration policies in recent years. The study examines the successes and failures of the integration policies of Latvia during the last twenty-five years, using mainly direct observations and sociological data collected during the last twenty years. The results show that language knowledge, citizenship status, and socioeconomic conditions play an important role in integration.

Rather than focusing on the definition of the observed variable dependencies on each perturbation, the suggested method in this article involves the study of the behavior of the output variable, conditionally accepting that the system is affected by some common parameter (factor) that is the resultant action of perturbations. In keeping with this approach, we plot a series of ramps, form a system of mathematical models, calculate automatic regulator parameters, and create an adaptive control algorithm.

Using household survey data, we show the A3 surcharge is markedly regressive. Carbon taxation in the non-ETS sector is envisaged as a means to reduce CO2 emissions cost-effectively and generate revenue to lower the A3 surcharge. A non-ETS carbon tax would be less regressive than the A3 surcharge and its cost would be more evenly distributed across households. We calculate the revenue of a (sic)20/tCO(2) non-ETS carbon tax would have allowed a cut in the A3 surcharge of about 68% in 2011, and 39% in 2012. The impact of the carbon tax plus the reduced A3 surcharge would have been less regressive, but the cost higher for most households. The restrictions imposed in the simulations mean the results are only appropriate to render first-round effects of the reform. Policy relevance: In the vast majority of the EU Member States, the cost of RES-E support is largely paid by electricity consumers, most often through specific surcharges. Rising electricity prices are a common concern given the implications for competitiveness and equity. The Member States facing this issue could conveniently address it through environmental tax reforms consistent with the Climate and Energy Package. Replacing RES-E surcharges with carbon taxes in the non-ETS sector would permit cost-effective reduction of CO2 emissions while allocating the cost of RES-E support more equitably. The difference in regressivity would stem from the different consumption patterns of home fuels (including electricity) and motor fuels across income distribution. A cross-country comparison of energy household budget shares proves the structural nature of this difference between home fuels and motor fuels. Moreover, the notion that electricity consumers should pay for RES-E support is questioned on the grounds that electricity is a basic necessity good and RES-E support is a means of providing public goods, notably energy security and climate protection.

According to the Hebei Province industrial structure and energy consumption status, this paper decomposes the energy consumption intensity into structure share and efficiency share, and analyzes the effect of industrial restructuring and energy efficiency on the overall energy consumption intensity. The empirical results show that the energy consumption intensity of Hebei province is declining in the research period, which is the result of energy efficiency improvement and industrial structure adjustment in different industries. The biggest influencing factor is the efficiency share, especially the improvement of energy utilization rate of the second industry. The effect of structural share on energy consumption is small compared to efficiency share. The decreasing of second industrial energy consumption intensity is the main reason for the decline in the overall energy from the point of the structure share and efficiency share. Finally, this paper puts forward the ways to reduce the energy consumption from the industrial structure adjustment and other dimensions.","[Wang, Xinli; Yan, Liping] North China Elect Power Univ, Dept Econ Management, Baoding, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University,"Wang, XL (通讯作者)，North China Elect Power Univ, Dept Econ Management, Baoding, Peoples R China.",wxli0704@163.com; 541143137@qq.com,"wang, jing/GVT-8700-2022; Wang, Xin/HZL-4695-2023; Wang, Xin/GYU-1129-2022",,Social science Funds of Hebei Province [HB15YJ039],Social science Funds of Hebei Province,This research was supported by Project supported by the Social science Funds of Hebei Province.

Stimulated by various incentive policies, wind power generation in China has achieved tremendous growth, with the cumulative installed capacity being the largest worldwide for five consecutive years since 2010. However, obstructed by various barriers, wind power provides only 2.6% of national electricity generation in China, despite the strong support from the government. From a sociotechnical transition perspective, this paper aims to systematically analyze the barriers hindering the further development of China's wind power. A wind power niche model is established to illustrate the complex interactions among actors in the wind power industry and electricity supply regime. Then, qualitative content analysis is adopted to process the related evidence and data, and four categories of socio-technical barriers are identified, including technology, governance, infrastructure and culture barriers. The study shows that various interrelated barriers form a blocking mechanism which prohibits the further development of wind power in China. Policy suggestions are proposed to eliminate the barriers and further empower the wind power niche. The lesson learned from China can offer useful references for other economies to promote wind power industries of their own. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Criteria are now applicable to solid biomass and biogas, however because it is not mandatory criteria can be adapted by member states with the risk of different interpretation. Operators are required to report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for every MJ of energy produced. This paper provides a rigorous analysis of the current GHG emissions accounting methodology for biogas facilities to assess expected compliance for producers. This research uses data from operating CHP and biomethane facilities to calculate GHG emissions using the existing methodology and Government calculator. Results show that whilst many biogas facilities will meet GHG thresholds, as presently defined by Government, several operators may not comply due to methodological uncertainties and chosen operating practices. Several GHG accounting issues are identified which need to be addressed so the biogas industry achieves its reporting obligations and is represented objectively with other bioenergy technologies. Significant methodological issues are highlighted; including consignment definition, mass balance allocation, measurement of fugitive methane emissions, accounting for digestate co-products, fossil fuel comparators, and other accounting problems. Recommendations are made to help address the GHG accounting issues for policy makers and the biogas industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Adams, P. W. R.; Mezzullo, W.

One key area of uncertainty pertains to public attitudes and acceptability. Though there is wide-ranging research relevant to public acceptability, very little work has unpacked the multiple questions concerning how policy-makers can grapple with and mitigate related uncertainties in efforts to enact energy systems change. In this paper, public acceptability is identified as an indeterminate form of uncertainty that presents particular challenges for policy making. We build on our existing research into public values for energy system change to explore how the outcomes of the project can be applied in thinking through the uncertainties associated with public acceptability. Notably, we illustrate how the public values identified through our research bring into view alternative and quite different problem and solution framings to those currently evident within UK policy. We argue that engagement with a wide range of different framings can offer a basis for better understanding and anticipating public responses to energy system change, ultimately aiding in managing the complex set of uncertainties associated with public acceptability.

In this paper, we propose a weighted goal programming model that integrates efficient allocation of resources to simultaneously achieve sustainability related goals on GDP growth, electricity consumption and GHG emissions. We validate the model with application to key economic sectors of the United Arab Emirates to achieve sustainable development goals by the year 2030.

The article aims to unveil the evolution of this innovative environment by applying the Functions of Innovation Systems (FIS) approach to the Chinese province of Shandong. It examines the actors, institutions and policy instruments that shape Shandong's innovation system for SWH, the dominant drivers and barriers during the evolution of the TIS and also assesses the applicability of the IS approach to China. It appears that the presence of influential interest organizations and proactive support from local governments have acted as strong drivers for the emergence of Shandong's innovation system for SWHs. On the other hand, the lack of adequate personnel and an overreliance on government policies act as main barriers. With regard to the Chinese specificities potentially detracting from the relevance of applying IS theory to China, we did not find that the central government acted as an initiator of innovation nor that state-owned enterprises had dominant positions in the market. In this innovative industry the impetus for development came from the bottom up and from private corporations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this article is to analyze how electricity providers deal with such obligatory price increase communication and to provide a comprehensive overview of communicative arguments used by firms. Data is gathered through a content analysis of 97 price increase mailings. Findings show that electricity providers apply several price communication strategies while other promising strategies for customer retention are mostly ignored (i.e., those related to competitors, offerings and relationship benefits). Further, price increase communication differs between national and local firms. Local firms are more transparent in their price increase communication and refer even less often to offer and relationship benefits. Electricity firms have many options to improve the potential effects of price increase letters, such as referring to the future relationship. This is the first study which examines the content of price increase communication by firms. It structures price communication practices used by electricity providers, analyzes their empirical relevance, summarizes findings in five global propositions, and provides a detailed agenda for future research. Moreover, the study indicates several means for public policy organizations to offer regulations on the content of price increase notifications. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the overall strategy to date for promoting distributed energy remains unclear. It is not yet well understood which factors promote the growth of the distributed energy sector and what barriers need to be removed. In this article we present the results of a questionnaire directed at a panel of 26 experts from the distributed energy value chain and 15 semi-structured interviews with industry and non-industry representatives. We investigated, from a sociotechnical transition perspective, the possibilities and challenges of the transition to distributed energy in Finland through 2025. The results show that a shift to a prosperous future for distributed energy is possible if permit procedures, ease of grid connection, and taxation laws are improved in the electricity sector and new business concepts are introduced in the heat sector. In contrast to other European countries, the transition in Finland is expected to take place through a market-based approach favoring investment-focused measures. We conclude that incentive-based schemes alone, whatever they may be, will be insufficient to create significant growth in Finland without institutional change, removal of barriers, and the engagement of key actors.

To evaluate and compare these procedures, modeling uncertainty caused by model selection and parameter estimation has to be assessed and integrated into a modeling process. To do this, a data perturbation method estimates the modeling uncertainty inherited in a selection process by perturbing the data. Critical to data perturbation is the size of perturbation, as the perturbed data should resemble the original dataset. To account for the modeling uncertainty, we derive the optimal size of perturbation, which adapts to the data, the model space, and other relevant factors in the context of linear regression. On this basis, we develop an adaptive data-perturbation method that, unlike its nonadaptive counterpart, performs well in different situations. This leads to a data-adaptive model selection method. Both theoretical and numerical analysis suggest that the data-adaptive model selection method adapts to distinct situations in that it yields consistent model selection and optimal prediction, without knowing which situation exists a priori. The proposed method is applied to real data from the commodity market and outperforms its competitors in terms of price forecasting accuracy.","[Zhang, Yongli] Univ Oregon, Lundquist Coll Business, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Shen, Xiaotong] Univ Minnesota, Sch Stat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Oregon; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Zhang, YL (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Lundquist Coll Business, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",yongli@uoregon.edu; xshen@stat.umn.edu,,,National Science Foundation [DMS-0906616]; National Institute of Health [1R01GM081535]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1207771] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Institute of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"The research was supported in part by National Science Foundation Grant DMS-0906616 and National Institute of Health Grant 1R01GM081535.

For every new ship the attained EEDI has to be calculated and not higher than the required EEDI which is calculated from the reference line value and appropriate reduction factor. The reference line value represents the world fleet average and is dependent on the ship type and size. The reduction factor represents a reduction for the EEDI relative to the reference line value and is increased in a set of time intervals. However, the scheme of the reduction factor change seems to be rigidly set and could lead to design issues and ship under powering. This study estimates the CO2 emission from bulk carriers based on the current reduction factor change policy. Other policies and some innovative approaches are also discussed and the CO2 emission in every scenario is estimated. The results are then compared with the requirement of reaching mean global CO2 stabilization level of 550 ppm in the atmosphere. It is concluded that policies which include feedback from the shipbuilding sector impose requirements that could be much easier to satisfy and which will lead to overall lower CO2 emission.

Despite this factor, efforts to reduce the consumption of energy through the installation of low-carbon technologies including sealed whole-building systems frequently isolate the thermal environment and fail to recognise and respond to the influence of other sensory information on personal preferences and behaviours. Older people represent an increasing proportion of the UK's population, can be faced with a range of physiological challenges associated with ageing, and sometimes have long-established personal preferences. Drawing from data collected across the Conditioning Demand Project, this paper explores the embodied nature of older people's experiences of low-carbon and more traditional thermal technologies in private residences, extra-care housing and residential care-homes, focussing specifically upon auditory and olfactory stimulus. Exploring the management of the sensory experience across these settings, we analyse each case to inform the development of new design and policy approaches to tackling housing for older people. In doing so, we further build connections between energy research and debates around sensory urbanism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, district energy planning has not yet been incorporated into the statutory planning system in China, primarily because there are no clear standards and specifications for these plans. In this paper, we propose a general framework and low carbon estimation method for district energy planning, which is based on evaluating the low carbon energy planning practices of several new districts in China. In addition, several key points of concern in the planning process are extracted and discussed: overall infrastructure planning; co-operation between city planning and other special low carbon eco-planning; investment, financing and profitable operation; planning management mechanisms; and the management of the construction of the energy system to coincide with the project schedule. We carried out a case study of a low carbon energy plan for a new district of Beijing to evaluate our framework. Finally, we conclude that to realize the low carbon target, regional energy planning covering technologies, the market and management should be standardized as soon as possible.

Do cooperative research and development (R&D) subsidies stimulate regional innovation efficiency? Evidence from Germany, Regional Studies. The subsidization of research and development (R&D) and R&D cooperation has gained in importance in recent years. Building on a rich panel dataset, covering 270 German labour market regions and four industries, it is shown that subsidies for R&D cooperation are a suitable policy measure for stimulating the innovation efficiency of regions. The empirical findings suggest that regions with low innovation capacities benefit the most from cooperation among regional firms and subsidized links to non-regional public research institutes. The subsidization of cooperation with non-regional universities is more important for regions with large innovation capacities.

We employ WTI crude oil prices and Cleveland financial stress index for the period 1991-2014 and divide the sample into pre-crisis, in-crisis, and post-crisis periods due to the downward trend in oil price in 2008. The volatility model estimations indicate that oil prices and financial stress index are dominated by long-run volatility. The volatility spillover causality test supports evidence on risk transfer from oil prices to financial stress before the crisis and from financial stress to oil prices after the crisis. The impulse response analysis shows that the volatility transmission pattern has similar dynamics before and after the crisis and is characterized by higher and long-lived effects during the crisis. Our results have implications for both policy makers and investors, and for future work. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This was done by calculating the payback time for various sizes of newly installed PV systems for a Finnish detached house with district heating. Three types of economic support schemes (guaranteed selling price, fixed premiums and self-consumption incentives) were tested in an hourly simulation. The load of the building was based on real-life measurements, while PV output was simulated with TRNSYS software. The energy results were post-processed with economic data in MATLAB to find the payback time. Hourly electricity prices from the Nordic energy market were used with PV system prices from Finnish companies. Unsubsidised residential PV systems in Finland had payback times of more than 40 years. The production-based support for PV generation needs to be two to three times the buying price of electricity, to make it possible to pay back the initial investment in 20 years. Low capacity systems with more than 50% self-consumption (under 3-kW) were favoured by self-consumption incentives, while high capacity systems with less than 40% self-consumption (over 5 kW) were favoured by the FIT-type support schemes.

In particular, the population of cross-sectional units is grouped into clusters, such that slope parameter homogeneity is maintained only within clusters. Our method assumes no a priori information about the number of clusters and cluster membership and relies on the data instead. The unknown number of clusters and the corresponding partition are determined based on the concept of partitional clustering', using an information-based criterion. It is shown that this is strongly consistent, that is, it selects the true number of clusters with probability one as N. Simulation experiments show that the proposed criterion performs well even with moderate N and the resulting parameter estimates are close to the true values. We apply the method in a panel data set of commercial banks in the US and we find five clusters, with significant differences in the slope parameters across clusters.","[Sarafidis, Vasilis] Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia; [Weber, Neville] Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Sarafidis, V (通讯作者)，Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",vasilis.sarafidis@monash.edu; neville.weber@sydney.edu.au,,,Research Unit of the Faculty of Economics and Business at University of Sydney,Research Unit of the Faculty of Economics and Business at University of Sydney,"We are grateful to two anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

At the moment, China is the predominant supplier of both and its recent rare earth industrial policies combined with its own growing demand for rare earths have caused widespread concern. To diversify supplies, new mining outside of China is needed. But what many observers of the rare earth problem overlook is that China also dominates in (1) the processing of rare earths, particularly the less abundant heavy rare earths, and (2) the supply chains for permanent magnets. Heavy rare earths and permanent magnets are critical for many renewable energy technologies, and it will require decades to develop new non-Chinese deposits, processing capacity, and supply chains. This article clarifies several misconceptions, evaluates frequently proposed solutions, and urges policy makers outside of China to undertake measures to avert a crisis, such as greater support for research and development and for the cultivation of intellectual capital.

Within-country analysis of the links between informal care provision and labour market outcomes has been limited even though there are wide regional variations in informal caring. This issue is important because areas with the highest levels of informal caring typically have relatively low economic activity and employment rates. Despite the wide variations in informal care provision, labour market outcomes for different care categories are not found to vary markedly across England and Wales.

Such models typically embody a balanced growth path. This often leads researchers to estimate models imposing stringent prior choices on technical change. We demonstrate that estimation of the substitution elasticity and TFP growth can be substantially biased if technical progress is thereby mis-specified. We obtain analytical and simulation results in the context of a model consistent with balanced and near-balanced growth (i.e. departures from balanced growth but broadly stable factor shares). Given this evidence, a constant elasticity of substitution production function system is then estimated for the US economy. Results show that the estimated substitution elasticity tends to be significantly lower using a factor-augmenting specification (well below one). We are also able to reject conventional neutrality forms in favour of general factor augmentation with a non-negligible capital-augmenting component. Our work thus provides insights into production and supply-side estimation in balanced-growth frameworks.","[Leon-Ledesma, Miguel A.; Willman, Alpo] Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England; [McAdam, Peter; Willman, Alpo] European Cent Bank, Res Dept, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; [McAdam, Peter] Univ Surrey, Sch Econ, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England",University of Kent; European Central Bank; University of Surrey,"Leon-Ledesma, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England.",m.a.leon-ledesma@kent.ac.uk; peter.mcadam@ecb.europa.eu; alpo.willman@gmail.com,"Leon-Ledesma, Miguel/AAG-8740-2021",,,,,,30,29,31,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

In order to ensure effectiveness of policies targeting household energy conservation, it is important to investigate existing energy practices of different social groups. This article describes and explains energy practices in three leading states in environmental politics, technological innovation, and support for renewable energy production: Denmark, Austria, and the United Kingdom. Based on a longitudinal analysis of housing utility costs from the European Community Statistics on Income and Living Conditions we show that income plays a central role in households' energy practices. While high-income households have higher overall energy consumption, low-income groups spend a larger share of their income on utility costs. The variation of energy consumption across income groups is related to household characteristics, characteristics of the dwellings, and cross-national differences in the housing sector.

The model uses two independent variables, namely, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and the proportion of the tertiary industry in GDP, to construct carbon intensity learning curves (CILCs), i.e., CO2 emissions per unit of GDP, of 30 provinces in China. Instead of the traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) method, a PSO-GA intelligent optimization algorithm is used to optimize the coefficients of a learning curve. The carbon intensity abatement potentials of the 30 Chinese provinces are estimated via PSO-GA under the business-as-usual scenario. The estimation reveals the following results. (1) For most provinces, the abatement potentials from improving a unit of the proportion of the tertiary industry in GDP are higher than the potentials from raising a unit of per capita GDP. (2) The average potential of the 30 provinces in 2020 will be 37.6% based on the emission's level of 2005. The potentials of Jiangsu, Tianjin, Shandong, Beijing, and Heilongjiang are over 60%. Ningxia is the only province without intensity abatement potential. (3) The total carbon intensity in China weighted by the GDP shares of the 30 provinces will decline by 39.4% in 2020 compared with that in 2005. This intensity cannot achieve the 40%-45% carbon intensity reduction target set by the Chinese government. Additional mitigation policies should be developed to uncover the potentials of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia. In addition, the simulation accuracy of the CILCs optimized by PSO-GA is higher than that of the CILCs optimized by the traditional OLS method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

History and space matter in the evolution of industries: this special issue shows how and why.,"[Capasso, Marco] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Stam, Erik] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht Univ Sch Econ USE, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Cefis, Elena] Univ Bergamo, Dept Management Econ & Quantitat Methods, I-24127 Bergamo, Italy",Maastricht University; Utrecht University; University of Bergamo,"Capasso, M (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",marco.capasso@gmail.com,"Cefis, Elena/AAJ-3162-2020; Stam, Erik/E-6605-2017","Cefis, Elena/0000-0001-9960-4354; Stam, Erik/0000-0001-9827-0516; Capasso, Marco/0000-0003-2057-299X","Utrecht University through the High Potential Grant (HIPO) [60CEFI10]; University of Bergamo, Department of Management, Economics and Quantitative Methods","Utrecht University through the High Potential Grant (HIPO); University of Bergamo, Department of Management, Economics and Quantitative Methods","The DIME-HIPO Workshop on 'Industrial Dynamics and Economic Geography' was financially supported by Utrecht University through the High Potential Grant (HIPO) granted to Elena Cefis and Koen Frenken.

We minimize the simulation effort by replacing some key steps of the likelihood estimation procedure by numerical integration. We refer to this method as numerically accelerated importance sampling. We show that the likelihood function for models with a high-dimensional state vector and a low-dimensional signal can be evaluated more efficiently using the new method. We report many efficiency gains in an extensive Monte Carlo study as well as in an empirical application using a stochastic volatility model for U.S. stock returns with multiple volatility factors.

Irrigated areas will increase in forthcoming years, while fresh water supplies will be diverted from agriculture to meet the increasing demand of domestic use and industry. Furthermore, the efficiency of irrigation is very low, since less than 65 % of the applied water is actually used by the crops. The sustainable use of irrigation water is a priority for agriculture in arid areas. So, under scarcity conditions and climate change considerable effort has been devoted over time to introduce policies aiming to increase water efficiency based on the assertion that more can be achieved with less water through better management. Better management usually refers to improvement of water allocation and/or irrigation water efficiency. The former is closely related to adequate pricing, while the latter depends on the type of irrigation technology, environmental conditions and the scheduling of water application. Agricultural practices, such as soil management, irrigation and fertilizer application and disease and pest control are related with the sustainable water management in agriculture and protection of the environment. Socio-economic pressures and climate change impose restrictions to water allocated to agriculture. The adoption of sustainable water management in Mediterranean is not only a technological problem but involves many other considerations relative to social behavior of rural communities, the economic constrains, or the legal and institutional framework that may favor the adoption of some measures and not others. Sustainable water management in agriculture, which has a multi-functional role in Southern Europe, can be achieved by adopting improvements in irrigation application, soil and plant practices, water pricing, reuse of treated wastewater, farmers' participation in water management and capacity building.

This paper aims to establish if there is a paradox in relation to the corporate tax rate and corporate-tax-to-GDP-ratio in the European Union (the corporate tax rates reduction did not cause a corporate-tax-to-GDP-ratio drop), as this trend was observed by researchers. In order to assess the outcome of corporate tax competition as it is reflected by the firms' behavioural responses, a panel data for EU countries was used. The findings do not confirm that the downward pressures on corporate tax rates are not translated in a fall in corporate revenues over the time. (C) The Authors.

In relation to the field of valuation and insurance, flood risk represents a significant factor entering the new valuation procedures as well as binding regulations for real property valuation. The main objective of the research was to determine whether flood risk could be considered as a price-setting factor in market price of a real estate. If so, then it would be possible to start considering it in real estate valuation methods. Statistical methods of multiple linear regression model and statistical hypothesis testing, particularly statistical signification of regression parameter representing flood risk were employed in the research. The research was performed on the housing segment of the Czech real estate market. The paper presents an estimated model with a modified set of parameters that can be used to determine the market price of a house and also determine the degree of influence factor the flood risk may have on the final market price.

In this paper, analysis of the portfolio of vehicle insurance data using generalized linear model (GLM) is performed. Based on large real-world sample of data from 67 857 vehicles, the present study proposes a classification analysis approach addressing the selection of predictor variables. The models with different predictor variables are compared by the analysis of deviance. Based on this comparison, the model for the best estimate of annual claim frequency is chosen.

The analysis uses the model of four types of organizational cultures, i.e. the transaction-oriented market culture, the family-oriented clan culture, the tradition-bound hierarchical culture and the innovative adhocracy culture. The study shows that the use of coaching in organization management can gradually model or change the organizational culture. Moreover, it attempts to determine possible directions of the change. It is observed that - in favourable conditions - coaching may enable transformation from the traditional to the innovative culture. The change is possible because coaching brings about changes in people's behaviour, stimulates their creativity, coming up with plans and taking actions. There is a positive impact on the motivation of employees too. Coaching allows for a gradual rather than revolutionary change. The study also shows how the type of the organizational culture influences the possibility to implement coaching. Therefore, it also describes potential problems and barriers. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Two major policy documents guiding climate change adaptation planning in Kenya, the National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) and the National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP), were analysed for use of scientific information in their formulation through literature review; and interviewing policy makers using an open-ended questionnaire to determine the extent to which they accessed and applied scientific-based evidence of climate change impacts in development planning. Both documents, the NCCRS and NCCAP, made fairly good use of evidence contained in technical reports, especially the UNFCC, World Bank and FAO reports. However, they made very minimal, less than 20 %, reference to the hard scientific facts offered by journals, books and workshop proceedings. Similarly, only about 6 % of the respondents used the climate change information to develop mitigation and adaptation plans, training curricula, and Research and Development programs. The rest, over 76 %, rarely used it for planning purposes. This could be attributed to limited knowledge of appropriate methodology to distil relevant decision-relevant information from the spectrum of available information on climate change projections, availability of the information in user-unfriendly formats, and lack of information sharing protocols. There is need to reverse this trend. Most respondents (42 %) preferred the agricultural extension system in delivering climate change information. This was followed by stakeholders meetings with 29 % of the respondents' preference, conferences and workshops with 5 %, media (4 %), and climate change networks and internet with less than 1 % each. However, the national agricultural system is severely constrained by staff and facilities, and is therefore very limited in its reach. There is therefore need to strengthen it and also take full advantage of recent advances in ICT if the war against climate change is to be won. Meanwhile, majority of the respondents (50 %) were ignorant of the existence of any climate change databases. But about 17 % of the respondents were aware of and accessed databases hosted by Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and other international research centres. Another 10 % of the respondents relied on databases managed by donor agencies whilst about 8 % of the respondents each accessed databases established by Government Departments and National Agricultural Research Institutions (NARIs). Finally, about 7 % of the respondents relied solely on the FAO-based databases. The preference by respondents for databases managed by CGIAR centres may be attributed to the richness and accessibility of these databases due to very active participation of these centres in climate change research. There is need to enrich NARIs databases and those of Government Departments and make them more accessible to enhance sharing and application of climate change information by policy makers and other stakeholders.","[Kwena, Kizito; Ruttoh, Reuben J.] KARI Katumani, POB 340-90100, Machakos, Kenya; [Ndegwa, William; Kibue, Anthony M.] Kenya Meteorol Dept, Nairobi, Kenya; [Esilaba, Anthony O.] KARI Headquarters, Nairobi, Kenya; [Nyamwaro, Sospeter O.; Wamae, Dickson K.] KARI Muguga North, Kikuyu, Kenya; [Matere, Stella J.] KARI Muguga South, Nairobi, Kenya; [Kuyiah, Joan W.] Minist Agr, Nairobi, Kenya",,"Kwena, K (通讯作者)，KARI Katumani, POB 340-90100, Machakos, Kenya.",kwenakizito@yahoo.com,,,,,,,8,2,2,2,15,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1610-2010,,978-3-319-13000-2; 978-3-319-12999-0,CLIM CHANG MANAG,,,2015,,,,,,,35,42,,10.1007/978-3-319-13000-2_3,0.0,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BF2JL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380473000003,0

Despite a considerable amount of studies is available on this subject, the lack of comprehensive model, which enable analysis of business advice in the context of an entrepreneurial process taking place in the dynamic environment, has been identified. Therefore an attempt has been made to develop a theoretical model based on resource based view and dynamic capabilities approach, which provide a logic base for analysis of business advisor's role in development of competitive advantage within an entrepreneurial process. A modelled separation of the influence and the impact brings in the important consequences in indicating business advisor's involvement in relation to strategic decisions and thus directions of firms development.

Residential kitchen gardens in Rome are a custom started in the past, but recently they experienced a strong increase with a concentration in the city fringe. The amount and extension of these cultivated parcels has been inventoried by the Italian Institute of Agricultural Economics (INEA) in 2014 with a methodology based on photointerpretation of the very high resolution imagery provided by Google Earth. The spatial dataset, after field validation, contains around 2,700 polygons with some attributes, among which the agricultural land use (i.e. horticulture, mixed crops, orchards, vineyards and olive groves). The use of water in urban agriculture is a relevant issue both in terms of competition with other uses and in terms of safety for human health. In Rome, residential kitchen gardens may resort to municipal water supply but, due to water costs, the water abstraction from wells (legal and illegal) and canals and rivers (illegal) is common. This paper describes the estimation of the irrigation water demand of the residential kitchen gardens by taking into account various agricultural land use and two different irrigation systems. Estimations are referred to the irrigation season (April-September) by using average climatic data (1950-2000). Parcels irrigation water requirement is also evaluated in terms of sustainability by considering a scenario where rain water is harvested and stored for the irrigation season as a possible alternative or supplement to the current irrigation sources. The proposed approach could be useful for administrators for a preliminary assessment of one of the component of water use in urban areas, and to support water management activities by taking into account the beneficial role of urban agriculture.

Honesty, fairness, integrity and the people consumers, customers, clients, community, the public, the company and their needs and interests are gradually taking top ranks in the charts of corporate values. This approach is entirely consistent with the concept of socially responsible business, of which corporate governance (in the economic field) can be considered an integral part. Our main objective is to highlight the importance of applying the principles of governance corporate for companies whose securities are listed on the Bratislava Stock Exchange. The paper uses a correlation analysis to examine the association between corporate governance as a part of socially responsible business and financial decision making process in the area of dividend policy and indebtedness. We measured the level of corporate governance by corporate governance index, which contains information about the disclosure of annual reports, corporate governance information in annual reports, the content of corporate governance statements, boards of companies, remuneration of board members, risk management, audit, remuneration and nomination committee characteristics. We have compiled the first corporate governance index in Slovakia and we found inspiration in foreign studies with respect to the specifics of the Slovak financial market. The most important contribution of this paper is the finding that the application of the principles of corporate governance affects financial decisions of companies. There is a correlation between the responsible application of corporate governance principles and the total debt of companies. And also, there is a correlation between responsible application of corporate governance principles and the amount of dividends paid to shareholders.

Interest in multi-agent systems is rising because there are a lot of benefits that can be associated with their usage. Development of multi-agent system architectures, that facilitate information management, is an important research challenge that faces advancement in the management information systems area in the form of message passing technologies. The challenges associated with information management can be classified into three general categories: acquisition, organization and distribution. A management information system includes a series of processes that an individual (software agent) has to accomplish. Considering these processes, analysis of the information management has led to identification of several sets of such processes. By analyzing the previous research conducted in this area, it is determined that so far there haven't been many studies about information management development approaches based on multi-agent systems platform. The paper presents a multi-agent system that is designed to support the management of information about graduates of one or more educational institutes such as high school, university, masters and doctoral degree. We developed and implemented a multi-agent system for information management using the JADE platform. If the data is located in distributed execution environments, then the idea of using mobile agents allows the improvement of the system's performance. The multi-agents system presented in the paper is a distributed information management system based on the use of mobile agents, who receive queries from the system user and who, visiting the educational institutes databases, where this information can be found, transmit the interrogation results and then, a master agent processes these results based on rule sets implemented in the JADE platform. The mobility of the agent is defined by using an approach based on both the quality attributes specified for the multi-agent architecture and on the execution environments of the multi-agent system. This paper presents a distributed management model based on mobile agents in JADE. The model includes a distributed multi-agent system that is responsible for its management. Solving an information management problem requires a lot of tasks. The paper presents the results of a simulation of the multi-agent system operating on behalf of a user, management tasks and management information for some persons. Particularly, this work is focused on describing the designed multi-agent system architecture in JADE. This multi-agent system can be used by an employer for an interview in order to find if a potential candidate has competence in your job description (domain of competence). (C) 2015 The Authors.

In the on-going transition towards low carbon cities, tools to support local municipalities are fundamental. To scale up results achieved at single buildings to group of buildings and to reflect the dynamics of the buildings stock with acceptable computational costs, new approaches are needed. This paper presents a new bottom-up methodology to aid decision-makers in the planning process; the approach enables to simulate and analyse the evolution of the building stock from an energetic, economic and social perspective over long-term horizons. The approach is based on analytic hybrid methodologies for building energy performances assessment and on Geographic Information System for the creation of a database and thematic maps. In particular, the approach: 1) identifies the cost-optimal mix of successful renovation packages; 2) identifies buildings that needs to be prioritized; 3) considers the impact of socio-economic factors on policies implementation. The method is validated through urban calibration coefficients dependent on the city energy balance. Results show that this approach can support different stakeholders in selecting specific strategies depending on the desired goals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A huge mismatch of demand and supply forces the utilities to resort to load-shedding. To overcome this chronic problem the people need to either conserve energy or use some means to fulfil their energy requirements during the load shedding hours. An easier approach in this regard is the utilization of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) at user ends. However, due to the absence of any Governmental regulations the Pakistani markets are flooded with low-quality, locally-made UPSs. In this context it was decided to conduct this research, i.e. to explore the impact of these UPSs on the Pakistan's power system. Different types of UPS have been studied in our laboratory. Their charging and discharging processes have been investigated with respect to the harmonics in current and their efficiencies. The UPSs have been estimated to contribute a loss of 410 MW in Pakistan's power system. The cost of the energy lost in these UPSs, from year 2007 to 2013, has been estimated around 1934 million US dollars. The paper finally concludes that there is a need of energy policy in Pakistan to regulate the use of UPSs and related power quality issues. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we look at the effects of this spectacular increase in natural gas, and oil, extraction capacity can have on the mix of primary energy sources, on energy prices, and through that on internal political stability of rentier states. We use two exploratory simulation models to investigate the consequences of the combination of both complexity and uncertainty in relation to the global energy system and state stability. Our simulations show that shale developments could be seen as part of a long term hog-cycle, with a short term drop in oil prices if unconventional supply substitutes demand for oil. These lower oil prices may lead to instability in rentier states neighbouring the EU, especially when dependence on oil and gas income is high, youth bulges are present, or buffers like sovereign wealth funds are too limited to bridge the negative economic effects of temporary low oil prices.

Recent work provides anecdotal evidence of natural gas (NG) and renewable electricity (RE) synergies in the power sector, however few studies quantify the value of investing in NG and RE systems together as complements. This paper uses discounted cash flow analysis and real options analysis to value hybrid NG-RE systems in distributed applications, focusing on residential and commercial projects assumed to be located in the states of New York and Texas. Technology performance and operational risk profiles are modeled at the hourly level to capture variable RE output and NG prices are modeled stochastically as geometric Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic processes to capture NG price uncertainty. The findings consistently suggest that NG-RE hybrid distributed systems are more favorable investments in the applications studied relative to their single technology alternatives when incentives for renewables are available. In some cases, NG-only systems are the favorable investments. Understanding the value of investing, in NG-RE hybrid systems provides insights into one avenue towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions, given the important role of NG and RE in the power sector.

On this basis, the social embeddedness concept is proposed instead of the frequently used producer-consumer juxtaposition. Observation shows no linearity between resource distribution imbalances and supply dynamics on the one hand and price on the other. As a socially endogenous factor, oil price generates practices and norms comprising benchmarks for resource valuation, stock market dynamics and risk aversion practices. A high oil price incentivises investments and inter-fuel competition, whereas a low oil price increases both political and market risks beyond the consumer-producer conceptualisation. Hence, it is argued that the notion of oil price affordability in energy security should be revised. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis is supported by detailed expert interviews in all cement plants of Taiwan. The simulation results reveal that by 2035, eighteen energy efficient technologies could result in 25% savings for electricity and 9% savings for fuels under the technical diffusion scenario. This potential totally amounts to about 5000 TJ/year, of which 91% can be implemented cost-effectively assuming a discount rate of 10%. Policy makers should support a fast diffusion of these technologies. Additionally, policy makers can tap further saving potentials. First, by decreasing the clinker share, which is currently regulated to a minimum of 95%.

Given its importance, this work proposes an optimization model that assists to decide on when and where LNG should be delivered by coordinating tanker type, assignment and routing, inventory management, contract obligations, arbitrage and uncommitted LNG. The model maximizes the profit mainly by taking advantage of price differences between different markets. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, following the analysis of expenses and revenues, a new mixed integer programming model for LNG liquefaction and shipping is proposed from a corporate finance perspective. Furthermore, a solution approach for it is implemented and tested. Second, the model is used to derive a short term trade policy for the Middle Eastern LNG producers regarding the spot sale of their uncommitted product to Japan or to the UK, namely to: dispatch to whichever market has the higher current spot price, regardless of the variability of the transport expenses.

This paper measures market distortions and aggregate productivity growth in China's energy sector. We use the wedge between output elasticities and factor shares in revenues to recover a measure of firm-level market distortions. Using data on a large sample of Chinese energy enterprises from 1999 to 2007, our estimations provide strong evidence of the existence of both factor and product market distortions within and across China's various energy industries. The productivity aggregation and decomposition results demonstrate that the estimated aggregate productivity growth (APG) is, on average, 2.595% points per year, of which technological change, resource reallocation, and firm entries and exits account for 1.981, 0.068, and 0.546% points, respectively. The weak contributions of resource reallocation and firm turnover to APG are also found in energy sub-industries, except in the coal industry. Our research suggests that China's energy sector has major potential for productivity gains from resource reallocation through the reduction of market distortions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

By time-zero efficiency is meant a sequence of prices of derivatives contracts having the same underlying asset but different times to maturity which implies that prices comply with a set of efficiency conditions that prevent profitable time-zero arbitrage opportunities. We investigate whether statistical tests, based on the law of one price, and trading rules, based on price differentials and no-arbitrage violations, are useful for assessing time-zero efficiency. We apply tests and trading rules to daily data of three European power markets: Germany, France and Spain. In the case of the German market, after considering liquidity availability and transaction costs, results are not inconsistent with time-zero efficiency. However, in the case of the French and Spanish markets, limitations in liquidity and representativeness are challenges that prevent definite conclusions. Liquidity in French and Spanish markets should improve by using pricing and marketing incentives. These incentives should attract more participants into the electricity derivatives exchanges and should encourage them to settle OTC trades in clearinghouses. Publication of statistics on prices, volumes and open interest per type of participant should be promoted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
