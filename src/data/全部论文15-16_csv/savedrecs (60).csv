The hypothesis is that when there is an increase in profitability of a DRG, hospitals will increase the proportion of that DRG (own-price effects) and decrease those of other DRGs (cross-price effects), except in cases where there are scope economies in producing two different DRGs. This conjecture is tested in the context of the case payment scheme (CPS) under Taiwan's National Health Insurance programme over the period of July 1999 to December 2004. To tackle endogeneity of DRG profitability and treatment policy, a fixed-effects three-stage least squares method is applied. The results support the hypothesised own-price and cross-price effects, showing that DRGs which share similar resources appear to be complements rather substitutes. For-profit hospitals do not appear to be more responsive to DRG profitability, possibly because of their institutional characteristics and bonds with local communities. The key conclusion is that DRG-based payments will encourage a type of 'product-range' specialisation, which may improve hospital efficiency in the long run. However, further research is needed on how changes in output mix impact patient access and pay-outs of health insurance.

Methods: We used data from three clinical trials (the Randomized Clinical Trial on Effectiveness of Integrated COPD Management in Primary Care [RECODE], the Assessment Of Going Home Under Early Assisted Discharge [GO-AHEAD], and the Health Status Guided COPD Care [MARCH]). Data were randomly split into an estimation sample and a validation sample. The conceptual similarity between patient-reported CCQ and preference based EQ-5D scores was assessed using correlation and principal-component analysis. Different types of models were estimated with increasing complexity. We selected the final models on the basis of mean absolute error and root mean square error when comparing predicted and observed values from the same population (internal validity) and from different trial populations (external validity). We also developed models for different country-specific EQ-5D value sets. Results: The principal-component analysis showed that the CCQ domains functional state and mental state are associated with four dimensions of the EQ-5D. The EQ-5D dimension pain/ discomfort formed a separate construct on which no CCQ item loaded. The mean observed EQ-5D values were not significantly different from the mean predicted EQ-5D values in internal validation samples but did significantly differ in external validation samples. The models underestimated EQ-5D values in milder health states and overestimated them in more severe health states. The predictive ability of the models was similar across different EQ-5D value sets. Conclusions: The models can predict mean EQ-5D values that are similar to observed mean values in a similar population. the overestimating/underestimating of the low/high EQ-5D values, however, limits its use in Markov models. Therefore, mapping should be used cautiously.","[Boland, Melinde R. S.; Goossens, Lucas M.; Rutten-van Molken, Maureen P. M.

The growing number of prospective clinical/economic trials reflects both widespread interest in economic information for new technologies and the regulatory and reimbursement requirements of many countries that now consider evidence of economic value along with clinical efficacy. As decision makers increasingly demand evidence of economic value for health care interventions, conducting high-quality economic analyses alongside clinical studies is desirable because they broaden the scope of information available on a particular intervention, and can efficiently provide timely information with high internal and, when designed and analyzed properly, reasonable external validity. In 2005, ISPOR published the Good Research Practices for Cost Effectiveness Analysis Alongside Clinical Trials: The ISPOR RCTCEA 'I'ask Force report ISPOR initiated an update of the report in 2014 to include the methodological developments over the last 9 years. This report provides updated recommendations reflecting advances in several areas related to trial design, selecting data elements, database design and management, analysis, and reporting of results. Task force members note that trials should be designed to evaluate effectiveness (rather than efficacy) when possible, should include clinical outcome measures, and should obtain health resource use and health state utilities directly from study subjects. Collection of economic data should be fully integrated into the study. An incremental analysis should be conducted with an intention-to-treat approach, complemented by relevant subgroup analyses. Uncertainty should be characterized. Articles should adhere to established standards for reporting results of cost-effectiveness analyses.

This shift in demographics will put increasing pressure on the National Health Service and providers of social care. However, older people do not rely only on care provided by the state; informal care of the elderly is often supplied by family and friends. Therefore, the relationship between formal and informal care and the reaction of informal carers to institutional changes is an important policy issue. This study uses individual level data from the British Household Panel Survey to estimate the effects of the introduction of free personal care for the elderly in Scotland on informal care behaviour. As the change in policy applied only to Scotland, a natural experiment is formed allowing a difference-in-differences approach to be used. This paper finds that the introduction of the policy increased the probability of women supplying informal care by around six percentage points. In addition, for both sexes, it reports evidence of a shift away from the upper and lower tails towards the middle of the hours of care distribution as a result of the change in policy.

'this study evaluated physicians' therapy preferences for preventing skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with bone metastases secondary to solid tumors. Methods: A Web-enabled, discrete-choice experiment online survey was conducted among physicians who treated patients with bone metastases and solid tumors in the United States. Respondents chose between pairs of hypothetical medications defined by combinations of six attributes at varying levels for two hypothetical patients. Preference weights for attribute levels were estimated using a randomparameters logit model. Results: In total, 200 physicians completed the survey. Their mean age was 52 years, 57% were in practice for more than 15 years, 37% were oncologists, and 65% treated 10 or fewer patients with bone metastases weekly. Out-of-pocket cost to patients was the most important attribute overall. Among clinical outcomes, time to first SRE and risk of renal impairment were the most important attributes. Statistically significant preferences were observed for all attribute levels for time to first SRE, risk of renal impairment, and mode of administration. Predicted choice probability analysis showed that physicians preferred a hypothetical medication with attributes similar to those of denosumab over one with attributes similar to those of zoledronic acid. Conclusions: Physicians indicated that clinical attributes are important when considering bone-targeting therapy for bone metastases, but consistent with the current health care landscape, patient out-of-pocket cost was the most important. With health care costs being increasingly shifted to patients, physicians require accurate information about co-pays and assistance programs to avoid patients receiving less costly, yet potentially inferior, treatment.

We observed the morphological and growth changes, as well as changes in selected physiological functions of plants. In this work we address the possible adaptive or defence mechanisms of plants to water scarcity. The main objective of my work was to monitor the impact of plant growth regulators on physiological parameters under drought stress. The experiment was conducted on a field experimental station in Zabcice on variety Matylda. This area (Zabcice) is located in a warm area with prevailing continental climate, with average annual rainfall of 482 mm and an average annual temperature of 9.3 degrees C. Within this experiment following growth regulators and fungicide with growth regulation effect were used: Retacel extra R68 (chlormequat chloride 720 g.l(-1)), Moddus (trinexapac-ethyl 250 g.l(-1)), Cerone (ethephon 480 g.l(-1)), Amistar (strobilurin 250 g.l(-1)). Approximately 2 and 4 weeks since the beginning of drought stress were carried out physiological measurements of chlorophyll and flavonoid content. From our preliminary results it can be concluded that under drought stress the decrease of chlorophyll content in leaves was found. Growth regulators CCC and trinexapac mitigate the decline of chlorophyll content caused by drought in the upper leaves but rather increased the impact in older (lower) leaves. Fungicide azoxystrobin alleviates the decrease of chlorophyll caused by drought in all leaves. The results show that the positive effect of regulators reducing the impact of drought on the parameter FV/FM was seen in all growth regulator treatments with the most significant effect of the active ingredience trinexapac-ethyl.","[Baranyiova, Irena; Klem, Karel] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Baranyiova, I (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",irena.baranyiova@mendelu.cz,"Klem, Karel/G-9726-2014","Klem, Karel/0000-0002-6105-0429",,,,,5,0,0,0,4,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,405,408,,,,,,4,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100074,0

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a dangerous pathogen resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics with biofilm-formation ability. Because of an increasing resistance of bacterial species to ATBs, it is necessary to develop new methods for rapid identification of bacteria. Biobarcode assay provides a rapid detection of the antigen presence in the sample. Detection is based on the antibody-antigen interaction. The antibodies were bound to magnetic and non-magnetic particles. Next, immunoglobulin G (IgG) was bounded to magnetic particles. The non-magnetic particles were bound with anti-plasminogen antibody that is a specific antigen for MRSA as well as 20 bp oligonucleotides for detection. The first step involved determination of binding capacity of antibodies for different bacteria by ELISA. The IgG were able to bind 4.6 . 10(4) +/- 8% CFU . ml(-1) of MRSA, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis and the anti-plasminogen antibody (anti-Pls) was specific for MRSA only with the binding capacity of 5 . 10(3) CFU . ml(-1). After binding of antibodies to particles, the bacterial strain MRSA was captured by these antibody-modified particles and the detection oligonucleotide was released and determined by electrochemical method. The results suggest that the IgG is non-specific for MRSA while specificity of the anti-plasmin antibody for MRSA was confirmed. In this study, we developed a method for rapid detection of MRSA in the pooled sample.","[Cihalova, Kristyna; Dostalova, Simona; Hegerova, Dagmar; Skalickova, Sylvie; Vaculovicova, Marketa; Kizek, Rene; Kopel, Pavel] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Cihalova, K (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Chem & Biochem, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",kriki.cihalova@seznam.cz,"Kopel, Pavel/E-5711-2012; Kizek, Rene/D-7748-2012; Skalickova, Sylvie/E-8430-2012; Cihalova, Kristyna/H-4517-2018; Vaculovicova, Marketa/E-5583-2016; Rex, Simona/D-4951-2013; Hegerova, Dagmar/J-7030-2012","Kopel, Pavel/0000-0003-4216-9544; Skalickova, Sylvie/0000-0002-2808-001X; Cihalova, Kristyna/0000-0001-8661-0763; Vaculovicova, Marketa/0000-0002-6771-1304; Rex, Simona/0000-0003-0737-3144; Hegerova, Dagmar/0000-0003-0826-234X",,,,,13,0,0,0,17,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,448,452,,,,,,5,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100084,0

Local wintertime tourism, which has traditionally been a strong pillar for the economies of mountainous areas, could decrease significantly in the future, due to economic crisis, but also due to decreased snow coverage according to the predicted climate trends for the coming years. This paper is based on the idea to address the crisis in the mountainous areas of Greece, and ski destinations in particular, by an all-year model of operation that could alleviate seasonality (at least in part) and yield important social and financial benefits for the local communities. Our thesis is motivated by successful summer-tourism practices of ski centers around the word. Are Greek people actually willing to visit ski destinations after the short ski season, and if so what are their preferences on possible activities, services and facilities in ski centers (assuming they would operate all year long)? To answer such questions, we created a self-administered, web-based questionnaire that was circulated to the public via e-mail and social media for a period of one month. About 460 people, most of them fans of the Greek mountains, completed the questionnaire. We present and discuss data collected and analyzed, focusing on the participants' preferences on possible activities, services and organizational aspects of mountain tourism during summertime.","[Dologlou, Natali; Kotsios, Vaios] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Metsov Interdisciplinary Res Ctr, Patiss 42, GR-10682 Athens, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,"Dologlou, N (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Metsov Interdisciplinary Res Ctr, Patiss 42, GR-10682 Athens, Greece.",ndolog@central.ntua.gr; pa07vaik@survey.ntua.gr,"Dologlou, Natali/AAO-2778-2020","Dologlou, Natali/0000-0002-3918-0374; Kotsios, Vaios/0000-0003-1139-0967",,,,,56,1,1,1,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-15859-4; 978-3-319-15858-7,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,3,25,,10.1007/978-3-319-15859-4_1,0.0,,,23,"Business; Cultural Studies; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Cultural Studies; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BF1CF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380358000001,0

To lift this uncertainty, we adapt a model of consumer behaviour under rationing to the case of linear nutritional constraints. Dietary adjustments are derived from information on consumer preferences, consumption levels, and nutritional contents of foods. A calibration exercise simulates, for different income groups, how the French diet would respond to various nutrition recommendations, and those behavioural adjustments are translated into health outcomes through the DIETRON epidemiological model. This allows for the ex-ante comparison of the efficiency, equity and health effects of ten nutritional recommendations. Although most recommendations impose significant taste costs on consumers, they are highly cost-effective, with the recommendations targeting salt, saturated fat, and fruits and vegetables (F&V) ranking highest in terms of efficiency.

Under a stochastic demand setting, a dual-sourcing policy with a supplementary supplier is introduced to mitigate the profit losses for the retailer. We built mathematical models to evaluate the performances of the retailer under single and dual sourcing policies respectively. The study shows that a risk-neutral retailer will prefer a dual sourcing policy that makes him carry more inventory from a more robust supplier when facing two-sided disruption risks. Furthermore, the retailer performances in terms of total profit are overwhelming under scenarios where the supplementary supplier is less, median and more robust to risks. Our mathematical models is examined through numerical examples and the results provide important guidelines for implementing sourcing policies when two-sided disruption risks is considered.","[Lin, I-Chen; Hung, Yu-Hsiang] Taipei Univ Technol, Ind Engn & Management, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taipei University of Technology,"Lin, IC (通讯作者)，Taipei Univ Technol, Ind Engn & Management, Taipei, Taiwan.",iclin@ntut.edu.tw; joaisn185@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",,,978-94-6239-102-4; 978-94-6239-101-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,113,117,,10.2991/978-94-6239-102-4_24,0.0,,,5,"Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BE5UU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373492700024,0

In addition to the historically strong record of various cultural uses they had in symbols, rituals, traditional folklore, arts, crafts, events and festivals, at present, the growing synergy with tourism stands out as an approach that could enhance their fundamental values even further as an important catalyst of a sustainability-aimed socio-economic development. The comparative analysis of cultural heritage policies in the case of continuing, productive and living landscapes as the Rose Valley cultural landscape in Bulgaria and the Olive Groves cultural landscape in Greece aims to encourage landscape conservation by providing cross-case landscape definitions, history of formation, cultural significance, preservation and governance systems, as well as initiated projects for sustainable use and development.

In this research, on the basis of existing research and characteristics of the Chinese consumers, the impact of negative network public opinions on purchasing willingness of Chinese consumers is investigated. Moreover, relevant theories are used as a basis to build a model which has four variables including network public opinions, brand attitudes, the consumer involvement degree and consumers' purchasing willingness. A statistical analysis is made of data obtained through the questionnaire survey to validate the impact of negative public opinions on consumers' purchasing willingness, the mediate effect of brand attitudes and the moderate effect of the consumer involvement degree. On this basis, recommendations are given to enterprises in China to manage and cope with negative network public opinions.","[Wang Tian; Li Guo-feng] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Wang, T (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,801,808,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600106,0

Because one member employs an Atkinson type aggregation we refer to it as the Atkinson index of consistent inequality. A second member of this family parallels the Kolm index of inequality. Two innovative features of these indices are that no specific structure is imposed on the form of the index at the outset and no transformation of any existing index is considered to ensure consistency. Each of them regards an achievement distribution as equally unequal as the corresponding shortfall distribution. We apply these indices to study inequality in grip strength among 50+ year-old Europeans.

Economic evaluation can be useful in providing decision makers with the best evidence of the anticipated benefits of new investments, as well as their expected opportunity costs the benefits forgone of the options not chosen. To guide the decisions of health systems effectively, it is important that the methods of economic evaluation are founded on clear principles, are applied systematically, and are appropriate to the decision problems they seek to inform. Methods: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a major funder of economic evaluations of health technologies in low- and middle income countries (LMICs), commissioned a reference case through the International Decision Support Initiative (iDSI) to guide future evaluations, and improve both the consistency and usefulness to decision makers. Results: The iDSI Reference Case draws on previous insights from the World Health Organization, the US Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health Care, and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Comprising 11 key principles, each accompanied by methodological specifications and reporting standards, the iDSI Reference Case also serves as a means of identifying priorities for methods research, and can be used as a framework for capacity building and technical assistance in LMICs. Conclusions: The iDSI Reference Case is an aid to thought, not a substitute for it, and should not be followed slavishly without regard to context, culture, or history. This article presents the iDSI Reference Case and discusses the rationale, approach, components, and application in LMICs.","[Wilkinson, Thomas] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Publ Hlth, Wits Rural Publ Hlth & Hlth Transit Unit, PRICELESS SA, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Sculpher, Mark J.; Claxton, Karl; Revill, Paul; Culyer, Anthony J.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Claxton, Karl] Univ York, Dept Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Briggs, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Cairns, John A.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London, England; [Teerawattananon, Yot] Minist Publ Hlth, Hlth Intervent & Technol Assessment Program HITAP, Bangkok, Thailand; [Asfaw, Elias] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Dept Econ, Durban, South Africa; [Lopert, Ruth] George Washington Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Washington, DC USA; [Lopert, Ruth] Management Sci Hlth, Arlington, VA USA; [Culyer, Anthony J.] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Walker, Damian G.] Bill & Melinda Gates Fdn, Global Dev Program, Seattle, WA USA",University of Witwatersrand; University of York - UK; University of York - UK; University of Glasgow; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Ministry of Public Health - Thailand; University of Kwazulu Natal; George Washington University; University of York - UK; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,"Wilkinson, T (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Publ Hlth, Wits Rural Publ Hlth & Hlth Transit Unit, PRICELESS SA, Johannesburg, South Africa.",tommy.d.wilkinson@gmail.com,"Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020; Cairns, John/AAD-1168-2020","Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997; Lopert, Ruth/0000-0002-0882-4288; Walker, Damian/0000-0003-4568-0970; Sculpher, Mark/0000-0003-3746-9913; Teerawattananon, Yot/0000-0003-2217-2930",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),The development of the iDSI Reference Case was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.,,41,157,161,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2016,19.0,8.0,,,,,921,928,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.04.015,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,EO1HD,27987641.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000396448300003,0

It focuses on low-educated individuals in England and Wales who entered the labour market immediately after the 1973 oil crisis. Our identification strategy relies on the comparison of individuals who left school at the compulsory age, were born in the same year and had a similar quantity of education - but whose school-leaving behaviour in different years (hence, different economic conditions) was exogenously implied by compulsory schooling laws. We provide evidence that, unlike school-leavers who did postpone their entry into the labour market during the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s, pupils' decisions to leave school at the compulsory age immediately after the 1973 oil crisis were not endogenous to the contemporaneous economic conditions at labour-market entry. We use a repeated cross section of individuals over the period 1983-2001 from the General Household Survey and adopt a lifecourse perspective, from 7 to 26 years after school-leaving. Our results show that poor economic conditions at labour-market entry are particularly damaging to women's health. For men, the health impact of poor economic conditions at labour-market entry is less obvious and not robust to all specifications.

Individuals can choose between two actions: either to adopt a new behavior or stay with the default one. A key element is an individual threshold, i.e. the number or proportion of others who must take action before a given actor does so. This threshold represents an individual's inclination to adopt the new behavior. The main novelty of the paper is to assume that the thresholds are endogenously determined. Agents change their inclination by exposition to other inclinations in the social network. This provides a coupled dynamical system of aggregate adoption rate and inclinations orchestrated by the network. With our model we are able to explain a variety of adoption behavior. Of particular interest is the existence of non-monotonic behavior of the aggregate adoption rate which is not possible in the benchmark model without inclination. Our model is therefore able to explain sudden outbreaks of collective action. This suggests to reinvent the common static and exogenous concept of a tipping point by defining it endogenously generated by the network. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Any such rule can be obtained from a preference model with CRRA period utility. In a steady state with constant interest rates, a proportional consumption rule can be derived from a model with time-consistent preferences or from a model with possibly time-inconsistent preferences in which a household continually reoptimizes future utility discounted relative to the present instant. These two preference models will only coincide for the special case when the discount function is exponential. More generally, there will be two distinct yet observationally equivalent preference models. Hyperbolic like discounting may arise because that is a simpler way for the brain to process a standard exponential discount function after accounting for mortality risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The test detects local alternatives that approach the identified set at the best rate among available tests in a broad class of models, and is adaptive to the smoothness properties of the data generating process.

This paper estimates the impact of competition between nursing homes on their quality, and how this impact varies when consumers have better access to information. The effect of competition is identified using exogenous variation in the geographical proximity of nursing homes to their potential consumers. The change in information transparency is captured by the launch of the Five-Star Quality Rating System in 2009, which improved access to the quality information of nursing homes. We find that while the effect of competition on nursing home quality is generally rather limited, this effect becomes significantly stronger with increased information transparency. The results suggest that regulations on public quality reporting and on market structure are policy complements, and should be considered jointly to best improve quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The loglikelihood function is split into two parts that are weighted differently. The first part is associated with the key variables while the second part is associated with the related variables which may contribute to the forecasting of key variables. We derive asymptotic properties, including consistency and asymptotic normality, of the weighted maximum likelihood estimator. We show that this estimator outperforms the standard likelihood-based estimator in approximating the true unknown distribution of the data as well as in out-of-sample forecasting accuracy. We verify the new estimation method in a Monte Carlo study and investigate the role of different weights in different settings. In the context of forecasting gross domestic product growth, this key variable is typically observed at a low (quarterly) frequency while the supporting variables are observed at a high (monthly) frequency. We adopt a low frequency representation of the mixed frequency dynamic factor model and discuss the computational efficiencies of this approach. In our empirical study for the U.S. economy, we present improvements in nowcasting and forecasting accuracy when the weighted likelihood-based estimation procedure is adopted. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We use the representation of confidence in beliefs introduced in Hill (2013), and axiomatise a class of models, differing from each other in the appropriate notion of stakes. The theory naturally suggests two distinct strategies for completing preferences, and hence for choosing in the presence of incompleteness: one that relies only on beliefs in which the decision maker is sufficiently confident, and one that mobilises all beliefs, no matter how little confidence she may have in them. Axiomatic characterisations are given for completion procedures following each of the strategies. Finally, in a market setting, the incorporation of confidence is shown to add an extra friction, beyond the standard implications of non-expected utility models for Pareto optima.

Despite the support, practical approaches for measuring value remain elusive. Value is commonly defined as quality divided by costs, where quality reflects patient outcomes and costs are the total costs for providing care, whether these be costs related to an episode, a diagnosis, or per capita. Academicians have proposed a conceptual approach to measure value, in which we measure outcomes important to patients and costs using time driven activity-based costing. This approach is conceptually sound, but has significant practical challenges. In our commentary, we describe how health care can use existing quality measures and cost accounting data to measure value. Although not perfect, we believe this approach is practical, valid, and scalable and can establish the foundation for future work in this area.","[Lee, K. H. Ken; Austin, J.

Methods: A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted of 147 patients with advanced hip or knee OA to compare the effect of two decision aids (booklet-only vs. booklet with DVD). Results: Both decision aid programs were well received and demonstrated improvements in patient knowledge and willingness to participate in treatment decisions. The decision aids, however, had a marginal effect on patient willingness to participate in OA management, with an increase of 0.11 and 0.6 on a scale of 2 (P = 0.58) between groups. Conclusions: The decision aids were accepted for most patients and effective in improving patient knowledge and willingness to participate in the decision process. Nevertheless, the addition of a more expensive DVD to the booklet program did not improve patient acceptance or knowledge.","[Shue, Jennifer; Karia, Raj J.; Cardone, Dennis; Samuels, Jonathan; Shah, Mehul; Slover, James D.] NYU, Langone Med Ctr, New York, NY USA",New York University; NYU Langone Medical Center,"Karia, RJ (通讯作者)，NYU, Hosp Joint Dis, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 301 East 17th St,Suite 1616, New York, NY 10003 USA.",raj.karia@nyumc.org,,"slover, james/0000-0003-0099-0721; samuels, jonathan/0000-0002-1513-770X",Orthopaedic Research and Education Foundation,Orthopaedic Research and Education Foundation,"Financial support for this study was provided entirely by a grant from the Orthopaedic Research and Education Foundation.

We report the results of a cluster randomized experiment, in which 3000 households in 20 communes in Vietnam were randomly assigned at baseline to a control group or one of three treatments: an information leaflet about Vietnam's government-run scheme and the benefits of health insurance, a voucher entitling eligible household members to 25% off their annual premium, and both. At baseline, the four groups had similar enrollment rates (4%) and were balanced on plausible enrollment determinants. The interventions all had small and insignificant effects (around 1 percentage point or ppt). Among those reporting sickness in the 12months prior to the baseline survey the subsidy-only intervention raised enrollment by 3.5ppts (p=0.08) while the combined intervention raised enrollment by 4.5ppts (p=0.02); however, the differences in the effect sizes between the sick and non-sick were just shy of being significant. Our results suggest that information campaigns and subsidies may have limited effects on voluntary health insurance enrollment in Vietnam and that such interventions might exacerbate adverse selection.

We first discuss the concept and usefulness of the Poverty Gap Profile (PGP) for comparing poverty in two populations. Dominance of one PGP over another suggests poverty dominance for a wide class of indices which may be expressed as functionals of the PGP. We then discuss hypotheses that can be used to test poverty dominance in terms of the PGP and introduce and justify a test statistic based on empirical PGP's where we allow for the poverty line to be estimated. A method for obtaining critical values by simulation is proposed that takes account of estimation of the poverty line. The finite sample properties of the methods are examined in the context of a Monte Carlo simulation study and the methods are illustrated in an assessment of relative consumption poverty in Australia over the period 1988/1989-2009/2010.

The new method is similar to the method for making multilateral comparisons of Caves, Christensen and Diewert (1982b) but their method can only compare gross outputs across production units and not compare real value added of production units across time and space. The present paper uses the translog GDP methodology for measuring productivity levels across time that was pioneered by Diewert and Morrison (1986) and adapts it to the multilateral context. The new method is illustrated using an industry level data set and shows that productivity dispersion across 38 countries between 1995 and 2011 has decreased faster in the traded sector than in the non-traded sector.

In theory, a system of managed competition involves incentives for quality and efficiency of provided care. This is mainly because health insurers contract on behalf of their clients with healthcare providers on, potentially, quality and costs. The paper develops a strategy to comprehensively analyse available multidimensional data on quality and costs to assess and report on the relative performance of healthcare providers within managed competition. Data and methods: We had access to individual information on 2409 clients of 19 Dutch diabetes care groups on a broad range of (outcome and process related) quality and cost indicators. We carried out a cost-consequences analysis and corrected for differences in case mix to reduce incentives for risk selection by healthcare providers. Results and conclusion: There is substantial heterogeneity between diabetes care groups' performances as measured using multidimensional indicators on quality and costs. Better quality diabetes care can be achieved with lower or higher costs. Routine monitoring using multidimensional data on quality and costs merged at the individual level would allow a systematic and comprehensive analysis of healthcare providers' performances within managed competition.

Methods: Strategies to locate studies included online searches of 13 databases and 19 research registries, hand searches of 57 journals, and author and ancestry searches of all eligible studies. Search terms included patient compliance, medication adherence, and related terms. Searches were conducted for all studies published since 1960. Eligible published or unpublished primary studies tested medication adherence interventions and reported medication knowledge, quality of life, physical function, and symptom outcomes. Primary study attributes and outcome data were reliably coded. Overall standardized mean differences (SMDs) were analyzed using random-effects models. Dichotomous and continuous moderator analyses and funnel plots were used to explore risks of bias. Results: Thorough searching located 141 eligible reports. The reports included 176 eligible comparisons between treatment and control subjects across 23,318 subjects. Synthesis across all comparisons yielded statistically significant SMDs for medication knowledge (d = 0.449), quality of life (d = 0.127), physical function (d = 0.142), and symptoms (d = 0.182). The overall SMDs for studies focusing on subsamples of patients with specific illnesses were more modest but also statistically significant. Of specific symptoms analyzed (depression, anxiety, pain, energy/vitality, cardiovascular, and respiratory), only anxiety failed to show a significant improvement after medication adherence interventions. Most SMDs were significantly heterogeneous, and risk of bias analyses suggested links between study quality and SMDs. Conclusions: Modest but significant improvements in patient-centered outcomes were observed after medication adherence interventions.","[Conn, Vicki S.; Ruppar, Todd M.; Enriquez, Maithe; Cooper, Pamela S.] Univ Missouri, Sch Nursing, S317 Sinclair Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Conn, VS (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Sch Nursing, S317 Sinclair Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",conn@missouri.edu,"Ruppar, Todd/AAS-3830-2021; Enriquez, Maithe/J-2924-2019","Ruppar, Todd/0000-0003-0794-5544; Conn, Vicki/0000-0003-2404-6575",National Institutes of Health [R01NR011990],National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"The project was supported by Award Number R01NR011990 (Vicki S.

We consider two approaches penalized least squares (PLS) for first-differenced models without endogenous regressors, and penalized GMM (PGMM) for first-differenced models with endogeneity. We show that with probability tending to one, both methods can correctly determine the unknown number of breaks and estimate the common break dates consistently. We establish the asymptotic distributions of the Lasso estimators of the regression coefficients and their post Lasso versions. We also propose and validate a data-driven method to determine the tuning parameter used in the Lasso procedure. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that both the PLS and PGMM estimation methods work well in finite samples. We apply our PGMM method to study the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic growth using a panel of 88 countries and regions from 1973 to 2012 and find multiple breaks in the model.

The consistency of either estimator depends on exogeneity of the explanatory variables (inputs, in the production frontier setting). We will investigate the case that one or more of the inputs is endogenous, in the simultaneous equation sense of endogeneity. That is, we worry that there is correlation between the inputs and statistical noise or inefficiency. In a standard regression setting, simultaneity is handled by a number of procedures that are numerically or asymptotically equivalent. These include 2SLS; using the residual from the reduced form equations for the endogenous variables as a control function; and MLE of the system that contains the equation of interest plus the unrestricted reduced form equations for the endogenous variables (LIML). We will consider modifications of these standard procedures for the stochastic frontier setting. The paper is mostly a survey and combination of existing results from the stochastic frontier literature and the classic simultaneous equations literature, but it also contains some new results.

Numerous studies can be found in the areas of productivity analysis, industrial organization, labor economics, and health economics. While many papers have estimated the more restrictive output- and input-oriented distance functions, here we estimate a more general directional distance function. A seminal paper on directional distance functions by Chambers (1998) as well as papers by Fare et al. (1997), Chambers et al. (1998), Fare and Grosskopf (2000), Grosskopf (2003), Fare et al. (2005), and Hudgins and Primont (2007) do not address the issue of how to choose an optimal direction set. Typically the direction is arbitrarily selected to be 1 for good outputs and 1 for inputs and bad outputs. By estimating the directional distance function together with the first-order conditions for cost minimization and profit maximization using Bayesian methods, we are able to estimate optimal firm-specific directions for each input and output which are consistent with allocative and technical efficiency. We apply these methods to an electric-utility panel data set, which contains firm-specific prices and quantities of good inputs and outputs as well as the quantities of bad inputs and outputs. Estimated firm-specific directions for each input and output are quite different from those normally assumed in the literature. The computed firm-specific technical efficiency, technical change, and productivity change based on estimated optimal directions are substantially higher than those calculated using fixed directions.

This study considers two ways of exploring the presence of attribute non-attendance (that is, respondents considering only a subset of the attributes that define the choice options) in a health state valuation discrete choice experiment. The methods used include the latent class (LC) and endogenous attribute attendance (EAA) models, which both required adjustment to reflect the structure of the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) framework for valuing health outcomes. We find that explicit consideration of attendance patterns substantially improves model fit. The impact of allowing for non-attendance on the estimated QALY weights is dependent on the assumed source of non-attendance. If non-attendance is interpreted as a form of preference heterogeneity, then the inferences from the LC and EAA models are similar to those from standard models, while if respondents ignore attributes to simplify the choice task, the QALY weights differ from those using the standard approach. Because the cause of non-attendance is unknown in the absence of additional data, a policymaker may use the range of weights implied by the two approaches to conduct a sensitivity analysis.

In Japan, the treatments available include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and varenicline; however, unassisted attempts to quit smoking remain common. Objective The objective of this study was to compare the health and economic consequences in Japan of using pharmacotherapy to support smoking cessation with unassisted attempts and the current mix of strategies used. Methods A discrete-event simulation that models lifetime quitting behaviour and includes multiple quit attempts (MQAs) and relapses was adapted for these analyses. The risk of developing smoking-related diseases is estimated based on the duration of abstinence. Data collected from a survey conducted in Japan were used to determine the interventions selected by smokers initiating a quit attempt and the time between MQAs. Direct and indirect costs are assessed (expressed in 2014 Japanese Yen). Results Using pharmacotherapy (NRT or varenicline) to support quit attempts proved to be dominant when compared with unassisted attempts or the current mix of strategies (most are unassisted). The results of stratified analyses by age imply that smoking cessation improves health outcomes across all generations. Indirect costs due to premature death leading to lost wages are an important component of the total costs, exceeding the direct medical cost estimates. Conclusions Increased utilisation of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy to support quit attempts is predicted to lead to an increase in the number of smokers achieving abstinence, and provide improvements in health outcomes over a lifetime with no additional costs.","[Igarashi, Ataru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Drug Policy & Management, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Goto, Rei] Kyoto Univ, Hakubi Ctr Adv Res, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Ushinomiyacho, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Goto, Rei] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Sakyo Ku, Yoshida Honmachi, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Suwa, Kiyomi; Yoshikawa, Reiko] Pfizer Japan Inc, Shibuya Ku, 3-22-7 Yoyogi, Tokyo 1518589, Japan; [Ward, Alexandra J.] Evidera, 430 Bedford St,Suite 300, Lexington, MA 02420 USA; [Moller, Joergen] Evidera, Metro Bldg,6th Floor,1 Butterwick, London W6 8DL, England",University of Tokyo; Kyoto University; Kyoto University; Pfizer; Evidera; Evidera,"Igarashi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Drug Policy & Management, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",atarui1@mac.com,,"Moller, Jorgen/0000-0002-8194-864X; igarashi, ataru/0000-0001-6307-6916",,,,,47,20,20,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Changes in risk are defined by the concept of nth-order stochastic dominance and concern the effectiveness of preventive treatment, side effects, severity of the potential disease, and comorbidity risk. The impact of a riskier environment on the probability of disease threshold above which the preferable decision is to undergo preventive treatment is shown to depend on both mixed risk averse individual preferences and the configuration of increase in risk considered. These results suggest that neglecting differences between risks when evaluating the treatment threshold is likely to lead to substantial errors in most cost-benefit applications for preventive treatment.

Bouquet) by hybridization. These last references, obtained from 4 or 5 back crossing between Muscadinia. rotondifolia. X. V. vinifera, have in particular a high level of resistance against mildew and oidium. These varieties have RUN 1 and RPV1. resistance genes, with several other secondary genes on one chromosome locus. This makes access to organic market easier. Agronomic criteria are studied for this selection. Among the 14 selected grapevine species, some have high level of polyphenols (6 times more than alicante). Others (white and red) have a high aromatic potential. Others have a low sugar content 135 g/l to 150 g/l) and adapted sugar/acidity ratio. - In the cellar: The absence of fermentation and alcohol requires optimization of the process for juice making. For example by increasing polyphenols extraction and colour stability by using thermo-treatment. Flash release process coupled with enzymatic soaking on grapes at 45 degrees C for example, increases 2 or 3 fold polysaccharide juice content, and increases anthocyanins extraction and hence colour intensity. With this process the draining of grape marc and juice production increase. Pressure technology by on line horizontal decanter is possible. - In juice storehouse. Electro membrane process, (oenodia membrane process) with specific membranes gives possibilities to achieve two objectives on juice: - Decrease pH and increase acidity of juice and colour stabilization, without any additive.","[Escudier, Jean-Louis; Samson, Alain; Mikolajczak, Michel; Bouissou, Delphine; Veyret, Melanie; Zumstein, Emanuelle; Heywang, Marc; Lacipere, Jean-Noel; Ojeda, Hernan] INRA, UE999 Pech Rouge, Gruissan, France; [Caille, Soline; Souquet, Jean-Marc; Cheynier, Veronique] INRA, UMR 1083SP0, Montpellier, France; [Payraud, Richard; Brienza, Emilie; Moreau, Stephanie; Guyot, Pierre] FOULON SOPAGLY SAS, Macon, France; [Rousseau, Jacques] Groupe ICV Jasse Maurin Lattes, Montpellier, France",INRAE; INRAE,"Escudier, JL (通讯作者)，INRA, UE999 Pech Rouge, Gruissan, France.",,,"Cheynier, Veronique/0000-0001-7759-284X",,,,,14,3,3,0,4,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1001.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701001,0.0,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700001,0

In the twentieth century, most of these regions have had important territorial transformations, however, viticulture elements remain in culture and regional identity. In recent years, the growing of vines expanded to other regions and also in other States. The cultivation of the vine and winemaking built a brand, both for the actors and for the regional society, whose viticultural landscape distinguishes and identifies regions, and the cultural expression of the grape and wine is present in numerous material and intangible elements. The material and the intangible cultural complex of the wine-growing regions are a diverse and dynamic heritage, more concentrated in Rio Grande do Sul, which contributes to the enhancement and preservation of cultural heritage and territorial wine in this State.

Methods: Systematic review of PRO use in populations younger than 18 years with any of 17 infectious diseases for which vaccines are available or in development. The search was limited to studies performed in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand and published between January 1, 1990, and July 31, 2013. Searches were conducted in Scopus and PsycINFO, and reference lists were manually searched. Results are reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results: Of 6410 titles and abstracts and 174 full-text articles reviewed, 17 full-text articles were included for data extraction. The largest number of PRO studies was carried out in patients with anogenital warts and rotavirus gastroenteritis. No PRO studies were identified for nine conditions. A total of 24 PRO measures (12 generic and 12 disease-specific) were used in the studies reviewed. Most of the instruments used were of high quality. Proxy responses were occasionally obtained when self -report would have been feasible. No validated disease-specific instruments for children with any of the conditions studied were found. Conclusions: The paucity of studies and PRO instruments to assess pediatric health status in vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, and the lack of a standardized approach to measurement, makes it difficult to capture the impact of disease and the benefit of vaccination and could potentially hinder decision making. Guidelines from relevant bodies to steer research in this area would be useful. Copyright (C) 2016, International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

The least concave decomposition of the NM index introduced by Debreu (1976) plays an important role in our analysis as do the notions of minimum concavity points and minimum concavity directions.

The search for alternative methods of microbiological control is important and necessary, since SO2 is a potential allergen and consumers are increasingly looking for healthier and preservative free products. Ultraviolet radiation was tested as an innovative technology that can help reduce the amount of sulphur dioxide used in winemaking. The object of this study was to optimize the process conditions compared to the results obtained previously, and to evaluate the efficiency of microbiological stabilization and its influence on the physico-chemical characteristics, the phenolic composition and sensory profile. Thus, red wine with very low content of sulphur dioxide was subjected to UV-C radiation in two different doses 424J/le 778J/l, and the preparation of a control wine was carried out to which 30 mg/l sulfur dioxide was added. The wines (control-UV0, UV1 and UV2) were analyzed over time (from 0 to 4 months). The results show that treatment with a lower dosage is effective in the microbiological control of the product.

The bidder's valuations are drawn from a distribution with a decreasing hazard rate and non-decreasing virtual valuations. We find that at equilibrium the seller adopts an advertising policy which minimizes the uncertainty over the number of participants, and sets a reserve price which only depends on the distribution of valuations and the weight on revenue in the objective function. A welfare-maximizing seller is shown to advertise more than a revenue-maximizing seller, and a ceteris paribus increase in the advertising level is proved to increase the expected winner's rent.

We introduce a noncooperative, sequential coalition formation model and show that the set of equilibrium outcomes coincides with the recursive core, a generalisation of the core to such games. In order to extend past results limited to totally recursive-balanced partition function form games we introduce a more permissive perfectness concept, subgame-consistency that only requires perfectness in selected subgames. Due to the externalities, the profitability of deviations depends on the partition formed by the remaining players: the stability of core payoff configurations is ensured by a combination of the pessimism of players going for certain profits only and the assumption that players base their stationary strategies on a made-up history punishing some of the possible deviators and getting this sometimes right.

In much applied research, X and W are discrete, and W has fewer points of support than X. Consequently, L(g) is not identified nonparametrically and can have any value in (-infinity, infinity). This paper uses shape restrictions, such as monotonicity or convexity, to achieve interval identification of L(g). The paper shows that under shape restrictions, L(g) is contained in an interval whose bounds can be obtained by solving linear programming problems. Inference about L(g) can be carried out by using the bootstrap. An empirical application illustrates the usefulness of the method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Despite increasing evidence that cannabis use is associated with adverse health effects, the knowledge on preventative strategies is still limited. This study stemmed from a systematic review of effective prevention in which school-based programmes were identified as promising. The primary objective was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of Project ALERT (Adolescent, Learning, Experiences, Resistance, and Training), compared with ordinary ATOD (Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drug) education, among Swedish students in the eighth grade of compulsory school. Methods The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the societal perspective with quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) as an outcome (willingness-to-pay threshold (sic)50,000) and follow-up periods from 1 year to a lifetime, considering a discounting rate of 3 %, and with costs inflated to 2013 levels. A Markov model was constructed on the basis of the 'states' of single use, regular use, daily use and use of other illicit drugs, which were associated with 'complications' of psychosis, schizophrenia, traffic accidents, depression and amotivational syndrome. Health and cost consequences were linked to both states and complications. Results The programme was cost saving on the basis of evidence from the USA (ratio 1:1.1), and was cost effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (sic)22,384 per QALY) after reasonable adjustment for the Swedish context and with 20 years of follow-up. When the target group was restricted to boys who were neither studying nor working/doing work experience, the programme was cost effective after 9 years and cost saving (ratio 1:3.2) after 20 years. Conclusion School-based prevention such as Project ALERT has the potential to be cost effective and to be cost saving if implemented in deprived areas. In the light of the shifting landscape regarding legalization of cannabis, it seems rational to continue the health economic analysis of prevention initiated here.","[Deogan, Charlotte; Skarstrand, Eva; Manrique-Garcia, Edison; Mansdotter, Anna] Karolinska Inst, Publ Hlth Sci, S-17777 Stockholm, Sweden; [Zarabi, Natalie] Dent & Pharmaceut Benefits Agcy, Stockholm, Sweden; [Stenstrom, Nils] Natl Board Hlth & Welf, Stockholm, Sweden; [Hogberg, Pi] Publ Hlth Agcy Sweden, Stockholm, Sweden; [Neovius, Kristian] Aux Anal AB, Stockholm, Sweden",Karolinska Institutet; National Board of Health & Welfare; Public Health Agency of Sweden,"Månsdotter, A (通讯作者)，Karolinska Inst, Publ Hlth Sci, S-17777 Stockholm, Sweden.",anna.mansdotter@ki.se,"manrique, edison/Q-2070-2015; Stenström, Nils/AAJ-5055-2021; manrique, edison/Q-2066-2015","manrique, edison/0000-0003-4810-3394",Public Health Agency of Sweden,Public Health Agency of Sweden,This study was initiated and funded by the Public Health Agency of Sweden.

It turns out that several axiomatizations of the Shapley value on the class of all TU-games do not characterize this solution on the class of assignment games. However, when considering an assignment game as a (communication) graph game where the game is simply the assignment game and the graph is a corresponding bipartite graph where buyers (sellers) are connected with sellers (buyers) only, we show that Myerson's component efficiency and fairness axioms do characterize the Shapley value on the class of assignment games. Moreover, these two axioms have a natural interpretation for assignment games. Component efficiency yields submarket efficiency stating that the sum of the payoffs of all players in a submarket equals the worth of that submarket, where a submarket is a set of buyers and sellers such that all buyers in this set have zero valuation for the goods offered by the sellers outside the set, and all buyers outside the set have zero valuations for the goods offered by sellers inside the set. Fairness of the graph game solution boils down to valuation fairness stating that only changing the valuation of one particular buyer for the good offered by a particular seller changes the payoffs of this buyer and seller by the same amount.

The key methodological contribution is that price response heterogeneity is identified while controlling for censoring of consumption at zero and endogeneity of expenditure by using a finite mixture instrumental variable Tobit model. The SSB price elasticity estimates show a decreasing trend across increasing consumption quantiles, from -2.3 at the median to -0.2 at the 95th quantile. Although high consumers of SSBs have a less elastic demand for SSBs, their very high consumption levels imply that a tax would achieve higher reduction in consumption and higher health gains. Our results also suggest that an SSB tax would represent a small fiscal burden for consumers whatever their pre-policy level of consumption, and that an excise tax should be preferred to an ad valorem tax.

In 1978, states with Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) programs were required to start providing wage replacement benefits to pregnant women, substantially increasing access to antenatal and postnatal paid leave for working mothers. Using natality data, I find that TDI paid maternity leave reduces the share of low birth weight births by 3.2 percent, and the estimated treatment-on-the-treated effect is over 10 percent. It also decreases the likelihood of early term birth by 6.6 percent. Paid maternity leave has particularly large impacts on the children of unmarried and black mothers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review and examine the quality of contemporary economic evaluations in the diagnosis and management of TBI. Methods: Two reviewers independently searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Health Technology Assessment Database, EconLit, and the Tufts CEA Registry for comparative economic evaluations published from 2000 onward (last updated on August 30, 2013). Data on methods, results, and quality were abstracted in duplicate. The results were summarized quantitatively and qualitatively. Results: Of 3539 citations, 24 economic evaluations met our inclusion criteria. Nine were cost-utility, five were cost-effectiveness, three were cost-minimization, and seven were cost-consequences analyses. Only six studies were of high quality. Current evidence from high-quality studies suggests the economic attractiveness of the following strategies: a low medical threshold for computed tomography (CT) scanning of asymptomatic infants with possible inflicted TB], selective CT scanning of adults with mild TBI as per the Canadian CT Head Rule, management of severe TBI according to the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines, management of FBI in dedicated neurocritical care units, and early transfer of patients with TBI with nonsurgical lesions to neuroscience centers. Conclusions: Threshold -guided CT scanning, adherence to Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines, and care for patients with TBI, including those with nonsurgical lesions, in specialized settings appear to be economically attractive strategies.

Both physicians and patients are heterogeneous. Physicians choose both the number of patients and the quality of care to provide to their patients. When determining physician payment rates, the principal must ensure access to care for all patients. When physicians can adjust the number of patients seen, there is no incentive to over-treat. In contrast, altruistic physicians always quality stint: they prefer to add an additional patient, rather than to increase the quality of service provided. A mixed payment mechanism does not increase the quality of service provided with respect to capitation. Offering a menu of compensation schemes may constitute a cost-effective strategy for inducing physicians to choose a given overall caseload but may also generate difficulties with access to care for frail patients.

The NSAID class of products has a somewhat controversial history, around which a complex regulatory and informational environment has developed. This history includes a boxed warning mandated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for all NSAIDs in 2005. We investigate the impact that various information shocks have had on the use of prescription medications for pain in primary care in the USA. We accomplish this by extracting data on nearly 600000 patients from a unique nationwide electronic medical record database and estimate the probability of any active prescription for the four types of pain medications as a function of FDA actions, advertising, media coverage, and patient characteristics. We find that even after accounting for multiple sources of information, the FDA label changes and boxed warnings had a significant effect on pain medication prescribing. The boxed warning did not have the same impact on the use of all NSAID inhibitors. We find that the boxed warning reduced the use of NSAID COX-2 inhibitor use, which was the focus of much of the press attention. In contrast, however, the warning actually increased the use of non-COX-2 NSAID inhibitors. Thus, the efficacy of the FDA's black box warning is clearly mixed.

Moreover, clinics that were prescribing relatively fewer antibiotics than other local clinics before the disclosure requirement were more likely to increase their prescription rate.

Methods: The national pharmacy database was used to select patients using venlafaxine for at least 6 months. Switchers and nonswitchers were identified, and switch behavior was compared for a 12 month follow-up period. Change in health service use following switching was also compared between switchers and nonswitchers including use of the emergency department, hospital, and specialist outpatient services over the same period. Results: Approximately 12% of all originator brand users switched to generic venlafaxine, at least half of whom continued to use the generic throughout the follow-up period to August 1, 2012. Almost 60% of new users of the generic venlafaxine, however, switched to using the originator brand. Aside from a slight reduction in the use of outpatient services among switchers, there were no significant differences in health services use between switchers and nonswitchers for either existing or new venlafaxine users. Conclusions: Although both products remain fully subsidized and available, there is little incentive for presoibers, pharmacists, or patients to switch to the less expensive generic brand. If savings to the national New Zealand budget are to be realized, additional policy measures should be implemented to minimize incentives for multiple and reverse switching, and prescribers, as key opinion leaders, could take the lead in promoting generics to their patients.

Methods: Health Survey for England data sets for 2010, 2011, and 2012 were pooled (n = 35,062) and used to model health-related quality of life as a function of sex, age, and socioeconomic status (SES). Office for National Statistics mortality rates were used to construct life tables for age-sex-SES groups. These quality-of-life and length-of-life estimates were then combined to predict QALE as a function of these characteristics. Missing data were imputed, and Monte-Carlo simulation was used to estimate standard errors. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore alternative regression models and measures of SES. Results: Socioeconomic inequality in QALE at birth was estimated at 11.87 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), with a sex difference of 1 QALY. When the socioeconomic-sex subgroups are ranked by QALE, a differential of 10.97 QALYs is found between the most and least healthy quintile groups. This differential can be broken down into a life expectancy difference of 7.28 years and a quality-of-life adjustment of 3.69 years. Conclusions: The methods proposed in this article refine simple binary quality-adjustment measures such as the widely used disability free life expectancy, providing a more accurate picture of overall health inequality in society than has hitherto been available. The predictions also lend themselves well to the task of evaluating the health inequality impact of interventions in the context of cost-effectiveness analysis.

Our approach uses linear regression to reduce the dimension of the numerical optimization problem yet it produces the same estimator as maximizing the likelihood. It improves the numerical behavior of estimation by eliminating parameters from the objective function that cause problems for conventional methods. We find that spanned models capture the cross-section of yields well but not volatility while unspanned models fit volatility at the expense of fitting the cross-section. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Medical devices, including diagnostic products, are a rapidly growing market in healthcare, with over 10,000 medical technology patent applications filed in Europe in 2012-nearly double the number filed for pharmaceuticals. This increase in the market place, in combination with the limited, or constricting, budgets that healthcare decision makers face, has led to a greater level of examination with respect to the economic evaluation of medical devices. However, methodological questions that arise due to the unique characteristics of medical devices have yet to be addressed fully. This review of journal publications and HTA guidance identified these characteristics and the challenges they may subsequently pose from an economic evaluation perspective. These unique features of devices can be grouped into four categories: (1) data quality issues; (2) learning curve; (3) measuring long-term outcomes from diagnostic devices; and (4) wider impact from organisational change. We review the current evaluation toolbox available to researchers and explore potential future approaches to improve the economic evaluation of medical devices.","[Craig, Joyce A.; Carr, Louise; Glanville, Julie] Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, York YO10 5NH, N Yorkshire, England; [Hutton, John] Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Iglesias, Cynthia P.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Sims, Andrew J.] Newcastle Upon Tyne Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Clin Measurement & Engn Unit, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK; University of York - UK; Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,"Craig, JA (通讯作者)，Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Level 2 Market Sq,Vanbrugh Way, York YO10 5NH, N Yorkshire, England.",joyce.craig@york.ac.uk,"Sims, Andrew/AAT-8027-2021; Glanville, Julie/ADR-6508-2022","Sims, Andrew/0000-0002-9553-7278; Glanville, Julie/0000-0002-1253-8524",Medical Research Council [G0501892] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0501892] Funding Source: UKRI,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,89,22,24,0,23,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Simplifying drug regimens (e.g., via a fixed-dose combination) has been shown to improve real-world outcomes by reducing pill burden and treatment regimen complexity, improving adherence, and reducing healthcare resource use and associated costs; however, no studies assessing such outcomes have been conducted to date for the acute treatment of migraine. Objective To assess migraine-related healthcare resource use and associated costs for subjects prescribed S/NS vs. subjects prescribed single-entity oral triptans (SOTs) within a managed care population in the USA. Methods In this retrospective analysis of administrative claims data from July 1, 2008 to December 31, 2009 (IMS LifeLink), subjects meeting the following criteria were selected: one or more pharmacy claim(s) for either S/NS or SOT (index date), aged 18-64 years; at least one migraine diagnosis, and continuous enrollment in the 6 months prior to and post the index date. The study population was subsequently stratified for two analyses: triptan-naive (triptan naive in the 6-month period prior to the index date) and triptan-switch (triptan user in the 6-month period prior to the index date and switching to another triptan). Subjects prescribed S/NS were propensity-score matched with subjects prescribed SOT (triptan-naive analysis: 1: 3; triptan-switch analysis: 1:1) to assess differences in healthcare resource use and associated costs (2009 US$) between the S/NS and SOT groups. Results Results from the triptan-naive and triptan-switch analyses suggest that subjects prescribed S/NS are likely to have similar healthcare resource use patterns as those either newly initiated on an SOT or switching SOTs, as measured by migraine medication use, migraine-related healthcare resource use, and all-cause healthcare resource use. One exception was the observed increased use of opioids in the SOT group compared with the S/NS group (change in mean number of tablets pre-index vs. post-index, S/NS vs. SOT; triptan-naive analysis: 8.6 vs. 18.3, p = 0.045; triptan-switch analysis: -8.2 vs. 17.7; p = 0.120). Total costs from the triptan-naive analysis indicated that the S/NS group had lower migraine-related (US$ 744 vs. US$820; p = 0.067) and all-cause healthcare costs (US$4,391 vs. US$4,870; p = 0.040) when compared with the SOT group, driven by savings in medical costs (migraine-related: US$252 vs. US$380; p = 0.001; all-cause: US$3,023 vs. US$3,599; p = 0.014). However, no significant differences were observed for total costs from the triptan-switch analysis (migraine-related healthcare costs, S/NS vs. SOT: US$1,159 vs. US$1,117; p = 0.929; all-cause healthcare costs: US$5,128 vs. US$4,788; p = 0.381). Conclusion Study results suggest similar healthcare resource use patterns and associated costs when comparing S/NS and SOT across a triptan-naive and triptan-experienced population. While the current study focuses on direct medical costs, future studies should extend beyond such a perspective to explore functional status, productivity, and health-related quality of life and satisfaction, attributes not captured in administrative claims data, but nonetheless important treatment goals.","[Runken, M.

As a consequence, there is quite understandable pressure to take account of other attributes of benefit and to fund technologies, even when the opportunity costs are likely exceed the benefits they offer. Recent evidence suggests that NICE technology appraisal is already approving drugs where more health is likely to be lost than gained. Also, NICE recently proposed increasing the upper bound of the cost-effectiveness threshold to reflect other attributes of benefit but without a proper assessment of the type of benefits that are expected to be displaced. It appears that NICE has taken a direction of travel, which means that more harm than good is being, and will continue to be, done, but it is unidentified NHS patients who bear the real opportunity costs.

The amount of biomass of catch crops is traditionally evaluated by destructive sampling that are labour and time consuming and may not represent the whole monitored area. Within the period of 2013-2014, the aboveground biomass of catch crops was evaluated using ground measurements of vegetation index NDVI and the results were compared with traditionally carried sampling of plant matter. The study took place on a small-plot field trial established in 2006 at the experimental field station in Zabcice (South Moravia, Czech Republic). The experiment included nine kinds of catch crops. Catch crops growths were set up after every harvest of winter wheat (in mid-August). The experiment included control variant without catch crop sowing. Regression analysis for both years of monitoring showed positive dependence between the amount of vegetable matter (fresh and dry matter) and vegetation index NDVI. The accuracy of the measurement depends on the state of growths, particularly with regard to the lower sensitivity of the NDVI when a certain degree of leaf area index is reached. Despite these shortcomings, the spectral measurement is a good alternative to traditional methods, mainly due to rapid and simple measurement and its easy repeatability without damaging the crop.","[Handlirova, Martina; Lukas, Vojtech; Prochazkova, Blanka; Smutny, Vladimir] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Handlirova, H (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrosyst & Bioclimatol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",martina.handlirova@mendelu.cz,"Lukas, Vojtech/G-1573-2010; Smutný, Vladimír/I-6219-2018; Dočkalíková, Martina/AAN-9240-2021; Procházková, Blanka/AAI-9097-2021","Lukas, Vojtech/0000-0001-8051-3305; Smutný, Vladimír/0000-0002-9626-7417; Dočkalíková, Martina/0000-0002-4464-9640; Procházková, Blanka/0000-0001-6935-5596",,,,,14,0,0,0,5,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,34,37,,,,,,4,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100004,0

Therefore, controlling the income gap is conducive to economic growth and in turn conducive to narrowing the income gap, in this way the goal that equality and growth develop coordinately may be achieved.(2) the income distribution inequality leads to educational inequality, but the lessening of educational inequality has not promoted the narrowing of the gap in income distribution, a virtuous circle between educational equality and income distribution equality, has not formed spontaneously. To make education, economic growth, income distribution into an endogenous nice track, a series of reforms, policies and measures are needed, to solve such kind of problems as unreasonable labor market structure, urban and rural variations in returns to schooling and unreasonable education investment structure.","[Long Cui-hong] East China Normal Univ, Sch Business, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China",East China Normal University,"Long, CH (通讯作者)，East China Normal Univ, Sch Business, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,32,0,0,1,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,1771,1778,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600235,0

Hence, how to choose a good doctor is difficult for them. In traditional way, patients could base on doctors' ranking (title) in hospital to determine their qualities. With the growth of information technologies, the online doctor rating becomes a new channel for patients to obtain information about doctors' service. Online doctor rating will reduce information asymmetry and establish trust relationship between patients and doctors. This paper uses a laboratory experiment with eye-tracking machine to explore the effects and strength of two types of information on patients' choice. The results of experiment prove that the offline ranking and the number of online ratings positively affect patients' choice of consulting a doctor, as well as online ratings having a stronger impact on patients' choice than offline doctor ranking. The findings of this paper prove the value of information technologies on healthcare, as well as contributing to online health research.","[Yang Hua-long; Ju Xiao-feng] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Yang, HL (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,13,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,62,67,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600009,0

This may reflect a lack of understanding of how the spillover effect of illness can be appropriately quantified. In this study we used three different approaches to quantify health spillovers resulting from meningitis. We conducted a survey of 1218 family networks affected by meningitis and used regression modelling to estimate spillover effects. The findings show that meningitis had long-term effects on family members' health, particularly affecting the likelihood of family members reporting anxiety and depression. These effects extended beyond a single close family member. These findings suggest that vaccinating against meningitis will bring significant health benefits not just to those that might have contracted the illness but also to their family networks. In methodological terms, different approaches for quantifying health spillovers provided broadly consistent results. The choice of method will be influenced by the ease of collecting primary data from family members in intervention contexts. (c) 2015 The Authors.

This paper provides the first nationally representative estimate of the medical cost attributable to obesity and overweight in China. We improve upon the traditional estimation methodology (two-part model) by jointly adopting the instrumental variable approach and the panel data methods in order to correct for the potential endogeneity of body size and the individual heterogeneity in medical expenditure. Using longitudinal data from 20002009 China Health and Nutrition Surveys, we find that body size has a significant impact on the individual expected medical expenditure and the per capita medical cost attributable to obesity and overweight in a single medical event is estimated to he 6.18 Yuan, or 5.29% of the total personal medical expenditure. This translates to 24.35 billion Yuan annual cost on the national scale, accounting for 2.46% of China's national health care expenditure. The subsample analyses also show that such cost is higher for the urban, women, and better educated people and increases over time. Our results contribute to the literature on the economic impact of obesity in developing countries and bear policy implications on controlling the rising health care costs in China.

Objectives: We aim to outline the key principles of what assessments are needed to inform only in research (OIR) or approval with research (AWR) recommendations, in addition to approval or rejection. Methods: We developed a comprehensive algorithm to inform the sequence of assessments and judgments that lead to different types of guidance: OIR, AWR, Approve, or Reject. This algorithm identifies the order in which assessments might be made, how similar guidance might be arrived at through different combinations of considerations, and when guidance might change. Results: The key principles are whether the technology is expected to be cost-effective; whether the technology has significant irrecoverable costs; whether additional research is needed; whether research is possible with approval and whether there are opportunity costs that once committed by approval cannot be recovered; and whether there are effective price reductions. Determining expected cost-effectiveness is only a first step. In addition to AWR for technologies expected to be cost-effective and OIR for those not expected to be cost-effective, there are other important circumstances when OIR should be considered. Conclusions: These principles demonstrate that cost-effectiveness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for approval. Even when research is possible with approval, OIR may be appropriate when a technology is expected to be cost-effective due to significant irrecoverable costs.","[Claxton, Karl; Palmer, Stephen; Bojke, Laura; Griffin, Susan; Soares, Marta; Spackman, Eldon; Rothery, Claire] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Claxton, Karl] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Longworth, Louise] Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, London, England",University of York - UK; University of York - UK; Brunel University,"Rothery, C (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",claire.rothery@york.ac.uk,"Griffin, Susan/AAE-8970-2020; Soares, Marta/HJH-3434-2023; Rothery, Claire/IAQ-0546-2023","Griffin, Susan/0000-0003-2188-8400; Soares, Marta Ferreira Oliveira/0000-0003-1579-8513; Longworth, Louise/0000-0003-2512-4862","Medical Research Council; National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (NIHR HTA) program [06/90/99]; MRC [G0802659, MC_U145079308] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MC_U145079308, G0802659] Funding Source: researchfish",Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (NIHR HTA) program; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),This article is based on research funded by the Medical Research Council and the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (NIHR HTA) program (project no. 06/90/99) and will be published in full in the HTA series.

In their long-run savings decisions individuals take into account a cost of self-control, which depends on the consumption temptations of their impatient short-run self. I obtain a closed-form solution for consumption and show that within a certain range of self-control an investment subsidy can be useful in order to reduce consumption and to increase investment, growth, and welfare of the long-run self. A consumption tax, perhaps surprisingly, is found to be counterproductive. It induces individuals with limited self-control to consume even more. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A Markov cohort model in which patients were administered a sequence of treatments was used to predict long-term outcomes associated with each treatment. The model was informed by data from the eltrombopag clinical trial program and the available literature. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service, and a lifetime time horizon was used. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Eltrombopag dominated romiplostim (i.e., eltrombopag was as effective as but less costly than romiplostim) in both splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients, assuming a class effect for the two treatments. Eltrombopag also dominated romiplostim in most deterministic sensitivity analyses with the exception of when indirect efficacy estimates were incorporated into the model. In this analysis, eltrombopag no longer dominated romiplostim but remained cost-effective versus romiplostim at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that there was a 99% and 92% chance of eltrombopag being cost-effective at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year in splenectomized and nonsplenectomized patients, respectively. Conclusions: Results of this study demonstrate that eltrombopag is cost-effective when compared with romiplostim to be used in the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia, representing good value for the UK National Health Service.","[Allen, Rachel] GlaxoSmithKline, Stockley Pk West, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Bryden, Peter] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Grotzinger, Kelly M.] GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA USA; [Stapelkamp, Ceilidh] Novartis, London, England; [Woods, Bethan] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England",GlaxoSmithKline; University of Bristol; GlaxoSmithKline; Novartis; University of York - UK,"Grotzinger, KM (通讯作者)，GlaxoSmithKline, POB 643, Mt Joy, PA 17552 USA.",kmgrotzinger@embarqmail.com,,"Woods, Bethan Sarah/0000-0002-7669-9415; Stapelkamp, Ceilidh/0000-0002-2707-3790","GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA","GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA(GlaxoSmithKline)","This study was funded by GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.",,33,12,12,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2016,19.0,5.0,,,,,614,622,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.03.1856,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DU5MA,27565278.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382254600015,0

The technique is based on recentered influence function regression and requires only the application of OLS to a transformed variable with similar interpretation. Our method requires few identifying assumptions to yield valid estimates in most common empirical applications, unlike current methods favoured in the literature. Using the Swedish Twin Registry and a within twin pair fixed effects identification strategy, our new method finds no evidence of a causal effect of education on income-related health inequality.

Financing is found to have increased amniocentesis testing by about 35%. At ages above the eligibility threshold, utilization rates rose to roughly 33%, reflection nearly full takeup among prospective users of amniocentesis. Additionally, whereas below the age-35 threshold amniocentesis utilization rates increase with maternal age, this relation is muted above this age. Finally, no evidence is found that financing affects outcomes such as pregnancy terminations and births of children with Down syndrome. These results support the view that women above the eligibility threshold tend to refrain from acquiring inexpensive information about their degree of risk that absent the financing they would acquire, and instead, undergo the accurate and costly test regardless of additional information that noninvasive screening would provide.

MCS therapy, however, is resource intensive. Objective: The purpose of this report was to systematically review the MCS cost-effectiveness literature as it pertains to the treatment of adult patients in end-stage heart failure. Methods: We conducted a systematic search and narrative review of available cost- effectiveness and cost-utility analyses of MCS in adult patients with end-stage heart failure. Results: Eleven studies analyzing the cost-effectiveness or cost utility of MCS were identified. Seven studies focused on bridge to transplantation, three studies focused on destination therapy, and one study presented analyses of both strategies. Two articles evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp., Pleasanton, CA). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between MCS and medical management ranged between $85,025 and $200,166 for bridge to transplantation and between $87,622 and $1,257,946 for destination therapy (2012 Canadian dollars per quality-adjusted life year). Sensitivity analyses indicated that improvements in survival and quality of life and reductions in device and initial hospital-stay costs may improve the cost-effectiveness of MCS. Conclusions: Current studies suggest that MCS is likely not cost-effective with reference to generally accepted or explicitly stated thresholds. Refined patient selection, complication rates, achieved quality of life, and device/surgical costs, however, could modify the cost-effectiveness of MCS.","[Nunes, Abraham J.; MacArthur, Roderick G.

The reporting of VOI measures, particularly the expected value of perfect parameter information (EVPPI) and the expected value of sample information (EVSI), is limited because of the computational burden associated with typical two-level Monte Carlo-based solution. Recently, a nonparametric regression approach was proposed that allows the estimation of multiparameter EVPPI and EVSI directly from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis sample. Objectives: To demonstrate the value of the nonparametric regression approach in calculating VOI measures in real-world cases and to compare its performance with the standard approach of the Monte-Carlo simulation. Methods: We used the regression approach to calculate EVPPI and EVSI in two models, and compared the results with the estimates obtained via the standard Monte-Carlo simulation. Results: The VOI values from the two approaches were very close; computation using the regression method, however, was faster. Conclusion: The non parametric regression approach provides an efficient and easy-to-implement alternative for EVPPI and EVSI calculation in economic models.","[Tuffaha, Haitham W.; Gordon, Louisa G.; Scuffham, Paul A.] Griffith Univ, Menzies Hlth Inst Queensland, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Tuffaha, Haitham W.; Gordon, Louisa G.; Scuffham, Paul A.] Griffith Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia; [Strong, Mark] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Menzies Health Institute Queensland; Griffith University; Griffith University - Logan Campus; University of Sheffield,"Tuffaha, HW (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia.",haitham.tuffaha@griffith.edu.au,"Tuffaha, Haitham W/P-2676-2016; Scuffham, Paul/AAS-8084-2021; Strong, Mark/A-4638-2010; Gordon, Louisa/P-1427-2016","Tuffaha, Haitham W/0000-0003-2993-3480; Scuffham, Paul/0000-0001-5931-642X; Strong, Mark/0000-0003-1486-8233; Gordon, Louisa/0000-0002-3159-4249","UK National Institute for Health Research [PDF-2012-05-258]; National Health and Medical Research Council PhD scholarship through the Centre for Research Excellence in Nursing Interventions for Hospitalised Patients; National Institute for Health Research fellowship; Medical Research Council [G0601721, MR/J000434/1] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [PDF-2012-05-258] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [MR/J000434/1, G0601721] Funding Source: UKRI; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [PDF-2012-05-258] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)",UK National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Health and Medical Research Council PhD scholarship through the Centre for Research Excellence in Nursing Interventions for Hospitalised Patients; National Institute for Health Research fellowship(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This report is an independent research supported by the UK National Institute for Health Research (postdoctoral fellowship, PDF-2012-05-258).

We show that taking advantage of mixed frequency data allows us to better recover causal relationships when compared to the conventional common low frequency approach. We also show that the new causality tests have higher local asymptotic power as well as more power in finite samples compared to conventional tests. In an empirical application involving U.S. macroeconomic indicators, we show that the mixed frequency approach and the low frequency approach produce very different causal implications, with the former yielding more intuitively appealing result.

I show that the spirit of capitalism reduces the precautionary saving demand, while regime switching increases the precautionary saving demand. With the spirit of capitalism and regime switching, the excess sensitivity puzzle can be resolved to some extent. Unlike Luo et al. (2009), I show that the spirit of capitalism can interpret the excess smoothness puzzle when labor income follows a unit root process or an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process which is widely used in the literature of consumption and saving. I find that regime switching would worsen the excess smoothness puzzle under complete information, while the excess smoothness puzzle can be resolved by regime switching under incomplete information. Finally, I discuss the effects of the spirit of capitalism and regime switching on the welfare gain of information. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The independence conditions are used to derive first-stage nonseparable reduced form functions. Once constructed, these reduced form functions are employed to express the derivatives of nonseparable structural functions in terms of the derivatives of the reduced form functions. For models with simultaneity, we obtain the new results by combining the independence assumptions together with parametric specifications and exclusion restrictions. For models with triangularity, we allow all functions to be nonparametric and nonseparable in unobservable random terms. For the latter, we provide several equivalence results and discuss some of the trade-offs between observable and unobservable instruments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from the Avahan Programme in India,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,HIV prevention; average cost; scale-up; Avahan; NGO; India,,"Expanding essential health services through non-government organisations (NGOs) is a central strategy for achieving universal health coverage in many low-income and middle-income countries. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention services for key populations are commonly delivered through NGOs and have been demonstrated to be cost-effective and of substantial global public health importance. However, funding for HIV prevention remains scarce, and there are growing calls internationally to improve the efficiency of HIV prevention programmes as a key strategy to reach global HIV targets. To date, there is limited evidence on the determinants of costs of HIV prevention delivered through NGOs; and thus, policymakers have little guidance in how best to design programmes that are both effective and efficient. We collected economic costs from the Indian Avahan initiative, the largest HIV prevention project conducted globally, during the first 4years of its implementation. We use a fixed-effect panel estimator and a random-intercept model to investigate the determinants of average cost. We find that programme design choices such as NGO scale, the extent of community involvement, the way in which support is offered to NGOs and how clinical services are organised substantially impact average cost in a grant-based payment setting.

However, many diagnostic biomarkers struggle to gain market access and obtain appropriate coverage because of a lack of evidence on their health economic impact. Objectives The aim was to review the (methodological) characteristics of recent economic evaluations on diagnostic biomarkers and examine whether these studies dealt with specific issues such as different payer perspectives, preference heterogeneity, and multiple applications in subpopulations. Methods The PubMed database and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database were searched. Full economic evaluations published after 2009 assessing diagnostic biomarkers for the main non-communicable diseases in middle-income or high-income countries were considered eligible. Empirical and methodological study characteristics were summarized, as was the handling of specific issues related to the economic evaluation of personalized medicine. Results Thirty-three economic evaluations were included, of which 25 were model-based analyses. The number of strategies compared ranged from two to 17 per study, and was especially large in studies assessing genetic testing in patients and their relatives. Cost-effectiveness results were most sensitive to test accuracy and costs of the biomarker (N = 7), the relative risk of an event (N = 4), and the proportion of people accepting genetic testing (N = 2). One study incorporated patient preferences, and none of the studies considered different payer perspectives, cost sharing arrangements or variable opportunity costs due to population density variability. Conclusions Published health economic evaluations of biomarkers used for diagnosing, staging diseases, and guiding treatment selection are characterized by a large number of comparators to model the potential clinical applications and to determine their value. Assessing outcomes beyond health as well as specific issues, such as different payer perspectives and patient preferences, is crucial to fully capture the potential health economic impact of diagnostic biomarkers and to inform value-based reimbursement.","[Oosterhoff, Marije; van der Maas, Marloes E.; Steuten, Lotte M.

The attractiveness of using prices of other countries as a benchmark for decisions within a national price control is obvious. Alternative models for price and reimbursement decision making such as value-based pricing (VBP), i.e. cost-effectiveness analyses, are more complicated. However, IRP provides incentives for stakeholders to take action not in line with optimal (welfare-maximizing) pricing. IRP is costly for two reasons. First, manufacturers are incentivised to limit or delay access to new innovative treatments in countries with small markets and/or a low income, which can be costly in terms of loss of health. Second, all countries also experience a loss of welfare (health) because IRP reduces the opportunities for differential pricing (Ramsey pricing), i.e. using the fact that the ability and willingness to pay differs between countries. Thus, IRP results in less sales revenue to finance research and development of new innovative drugs. We can now observe that payers and manufacturers are engaged in different types of risk-sharing schemes, price-volume negotiations, payback arrangements, confidential discounts, coverage with evidence developments, etc., all with the purpose of returning to the old model of price discrimination and Ramsey pricing. Shortly, real prices for use in IRP systems will cease to exist and, thus, we expect to soon see the end of IRP, a new system for price discrimination and an increasing demand for VBP.","[Persson, Ulf] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ IHE, Box 2127, SE-22002 Lund, Sweden; [Persson, Ulf] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Lund, Sweden; [Jonsson, Bengt] Stockholm Sch Econ, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",Lund University; Stockholm School of Economics,"Persson, U (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Lund, Sweden.",ulf.persson@ihe.se,,,,,,,19,29,31,0,20,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

However, most economic evaluations do not include all medical costs that may result from this additional demand in health care and include only future costs of related illnesses. Although there has been much debate regarding the question to which extent future costs should be included from a societal perspective, the appropriate role of future medical costs in the widely adopted but more narrow healthcare perspective has been neglected. Using a theoretical model, we demonstrate that optimal decision rules for cost-effectiveness analyses assuming fixed healthcare budgets dictate that future costs of both related and unrelated medical care should be included. Practical relevance of including the costs of future unrelated medical care is illustrated using the example of transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Our findings suggest that guidelines should prescribe inclusion of these costs.

As consequence, climatic variations are producing a mismatch between technological and phenolic maturity and are affecting the microbiota's ecology, biodiversity and their metabolism in vineyard, grape, must and wine. However, there are natural resources that can help to mitigate the effects of global warming. It has been noticed that grapes from female plants of wild vines (Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris) have very appropriate characteristics to face up this problem: later maturing, high acidity, high polyphenol content,... A molecular study of 819 strains isolated at the end of spontaneous fermentations of grapes of Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris grapevines from 30 locations in northern of Spain revealed 8 different genera and 18 different species. 71,5% of the yeasts were classified as non-Saccharomyces and 28,5% were identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This latter specie was characterized at strain level, classifying 30 different groups, 6 of which as the majority from 2 up to 4 different locations. These findings demonstrate a wide diversity of yeast microbiota in wild grapes that will allow a yeast selection for the wine industry in a scenario of climate change.","[Puig-Pujol, Anna; Ferrando, Nuria; Capdevila, Fina] Inst Agrifood Res & Technol, Catalonian Inst Vine & Wine IRTA INCAVI, Dept Enol Res, Pl Agora 2, Barcelona 08720, Spain; [Ocete, Rafael] Univ Seville, Fac Biol, Avda Reina Mercedes S-N, E-41012 Seville, Spain; [Revilla, Eugenio] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Agr Chem & Food Sci, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",IRTA; University of Sevilla; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Ferrando, N (通讯作者)，Inst Agrifood Res & Technol, Catalonian Inst Vine & Wine IRTA INCAVI, Dept Enol Res, Pl Agora 2, Barcelona 08720, Spain.",,"Capdevila, Fina/HKO-7508-2023; Puig-Pujol, Anna/AAW-7273-2020",,,,,,30,3,3,0,14,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,2026.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160702026,0.0,,,5,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700070,0

For each treatment were made four replications in the field, with 07 plants each. The physicochemical analyses in must and wine as pH, total soluble solids (TSS), expressed acidity malic acid, expressed as acid into lactic acid, total acid and ethanol were made by infrared spectrometry Fourier transform (FTIR). There were significant differences between treatments in physical and chemical composition of must and wine. These preliminary results suggest that ethylene pre-harvest application modify somehow the malic acid content, modifying the total acidity and pH of the must and wine in Cabernet Sauvignon, promoting a slight modification in the TSS and thus in ethanol.","[Silveira, Jansen Moreira; Fernandes, Elizeu Nogueira; Hamm, Bruna Lais; Triches, Willian dos Santos; Eckhardt, Daniel Pazzini; del Aguila, Juan Saavedra] Fed Univ Pampa UNIPAMPA, Course Bachelors Degree Oenol, Dom Pedrito Campus,St Vinte & Abril 80, BR-96450000 Dom Pedrito, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Pampa,"del Aguila, JS (通讯作者)，Fed Univ Pampa UNIPAMPA, Course Bachelors Degree Oenol, Dom Pedrito Campus,St Vinte & Abril 80, BR-96450000 Dom Pedrito, RS, Brazil.",juanaguila@unipampa.edu,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1027.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701027,0.0,,,2,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700027,0

The results suggest health insurance factors into the decision to have WC pay for discretionary care. The implied instrumental variables estimates suggest a ten-percentage-point decrease in health insurance coverage increases WC bills by 15.3 percent. Despite the large impact of health insurance on the number of WC bills, the additional cost to WC at age 26 appears to be small as most of the increase comes from small bills. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

(2002) to the case where the errors are cross-sectionally heteroskedastic. This extension is not trivial due to the incidental parameters problem and its implications for estimation and inference. We approach the problem by working with a mis-specified homoskedastic model, and then show that the transformed maximum likelihood estimator continues to be consistent even in the presence of cross-sectional heteroskedasticity. We also obtain standard errors that are robust to cross-sectional heteroskedasticity of unknown form. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the finite sample behavior of the transformed maximum likelihood estimator and compare it with various GMM estimators proposed in the literature. Simulation results reveal that, in terms of median absolute errors and accuracy of inference, the transformed likelihood estimator outperforms the GMM estimators in almost all cases.

In total, we consider over 400 different estimators, using 11 years of data on 31 different financial assets spanning five asset classes. When 5-minute RV is taken as the benchmark, we find little evidence that it is outperformed by any other measures. When using inference methods that do not require specifying a benchmark, we find some evidence that more sophisticated measures outperform. Overall, we conclude that it is difficult to significantly beat 5-minute RV. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

By allowing the response variable and explanatory variables be jointly a nonstationary process, the proposed methods are widely applicable to nonstationary and dependent observations. We propose a local linear shrinkage method that can simultaneously achieve parameter estimation and variable selection. Its selection consistency and the favorable oracle property are established. Due to the fear of losing efficiency, an information criterion is further proposed for distinguishing between time-varying and time-constant components. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: An online survey including the CHU9D and the EQ-5D-Y, self-reported health status, and a series of sociodemographic questions was developed for administration to a community-based sample of adolescents (aged 11-17 years). Individual responses to both instruments were translated into utilities using scoring algorithms derived from the Australian adult general population. Results: A total of 2020 adolescents completed the online survey. The mean +/- SD utilities of the CHU9D and the EQ-5D-Y were very similar (0.82 +/- 0.13 and 0.83 +/- 0.19, respectively), and the intraclass correlation coefficient (0.80) suggested good levels of agreement. Both instruments were able to discriminate according to varying levels of self-reported health status (P < 0.001). Although exhibiting good levels of agreement overall, some wide divergences were apparent at an individual level. Conclusions: The study results are encouraging and illustrate the potential for both the CHU9D and the EQ-5D-Y to be more widely used for measuring and valuing the HRQOL of adolescent populations in Australia and internationally. Generating adolescent-specific scoring algorithms pertaining to each instrument and an empirical comparison of the resulting utilities is a natural next step. More evidence is required from the application of the CHU9D and the EQ-5D-Y in specific patient groups in adolescent health settings to inform the choice of instrument for measuring and valuing the HRQOL for the economic evaluation of adolescent health care treatments and services.","[Chen, Gang; Ratcliffe, Julie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Med, Repatriat Gen Hosp, Daw Pk, SA 5041, Australia; [Flynn, Terry] Uppsala Univ, Ctr Res Eth & Bioeth, Uppsala, Sweden; [Stevens, Katherine; Brazier, John] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Huynh, Elisabeth] Univ S Australia, Sch Business, Inst Choice, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Sawyer, Michael] Univ Adelaide, Discipline Paediat, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Roberts, Rachel] Univ Adelaide, Dept Psychol, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",Flinders University South Australia; Uppsala University; University of Sheffield; University of South Australia; University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide,"Chen, G (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Med, Repatriat Gen Hosp, A Block,Level 1,Daws Rd, Daw Pk, SA 5041, Australia.",Gang.Chen@flinders.edu.au,"Chen, Gang/G-4214-2011; brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Roberts, Rachel Margaret/AAE-5712-2020; Stevens, Katherine/E-4679-2010; Huynh, Elisabeth/M-5970-2015; Ratcliffe, Julie/G-3169-2017","Roberts, Rachel Margaret/0000-0002-9547-9995; Chen, Gang/0000-0002-8385-5965; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Stevens, Katherine/0000-0002-9018-6413; Huynh, Elisabeth/0000-0002-1855-3143; Ratcliffe, Julie/0000-0001-7365-1988",,,,,33,55,58,3,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2015,18.0,4.0,,,,,432,438,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.02.014,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CK6SQ,26091597.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356358600010,0

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) selected the geko (TM) device for evaluation, and invited the manufacturer, Firstkind Ltd, to submit clinical and economic evidence. King's Technology Evaluation Centre, an External Assessment Centre (EAC) commissioned by the NICE, independently assessed the evidence submitted. The sponsor submitted evidence related to the geko (TM) device and, in addition, included studies of other related devices as further clinical evidence to support a link between increased blood flow and VTE prophylaxis. The EAC assessed this evidence, conducted its own systematic review and concluded that there is currently limited direct evidence that geko (TM) prevents VTE. The sponsor's cost model is based on the assumption that patients with an underlying VTE risk and subsequently treated with geko (TM) will experience a reduction in their baseline risk. The EAC assessed this cost model but questioned the validity of some model assumptions. Using the EACs revised cost model, the cost savings for geko (TM) prophylaxis against a 'no prophylaxis' strategy were estimated as pound 197 per patient. Following a second public consultation, taking into account a change in the original draft recommendations, the NICE medical technologies guidance MTG19 was issued in June 2014. This recommended the adoption of the geko (TM) for use in people with a high risk of VTE and when other mechanical/pharmacological methods of prophylaxis are impractical or contraindicated in selected patients within the National Health Service in England.","[Summers, Jennifer A.; Clinch, James; Radhakrishnan, Muralikrishnan; Healy, Andy; McMillan, Viktoria; Morris, Elizabeth; Rua, Tiago; Lewis, Cornelius; Peacock, Janet L.; Keevil, Stephen F.] Kings Technol Evaluat Ctr, London, England; [Summers, Jennifer A.; Ofuya, Mercy; Wang, Yanzhong; Peacock, Janet L.] Kings Coll London, Div Hlth & Social Care Res, London SE1 3QD, England; [Summers, Jennifer A.; Peacock, Janet L.] Kings Coll London, Guys & St Thomas NHS Fdn Trust, NIHR Biomed Res Ctr, London SE1 3QD, England; [Clinch, James; Lewis, Cornelius] Kings Coll Hosp London, Med Engn & Phys, London, England; [Radhakrishnan, Muralikrishnan; Healy, Andy; Rua, Tiago] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, David Goldberg Ctr, Ctr Econ Mental & Phys Hlth, London SE1 3QD, England; [McMillan, Viktoria; Morris, Elizabeth; Keevil, Stephen F.] St Thomas Hosp, Kings Coll London, Dept Biomed Engn, Div Imaging Sci & Biomed Engn, London, England; [Dimmock, Paul W.] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, Med Technol Evaluat Programme, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Keevil, Stephen F.] Guys & St Thomas NHS Fdn Trust, St Thomas Hosp, Dept Med Phys, London, England",University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London; Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust; King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; King's College Hospital; University of London; King's College London; Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust; University of London; King's College London; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence; Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust,"Summers, JA (通讯作者)，Kings Technol Evaluat Ctr, London, England.",jennifer.a.summers@kcl.ac.uk,"Summers, Jennifer/JQW-6458-2023; Dimmock, Paul/KCK-8972-2024; Wang, Yanzhong/GRY-3114-2022","Summers, Jennifer/0000-0002-3156-0479; Rua, Tiago/0000-0002-2746-5663; Wang, Yanzhong/0000-0002-0768-1676; Ofuya, Mercy/0000-0002-4329-8615; Radhakrishnan Kartha, Muralikrishnan/0000-0003-4380-3471; Morris, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3774-4148; Peacock, Janet/0000-0002-0310-2518",,,,,75,14,16,1,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

In the Netherlands, rates of institutional LTC use are falling, whereas homecare use is growing. Are these changes attributable to declining disability rates, or has LTC use given disability changed? And have institutionalization rates fallen regardless of disability level, or has LTC use become better tailored to needs? We answer these questions by explaining trends in LTC use for the Dutch 65+ population in the period 2000-2008 using a nonlinear variant of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition. We find that changes in LTC use are not due to shifts in the disability distribution but can almost entirely be traced back to changes in the way the system treats disability. Elderly with mild disability are more likely to be treated at home than before, whereas severely disabled individuals continue to receive institutional LTC. As a result, LTC use has become better tailored to the needs for such care. This finding suggests that policies that promote LTC in the community rather than in institutions can effectively mitigate the consequences of population aging on LTC spending.

In this paper, we provide the first physician-level analysis of changes in healthcare provision to Medicare and privately insured patients across the business cycle. Using Florida discharge data aggregated to the physician level, we find that as county unemployment rates increase, physicians treat fewer privately insured patients in both inpatient and outpatient settings. In contrast, physicians who are more exposed to income losses during recessions provide more care to Medicare patients as the unemployment rate rises. Further analysis suggests that easing capacity constraints may contribute to this rise in Medicare volume; however, even in areas that are not capacity constrained, care provided to Medicare patients remains countercyclical among physicians with a large share of privately insured patients. This pattern is consistent with demand inducement in response to a negative income shock. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional motivations, such as altruism and exchange, are matched against more recent social bond theories. Our findings indicate that informal caregivers receive less frequent and less generous transfers than non-caregivers; that is, caregivers are more prone to suppress their self-interested motivations in order to prioritize the well being of another person. Additionally, long-term public care benefits increase both the probability of receiving a transfer and its amount, with this effect being more intense for both the poorest and richest households. Our findings suggest that if long-term care benefits are intended to increase the recipients' welfare and represent a higher fraction of total income for the poorest households, the effectiveness of these long-term care policies may be diluted.

A rate-optimal estimator of the entire quadratic covariation of an Ito-semimartingale is constructed by a locally adaptive spectral approach. Thresholding allows to disentangle the co-jump from the continuous part. We derive a feasible limit theorem for a truncated estimator of integrated covolatility which facilitates asymptotically efficient (co-)volatility estimation in the presence of jumps. A test for common jumps is presented. Simulations and an empirical application to intra-day tick-data from EUREX futures demonstrate the practical value of the approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We show that, for many statistics in spatial econometric models, the bootstrap can be studied based on linear quadratic (LQ) forms of disturbances. By proving the uniform convergence of the cumulative distribution function for LQ forms to that of a normal distribution, we show that the bootstrap is generally consistent for test statistics that can be approximated by LQ forms, including Moran's I. Possible asymptotic refinements of the bootstrap are most commonly studied using Edgeworth expansions. For spatial econometric models, we may establish asymptotic refinements of the bootstrap based on asymptotic expansions of LQ forms. When the disturbances are normal, we prove the existence of the usual Edgeworth expansions for LQ forms; when the disturbances are not normal, we establish an asymptotic expansion of LQ forms based on martingales. These results are applied to show the second order correctness of the bootstrap for Moran's I test. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the experiment, seeds were coated by manganese, copper, zinc, molybdenum and by combination of Mn-Zn-Cu. The same fertilizers were used as foliar nutrition. There was default fertilization with nitrogen for all variants. The control observation was microelements free. The results showed no statistically difference between control variant and seed coating or foliar nutrition in any category (value of N-tester, yield or grain quality).

In this paper, we propose a simple specification test of the null hypothesis that the individual effects are time-invariant against the alternative that they are time-varying. Our test is an application of Hausman (1978) testing procedure and can be used for any generalized linear model for panel data that admits a sufficient statistic for the individual effect. This is a wide class of models which includes the Gaussian linear model and a variety of nonlinear models typically employed for discrete or categorical outcomes. The basic idea of the test is to compare two alternative estimators of the model parameters based on two different formulations of the conditional maximum likelihood method. Our approach does not require assumptions on the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity, nor it requires the latter to be independent of the regressors in the model. We investigate the finite sample properties of the test through a set of Monte Carlo experiments. Our results show that the test performs well, with small size distortions and good power properties. We use a health economics example based on data from the Health and Retirement Study to illustrate the proposed test. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Recent findings showed that the organization's leadership and its philosophy significantly influences learning process. The main aim of the study is to examine the impact of specific types of leadership styles, employee oriented and task oriented, on organizational learning orientation and innovation performance. A hypothetical model relating leadership orientation, learning orientation and innovation performance was developed. The model was empirically tested by using a survey data from 432 senior and middle management members currently working in 127 textile and leather product manufacturing firms in Ethiopia. The structural equation modeling based analysis reveals that leadership style influences both learning and performance of an organization. Moreover, it shows the relationship between leadership and innovation performance is fully mediated by the learning orientation of the organizations.","[Beyene, Kinfe-tsegay; Shi Chun-sheng; Wu Wei-wei] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Beyene, KT (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",,"yang, zhou/KBB-6972-2024",,,,,,42,0,0,2,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,1942,1950,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600257,0

Methods: Seventy-five European medical assessors were assessed in a field study using the Domain Specific Risk Taking scale and the Big Five inventory scale. Assessors rated the risks and benefits for a mock clinical dossier specific to their area of expertise, and ordinal regression models were used to assess the odds of risk attitude or personality traits in predicting either the benefit or the risk ratings. Results: An increase in the conscientiousness score predicted an increase in the perception of the drug's benefit, and male assessors gave higher scores for the drug's benefit ratings than did female assessors. Extraverted assessors saw fewer risks, and assessors with a perceived neutral-averse or averse risk profile saw greater risks. Conclusions: Medical assessors perceive the benefits and risks of medicines via a complex interplay of the medical situation, their personality traits and even their gender. Further research in this area is needed to determine how these potential biases are managed within the regulatory setting.

The solutions for capacity allocation can be adding or removing workers and machines at every work stations. A hi-criteria objective function comprising tardiness penalty and fixed costs is used to evaluate each solution. A modified simulated annealing procedure coupled with a simulation model is used, and convergence is accelerated through a gradient-based heuristic based on bottleneck analysis. A case study in an assembly job-shop for refrigeration equipments is prodded to reveal the feasibility and validity of the new approach.","[Huang, Liang] Northeastern Univ, Sch Control Engn, Qinhuangdao, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xin] China Huanqiu Contracting & Engn Corp, Liaoning Branch, Fushun, Peoples R China",Northeastern University - China; China National Petroleum Corporation,"Huang, L (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Sch Control Engn, Qinhuangdao, Peoples R China.",n-xyz@163.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,7,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",,,978-94-6239-102-4; 978-94-6239-101-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,345,348,,10.2991/978-94-6239-102-4_71,0.0,,,4,"Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BE5UU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373492700071,0

The sugar content in the taproots gradually increased up to an average harvest value of 18.1%. When monitoring the variants, the content of alpha-amino nitrogen did not undergo significant changes, staying in the rather positive values of 15-20 mg.100g(-1). Similarly positive was the low content of noxious potassium at the point of harvest. The best results were obtained after repeated application of the Carbon Si fertilizer. This variant reached the highest taproot yield, polarization sugar yield and refined sugar yield per hectare. The highest sugar content was reached after repeated application of the Carbonbor Zn, Cu, S spray in combination with Insenol.

Statistical models that take account of provider-specific effects form the basis of the proposed case-mix adjustment methodology. Indirect standardisation provides a transparent means of case mix adjusting the PROMs data, which are updated on a monthly basis. Recently published PROMs data for patients undergoing unilateral knee replacement are used to estimate empirical models and to demonstrate the application of the proposed case-mix adjustment methodology in practice. The results are illustrative and are used to highlight a number of theoretical and empirical issues that warrant further exploration. For example, because of differences between PROMs instruments, case-mix adjustment methodologies may require instrument-specific approaches. A number of key assumptions are made in estimating the empirical models, which could be open to challenge. The covariates of post-operative health status could be expanded, and alternative econometric methods could be employed.

This study leverages a quasi-experimental research design to estimate the effect of online competition in an online weight-loss community on weight change. To avoid the self-selection issue, we employ the combination of propensity score matching and difference-in-differences analysis to identify and evaluate the impact of competition on weight-loss. The results show that competition has a positive impact on healthcare performance, which leads to a 46.03 percent increase in weight loss. The findings are striking since the proportion of Health 2.0 websites with competition features is still low.

The state-action Q-values are traditionally stored in a Q table, which will decrease the learning speed when large storage memory is needed. The neural network has a strong ability to deal with large-scale state spaces. Therefore, the neural network is introduced to work with Q-learning to ensure the self-learning efficiency of avoiding obstacles for industrial vehicles in unpredictable environments. Experiment results show that an autonomous mobile vehicle using the proposed method can successfully navigate to the target place without colliding with obstacles, and hence prove the self-learning ability of navigation in an unknown environment.","[Xia, Chen; El Kamel, A.] Ecole Cent Lille, CNRS, UMR 8219, LAGIS, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite de Lille - ISITE; Centrale Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Lille,"Xia, C (通讯作者)，Ecole Cent Lille, CNRS, UMR 8219, LAGIS, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",donaldgreg.x@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,11,11,2,8,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",,,978-94-6239-102-4; 978-94-6239-101-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,671,675,,10.2991/978-94-6239-102-4_136,0.0,,,5,"Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BE5UU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373492700136,0

Thus, based on behavioral finance theory, this paper aims to investigate whether investor sentiment in stock market has an impact on corporate investment in listed Chinese firms, where the mutual fund flows is taken as the proxy variable of investor sentiment for stocks. We utilize the database of China Stock Market as the origin of data sources and collect data of the mutual fund flows and corporate investment as the sample from the first quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2011. Then, we document a significant positive relationship between investor sentiment and corporate investment by using a proxy for investor sentiment. Further, the coefficient of investment-sentiment sensitivity is employed to divide portfolios. Consequently, the empirical evidence shows that investor sentiment sensitivities change differently across the level of firm investment. In terms of corporate investment, small firms show relatively higher sentiment sensitivity than large firms. Besides, the portfolios indicate that there is no significant relationship between other control variables and cross-sectional investor sentiment.","[Zhao Fang; Wang Su-sheng] Harbin Inst Technol, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Sch Urban Planning & Management, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Zhao, F (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Sch Urban Planning & Management, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,4,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,575,583,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600077,0

Using spatial weights based on cross-border lending data and European sovereign CDS spread data over the period 2009-2014, we find evidence of contagion in terms of high, time-varying spatial spillovers in the perceived credit riskiness of European sovereigns during the sovereign debt crisis. We find a particular downturn in spatial dependence in the second half of 2012 after the outright monetary transactions policy measures taken by the European Central Bank.

Under a fiscal policy associated with an unequal distribution of wealth and for policies of low or even zero interest rates, coordination failures exist, that is, involuntary unemployment persist even if prices are set at full employment levels. Coordination failures exist if and only if nominal rates are below a threshold. Moreover, I demonstrate the following result on welfare: full employment allocations at a nominal rate equal to the threshold (high liquidity costs) are better, in terms of welfare, from unemployment allocations at any non-negative interest rates below the threshold. On the other hand, under a sufficiently progressive fiscal system that reduces the inequality in the wealth distribution, coordination failures do not exist. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The 'Great Recession' provides the opportunity to conduct this analysis as it involved contemporaneous shocks to the labor, housing, and stock markets. Using panel data from the Health and Retirement Study over the period 2004-2010, we relate changes in hypertension status to changes in state-level unemployment rate and house prices and to changes in stock market prices. We consider hypertension, a disease related to stress and of high prevalence among older adults, that has received little attention in the literature linking macroeconomic conditions to individual health. Our analysis exploits self-reports of hypertension diagnosis as well as directly measured blood pressure readings. Using both measures, we find that the likelihood of developing hypertension is negatively related to changes in house prices. Also, decreasing house prices lower the probability of stopping hypertension medication treatment for individuals previously diagnosed with the condition. We do not observe significant associations between hypertension and either changes in unemployment rate or stock market prices. We document heterogeneity in the estimated health effects of the recession by gender, education, asset ownership, and work status.

This paper investigates how the market for informal care changed during and after the Great Recession in Europe, with particular focus on the determinants of care receipt. We use data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, which includes a rich set of variables covering waves before and after the Great Recession. We find evidence of an increase in the availability of informal care after the economic downturn when controlling for year and country fixed effects. This trend is mainly driven by changes in care provision of individuals not cohabiting with the care recipient. We also find evidence of several determinants of informal care receipt changing during the crisis - such as physical needs, personal wealth, and household structures.

We present causal estimates that targeted interventions aimed at methamphetamine input markets ('precursor control') can temporarily increase retail street prices, but methamphetamine consumption is weakly responsive to higher drug prices. After the supply interventions, purity-adjusted prices increased then quickly returned to pre-treatment levels within 6-12 months, demonstrating the short-term effects of precursor control. The price elasticity of methamphetamine demand is -0.13 to -0.21 for self-admitted drug treatment admissions and between -0.24 and -0.28 for hospital inpatient admissions. We find some evidence of a positive cross-price effect for cocaine, but we do not find robust evidence that increases in methamphetamine prices increased heroin, alcohol, or marijuana drug use. This study can inform policy discussions regarding other synthesized drugs, including illicit use of pharmaceuticals.

The proposed approach exploits rank-based and quantile-based estimators, and can be viewed as a robust extension of the H-CLUB procedure (Fan et al., 2015). Such an extension allows us to handle possibly misspecified models and heavy-tailed data, which are stylized features in financial returns. Under mixing conditions, we analyze the proposed approach and demonstrate its advantage over H-CLUB. We further provide thorough numerical results to back up the developed theory, and also apply the proposed method to analyze a stock market dataset. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Although pollen season peaks when students take high-stakes exams, the effect of pollen allergies on school performance has received nearly no attention from economists. Using a student fixed effects model and administrative Norwegian data, this paper finds that increasing the ambient pollen levels by one standard deviation at the mean leads to a 2.5% standard deviation decrease in test scores, with potentially larger effects for allergic students. There also appear to be longer-run effects. The findings imply that random increases in pollen counts reduce test scores for allergic students relative to their peers, who consequently will be at a disadvantage when competing for jobs or higher education. This paper contributes to the literature by illuminating the interplay between individual health and human capital accumulation, which in turn can impact long-run economic growth.

If a fetus is affected, there is a 90% chance that the pregnancy will be terminated. Increasing folic acid intake to 400g per day 2months before and 2months after conception reduces prevalence rates by at least 40%. In 2005, France introduced a social marketing campaign seeking to increase the intake of folic acid by to-be-pregnant and pregnant women through information provision. This paper sets up a quasi-experimental setting to measure the impact of the French social marketing campaign on availability and preferences for folic acid. I combine detailed scanner data on grocery purchases with a dataset on macronutrients and micronutrients. The identification strategy exploits the variation in the usefulness of folic acid information between households: households that are pregnant or want to conceive a child use it, while those that are not pregnant do not. Results suggest evidence of a positive impact of the information campaign on folic acid household availability and preferences. A value per statistical neural tube defects case is found to be of at least 12 million.

Methods: Using a total of 222 health states, a household survey was conducted in a sample of 300 individuals from the general population. Each respondent performed a PC 15 times and a ranking method 6 times (two attempts of ranking three, four, and five health states, respectively). The health states of the PC and the ranking method were constructed to overlap each other. We converted the ranked data into PC data and examined the consistency of the response rate. Applying probit regression, we obtained the predicted probability of each method. Pearson correlation coefficients were determined between the predicted probabilities of those methods. The mean absolute error was also assessed between the observed and the predicted values. Results: The overall consistency of the response rate was 82.8%. The Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.789, 0.852, and 0.893 for ranking three, four, and five health states, respectively. The lowest mean absolute error was 0.082 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.074-0.090) in ranking five health states, followed by 0.123 (95% CI 0.111-0.135) in ranking four health states and 0.126 (95% CI 0.113-0.138) in ranking three health states. Conclusions: After empirically examining the consistency of the response rate between a PC and a ranking method, we suggest that using five alternatives in the ranking method may be superior to using three or four alternatives.","[Ock, Minsu; Jo, Min-Woo] Univ Ulsan, Coll Med, Dept Prevent Med, 86 Asanbyeongwon Gil, Seoul 138736, South Korea; [Yi, Nari] Stat Korea, Vital Stat Div, Daejeon, South Korea; [Ahn, Jeonghoon] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Hlth Convergence, Seoul, South Korea",University of Ulsan; Ewha Womans University,"Jo, MW (通讯作者)，Univ Ulsan, Coll Med, Dept Prevent Med, 86 Asanbyeongwon Gil, Seoul 138736, South Korea.",mdjominwoo@gmail.com,"옥, 민수/JMP-8473-2023; Ahn, Jeonghoon/CAA-1956-2022","Ahn, Jeonghoon/0000-0002-0177-0192","Korean Health Technology R&D Project, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea [HI13C0729]","Korean Health Technology R&D Project, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea","This study was supported by a grant from the Korean Health Technology R&D Project, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Republic of Korea (number of study: HI13C0729).",,26,7,7,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2016,19.0,5.0,,,,,655,660,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.03.1836,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DU5MA,27565283.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382254600020,0

The benefits and harms of screening in women 70 years and older, however, are less well documented. Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine whether extending screening to women older than 70 years would represent a costeffective use of NHS resources and to identify the upper age limit at which screening mammography should be extended in England and Wales. Methods: A mathematical model that allows the impact of screening policies on cancer diagnosis and subsequent management to be assessed was built. The model has two parts: a natural history model of the progression of breast cancer up to discovery and a postdiagnosis model of treatment, recurrence, and survival. The natural history model was calibrated to available data and compared against published literature. The management of breast cancer at diagnosis was taken from registry data and valued using official UK tariffs. Results: The model estimated that screening would lead to overdiagnosis in 6.2% of screen-detected women at the age of 72 years, increasing up to 37.9% at the age of 90 years. Under commonly quoted willingness-to-pay thresholds in the United Kingdom, our study suggests that an extension to screening up to the age of 78 years represents a cost-effective strategy. Conclusions: This study provides encouraging findings to support the extension of the screening program to older ages and suggests that further extension of the UK NHS Breast Screening Programme up to age 78 years beyond the current upper age limit of 73 years could be potentially cost-effective according to current NHS willingness-to pay thresholds.","[Rafia, Rachid; Brennan, Alan] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Regent St, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Madan, Jason] Warwick Med Sch, Div Hlth Sci, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Collins, Karen] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Fac Hlth & Wellbeing, Sheffield S1 1WB, S Yorkshire, England; [Reed, Malcolm W.
