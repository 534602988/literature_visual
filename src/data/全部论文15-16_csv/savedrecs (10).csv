In the medium term, Iran and Iraq have considerable potential to increase their outputs, and the new shale technologies will gradually globalize. Longer term, new technologies in electricity generation, storage, and smart demand-side technologies, together with electric cars and the shift towards digitalization and new electricity-based technologies in manufacturing, will increase demand for electricity, but not fossil fuels. These new and emerging technologies, rather than international agreements and the promotion of current generation renewables, will probably bring fossil fuel dominance to a gradual close. To facilitate decarbonization, energy policy should be directed at enhancing R&D and next generation renewables, instead of supporting existing ones.","[Helm, Dieter] Univ Oxford New Coll, Oxford OX1 3BN, England",University of Oxford,"Helm, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford New Coll, Oxford OX1 3BN, England.",dieter@dhelm.co.uk,,,,,,,19,28,32,2,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The results of an experimental trust game appeared at first to support the former mechanism. Even when trustee messages are not delivered to trustors, trustees who make a promise are more likely to act trustworthy than those who do not make a promise. However, we subsequently ran a control treatment with restricted (non-promise) communication to examine whether the correlation between promises and trustworthiness is causal. The results show that the absence of promises does not decrease average cooperation rates. This indicates that promises do not induce trustworthiness, they are just more likely to be sent by cooperators than by non-cooperators.","[Ismayilov, Huseyn] ADA Univ, Sch Business, 11 Ahmadbey Aghaoglu St, Baku 1008, Azerbaijan; [Ismayilov, Huseyn; Potters, Jan] Tilburg Univ, CentER, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Ismayilov, Huseyn; Potters, Jan] Tilburg Univ, Netspar, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Republic; ADA University; Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Ismayilov, H (通讯作者)，ADA Univ, Sch Business, 11 Ahmadbey Aghaoglu St, Baku 1008, Azerbaijan.;Ismayilov, H (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, CentER, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.;Ismayilov, H (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Netspar, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",hismayilov@ada.edu.az; j.j.m.Potters@uvt.nl,"Ismayilov, Huseyn/G-4187-2017","POTTERS, Jan/0000-0003-3670-4512",,,,,23,24,29,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Key concepts for the visitors to the museum in Usti are those of the absence of the Germans, and the restitution or realization of their history and cultural heritage. In Munich, the simple presentation of the Sudeten Germans is not what stands at the fore, but rather the key concepts of loss and absence of a homeland and the connected questions of identity.

The accumulation of cash and quasi-money is consistent with the buffer stock hypothesis.

We propose a multi-quantile version of the Generalized Method of Moments using the Laplace-type estimator. The empirical findings support the canonical NKPC with larger coefficients for marginal cost and expected inflation in the upper quantiles of the inflation distribution, while the hybrid NKPC fits better with the mid and lower quantiles. Accordingly, the risk of high inflation, measured by the right side tail of the conditional density, is more responsive to a change in expected inflation compared with the center and the left side. These results imply that monetary policy affects the future path of inflation in an asymmetric way, such that a tightening of monetary policy reduces high-inflation risks more than what we expect based on the point path, whereas the effect of expansionary policy on downside risk is minor. We also perform structural break tests and find that the model is unstable through 1983. There is a moderate change in the post-break data such that the downside risk of inflation becomes less responsive to expected inflation, which may reduce the cost of contractionary monetary policy.

The linkages between international trade and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have started to be recognised, yet the extent of outsourcing of emissions across nations is unknown. Filling this gap in knowledge is critical for designing effective policy mechanisms for assigning responsibility for reductions in emissions. Here we present a structural decomposition analysis of global trends in outsourcing of emissions from 1990 to 2010 for 186 individual countries. To this end, we disaggregate total CO2 emissions for each country into contributions from the domestic economy and international trade. This allows us to unveil outsourcing trends for all nations confirming a world-wide shifting of emissions-intensive production across borders. We categorise nations into outsourcers - countries that outsource carbon-intensive production to so-called contractor nations. Our detailed assessment of the commodity content of global outsourcing flows reveals interesting insights about the trade of carbon-intensive commodities.","[Malik, Arunima; Lan, Jun] Univ Sydney, ISA, Sch Phys A28, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Malik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, ISA, Sch Phys A28, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",arunima.malik@sydney.edu.au,"Malik, Arunima/IZE-7937-2023","Malik, Arunima/0000-0002-4630-9869","Australian Research Council [DP0985522, DP130101293]",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This work was financially supported by the Australian Research Council through its Discovery Projects [DP0985522 and DP130101293].,,55,74,74,11,64,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

A European study,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Armington; Trade elasticities; Computable General Equilibrium; Europe,ECONOMETRIC EVIDENCE; MODELS; TRADE; COINTEGRATION; PANEL,"CGE models are widely used for policy evaluation and impact analysis especially with respect to trade reforms, tax reforms, energy sector reform and development policy analysis. However, the results of such models are often argued to be sensitive to the choice of exogenous parameters such as trade elasticities. Several authors show that the choice of the so-called Armington elasticities in the demand function has a strong influence on the simulation results. Most existing estimates of Armington elasticities are only for the US. The few studies for other countries find substantially differing results. Nevertheless, many CGE modelers simply adopt the elasticities from other studies disregarding specific country and model characteristics. This paper aims at providing estimated elasticities based on recent data for a larger group of European countries. Using cointegration and panel fixed effects analyses we estimate the first order condition resulting from cost minimization or utility maximization subject to the CES utility or cost function in imports and domestic goods. The results show a rather large variation across sectors and countries and the magnitude is only partly comparable to the US elasticities. Moreover, in a small CGE application we are able to show that changing the elasticity set has a quantitative and even qualitative impact on CGE model results, which confirms the concern that one might end up with biased results due to a misspecification of the elasticities.

In addition, it also examines the main source behind the resilience in the TFP growth of 37 key manufacturing industries after two global financial crises. The stochastic frontier production model is applied using a micro-level panel data set of the establishments for the 37 key manufacturing industries for the estimations. Empirical results show that a steadily high rate of technical progress was the driving force behind the resilience in the TFP growth of the 21 growth-leading industries after two global financial crises. The 21 growth-leading industries achieved nearly five times the TFP growth and four times the technological progress of the other 16 key industries. A change in the growth-leading industries in 2012 shows an upgrade in the industrial structure with more knowledge-based and high-technology-based industries than in 2000 and 2005. The study suggests further research on the role of institutions and industrial policies for industrial upgrading based on the findings of this study in order for Korea to enhance its industrial development for a more sustainable long-run economic growth.","[Pai, Mi Kyung] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Econ & Trade, Taegu 702701, South Korea",Kyungpook National University,"Pai, MK (通讯作者)，Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Econ & Trade, Taegu 702701, South Korea.",mkpai@knu.ac.kr,,,,,,,12,10,10,1,16,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

It does stand to reason that the Marcellus Shale boom has made Pennsylvania natural gas production far more influential on aggregate oil and gas markets than before, but does such a differential effect appear in the data? Can we say, unequivocally, that the Marcellus Shale boom caused Pennsylvania's natural gas output to move the needle on national natural gas prices more so than before the boom occurred? These questions are investigated utilizing a threshold VAR model based on Tsay's (1998) test for unknown break points to investigate how, if at all, Pennsylvania's rapidly growing share of national natural gas production has altered the linkages between Pennsylvania's natural gas production and overall oil and gas prices. Findings indicate a structural break in the impact of Pennsylvania's natural gas production on natural gas prices occurring in early 2009, a date that matches well with the onset of the state's rapid production growth. Pre-break, there is minimal evidence that changes in Pennsylvania's production had a significant effect on the aggregate U.S. natural gas market; but when post break data is included, an increase in Pennsylvania's production leads to a lower average national price of natural gas, which is transitory and lasts for only a few months. These results provide statistical support to the notion that Pennsylvania has become a substantial component of the U.S. natural gas market at least in the short-run. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the domestic sales and exports are complementary for local firms in China's pharmaceutical industry, whereas in the case of the textile, transportation equipment, beverage, communication equipment and general equipment manufacturing industries, domestic sales and exports are substitutes. An increase in the average domestic sales increases foreign presence in all industries. The same applies to an increase in the average export intensity. An increase in the level of competition in China's textile industry increases the export intensity as well as domestic sales of local textile firms. However, an increase in the level of competition in the pharmaceutical industry leads to a very large decrease in export intensity of local pharmaceutical firms. In the case of China's transportation equipment manufacturing industry, an increase in the level of competition decreases domestic sales of local firms. Furthermore, an increase in the firm size increases domestic sales of Chinese firms in all six manufacturing industries.","[Sun, Sizhong] James Cook Univ, Coll Business Law & Governance, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Anwar, Sajid] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Business, Maroochydore, Qld, Australia; [Anwar, Sajid] Univ S Australia, Sch Commerce, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Anwar, Sajid] Shanghai Lixin Univ Commerce, Shanghai, Peoples R China",James Cook University; University of the Sunshine Coast; University of South Australia; Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance,"Anwar, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Business, Maroochydore, Qld, Australia.;Anwar, S (通讯作者)，Univ S Australia, Sch Commerce, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.;Anwar, S (通讯作者)，Shanghai Lixin Univ Commerce, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",SAnwar@usc.edu.au,"Anwar, Sajid/F-4401-2013; Anwar, Sajid/JBJ-1127-2023","Anwar, Sajid/0000-0001-9087-1309; Sun, Sizhong/0000-0001-8430-915X",,,,,36,5,6,2,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

I use data from the 2004-2012 Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, covering 10 European countries. Inheritances are used as an exogenous change in wealth to estimate the causal effect of wealth/inheritance receipt on retirement. I apply binary choice models for a sample of persons working in 2004/05 to estimate the effect of inheritance receipt during 2005-2011 on the probability of retirement in 2011/12. By comparing data on expected retirement age at the beginning of the sample period with actual retirement age I am able to control for unobserved factors that might be correlated with wealth and affect retirement decisions. The main findings are: (1) Inheritance receipt is quite common for individuals nearing retirement age (50+). About 20 % of the sample aged 50 and older in 2011/12 live in households that received at least one inheritance between 2005 and 2011. (2) Inheritance receipt significantly increases the probability of retirement and the effect increases with the size of the inheritance. (3) In contrast to what life-cycle theory suggests I do not find any evidence that expected and unexpected inheritances affect adjustments of planned retirement age differently. These results are important for assessing the effect of policies that induce changes in wealth, such as pension reforms, tax reforms or reforms of Social Security, on retirement behavior.","[Eder, Andreas] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Eder, A (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",andreas.eder@s.wu.ac.at,,"Eder, Andreas/0000-0002-7371-7032","European Commission [QLK6-CT-2001-00360, RII-CT-2006-062193, CIT5-CT-2005-028857, CIT4-CT-2006-028812, 211909, 227822, 261982]; U.S. National Institute on Aging [U01 AG09740-13S2, P01 AG005842, P01 AG08291, P30 AG12815, R21 AG025169, Y1-AG-4553-01, IAG BSR06-11, OGHA 04-064]; German Ministry of Education and Research",European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); U.S. National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); German Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This paper uses data from the SHARE wave 4 release 1.1.1, as of March 28th or SHARE wave 1 and 2 release 2.5.0, as of May 24th 2011 or SHARELIFE release 1, as of November 24th 2010.

Departing from the scant existing literature, which draws on country-level aggregate data, we study the impact of information sharing on the volume of private credit by examining unique bank-level panel data from Ukraine, a transition economy where information sharing among banks is only a recent phenomenon. Employing the fixed-effects framework and dynamic panel methods to address endogeneity due to the non-exogenous nature of banks' choice to participate in information sharing, we find no credit volume effect of information sharing when information sharing takes place through the central bank-administered public credit registry. In contrast, information sharing through private credit bureaus is associated with an increase in the volume of bank lending, in particular when a bank is partner of multiple private credit bureaus.

Augmenting the model of Campa and Goldberg (2001) with heterogeneous labour, we show that exchange rate movements may affect unskilled workers differently than skilled workers because they change the relative price of imported inputs. Using panel data on Swiss manufacturers covering the period 1998-2012, we find that an appreciation increases high-skilled and reduces low-skilled employment in most firms. We present evidence consistent with our model that the skill-biased effects of exchange rates arise because unskilled labour is more substitutable with imported inputs than skilled labour.","Univ Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Siegenthaler, M (通讯作者)，ETH, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",siegenthaler@kof.ethz.ch,,"Kaiser, Boris/0000-0003-4936-8618",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [00011.130077/1],Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We are indebted to two anonymous referees who provided comments and suggestions that substantially improved the article.

A state-level analysis of economic impacts is important, given differences between states in economic profiles and numbers, origins, and expenditure of medical tourists. We applied input-output (I-O) analysis, based on state-specific I-O data and disaggregated foreign patient data. The analysis includes nine of Malaysia's states. In 2007, these states were visited by 341,288 foreign patients, who generated MYR1,313.4m ($372.3m) output, MYR468.6m ($132.8m) in value added, and over 19,000 jobs. Impacts related to non-medical expenditure are more substantial than impacts related to medical expenditure, and indirect impacts are a substantial part of total impacts.

In particular, the uncertainty in the power output of RES requires conventional generation units to ramp up and down more frequently to maintain the power balance and the reliability of the system. Typically, the RES power output uncertainty is modeled in ED problems by considering its potential future scenarios. However, this leads to an optimization problem that is difficult to solve for real-sized networks. Here, we propose an alternative way of considering the uncertainty of RES and the consequent ramping of conventional generation via a robust reformulation of the problem. In particular, we show that in typical real-world instances of the ED problem, the associated deterministic formulation of the robust problem can be solved efficiently for larger scale constrained electricity networks even when the underlying uncertainty distribution is not normal. Moreover, we show that our approach results on dispatch solutions that require less ramping than scenario based solutions, with little trade-off on the long-term expected costs of the network dispatch. These results also provide insights about how RES penetration affects cost and dispatch policies in the electricity network. To illustrate our results, we present relevant numerical experiments on IEEE test networks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Moarefdoost, M.

Two possible closures' are presented in the paper. With the Classical-Marxian closure, credit (specifically consumer credit) endogenously adjusts to the pace of accumulation. With the alternative Keynesian closure, exogenous consumer credit determines the rate of steady-state growth. Two regimes of accumulation are identified on the basis of these two closures. Accumulation is constrained by profitability in the first regime and increasing inequality in the second regime. The paper also investigates the impact of rising managerial income on demand and accumulation. The managerial class plays a dual role in the capitalist economy increasing productivity on one hand and diverting a share of surplus from investment to consumption on the other.","[Vasudevan, Ramaa] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",Colorado State University,"Vasudevan, R (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",ramaa.vasudevan@colostate.edu,,"Vasudevan, Ramaa/0000-0001-5052-7247",,,,,43,9,9,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,MAY,2016,67.0,2,,,SI,,397,428,,10.1111/meca.12106,0.0,,,32,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DK7ZK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000375145700008,0

We find that technical indicators do exhibit statistically and economically significant in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting power under OLS regressions and forecast combinations, clearly exceeding that of well-known macroeconomic variables and state-of-the-art oil-macro forecasting variables. Moreover, the strength of the predictive evidence is substantial during recessions and expansions and can detect the typical decline in the oil returns near business-cycle peaks effectively. Furthermore, technical indicators reveal substantial economic value for investors, in terms of superior oil risk premium forecasts and sizable utility gains. The technical indicators' ability to predict the oil price stems in part from its ability to predict changes in sentiment, suggesting the financialization of oil markets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We use three ML techniques: support vector regression, Gaussian process regression and neural network models. We use an autoregressive moving average model as a benchmark. We find that ML methods improve their forecasting performance with respect to the benchmark as forecast horizons increase, suggesting the suitability of these techniques for mid- and long-term forecasting.

When the fiscal rule is defined in lump-sum transfers, government spending or consumption taxes, the impact multipliers of fiscal shocks get substantially amplified in an environment of easy access to credit. However, when the government reacts to debt deviations by raising distortionary income taxes, the effects of debt on the size of the output multipliers vanish or even reverse. The presence of leveraged households heightens the response of consumption to fiscal shocks in two directions: the change caused by the (primary) fiscal shock and the opposite change in response to the reaction of the (secondary) instrument in the rule. The latter is stronger when distortionary taxes are used to stabilize public debt, thus reducing the overall fiscal multiplier. As a consequence, we also find non-negligible welfare and distributional effects of alternative fiscal strategies.","[Andres, Javier; Bosca, Jose E.] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Bosca, Jose E.; Ferri, Javier] FEDEA, Madrid, Spain; [Ferri, Javier] Univ Valencia, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Andrés, JA; Boscá, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal, Valencia 46022, Spain.;Boscá, JE; Ferri, J (通讯作者)，FEDEA, Madrid, Spain.",javier.andres@uv.es; jose.e.bosca@uv.es; francisco.ferri@uv.es,"Andrés, Javier/K-7793-2014; Bosca, Jose E./K-8142-2014; Ferri, Javier/L-2024-2014","Bosca, Jose E./0000-0001-5238-1237; Ferri, Javier/0000-0001-7722-9186",Fundacion Rafael del Pino; BBVA Research; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-53150-R],Fundacion Rafael del Pino; BBVA Research(BBVA Foundation); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),This work was supported by Fundacion Rafael del Pino; BBVA Research; and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (grant ECO2014-53150-R).,,47,2,2,1,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

In this paper we report an experiment where we exploit differences in the conditions under which adaptive and eductive learning converge to REE so as to investigate which approach provides the better description of the learning behavior of human subjects. Our results suggest that the path by which the system converges appears to be a mixture of both adaptive and eductive learning model predictions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, rigorous studies on the importance of China's capital controls are limited, primarily due to the scarcity of proper measurements of China's capital controls. In this paper we create a new data set of indices including de jure and hybrid measurements of the changes in China's capital controls. In contrast to other capital control indices that are compiled in a yes-or-no style, we quantify the intensity of changes in China's capital controls. Our indices reveal a persistent but uneven process of capital account liberalization in China between 1999 and 2012. This paper describes the de jure and hybrid indices, including indices for capital controls on individual asset categories, gross flows, inflows and outflows, as well as for resident and nonresident asset transactions. Understanding that China usually implements policies in a step by step gradualist style, we extract this gradual information from the text in the IMFs Annual Report on Exchange Arrangement and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER) and some supplementary material from other sources.

An NGO constrained to spend a fixed fraction of all contributions on the public good can have an incentive to produce inefficiently.

Our main results are threefold: First, the long-term pass through was close to complete for most products before the financial crisis, but has weakened considerably afterward.

We show that many games are DDGs, yet none of the existing algorithms are guaranteed to find any Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE) of these games, much less all of them. We propose a fast and robust generalization of backward induction we call state recursion that operates on a decomposition of the overall DDG into a finite number of more tractable stage games, which can be solved recursively. We provide conditions under which state recursion finds at least one MPE of the overall DDG and introduce a recursive lexicographic search (RLS) algorithm that systematically and efficiently uses state recursion to find all MPE of the overall game in a finite number of steps. We apply RLS to find all MPE of a dynamic model of Bertrand price competition with cost-reducing investments which we show is a DDG. We provide an exact non-iterative algorithm that finds all MPE of every stage game, and prove there can be only 1, 3, or 5 of them. Using the stage games as building blocks, RLS rapidly finds and enumerates all MPE of the overall game. RLS finds a unique MPE for an alternating move version of the leapfrogging game when technology improves with probability 1, but in other cases, and in any simultaneous move version of the game, it finds a huge multiplicity of MPE that explode exponentially as the number of possible cost states increases.","[Iskhakov, Fedor] Univ New S Wales, CEPAR, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Rust, John] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Schjerning, Bertel] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of New South Wales Sydney; Georgetown University; University of Copenhagen,,,"Iskhakov, Fedor/ABC-7929-2021","Iskhakov, Fedor/0000-0002-9312-5122","Danish Council for Strategic Research (DSF); Frisch Centre project [1307]; Australian Research Council [CE110001029, FL110100247]; Australian Research Council [FL110100247] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",Danish Council for Strategic Research (DSF)(Danske Strategiske Forskningsrad (DSF)); Frisch Centre project; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We received many helpful suggestions and comments on earlier versions of this paper and extend particular thanks to Jaap Abbring, Laurent Bouton, Jeffrey Campbell, Eddie Dekel, Ulrich Doraszelski, Roger Lagunoff, David Levine, Andrew McClennan, Stephen Morris, Philip J.

We find that shareholder value would decrease by 3.5%. Under the new regime, firms would be smaller and less levered, would have less productive capital, and would feature lower default probabilities. The effects on aggregate output and employment would be negative. However, the government's revenues from corporate income tax would increase by 3% in the long-run and could be used to partially offset the negative side effects of the reform. The current period of historically low corporate bond yields is probably the best time to change the treatment of interest expenses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The controversy over the accuracies encouraged internal credit scoring systems to reduce reliance on sovereign credit ratings. By employing classification and regression trees (CART), multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machines (SVM), Bayes Net, and Naive Bayes; we explore the prediction performance of several artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in predicting sovereign credit ratings in a heterogeneous sample. The results suggest that AI classifiers outperform the conventional statistical technique in terms of accurate prediction. According to within one notch and two notches accurate prediction measure, the prediction performances of the AI classifiers exceed 90% accuracy whereas the performance of the conventional statistical method is around 70%. The results further reveal that the prediction performance of the models declines around the threshold rating that is located between investment grade and speculative grade which is not necessarily the result of inadequacy of the models. Rather, this is potentially due to CRAs' cautious behaviour toward those countries around threshold rating which can be interpreted as the certification price of upgrading to investment grade.

The generosity of the program and the skill level of the unemployed agent determine the optimal policy instrument to be implemented. Restricting attention to 'soft programs' contracts that make no use of punishments or sanctions allows a fully analytical characterization of the optimal program and, in addition, it makes the solution robust to hidden saving.

Wage mobility declined substantially in East Germany in the 1990s and moderately in East and West Germany since the late 1990s. These findings are robust in many dimensions. We apply RIF regression based decompositions to measure the role of factors associated with these mobility changes. Job and employment characteristics contribute to the decline in wage mobility, however, shifts in labor market structures are central for the development of overall wage mobility.

Theory suggests that telling lies in these environments may be strategically optimal if there exists a small difference in monetary incentives. We design a laboratory experiment to investigate whether agents with different monetary incentives in a network environment lie to each other. We found that most communication within an incentive group is truthful and deception often occurs between subjects from different groups. These results align with the prediction of the existing theory. Our findings have important implications for intraorganizational conflict management, demonstrating that in order to minimize deceptive communication between departments the firm may need to reduce incentive differences between these groups.","[Rong, Rong] Weber State Univ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA; [Houser, Daniel] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Weber State University; George Mason University,"Rong, R (通讯作者)，Weber State Univ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA.;Houser, D (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",,"Houser, Daniel/JXX-4326-2024",,NSF Dissertation Improvement Award,NSF Dissertation Improvement Award(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank NSF Dissertation Improvement Award for financial support of this project.

Specifically, a procedure is established based on a Cointegrated Vector Autoregression (CVAR) model that enables us to conclude that the expansionary monetary policy could continue for at least three more years. Our estimates suggest that the neutral real rate, consistent with full employment and the inflation target in the U.S., will remain negative until 2018. This trend will continue until 2019, when the nominal neutral rate will reach a level of 2%, which remains below the pre-crisis level of 4%. In fact, it seems that the neutral rate has permanently shifted toward a lower level associated with the new fundamentals of the U.S. economy.","[Sanchez Vargas, Armando] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Econ IIEC, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Vargas, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Econ IIEC, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",as.anchez@vt.edu,"Vargas, Armando Sanchez/AAQ-8927-2021",,PAPIIT project [IN301715]; PAPIME project [PE304914],PAPIIT project(Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT)); PAPIME project,"Full-time senior researcher at the Instituto de Investigaciones Economicas (IIEC) of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM, Mexico).

Sweden uses a Defense Price Index (FPI) which is a composite index of different civilan, non-defense, indices to automatically adjust the defense budget for price changes. This should ideally allow decision makers to concentrate on incremental decisions and their economic consequences when deciding on a new defense budget. This approach requires a high precision from FPI in targeting defense inflation. The problems with achieving such a precise index are illustrated in the article. Critical points, in particular, are defining and measuring productivity in defense and price and/or cost escalation of defense equipment. Another complication is that defense, and not only defense equipment, is a tournament good where the most important capability is the relative capability compared mainly with potential opponents in military conflicts and not the absolute capability. Since Sweden recently abolished conscription there are reflections on opportunity costs of conscription in the article as well as results from Swedish and other studies on cost escalation of defense equipment.","[Nordlund, Peter] Swedish Def Res Agcy, Dept Def Anal, FOI, Stockholm, Sweden",FOI - Swedish Defence Research Agency; Saab Group,"Nordlund, P (通讯作者)，Swedish Def Res Agcy, Dept Def Anal, FOI, Stockholm, Sweden.",peter.nordlund@foi.se,"Baltutyte, Gerda/AGH-5630-2022",,,,,,29,7,7,5,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

When firms compete only in prices, a firm sets a higher price under partial information than under complete information if it faces an efficient rival, and a lower price otherwise. Thus, more information redistributes market share from the more efficient to the less efficient firm, with a negative impact on welfare. When firms also compete in cost-reducing investment, more information leads a firm to decrease investment if it faces an efficient rival, and to increase investment otherwise. Welfare decreases if firms are sufficiently asymmetric and their products sufficiently differentiated.","[Brito, Duarte] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias Tecnol, DCSA, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal; [Brito, Duarte] CEFAGE UE, Evora, Portugal; [Pereira, Pedro] CEFAGE UE, Autoridade Concorrencia, Evora, Portugal; [Vareda, Joao] CEFAGE UE, European Commiss, Directorate Gen Competit, Evora, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Brito, D (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias Tecnol, DCSA, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal.",,"Pereira, Pedro/GNN-0031-2022; Brito, Duarte/B-9620-2009","Pereira, Pedro/0000-0002-9036-0354; Brito, Duarte/0000-0003-2971-9572; Vareda, Joao/0000-0001-8803-0447",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia; FEDER/COMPETE [PEst-C/EGE/UI4007/2013],Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER/COMPETE(European Union (EU)),The authors are pleased to acknowledge financial support from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia and FEDER/COMPETE (grant PEst-C/EGE/UI4007/2013).,,17,0,0,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

This paper examines not only the quantity, but also the quality of road infrastructure and, thus, extends existing studies that only consider the benefits of road accessibility. It is found that proximity to main roads may not necessarily result in improved welfare. Instead, ensuring all-weather access to roads appears to be a more significant factor in raising household well-being. Specifically, road accessibility during the rainy season reduces the probability of households reporting a less than adequate' (low satisfaction) response by 13-25 percent. This suggests that in Timor-Leste, and likely in other developing economies under similar conditions, maintenance of existing roads is more essential to well-being than building more roads.","[Chongvilaivan, Aekapol] Asian Dev Bank, Southeast Asia Dept, 6 ADB Ave, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines; [Taniguchi, Kiyoshi] Asian Dev Bank, Private Sect Operat Dept, 6 ADB Ave, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines; [Rabanal, Rommel] Asian Dev Bank, Pacific Dept, 6 ADB Ave, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines",Asian Development Bank; Asian Development Bank; Asian Development Bank,"Chongvilaivan, A (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Southeast Asia Dept, 6 ADB Ave, Mandaluyong City 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines.",achongvilaivan@adb.org,"Chongvilaivan, Aekapol/W-7941-2019; Taniguchi, Kiyoshi/ABC-3769-2021",,,,,,26,2,3,1,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

After constructing a novel industry-level data set on intangibles, we estimate the contribution of intangible-intensive industries and other industries to aggregate productivity growth in 1981-2008. The contribution of intangible-intensive industries to aggregate labour productivity growth has significantly increased, whereas that of other industries has substantially decreased. The increased contribution of intangible-intensive industries is mainly associated with total factor productivity growth rather than with input growth. This suggests that innovations related to intangible investments in these industries might become a new key source of productivity growth in Korea.","[Chun, Hyunbae] Sogang Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Nadiri, M.

We present results from an economic experiment conducted with 100 co-habiting heterosexual couples. We compare defection behavior in the prisoner's dilemma within real couples to pairs of strangers. One out of four participants chose not to cooperate with their spouse. To understand why spouses might prefer defection, we use a novel allocation task to elicit the individual's trade-off between efficiency and equality within a couple. We further investigate the impact of socio-demographic and psychological characteristics of the couples. We find in particular that lack of preferences for joint income maximization, having children and being married lead to higher defection rates in the social dilemma.","[Cochard, Francois] Univ Franche Comte, F-25030 Besancon, France; [Couprie, Helene] Univ Cergy Pontoise THEMA, 33 Blvd Port, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Hopfensitz, Astrid] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Universite de Franche-Comte; CY Cergy Paris Universite; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Couprie, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise THEMA, 33 Blvd Port, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France.",helene.couprie@u-cergy.fr,"Hopfensitz, Astrid/C-1236-2014","Hopfensitz, Astrid/0000-0002-6503-6114; Couprie, Helene/0000-0002-8511-5290",DREES-MiRe [015227]; ANR-TIES [ANR 2010 JCJC 1803 01]; ANR-Labex IAST,DREES-MiRe; ANR-TIES(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); ANR-Labex IAST(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We would like to thank Dieudonne Yebel for valuable research assistance.

The analysis is based on a panel structural vector error correction model, and the shocks are identified using sign and zero restrictions. We find that trade liberalization generates permanent depreciation, and higher government consumption causes persistent appreciation. Traded-sector productivity gains induce appreciation but their effects are not immediate and last only for a few years. Real exchange rate responses to unexpected monetary tightening are consistent with the long-run neutrality of money. The evidence suggests that trade liberalization and government consumption have a strong effect on real exchange rates, while the effects of traded-sector productivity shocks are much weaker.

We obtain analogous formulas for seasonal random walks, extending some of the results of Maravall and Pierce (J Time Series Anal, 8:177-293, 1987). The seasonal decomposition filters of the biannual seasonal random walk have formulas that explicitly reveal which deterministic functions they annihilate and which they reproduce, directly illustrating very general results of Bell (J Off Stat, 28:441-461, 2012; Center for Statistical Research and Methodology, Research Report Series, Statistics #2015-03, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, D.C. https://www.census.gov/srd/papers/pdf/RRS2015-03, 2015). Other formulas express phenomena heretofore lacking such concrete expression, such as the much discussed negative autocorrelation at the first seasonal lag quite often observed in differenced seasonally adjusted series. An innovation that is also applied to airline model seasonal decompositions is the effective use of signs of lag one and first-seasonal-lag autocorrelations (after differencing) to indicate, in a formal way, where smoothness is increased by seasonal adjustment and where its effect is opposite.","[Findley, David F.; Lytras, Demetra P.] US Census Bur, Suitland, MD USA; [Maravall, Agustin] Bank Spain, Madrid, Spain",Banco de Espana,"Findley, DF (通讯作者)，US Census Bur, Suitland, MD USA.",david.findley@ieee.org; demetra.p.lytras@census.gov; amaravall@telefonica.net,,,,,,,28,4,5,1,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

This article criticizes the theoretical basis for some previous confident predictions, including deskilling (Karl Marx), and massive reductions in the extent of the working day (John Maynard Keynes). I argue that further increases in the complexity and knowledge-intensity of work under capitalism are likely, although not inevitable. I consider some implications of growing complexity for work and the employment contract. Raising the question of possible asymmetries between labor and capital, I address their role in generating future increases in inequality. On the other hand, growing complexity may lead to radical changes in the employment contract and its evolution into a form of quasi-self-employment. But, in an increasingly knowledge-intensive system, those with inadequate training or skills may be left behind. Compensatory policy measures, such as a guaranteed basic income and wealth redistribution, remain on the agenda.","[Hodgson, Geoffrey M.] Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Hodgson, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",,"Hodgson, Geoffrey/AAQ-8246-2021",,,,,,86,19,21,0,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We give a simple and tractable characterization of schemes that minimize discipline costs while preserving incentive compatibility. We apply the model to a public goods contribution problem. We find that if the per-capita benefit from the public good is low, then regardless of whether peer discipline is feasible or not only small groups will contribute to the good. If the public good benefit is significant but peer discipline is infeasible it remains the case that only small groups contribute. On the other hand, if the public good benefit is significant but peer discipline is feasible then full contribution takes place regardless of group size. We reconcile this result with Olson's idea that small groups are more effective by considering the case where the per-capita benefit of the public good varies with group size. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The results indicate a considerable increase in post-acquisition innovation in the merged entity. This is mainly driven by inventors based in the acquirer's country, while innovation in the target's country tends to decline. The asymmetry of effects between acquiring and target firms increases with pre-acquisition differences in knowledge stocks, indicating a relocation of innovative activities towards more efficient usage within multinational firms. Instrumental variable techniques as well as a propensity-score matching approach indicate that the effect of cross-border M&As on innovation is causal. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that approximately 15-23 percent of China's production-based emissions during 1995-2009 were induced by the production of goods and services satisfying final demand in developed economies. Decomposition of emission transfers shows that trade of intermediate products played a significant role in emission transfer from developed economies to China. Most developed economies have consumption-based emission responsibilities that are higher than their production-based responsibilities, whereas China's consumption-based responsibility is significantly lower than its production-based responsibility. We argue that a fair and efficient carbon accounting approach should take CO emission transfers from developed economies to developing economies into consideration. It is important that China and its developed trade partners cooperate in reducing emission transfers.","[Zhang, Wencheng] Nankai Univ, Nankai Inst Int Econ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Peng, Shuijun] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Int Econ & Business, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Nankai University; Xiamen University,"Peng, SJ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Int Econ & Business, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",wenchengzhang86@163.com; shuijun_peng@xmu.edu.cn,,,"National Social Science Foundation of China [13ZD167]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373218, 71073131]; Program of Social Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2014C045]",National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program of Social Science Foundation of Fujian Province,"This paper is supported by the Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 13&ZD167), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71373218 and 71073131) and the Program of Social Science Foundation of Fujian Province (Grant No. 2014C045).",,28,5,8,5,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2016,24.0,2,,,,,68,89,,10.1111/cwe.12151,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DH7VH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373001400004,0

Because the ACA's employer health insurance mandate applies to individuals who work 30 or more hours per week, employers may try to avoid the mandate by cutting workers' hours below the 30-hour threshold in order to avoid having to provide them with health insurance. Although the employer mandate only went into effect in 2015, many observers have argued that forward-looking employers began to shift towards a part-time workforce well in advance of the mandate. To test this hypothesis, we examine relative shifts across two categories of part-time workers (25-29hours and 31-35hours). We find some evidence of a shift from the 31-35-hour category into the 25-29-hour category after the passage of ACA in March 2010. However, that shift is not more pronounced among low-wage workers or among workers in industries and occupations most likely to be affected by the mandate. Thus, there is little evidence that the ACA has caused the shift across hours categories, or led to an increase in part-time employment. However, the ACA could cause a shift towards part-time work in the future as the mandate takes effect.","[Slavov, Sita Nataraj] George Mason Univ, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Mathur, Aparna; Strain, Michael R.] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC 20036 USA",George Mason University; American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research,"Slavov, SN (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",sslavov@gmu.edu,,,,,,,11,12,22,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The ICT design of a demand response system serves as the basis of a cost-value model, which incorporates all relevant cost components and compares them to the expected savings of an electricity retailer. Our analysis is based on a typical German electricity retailer to determine the optimal read-out frequency of smart meters. For our set of parameters, a positive information value of smart meter read-outs is achieved within an interval of 21 to 57 min regarding variable costs.

Even though entrepreneurial exit decisions occur more frequently than many think, the literature on entrepreneurial discontinuance is not much developed. The paper first examines whether factors influencing early-stage discontinuance differ in the Czech Republic in comparison with Western countries. Second, it contributes to existing theories on nascent entrepreneurial activity of modest majority low-growth businesses by focusing on the role of expectations in discontinuance decisions. A sample of nascent entrepreneurs was interviewed in 2011 and then in two follow-up waves in 2012 and 2013. Building on hubris theory of entrepreneurship and theory of performance thresholds, the paper discusses subjective decision-making about entrepreneurial launch and exit. The results show that people with higher industry experience are more likely to discontinue from nascent entrepreneurship, a finding contrasting most research in Western countries. The paper also provides added value in relating growth aspirations to solo vs. team entrepreneurship. Solo entrepreneurs with high initial expectations were found more likely to discontinue from their efforts, whereas teams disbanded more often in case of low-ambition plans on new venture.","[Lukes, Martin; Zouhar, Jan] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Lukes, M; Zouhar, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",martin.lukes@vse.cz; zouharj@vse.cz,"Lukes, Martin/G-2677-2019; Zouhar, Jan/E-9659-2013","Lukes, Martin/0000-0001-9063-9251; Zouhar, Jan/0000-0002-1164-7948","EU [613257]; Faculty of Business Administration, University of Economics Prague [IP300040]; Czech Republic [P402/12/P241]","EU(European Union (EU)); Faculty of Business Administration, University of Economics Prague; Czech Republic(Czech Republic Government)","This paper is an outcome of the EU-funded collaborative research project CUPESSE, Grant Agreement No. 613257 and project Explaining causes of success and failure of early-stage entrepreneurial activity supported by internal grant agency of Faculty of Business Administration, University of Economics Prague (IP300040) and the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic, project No. P402/12/P241.",,46,11,11,4,49,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Successive generations of voters choose taxation, expenditure, and government debt through repeated elections. Voters are heterogeneous by age and by the intensity of their preferences for public good provision. The political equilibrium switches stochastically between left- (pro-public goods) and right-leaning (pro-private consumption) governments. A shift to the left (right) is associated with a fall (increase) in government debt, an increase (fall) in taxation, and an increase (fall) in government expenditures.

For this purpose, we use an overlapping generation model with endogenous fertility, endogenous longevity and human capital accumulation in a small open economy. We find that pensions will always increase as long as it is beneficial for parents to invest in human capital. Furthermore, we get the result that the ratio between pension benefits and the consumption of the young generation will strive to a positive limit value, and that a pure PAYG pension system will not run into any solvency problem due to a decreasing fertility rate or ageing.","[Stauvermann, Peter J.] Changwon Natl Univ, Sch Global Business & Econ, Gyeongnam 641773, Changwon, South Korea; [Kumar, Ronald R.] Univ S Pacific, Fac Business & Econ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Suva, Fiji; [Kumar, Ronald R.] Univ Bolton, Sch Business, Bolton BL3 5AB, England",Changwon National University; University of the South Pacific; University of Bolton,"Stauvermann, PJ (通讯作者)，Changwon Natl Univ, Sch Global Business & Econ, 9 Sarim Dong, Gyeongnam 641773, Changwon, South Korea.",pstauvermann@t-online.de; kumar_RN@usp.ac.fj,"Kumar, Ronald/AAK-7991-2020; Stauvermann, Peter Josef/I-3470-2019; Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh/H-4968-2015","Stauvermann, Peter Josef/0000-0001-7011-2209; Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh/0000-0001-9658-4896",School of Global Business & Economics of the Changwon National University,School of Global Business & Economics of the Changwon National University,"The authors' thank two anonymous reviewers and the editor, Professor Neri Salvadori, for their suggestions and advice.

We do this to investigate whether BC helps in reducing forecast errors. Via simulations, we find that BC forecasts typically outperform OLS forecasts. When BC is compared to the RW we obtain mixed results, favouring the latter while the persistence of the true process increases.

For this, it first analyses the specific characteristics and long-term development of the process capital accumulation there. The paper claims that, as in the rest of East Asia, capital accumulation in Korea has, since the mid-1960s, revolved around the production of specific industrial goods for world markets using the relatively cheap and disciplined local workforce for simplified labour-processes as appendage of the machine or in manual assembly operations. This modality of accumulation resulted from changes in the forms of production of relative surplus-value on a global scale through the development of computerisation and robotisation, and the concomitant transformation in the productive attributes of the collective worker of large-scale industry. The 1997-1998 financial-cum-economic crisis, as well as the foundations and characteristics of the subsequent recovery, are understood as manifestations of the contradictory dynamics of this specific form of capitalist development.","[Grinberg, Nicolas] Natl Univ San Martin, Natl Sci & Tech Res Council, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,"Grinberg, N (通讯作者)，Natl Univ San Martin, Natl Sci & Tech Res Council, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",n.grinberg@gmail.com,,,,,,,63,3,3,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Our results also document that changes in rice output and productivity did not help mitigate poverty either. The paper provides evidence to explain why a substantial exogenous increase in the rice prices between 2006 and 2008 did not help rural households to move out of poverty, while similar changes did help in the 1990s.","[Hoang, Trung X.] Vietnam Acad Social Sci, Inst European Studies, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Pham, Cong S.; Ulubasoglu, Mehmet A.] Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Dept Econ, Burwood, Australia",Deakin University,"Ulubasoglu, MA (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Dept Econ, Burwood, Australia.",Mehmet.ulubasoglu@deakin.edu.au,"Ulubasoglu, Mehmet/AAI-8535-2020; Ulubasoglu, Mehmet/AAT-2856-2021","Ulubasoglu, Mehmet/0000-0003-3055-5755",,,,,25,5,5,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Estimation proceeds from a bias-corrected objective function relative to some target infeasible criterion. We consider a determinant-based approach for likelihood settings, and a trace-based approach, which is not restricted to the likelihood setup. Both approaches depend exclusively on the Hessian and the outer product of the scores of the fixed effects. They produce simple and transparent corrections even in models with multiple effects. We analyze the asymptotic properties of both types of estimators when n and T grow at the same rate, and show that they are asymptotically normal and centered at the truth. Our strategy is to develop a theory for general bias-corrected estimating equations, so that we can obtain asymptotic results for a specific bias correction method using the first-order conditions.","[Arellano, Manuel] CEMFI, Madrid, Spain; [Hahn, Jinyong] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Hahn, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA.",hahn@econ.ucla.edu,"Arellano, Manuel/AAD-8080-2021",,,,,,9,20,21,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

As a result the number of entrepreneurial firms in Russia which close every year increases more and more in comparison to the appearance of the new ones. The share of small and medium business accounts for about 20% of GDP in our country, while abroad this figure reaches 50%.only for small business.

Using U.S. import price micro data, we identify two facts: First, exactly the firms that react the most with their prices to changes in their own costs are also the ones that react the least to changing prices of competing importers. Second, the response of import prices to exchange rate changes is U-shaped in our proxy for market share while it is hump-shaped in response to the prices of competing importers. We show that both facts are consistent with a model based on Dornbusch (1987) that generates variable markups through a nested-CES demand system. Finally, based on the model, we find that direct cost pass-through and price complementarities among importers play approximately equally important roles in determining pass-through but also partly offset each other. This suggests that equilibrium feedback effects in import pricing are large. Omission of either channel in an empirical analysis results in a failure to explain how market structure affects price-setting in industry equilibrium. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Simultaneously, it has challenged much of the received empirical wisdom about how labor markets adjust to trade shocks. Alongside the heralded consumer benefits of expanded trade are substantial adjustment costs and distributional consequences. These impacts are most visible in the local labor markets in which the industries exposed to foreign competition are concentrated. Adjustment in local labor markets is remarkably slow, with wages and labor-force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a full decade after the China trade shock commences. Exposed workers experience greater job churning and reduced lifetime income. At the national level, employment has fallen in the US industries more exposed to import competition, as expected, but offsetting employment gains in other industries have yet to materialize.

Because migrants self-select in the decision to return, the overarching problem addressed by this study is the use of an estimator that also accounts for selection on unobservables. I find that Mexican returnees are middle- to high-wage earners at all levels of educational attainment. Taking into account self-selection in return migration, wages would be approximately 7.7% higher at the median and 4.5% higher at the mean. Owing to positive self-selection, the immigrant-native wage gap would, therefore, partially close if there was no return migration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Despite their growing popularity, there is limited evidence on how CCT programs affect conflict and theoretical predictions are ambiguous. We estimate the effect of conditional cash transfers on civil conflict in the Philippines by exploiting an experiment that randomly assigned eligibility for a CCT program at the village level. We find that cash transfers caused a substantial decrease in conflict-related incidents in treatment villages relative to control villages in the first 9 months of the program. Using unique data on local insurgent influence, we also find that the program reduced insurgent influence in treated villages. An analysis of possible spillovers yields inconclusive results. While we find no statistical evidence of spillovers, we also cannot rule out that the village-level effect was due to displacement of insurgent activity from treatment to control villages.

We give evidence that over the period 1921-1933 the Fed followed an imperfect and partial McCallum rule, moving the money base instrument according to an output target but not correcting for the deviation from this target.

Within a short time, the imported goods, virtually unseen before, including the production of the well-known global manufacturers, appeared on the Russian market. Though not all of the food products delivered to Russia at that time were of equal and acceptable quality, e.g. the American chicken quarters, (Alali et al., 2012), the process of Russia's entry into the global food markets has definitely started. Globalization did not only lead to the growth of the delivery of the imported goods into the Russian market. The major well-known food companies from Finland, U.S.A. and other countries started opening their manufacturing facilities and sales outlets within the Russian territory. The local production of agricultural products has also experienced a revival. In a dozen years, from a highly dependent on the global markets food importer Russia successfully transformed into one of the major exporters of certain food products (for instance, grains). In this series of two articles devoted to the same research and incorporating a rich factual and statistical material, we analyze the modern condition of the Russian food market, estimate the consequences of its inclusion into the globalization process and attempt to determine its type.","[Dengov, Victor V.; Maksimov, Andrey V.] St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Tchaikovskogo Str 62,A 310, St Petersburg 191194, Russia; [Gregova, Elena] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",Saint Petersburg State University; University of Zilina,"Maksimov, AV (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Tchaikovskogo Str 62,A 310, St Petersburg 191194, Russia.",vvdengov@mail.ru; elena.gregova@fpedas.uniza.sk; andrei8745@gmail.com,"Dengov, Viktor/G-6599-2013; Gregova, Elena/P-1820-2015","Dengov, Viktor/0000-0002-4665-0362; Gregova, Elena/0000-0002-4296-4962",,,,,10,10,10,0,10,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,362,374,,,,,,13,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800046,0

Most of the literature regarding redistributive effects of agricultural policy is ex post and static in nature and many tools for an ex-ante analysis of impacts of sectoral or macroeconomic policies depict farm groups or representative farms rather than individual farms. However, the measurement of inequality is highly sensitive to the aggregation of individual data. In this paper, redistributive effects of an abolishment of different instruments of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) are analysed with a tool that is able to consistently assess impacts of sectoral policy on individual farm incomes. We find that an abolishment of the main components of the CAP, direct payments and market and price policies, results in a more unequal income distribution in relative terms, but a more equal income distribution in absolute terms. Based on the latter, we conclude that if the CAP aims at a more equal income distribution within the agricultural sector, then significant scope for improving the design of respective policy instruments exists.

The structure of the sample replicates the structure of the general population of companies in Romania. Based on their past credit history, we have distributed the companies in seven classes plus the default, using and adapting the Standard & Poor's categories: AAA (1020 companies, 34%) - no risk; AA (279 companies, 9.3%) - minimal risk; A (906 companies, 30.2%) - low risk; BBB (201 companies, 6.7%) - moderate risk; BB (123 companies, 4.1%) - acceptable risk; B (111 companies, 3.7%) - high risk; C (105 companies, 3.5%) - very high risk and D (255 companies, 8.5%) - default. We have then, estimated the one-step transitions probability for downgrading for one year, based on the present category, loan amount, size of company and sector of activity. Thus, although the approach is bottom-up and unconditioned, focusing on the companies, we have included the economic context, taking into account the type of company and the economic sector. We have performed the estimations first using logit regression, and then ANN (Artificial Neural Networks), and compared the results with Standard & Poor's transition matrix for 2010. The results were compared in terms of predictive power, and arguments were given for choosing an ANN design.","[Dima, Aline Mihaela; Vasilache, Simona] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dima, AM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",alinamihaeladima@yahoo.com; simona.vasilache@gmail.com,"Vasilache, Simona N/B-2909-2010; Dima, Alina/AAQ-6730-2021; Dima, Alina Mihaela/AAL-2950-2020",,,,,,78,20,20,0,12,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

In addition to various and comprehensive changes in the regulatory regime, most countries focused its efforts towards reforms of the tax systems. Therefore, it seemed reasonable to investigate the existing tax treatment of different categories of capital income in Croatia, i. e. interest income on savings deposits and bonds, dividends and capital gains. These additional taxes have been introduced recently with the primary objective of growth of budget revenues as well as additional contributions to the stability of the financial system. However, the paper raises the question of the justification of this decision with respect to the relative underdevelopment of the domestic financial system, and particularly illiquid and shallow capital markets. For this reason, the authors will analyze the structure and determinants of Croatian financial institutions and financial markets, and the importance of financial services in the national economy. The aim of this paper is to point out the importance of developing appropriate tax framework for all segments of the financial system in the Republic of Croatia. Authors will provide insight into the nature and key features of capital income taxes as well as the basic elements of the state taxes on financial institutions. Furthermore, in line with trends in European legislation, the introduction of tax on financial transactions ( FTT) will also be taken into account.","[Drazenovic, Bojana Olgic; Maradin, Dario; Buterin, Vesna] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Drazenovic, BO (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",bolgic@inet.hr; dmaradin@efri.hr; vesna.buterin@efri.hr,"Maradin, Dario/Q-9380-2018; Buterin, Vesna/Q-8705-2018; Olgic Drazenovic, Bojana/R-4177-2018","Maradin, Dario/0000-0001-9642-6038;",,,,,7,5,5,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,1060,1068,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600105,0

Exporting weapons to country Y seems to increase the probability of being attacked by the terrorists of this country Y as well. Deploying materials, however, does not seem to significantly influence the probability of attack. Including lagged values for our military support variables ensures that the causality direction is from military support to terrorist attacks. Moreover, these results indicate that while the effect of military deployment on the probability of attack lasts for more than 1 year, the effect is rather short-lived.","[Du Bois, Cind] Royal Mil Acad, Dept Econ Management & Leadership, Renaissancelaan 30, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Buts, Caroline] Vrije Univ Brussel, Res Fdn Flanders FWO, Dept Appl Econ, Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Du Bois, C (通讯作者)，Royal Mil Acad, Dept Econ Management & Leadership, Renaissancelaan 30, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",Cindy.Dubois@mil.be,,"Buts, Caroline/0000-0002-1551-6611; du bois, cind/0000-0002-7423-928X",,,,,40,5,6,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The considerations are based on selected cases of business practice of Polish financial market and surveys conducted in the period of 2009-2014 on a representative sample of Polish society. Poland is one of the most important and promising emerging markets hosting key financial players such as Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, Citigroup, BNP Paribas, UniCredit, Millennium, Raiffeisen Bank, ING, and also Banco Santander. The results clearly show that problem of ecological adjustment of financial institutions to public requirements concerning ecological standards really exist. The growing and consistent engagement of financial business for natural environment protection is a fact. ERI is a clear evidence of that. The results could be also useful for creating responsible financial business in modern economy. However, the implementation of environmental rules on financial market is not only inspiring, but also questionable.

Even though the theoretical and empirical literature has examined many of its potential causes, the puzzle persists. This paper aims at shedding further light on the issue by investigating the relationship between saving and investment in South Africa since 1946 using fractional integration and cointegration techniques to account for high persistence in the series. We find evidence of fractional cointegration between saving and investment, indicating some degree of persistence in the gap between the two variables. We also find a structural break in saving and investment ratios to GDP around 1980, which roughly coincides with the start of a financial deregulation process in South Africa. While fractional cointegration holds before the break, it does not thereafter. In other words, while the FH puzzle is observed before the start of financial deregulation, it subsequently disappears. This suggests that financial deregulation may have loosened the link between saving and investment.","[Gil-Alana, Luis A.] Univ Navarra, Fac Econ, Edificio Amigos, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain; [Gil-Alana, Luis A.] Univ Navarra, NCID, Edificio Amigos, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain; [Andre, Christophe] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev OECD, Econ Dept, Paris, France; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Chang, Tsangyao] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan; [Ranjbar, Omid] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Econ, Tehran, Iran",University of Navarra; University of Navarra; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); University of Pretoria; Feng Chia University; Allameh Tabataba'i University,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",rangan.gupta@up.ac.za,,,,,,,77,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We make use of a rich data set of all car models sold in eight European countries, observed at a monthly level during 1998-2011. We employ a difference-in-differences approach, exploiting the fact that different countries adopted their programs at different points in time. We find that the scrapping schemes played a strong role in stabilizing total car sales in 2009: they prevented a total car sales reduction of 30.5% in countries with schemes targeted to low emission vehicles, and a 29.0% sales reduction in countries with non-targeted schemes. We find evidence of crowding out due to substitution from non-eligible to eligible cars in France and Spain. Because eligible cars tend to be more fuel efficient, targeted scrapping schemes had significant environmental benefits in the form of improved fuel consumption: without the schemes, the average fuel consumption of new purchased cars would have been 3.6% higher. Those benefits did not materialize under non-targeted schemes, in which the fuel consumption would have been only 0.7% higher absent the scheme. Finally, we find some evidence that domestically produced cars benefited at the expense of foreign competitors especially in countries where the schemes were not targeted. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Exploring heterogeneous effects indicates that female education reduces teenage fertility more in provinces with lower population density and higher agricultural activity.

Case study is prepared on the example of 10 projects concerning the investment to the cycle paths granted from the ROP Southeast, where 7 out of the 10 projects were overvalued with the average deviation by 65%.","[Halamek, Petr] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Halámek, P (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",halamek@econ.muni.cz,"Halamek, Petr/AAB-3366-2021","Halamek, Petr/0000-0003-1754-9713",,,,,12,1,1,2,9,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,139,144,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-16,0.0,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500017,0

The methodology applied in the first part involved comparative analysis of the trends in foreign investment and gross domestic product, and in the other, a growth model based on the Endogenous Growth Model. The analysis implied a great deal of spatial differentiation in the inflow of foreign investment and in economic growth. Estonia, followed by Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia by margin reports the highest volume of foreign direct investments for production of the gross domestic product and when recalculated to the manpower. Lower influence of the foreign direct investments on the economy was reported for Lithuania, Poland, Latvia, and Slovenia. In the second part, a growth model is compiled, which revealed that statistically significant relations exist between economic growth, FDI and investment growth. Growth of foreign direct investment positively demonstrates itself in increasing the level of the gross domestic product. The influence of foreign direct investment on economic growth of the Central and Eastern European countries was more visible in the period of 2009-2012.","[Hlavacek, Petr] Univ Jan Evangelista Purkyne, Usti Nad Labem 40096, Czech Republic; [Bal-Domanska, Beata] Wroclaw Univ Econ, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne; Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Hlavacek, P (通讯作者)，Univ Jan Evangelista Purkyne, Usti Nad Labem 40096, Czech Republic.",petr.hlavacek@ujep.cz; beata.bal-domanska@ue.wroc.pl,"Bal-Domańska, Beata M./B-3193-2012; Hlavacek, Petr/A-4971-2018","Bal-Domańska, Beata M./0000-0003-0395-4259; Hlavacek, Petr/0000-0002-3922-5739",Internal Grant Agency of Jan Evangelista Purkyne University in Usti nad Labem in the Czech Republic,Internal Grant Agency of Jan Evangelista Purkyne University in Usti nad Labem in the Czech Republic,This paper is supported by Internal Grant Agency of Jan Evangelista Purkyne University in Usti nad Labem in the Czech Republic.,,43,49,51,1,34,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Why were the Spanish banks hardly affected by the financial distress and banks from Central and Eastern Europe were not impacted at all? How profitable were all these institutions and what was their risk? The mortgage crisis has revealed that the general knowledge regarding the banks activities and their risk is notably limited. In addition, the recent literature provides ambiguous results on the impact of bank strategies on bank risk. By analyzing the most prevalent banking strategies observed before the mortgage crisis among 360 banks around the world, we demonstrate the presence of a wide heterogeneity in the banking strategies. These can be grouped into the originator, trader, neutral and traditional models. We also analyze how the specific banking strategies affect bank distress during the mortgage crisis. We determine that the riskiest banking model is for cases in which the banks specialize in trading and securitization. Yet, the least risky banks seem to be the banks engaged in traditional banking activities. However, our evidence suggests that a well diversified, neutral model, allows banks to stay profitable without a significant risk increase effect.","[Hryekiewicz-Gontarczyk, Aneta] Kozminski Univ, Dept Accounting, Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University,"Hryekiewicz-Gontarczyk, A (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Dept Accounting, Warsaw, Poland.",,,"Hryckiewicz, Aneta/0000-0002-2546-1829",National Science Center [DEC-2013/11/D/HS4/03747],"National Science Center(National Science Centre, Poland)",The project has been funded from National Science Center based on the decision: DEC-2013/11/D/HS4/03747.,,76,0,0,0,13,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

The measurement of the average intra-national distance has become the crucial issue in estimating the home bias in goods trade for countries with no internal trade data. The aim of this article is to demonstrate how different internal distance measurement affects home bias in trade. The results of the analysis indicate that sub-unit based weighted measures perform better in the assessment of Croatia's internal distance than area based and measures based on relation to neighbour countries. In estimating the model, we use data on import values for Croatia according to standard gravity theory. Regression analysis corroborates theoretical assumptions regarding the impact of geographical distance of countries and transport costs on bilateral trade flows; imports from world are positively correlated with the GDP of imported countries and negatively correlated with the distance between them. The values of home bias variable for Croatia's total imports were slightly higher than results obtained from previous explorations for EU countries meaning that there is still place for Croatia's deeper integration into EU trade flows.","[Josic, Hrvoje] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Int Econ Dept, Zagreb, Croatia; [Josic, Mislav] Croatian Financial Serv Supervisory Agcy HANFA, Sesvete, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Josic, H (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Int Econ Dept, Zagreb, Croatia.",hjosic@efzg.hr,"Jošić, Hrvoje/AAY-7062-2020","Jošić, Hrvoje/0000-0002-7869-3017",,,,,39,1,1,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

These countries all entered the global financial crisis with sizable current account deficits, and the unwinding of these deficits has been a complex and painful process for most. While much of the general policy discussion of the large pre-crisis deficits has focused on losing export competitiveness, this paper highlights other results in the literature regarding import booms as well as a dimension that is rarely discussed - the drop in the non-trade portion of the current account (transfers and net income balance) in many countries. The paper also examines progress made in unwinding these deficits. Most countries have made tangible progress, but with different degrees: improvement of price competitiveness and a shift of production from non-tradable to tradable sectors has helped increase exports and along with compressed imports, close the current account deficits. The adjustment, though, has taken place against recessions and low growth in the euro area, and the paper also considers what has made the process more painful in some countries rather than others. We find that large current account balances prior to the crisis is the best predictor of a sharp drop in output during the crisis. Supportive macro policies to cushion the adjustment process and keep overall euro inflation at or above target level are necessary. In the longer term, improving institutions to deal with imbalances (and preventing them at future entry) are important.","[Kang, Joong Shik] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",International Monetary Fund; George Washington University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kang, JS (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,,,,,,30,10,11,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Based on a data set from a worldwide survey among delegates in international climate negotiations, this article assesses preferences for different MPRs for a future climate treaty among key players. The empirical findings provide evidence that small countries with low bargaining power rather opt for large minimum membership requirements while industrialized countries push forward the idea of a small carbon club of the largest emitters only. In contrast, delegates from countries in transition try to keep emission thresholds rather low which would allow a future agreement to come into force without their signature.","[Kesternich, Martin] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Kesternich, M (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany.",kesternich@zew.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ 01UN1016A]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),Financial support by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ 01UN1016A] and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) is gratefully acknowledged.

I bring together differing contributions of traditional institutionalism to further an emerging evolutionary-institutionalist discourse concerning the role played by culture and historicity, on one hand, and by individual actions and awareness, on the other, in shaping and reshaping the nature of the state. Such discourse is significant in understanding that, although inherited culture plays an important role in influencing the character of the state in a given society, the future of the state is not fully determined by its history. In equal measure, it depends on the volition of individuals who purposefully amend the state's institutions through rearranging power distribution. Using Russia's authoritarian state as a case in point, I demonstrate how this emerging evolutionary- institutionalist discourse can circumvent ideological misuse of the institutionalist paradigm in non-democratic societies.","[Klimina, Anna] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Econ, St Thomas More Coll, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Klimina, A (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Econ, St Thomas More Coll, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada.",,,,,,,,55,9,10,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

One of them is the issue of the differing level of economic development of individual territorial units, where the problem of income redistribution emerges. The difference between income and expenses results in the formation of fiscal gaps, both horizontal and vertical. The aim of the paper is to make an attempt to review the literature and to present the measures applied for measuring the vertical fiscal imbalance. It is also the starting point for conducting measurements of those imbalances in Germany based on Bird's and Tarasov's methodology.

In most countries, value-added tax (or goods and services tax) is of the highest significance to the national budget among the indirect taxes. In terms of the European Union, even though each EU country applies unified fiscal regulation principles, historical-moral factors that affect shadow economy, competitiveness, consumption levels, etc. still exist. Globalization of the economic environment and structural changes resulting from information and communications technologies render classic taxation systems outdated. National tax systems face stronger competition as a result of the globalization of the economy. VAT is a tax whose main specification are determined at the European Union Level. The fight against abusive practices is not an option for the Member States but a prerequisite for the effectiveness of the EU common system (Directive 2006/112). Tax competition favors certain taxpayers to the detriment of others, and the same holds true for Member States when they compete on taxation to attract economic activity or tax revenue (Remeur, 2015). Understanding about the globalization impact and the determinants that influence the VAT gap could potentially help to change and reduce it by using fiscal and macroeconomic levers. Research is based on an analytical approach combined with a systematic, logical and comparative analysis of scientific literature.","[Kundeliene, Kristina; Stankevicius, Evaldas] Gedimino St 50, Kaunas, Lithuania",,"Stankevicius, E (通讯作者)，Gedimino St 50, Kaunas, Lithuania.",kristina.kundeliene@ktu.lt; stankevicius07@gmail.com,"Kundeliene, Kristina Mrs./A-3809-2008",,,,,,28,1,1,0,6,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1119,1127,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800139,0

The Great Recession, which hit the developed, especially European economies the hardest, has shifted more economic power into the direction of emerging economies, thereby accelerating an inevitable economic and political change. Various states have managed to accelerate the change in the distribution of economic wealth. These states, grouped mainly in the BRICS, and in the Next Eleven (N11) have shown, contrary to the Western, culturally superior geopolitical thought, that they are neither backward nor incompetent, thereby challenging the developed states. After the paradigm of American Empire, which ended in the worst economic crisis in 70 years, it is time for a new paradigm. Since it would be an illusion to think that multipolarity would be shaped by all the parties concerned, it has to be shaped by those most important. However, the current relations between most powerful states are all but cooperative. The pragmatic relations and the common goals of the BRICS states should not be overestimated. The relations between the USA and the EU, which show a high level of homogeneity because of the Ukrainian crisis, may not in the future be so close. A clear difference would exist between the arranged and the accepted multi-polarity, and a multipolarity in which one side is not inclined but compelled to accept multipolarity, concurrently limiting its achievements. An approach to the present and the future multipolarity and multipolar world that would be multifarious and multifaceted is therefore a necessity.","[Kurecic, Petar] Univ North, Trg Zarka Dolinara 1, Koprivnica, Croatia; [Kampmark, Binoy] RMIT Univ, 124 La Trobe St, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University North - Croatia; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Kurecic, P (通讯作者)，Univ North, Trg Zarka Dolinara 1, Koprivnica, Croatia.",petar.kurecic@unin.hr; bkampmark@gmail.com,"Kurecic, Petar/M-2524-2017",,,,,,51,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,90,100,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100011,0

Findings - Despite capacity gaps, developing nations have encountered stronger legal challenges from the US and, although without much capacity gaps, similar patterns of litigation rivalries between the US and other advanced countries, with the exception of the EU, have been also found during dispute settlements in the WTO regimes. Research limitations/implications - Although the DSU procedures themselves might not be biased for/against certain member groups, there has been some evidence of the struggles of weaker opponent groups of the US during the actual litigation processes.

We demonstrate that the Great Recession has produced a significant recomposition of the poverty profile in Spain.

In the context of the relation between corporate reputation and the trust of stakeholders, scientists agree on evident importance of corporate reputation for the development of stakeholder trust in the organization; however, there is a lack of recommendations suggesting how an organization should develop the trust of key stakeholders using corporate reputation. The article presents a summarized view on the relationship between the main dimensions of corporate reputation and the factors of key stakeholder trust in the organization. Such relationships reveal that it is purposeful to invoke corporate reputation in order to develop trust of key stakeholders. Also, the article states the relation between the factors determining different stakeholders' trust in the organization and different dimensions of corporate reputation based on which the trust of the key stakeholders of the organization should be developed. The result of the theoretical study is a developed conceptual model of key stakeholder trust development in terms of corporate reputation. The model will be applied in further empirical studies on the development of trust of the key stakeholders: customers, employees, shareholders and suppliers.","[Matuleviciene, Migle; Stravinskiene, Jurgita] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Matuleviciene, M (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",migle.matuleviciene@gmail.com; jurgita.stravinskiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,44,5,5,1,32,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Under the influence of these changes, the library of the new era became the source of traditional and digital information, and free access to information and mediation in their evaluation and transfer became the underlying principle of its activities. The starting premise of this paper is that books and libraries are the levers to link the cultural and creative industries with educational institutions and partners in their environment. The inspirational model of five concentric circles of the cultural industry, which puts the book and the library at the core of the concentric circles as the hotbed of creative ideas, skills and talents, was used to identify the book's and the library's place. This model was also used by the European Commission in its classification of the creative industries. The model suggests that creative ideas, as the core of the creative arts in the form of text, sound or image, spread out like concentric circles and affect all areas of the creative industries that exist in a particular area. The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness of the importance of these industries for the national economy. The paper aims to find effective tools, ideas, activities and processes for creative partnerships and for the interaction with the users and the environment that would facilitate innovative development of library and informational activities, as well as the contribution of libraries to the development of a knowledge-based society. Unlocking the creative potential of the library rests on creative librarians who are creating new value in the system of creative and cultural industries by using elements of marketing at the library. In conclusion, the paper discovers an economic dimension of the products and services of the cultural and creative industries, which promote intelligent, sustainable and inclusive development of the entire society.","[Mihaljevic, Jasminka] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Boric, Marta] Dept Cultural Studies, Trg Svetog Trojstva 3, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Buljubasic, Iva] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Dept Cultural Studies, Trg Svetog Trojstva 3, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Mihaljevic, J (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",jasminka.mihaljevic@efos.hr; mboric@kulturologija.unios.hr; ibuljuba@kulturologija.unios.hr,"Mihaljevic, Jasminka/J-4992-2018",,,,,,21,0,0,4,30,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,243,254,,,,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600024,0

The results confirm the notion of leverage premium and have important implications for financial managers, investment analysts and other market participants who use asset pricing frameworks for investment appraisals.

ARTHUR LEWIS AND THE DUAL ECONOMY OF MANCHESTER IN THE 1950S,MANCHESTER SCHOOL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"We document, for the first time, the institution-building activities of the development economist W. Arthur Lewis (1915-91) as founder of Community House and the South Hulme Evening Centre, two further education centres which sought to fight discrimination among the Afro-Caribbean communities of Manchester in the 1950s. We depict the struggle by Afro-Caribbeans to achieve a decent standard of living (and to escape from the 'subsistence economy' which provides the basis for Lewis' most famous model) as a game of snakes and ladders in which the two main potential ladders out of poverty are-as in many developing countries-first, the ability to generate non-wage income through self-employment and second, 'vertical social capital', i.e. membership of social networks of a kind which gave the employee the ability to fight back against discrimination. The most imaginative aspect of Lewis's design for his further education centres is his incorporation of activities which build vertical social capital alongside conventional vocational training. On the basis of both the qualitative evidence and an exploratory model of the Manchester dual economy, we argue that Lewis' social centres had a significant positive impact on Afro-Caribbean income and poverty levels, and that they still provide inspiration for development practitioners.","[Mosley, Paul] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Ingham, Barbara] Univ London, Sch African & Asian Studies, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of Sheffield; University of London,"Mosley, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

The study is framed around discussion of the conceptual bias that remains in policy and academic literature towards a narrow subset of technological (product or process) innovation labelled 'high-capability' innovation in this paper. The paper argues that this bias influences the public and business community's understanding of the term 'innovation' and has implications for innovation measurement, research, policy and strategy. The study uses data from an economy-wide, regional innovation survey based on the Oslo manual, and includes 648 innovative firms covering all industry sectors. The paper combines elements of both subject and object approaches to innovation measurement, using data from an open-ended survey question to explore the alignment between what firms report as their 'most important innovation' (MII) and firm capabilities for introducing 'high-capability' technological innovation. Results show that a substantial share of firms report an MII that is a 'low-capability' innovation, including those firms with high R&D intensity, those with novel technological innovation, and firms in more innovative sectors of manufacturing and knowledge intensive business services. The paper discusses the implications of this result for future innovation measurement and research.","[O'Brien, Kieran] Univ Tasmania, Australian Innovat Res Ctr, Res House,1 Coll Rd, Hobart, Tas 7005, Australia",University of Tasmania,"O'Brien, K (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Australian Innovat Res Ctr, Res House,1 Coll Rd, Hobart, Tas 7005, Australia.",krobrien@utas.edu.au,,"O'Brien, Kieran/0000-0001-9623-0318",,,,,133,5,7,2,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

The lack of power supply over a long period of time over a wide area of the country, can make huge financial losses and also is threatened the safety of the residents. In recent years the phenomenon of blackout occurs repeatedly more often. The number of receivers deprived of the power supply is counted already in millions. The article presents the problems associated with the influence of great breakdowns in the power engineering system on the economy and the national energy security. Globalization of economy causes both threats to the power engineering system (cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks on transmission lines and power stations), as well as allows for the energy transmission to the systems threatened with breakdowns. The world's greatest breakdowns in power engineering systems are described by the authors of this article. The largest breakdowns which occurred in the Polish power system will be also described as well as the problems faced by Polish power system.

This allows for consideration of (a) trade growth in new varieties; (b) aggregate productivity changes attributed to reallocation of resources across and within an industry; and (c) productivity growth in manufacturing due to increased access to business services. The results indicate relatively small gains for the EU, whereas Ukraine benefits with a welfare increase of over 8%. The deindustrialization impact, previously found by Olekseyuk and Balistreri (2014) in a comparison of different modeling structures, is supported by our findings. Ukraine's welfare gains are higher under an Armington structure compared to monopolistic competition. This is due to a movement of resources into Ukraine's traditional export sectors producing under constant returns. Implementation of the FDI modeling approach and liberalization of barriers to FDI, however, mitigates the deindustrialization impact as multinational firms enter the Ukrainian market. This increases the number of available varieties and, consequently, induces productivity growth of manufacturing sectors due to improved access to business services as critical inputs.","[Olekseyuk, Zoryana] World Bank, Dev Prospects Grp DECPG, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Olekseyuk, Z (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Prospects Grp DECPG, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",zolekseyuk@worldbank.org,,"Olekseyuk, Zoryana/0000-0001-9403-8234",,,,,64,9,9,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The Research is based on existing empirical data on the impact of colour on human psychophysiology and consumer behaviour. Experimental data confirmed the hypotheses put forward and the results can be used in the commercial activities of trade and HoReCa. Using Visual elements of communications (colour) it becomes possible to increase average bill and manage consumer choice and encourage to order more expensive food and drinks and the quantity of the dishes. The marketing research was used as the method of experiment. Based on these results of experiment 1 it can be argued that the colour has an impact on the perception of offers by the visitors of restaurants, both men and women. Using the pizza example, it was found that the most attractive colour for the dish image is black. It is this colour that in psychology and marketing is associated with high cost and respectability. Perceived value of the dish shown on the black background compared to the basic price increased. The experimental results of experiment 2 showed the increase in the average bill amount using a black substrate. According to the results of both experiments we were able to determine a special effect of the black colour: under its influence the perceived value of proposals, as well as the average bill amount increases.","[Plushcheva, Larisa V.] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Kemerovo Inst, Affiliated Branch, Kuznetsky Prospect 39, Kemerovo 650992, Russia; [Kiselev, Vladimir M.; Savinkov, Sergey V.] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Stremyanny Pereulok 36, Moscow 117997, Russia",Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; Plekhanov Russian University of Economics,"Plushcheva, LV (通讯作者)，Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Kemerovo Inst, Affiliated Branch, Kuznetsky Prospect 39, Kemerovo 650992, Russia.;Kiselev, VM; Savinkov, SV (通讯作者)，Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Stremyanny Pereulok 36, Moscow 117997, Russia.",larisapv@rambler.ru; kisselev.vm@gmail.com; savinkov.sv@gmail.com,"KISELEV, VLADIMIR Mikhailivich/I-2745-2016; Kiselev, Vladimir M./B-6746-2014","KISELEV, VLADIMIR Mikhailivich/0000-0001-7193-778X; Kiselev, Vladimir M./0000-0003-0401-5659",,,,,17,2,2,2,16,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1720,1728,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800213,0

It highlights the continuing problems in ensuring stronger growth in employment and regional differences in levels of unemployment and structural problems in selected regions. The labour market is sensitive and vulnerable place of the Slovak economy, the adverse impacts of the crisis in past years exhibited significantly compared to most EU economies, which resulted in deepening structural problems in the labour market and higher unemployment rate, which is moreover in the long term significantly spatially differentiated on axis east - west. Despite significant regional differences in unemployment levels is a regional mobility of labour in Slovakia relatively low. Nowadays, to reducing regional disparities can be used a support from the state for the least developed districts of Slovakia. The latest economic forecasts confirm that there is an ongoing recovery in Slovakia also because of low energy prices and very accommodating monetary policy. Nevertheless, the results of the labour market are still affected by the persistence of large regional disparities in economic growth and employment. The European Commission also notes that unemployment remains one of the biggest problems of economic policy, with regard to its structural nature.","[Rievajova, Eva; Klimko, Roman] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Rievajová, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",eva.rievajova@euba.sk; roman.klimko@euba.sk,"Klimko, Roman/AAR-3082-2020",,scientific project VEGA 'Sucasnost a perspektivy zmien zamestnanosti a suvisiacich procesov v kontexte naplnania ciel'ov Europskej strategie zamestnanosti' [1/0001/16],scientific project VEGA 'Sucasnost a perspektivy zmien zamestnanosti a suvisiacich procesov v kontexte naplnania ciel'ov Europskej strategie zamestnanosti',The paper is the outcome of scientific project VEGA No. 1/0001/16 'Sucasnost a perspektivy zmien zamestnanosti a suvisiacich procesov v kontexte naplnania ciel'ov Europskej strategie zamestnanosti'.,,9,1,1,1,1,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-210-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,587,596,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH8SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000403638200062,0

The results of the study indicate that public administration, equipped with adequate planning tools, plays a key role in shaping urban space. At the same time, the users of space - in this case the inhabitants of the city - are an indispensible element of the planning process. As the analyses show, urban planners appreciate the comments and observations made by the users of space since they are an important source of information, highlighting the local issues important for the community. It should be stressed that a good point of departure for cooperation between public administration and the community is the fact that both the planners and the inhabitants, despite different perspectives, experience and knowledge, hold similar opinions on urban space, its condition, and management.","[Rogatka, Krzysztof; Chodkowska-Miszczuk, Justyna; Bieganska, Jadwiga; Sroda-Murawska, Stefania; Grzelak-Kostulska, Elzbieta] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Fac Earth Sci, Dept Urban Studies & Reg Dev, Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Rogatka, K (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Fac Earth Sci, Dept Urban Studies & Reg Dev, Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",krogatka@umk.pl; jchodkow@umk.pl; jadwigab@umk.pl; steffi@umk.pl; grzelak@umk.pl,"Rogatka, Krzysztof/G-7299-2019; Chodkowska-Miszczuk, Justyna M./E-6019-2015; Biegańska, Jadwiga/M-8547-2019; Sroda-Murawska, Stefania/JAC-7698-2023; Sroda-Murawska, Stefania/A-6842-2019","Chodkowska-Miszczuk, Justyna M./0000-0002-4436-475X; Biegańska, Jadwiga/0000-0002-0586-089X; Sroda-Murawska, Stefania/0000-0002-2357-2613",,,,,13,1,1,1,5,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,605,612,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-77,0.0,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500078,0

Eight groups around the GDP were identified, expressed in the most powerful European currencies, the Euro (EUR), the Swiss Franc (CHF), and the Great Britain Pound (GBP). The findings allow for building time maps with daily resolutions that endorse the deterministic perspective of the chronological spread of financial fluctuations generated by bilateral trades. The German GDP seems to impose the timing of the aggregated GDP of the Eurozone-12. The method is helpful to detect time delays between processes in the range of 2-4Q, so that knowing the sense and the magnitude of the movements in the advanced series might indicate the trends in the delayed one, or to lay the input variables in correct time positions in multivariate autoregressive lag models or in mixed frequency models.","[Scarlat, Eugen] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Dept Appl Phys Sci, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest,"Scarlat, E (通讯作者)，Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Dept Appl Phys Sci, Bucharest, Romania.",egen@physics.pub.ro,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,6,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

However, little is known regarding the factors that encourage students from across the world to enroll in U.S. colleges and universities each year. This paper examines the relationship between international enrollment and the openness of the United States' skilled labor market, currently regulated by the H-1B program. Gravity regressions reveal that H-1B visa issuances to a country are positively and significantly related to the number of international students from that country. Causal estimates of the impact of labor market openness are achieved by exploiting a dramatic fall in the H-1B visa cap in October 2003. Triple difference estimates show that the fall in the cap lowered foreign enrollment by 10%.

Elimination of communication barriers and trade barriers has resulted in the creation of an open and free world market. The competition of companies is growing and competition growth on a global scale has a great impact on the Slovak economy and Slovak labour market. The nature of the enterprise changes, knowledge economy based on education is becoming increasingly important. A particular importance in the labour force has its flexibility and mobility, to which this contribution will focus. The flexibility of the labour force is based on the willingness to carry out work in flexible forms of employment and the organization of working time (new forms of labour organization). Through the flexibility and mobility can be achieved consistency between the profile of the job and the profile of the employee, while the profile of the job is a priority for the employer (the employer efforts to find the most appropriate employee to be recruited). The increased labour mobility is a potential for employment growth, whereas it is based on changes in spatial location of the labour force and in the movement of workers between different fields of work. This results in changes in the structure of employment. Global competition continues to grow and the terms as knowledge economy, job flexibility and mobile workforce and are becoming more frequent.","[Trel'ova, Silvia] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005 25, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Trel'ová, S (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005 25, Slovakia.",silvia.trelova@fm.uniba.sk,"Treľová, Silvia/ABG-8435-2020","Treľová, Silvia/0000-0003-4851-6666",,,,,19,8,8,1,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2228,2235,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800277,0

The distribution of search revenues is unknown to the principal and has to be elicited from the agent so as to design the optimal search policy. At the same time, the search process is unobservable, requiring search to be self-enforcing. The two information asymmetries are mutually enforcing: if one is relaxed, delegated search is efficient. With both asymmetries prevailing simultaneously, search is almost surely inefficient (it is stopped too early). Second-best remuneration is shown to optimally utilize a menu of simple bonus contracts. In contrast to standard adverse selection problems, indirect nonlinear tariffs are strictly dominated.","[Ulbricht, Robert] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Ulbricht, R (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",robert.ulbricht@tse-fr.eu,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB/TR 15],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I am grateful to the co-editor, two anonymous referees, Guy Arie, Christian Hellwig, Dirk Hofmann, Niko Matouschek, Caspar Siegert, and especially Klaus M.

The first step is to define the criteria which negatively affect the quality of accounting data and then their assignment to the groups according to the context. Subsequently, determine the weights of the negative criteria in each group and then evaluate their importance. On the drafted model, the quality of accounting data in 78 companies are determined and there are found out positive statistically significant relationship with other criteria or circumstances based on the statistical methods.","[Vlckova, Miroslava] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Vlcková, M (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",mvlckova02@ef.jcu.cz,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-636-0,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2016,6.0,,,,,,1173,1179,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP1JI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000539487200144,0

It uses a model of frictions, which is a combination of a search model of the labor market and a q-type model of the capital market, emphasizing the interaction of capital and labor frictions. Relying on structural estimation of private sector U.S. data, it studies the future determinants of capital and job values and the implications for U.S. labor market developments. Key findings include: (i) complementarity between the hiring and investment processes; (ii) important cross effects of the value of capital on the mean and the volatility of the hiring rate, and vice versa; (iii) future returns are shown to play a dominant role in determining capital and job values; and (iv) U.S. labor market developments, including the outward shift of the Beveridge curve in the Great Recession and its aftermath 2007-2013, can be accounted for by changes in job and capital values. A relatively surprising finding is that job values went up, not down, in the Great Recession. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Eco-innovative solutions are mostly seen as beneficial for institutions, businesses or the society itself We mainly refer to those solutions which improve production processes, reduce environmental impact and promote the activities of corporate social responsiblity while educating the public. In order for the eco-innovation process to generate a positive outcome, it has to be backed up by a huge marketing campaign. Marketing communication of eco-innovations is highly specific with regards to its segment, target audience and its main goal. In each stage, the ongoing eco-innovative process should be supported by an appropriate marketing communication strategy in order to ensure its success. The next step to be successfully implemented is so-called diffusion, i.e. placement of a particular eco-innovation onto the market. The conception of use of marketing communication should be based on traditional marketing tools with regards to eco-innovations while some of the tools are more important than the others. Nowadays, traditional tools of marketing communication need to be endorsed by use of the tools of digital marketing or other tools of modem marketing communication.

We show that equilibrium dynamics simultaneously exhibit structural change and balanced growth of aggregate variables as is observed in US when the initial intensity of minimum consumption requirements is sufficiently small. This intensity is measured by the ratio between the aggregate value of the minimum consumption requirements and GDP and, therefore, it is inversely related with the level of economic development. Initially rich economies benefit from an initially low intensity of the minimum consumption requirements and, as a consequence, these economies end up exhibiting balanced growth of aggregate variables, while there is structural change. In contrast, initially poor economies suffer from an initially large intensity of the minimum consumption requirements, which makes the growth of the aggregate variables unbalanced during a very large period. These economies may never exhibit simultaneously balanced growth of aggregate variables and structural change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The estimated effects are similar in size and significance to those of historical opera houses. We document that these estimates reflect the importance of institutions for long-run economic growth, and that the effect of historical amenities on the contemporary local share of high skilled workers disappears upon controlling for regions' historical importance.

In an economy where the government has a priori chosen any tax-and-benefit schedule, we show that, despite their common goal of providing additional incentives for individuals to enter the labour force, workfare and an earned income tax credit are at odds with each other. We also show that, in the presence of an optimal nonlinear income tax, introducing unproductive workfare is always suboptimal when individuals face the same disutility of being on workfare. When this disutility is heterogeneous, unproductive workfare may be a useful policy tool.","[Brett, Craig] Mt Allison Univ, Dept Econ, Sackville, NB, Canada; [Jacquet, Laurence] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, Cergy, France; [Jacquet, Laurence] Oslo Fiscal Studies, Oslo, Norway",Mount Allison University; CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Brett, C (通讯作者)，Mt Allison Univ, Dept Econ, Sackville, NB, Canada.",cbrett@mta.ca,,,Canada Research Chairs Program; Marie Curie FP7 Integration Grant; European Union; Labex MMEDII [ANR-11-LBX-0023-01],Canada Research Chairs Program(Canada Research Chairs); Marie Curie FP7 Integration Grant(Marie Curie ActionsEuropean Union (EU)); European Union(European Union (EU)); Labex MMEDII,"Craig Brett's research was generously supported by the Canada Research Chairs Program.

When a person consumes an information source, she enjoys private benefit but also creates social value. Her use of the source enhances society's understanding of it, which is 'in the air' and freely accessible by others, but which decays in quality over time. We ask how efficiently information will be used in the presence of this externality effect under four cases: exogenously given prices, ownership and pricing by a profit-maximizing monopolist, ownership and pricing by a firm restricted by competition or mandate to earn zero profit, and open access. Information is overpriced and underused under both monopoly and zero-profit ownership, and underpriced and overused under open access. However, as the cost falls toward zero, outcomes under zero-profit ownership and open access both tend toward the efficient level, and for-profit monopoly ownership is increasingly inefficient. Potential efficiency gains from open access and zero-profit ownership are therefore greater as advances in technology reduce the costs of delivering information to consumers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We find that being a victim of crime, and having an acquaintance who is a victim of crime, have a negative effect on happiness. The cost of compensating someone who is a victim of crime, such that they are returned to the same position as if they had not been victimized, is similar to the cost of compensating someone who has an acquaintance who is a victim of crime (around 60% of annual household income). Females who are victims of crime, and victims of out-of-home theft and assault/threat, feel less victimized if they have an acquaintance who is also a victim of crime with whom to share their experience. Living in a safe neighborhood has a positive effect on happiness. The amount needed to compensate someone for living in an unsafe, or neutral neighborhood, as opposed to safe neighborhood, is 1500% of annual household income, which is much higher than the shadow price suggested in studies for the United States and United Kingdom.

We obtain the following empirical results. First, for non-Chaebol firms, the precautionary motive plays an important role in determining cash holdings throughout the sample period. In contrast, there is no empirical evidence supporting that Chaebol firms hold cash with the precautionary motive in the pre-crisis period: This motive becomes important only in the post-crisis period. Second Chaebol firms' cash holdings with the precautionary motive are different from those of non-Chaebol firms in the pre-crisis period, but not in the post-crisis period. These imply that after experiencing financial crisis, Chaebol firms' cash holding strategy has been changed substantially in a way to become more cautious in dealing with cash flow (CF) volatility.","[Choi, Yong-Seok; Min, Insik] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 130701, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Choi, YS (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 130701, South Korea.",choiy@khu.ac.kr; imin@khu.ac.kr,"Min, Insik/AAH-9100-2020; Choi, Yong-Seok/AAH-9264-2020","Choi, Yong-Seok/0000-0002-9689-2335",,,,,27,2,2,0,12,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

The results provide robust evidence supporting the view that China's OFDI so far have had a positive impact on domestic activities in enhancing firms' productivity and scales of operation, measured by sales and employment When we distinguish among investments on the basis of entry mode, accounting for endogeneity in the selection process, acquisitions facilitate early access to intangible assets, but are detrimental to financial performance, while greenfield investments have a stronger impact on the scale and productivity of Chinese multinationals investing in Europe.

To do so, a decomposition technique that enables distinction between direct and indirect effects in logistic regressions is deployed. Education drives different fertility behavior patterns and delays fertility through several mechanisms: attachment to the labor market, non-traditional values, and the characteristics of the partner and the partnership. Nevertheless, the ability of the mechanisms explored in this study to explain the link between education and fertility timing is rather limited, and a large part of this relationship remains unexplained. In addition, we find evidence of differences across educational groups in the way women's decisions to have their first child respond to several explanatory factors, which points at a structural change in the decision taking amongst women with different educational endowments.","[Davia, Maria A.] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Albacete 02061, Spain; [Legazpe, Nuria] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Cuenca 16071, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Davia, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Plaza Univ S-N, Albacete 02061, Spain.",mangeles.davia@uclm.es; nuria.legazpe@uclm.es,"Davia, Maria A/Q-8045-2017; Davia, Maria A./AAA-1722-2022; Legazpe Moraleja, Nuria/C-8079-2016","Davia, Maria A./0000-0001-9551-6111; Legazpe Moraleja, Nuria/0000-0002-2161-3768",,,,,50,1,1,2,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

For given values of nonmarket time, the relative efficiency of OJS, and the amount of search frictions, we derive a simple relationship between the unemployment rate, mismatch, and wage dispersion. We estimate the latter two from standard micro data. Our methodology accounts for measurement error, which is crucial to distinguish true from spurious mismatch and wage dispersion. We find that without frictions, output would be about 9.5% higher if firms can commit to pay wages as a function of match quality and 15.5% higher if they cannot.

In this study we apply two econometric techniques: the seemingly unrelated regression approach and a Bayesian estimator for panel data models with factor structural errors, to allow for CSD within a particular sector. By applying these models to monthly stock returns of S&P100 companies from six sectors over 10years, we can capture and measure the heterogeneous impacts of not only observed individual company accounting fundamentals and market-wide common shocks, but also unobservable sector-wide common shocks. Results from the empirical study show that the impacts from both observed factors and unobserved sector-wide common shocks vary markedly across companies. After controlling for observed accounting fundamentals and market-wide common factors, a considerable proportion of the variation in stock returns can be attributed to unobservable sector-wide common shocks.","[Hong, Kihoon Jimmy] Hongik Univ, Coll Business, Seoul, South Korea; [Peng, Bin] Univ Technol Sydney, Econ Discipline Grp, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Zhang, Xiaohui] Murdoch Univ, Sch Management & Governance, Perth, WA 6150, Australia",Hongik University; University of Technology Sydney; Murdoch University,"Zhang, XH (通讯作者)，Murdoch Univ, Sch Management & Governance, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.",xiaohui.zhang@murdoch.edu.au,,,"University of Technology, Sydney, Business School","University of Technology, Sydney, Business School","We would like to thank Steve Satchell, Yong Woong Lee and seminar participants at University of Technology, Sydney for their useful comments and discussions.

However, an allocation scheme of the risk measure VaR can be portfolio-invariant only under the asymptotically single-risk factor (ASRF) framework, which understates the economic capital of a highly concentrated portfolio in a multi-risk factor environment. This study proposes a portfolio-invariant capital allocation scheme of VaR of an asymptotically fine-grained portfolio in a multi-risk factor environment. To penalize the concentration risk, the strategy for the proposed capital allocation scheme is to estimate the second-order polynomial that approximates the risk measure VaR using the response surface methodology (RSM). Comparisons are made between the proposed capital allocation scheme to three other capital allocation schemes including the approximated Euler capital allocation scheme, and the schemes based on the approximated single-risk factor approach and the diversification factor approach, respectively. The results indicate that the proposed RSM allocation scheme is the only scheme among the four that is portfolio-invariant and penalizes the sectors with concentrated exposures.

This study uses propensity score matching to evaluate the success of an active labour market policy (the Welsh Assembly's 'Want2Work' programme) that cannot otherwise be evaluated using standard parametric techniques. Using a range of matching and estimation methods, sub-samples and types of job, the scheme was successful. Our most conservative estimate indicates that participants were 7 percentage points more likely to find employment than a control group of non-treated job-seekers. The method adopted here is a useful addition to the real world policy evaluation tool kit, where programme effectiveness needs to be judged in the absence of an established control group. Our results provide evidence that even those who are currently out of the labour market and on health related benefits can find work with the help of appropriately designed support.

Given two asymmetric regions, we show that under the Nash equilibrium the more productive region tends to spend more on public input, which results in this region attracting more capital than the less productive region. The comparison of the two equilibria reveals that the leader region obtains a first-mover advantage under the Stackelberg setting. This suggests that if regions interact with each other sequentially as in the Stackelberg equilibrium, then the regional disparity that is due to the heterogeneity of productivity is likely to be mitigated or enlarged, depending on which region performs the leadership role in the competition process.","[Liu, Yongzheng] Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Martinez-Vazquez, Jorge] Georgia State Univ, Int Ctr Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",Renmin University of China; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Liu, YZ (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yongzheng.liu@ruc.edu.cn; jorge-martinez@gsu.edu,,,Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of the Ministry of Education of China [NCET-13-0573]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-37572],Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of the Ministry of Education of China(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"We would like to thank two anonymous referees, James Alm, Sally Wallace, Yongsheng Xu, and seminar participants at the 67th Congress of the International Institute of Public Finance (IIPF) for their comments and helpful suggestions.

Several indicators of competition are used, and I control for a range of other factors potentially affecting growth. My results provide some support for the importance and positive impact on growth of financial market competition. No other competition area emerges as robust growth driver. The jointness analysis suggests a moderate degree of complementarity between financial market competition and important growth determinants, implying manageable policy complexity.

In particular, we examine an important non-tariff barrier to trade within US fuel economy policythe Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) two-fleet rule. By leveraging the removal of the two-fleet rule upon implementation of NAFTA and exploiting a policy discontinuity based on vehicle characteristics, we present evidence that the costs of offshoring were reduced to a larger degree for varieties that were subject to US fuel economy rules. Specifically, we estimate that prices fell between 5% to 10% for varieties subject to the CAFE two-fleet rule relative to varieties that were exempt from the rule. These effects are persistent, not present for manufacturers that did not offshore prior to NAFTA and are robust to variety-specific trends. These effects also reconcile the post-NAFTA differences in implied compliance costs between cars and trucks for our treatment manufacturer (Chrysler). Overall, the results highlight the potential costs of regional enforcement of otherwise location-neutral product standards, which may act as a barrier to natural patterns of efficient specialization.","[McCalman, Phillip] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Spearot, Alan] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of Melbourne; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Spearot, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",aspearot@gmail.com,"McCalman, Phillip/O-2636-2015","Spearot, Alan/0000-0001-7429-3780",UC Center for Energy and Environmental Economics; UCSC Committee on Research,UC Center for Energy and Environmental Economics; UCSC Committee on Research,"We thank John Ries and two referees for extremely helpful comments.

Representing subjective probabilistic beliefs about a continuous variable as a continuous subjective probability distribution, the methodology involves eliciting partial information about the subjective distribution and fitting a parametric distribution on the elicited data. As an illustration, the methodology is applied to a double auction experiment, where traders' beliefs about the bidding choices of other market participants are elicited. Elicited subjective beliefs are found to differ from proxies such as Bayesian Nash equilibrium beliefs and empirical beliefs, both in terms of the forecasts of other traders' bidding choices and in terms of the best-response bidding choices prescribed by beliefs. Elicited subjective beliefs help explain observed bidding choices better than BNE beliefs and empirical beliefs. By extending probabilistic belief elicitation beyond discrete-choice games to continuous-choice games, the proposed methodology enables to investigate the role of beliefs in a wider range of applications.","[Neri, Claudia] Univ St Gallen, Dept Econ, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Neri, C (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Dept Econ, Varnbuelstr 19, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",claudia.neri@unisg.ch,,,,,,,29,5,8,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

In contrast to increases in overall US tourism to Mexico and rapidly growing trade linkages, day trips to Mexico fell by over 20 % between 2000 and 2012. In the popular press, the reduction in short visits is widely attributed to a rising tide of violence in the Mexican border states, more specifically to a rise in the rate of homicides as a result of the emergence, or radical transformation, of a drug war in Mexico. We show that changes in the US border regime caused a large reduction of day trips and border tourism, and in doing so had a large negative effect on the Mexican border.

The results based on multiple regression techniques highlight the home country's social ills such as corruption, theft and homicide as key determinants. Also included in the regression models, as control variables, are proxies for economic development and geographic proximity to the U.S. Noteworthy is that, alcohol consumption, another explanatory variable, is negatively related to the apprehension incidence in the host country.

Otherwise, they run the risk of mismanaging their ISDM-related investments. The goal of this study is to develop a model that would enable academics and IS practitioners to better examine and understand how different dimensions of the use of ISDM influence strategic business goals of cost leadership, differentiation and cornering niche markets in IS development enterprises. Given the limited literature on the research topic, this study was considered exploratory and theory building in nature. The main result of the presented exploratory study is a clearly defined model for examining how different dimensions of ISDM influence strategic business goals.

The tobit part of the model explores the determinants of the amount donated by each household conditional on being in that class. We extend the standard latent class tobit panel approach to simultaneously include random effects, to allow for heteroskedasticity and to incorporate the inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) transformation of the dependent variable. Our findings, which are based on U.S. panel data drawn from five waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, suggest two distinct classes of donators. There is a clear disparity between the probabilities of zero donations across these classes, with one class dominated by the observed zero givers and associated with relatively low levels of predicted giving. We find clear evidence of both heteroskedasticity and random effects. In addition, all IHS parameters were significantly different from zero and different across classes. In combination, these findings endorse the importance of our three modelling extensions and suggest that treating the population as a single homogeneous group of donors, as is common in the existing literature, may lead to biased parameter estimates and erroneous policy inference. Although we use this model to explain charitable donations, we note that it has wide applicability for researchers across the social sciences. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Because actual inflation remains historically low and data on inflation expectations do not corroborate such risks, warnings for fiscal inflation are often ignored in policy and academic circles. This paper shows that a canonical NK-DSGE model enables identifying an anticipated component of inflation expectations that is closely related to fiscal policy. Estimation results suggest that fiscal inflation concerns have induced a 1.6%-points increase in long-run inflation since 2001. The model also rationalizes why data on inflation expectations do not reveal such concerns outright. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Disagreement varies over time and is positively correlated with general (economic) uncertainty. The degree to which individual forecasters disagree with the average forecast tends to persist over time. Models of heterogeneous expectation formation can be modified by introducing heterogeneous signal-to-noise ratios to match this feature. Furthermore, disagreement about correlations of different macroeconomic variables is high on average. In general, multivariate forecast data can be used more effectively than it has been to estimate models with heterogeneous expectations and to test the mechanisms used to generate disagreement in these models.

In this course it will become mandatory for European countries to publish annual estimates of unfunded public pension entitlements (UPPE) from 2017 onwards. This study describes the methodological concepts behind this new figure of national accounts. After a review of past studies we provide a large cross-country comparison for 18 EU countries and discuss a number of possible applications for policy makers and researchers. This includes the measurement of changes in pension obligations due to 2nd pillar pension reforms-observed recently in a number of Central and Eastern European countries. Also the use for estimating the offset between unfunded pension entitlements and savings rates (Feldstein in J Polit Econ 82:905-926, 1974) is discussed. Finally, we show the distribution of households' wealth across Europe including financial wealth, dwellings and UPPE. With respect to the pre-financial crisis year 2006, our data indicate that taking these three wealth categories into account many differences between countries with Beveridgean and Bismarckian pension systems as well as between western and central eastern European countries are eliminated.","[Kaier, Klaus; Mueller, Christoph] Univ Freiburg, Dept Publ Finance, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Kaier, Klaus] Univ Med Ctr Freiburg, Ctr Med Biometry & Med Informat, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg; University of Freiburg,"Kaier, K (通讯作者)，Univ Med Ctr Freiburg, Ctr Med Biometry & Med Informat, Stefan Meier Str 26, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.",kaier@imbi.uni-freiburg.de,"Kaier, Klaus/B-4227-2009","Kaier, Klaus/0000-0003-0837-6945",,,,,62,10,10,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2015,42.0,4,,,,,865,895,,10.1007/s10663-015-9285-3,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CR6UV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361484200010,0

Unlike in models with leapfrogging, granting forward protection, and imposing a non-obviousness requirement reduces growth. In the main case where entrants and incumbents have free access to the same R&D technology, infinite protection against imitation, granted independently of the size of the lead, maximizes growth. If entrants have to engage in costly catch up before they can undertake frontier R&D, growth is maximal for a finite (expected) length of protection against imitation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We compare the optimal fiscal policies derived from the Ramsey allocation problem with those in the centrally-planned economy. The results of this paper are as follows. First, the optimal share of public spending on infrastructure is smaller than its relative contribution in the production function. Next, the optimal share of public spending on education is smaller than its relative contribution in the accumulation of human capital, and does not affect the tax rate of capital income. Finally, the optimal tax rate of capital income is positive if the externality from public productive spending exists.","Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Econ, San Shia 23741, New Taipei, Taiwan",National Taipei University,"Lu, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Econ, 151 Univ Rd, San Shia 23741, New Taipei, Taiwan.",chiahuilu.chlu@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,1,2,0,30,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

This paper shows that a preference for good peers, and therefore stratification, can also emerge endogenously from reputational concerns that arise when graduates use their college of origin to signal their ability.

Itemised deductions provide an incentive for consumers to declare their purchases. This induces a partial shift in the demand from the black market to the legal one, for consumers need a transaction receipt to enjoy the tax deduction. I show that it is possible to increase tax proceeds by choosing a suitable level of itemised deduction, and this, for any level of taxation. Indeed, the cost for the tax authority on the consumers' side is more than compensated for by the extra proceeds generated on the sellers' side.","Univ Barcelona, Barcelona Econ Inst IEB, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Piolatto, A (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Barcelona Econ Inst IEB, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",piolatto@ub.edu,"Piolatto, Amedeo/Q-4747-2018","Piolatto, Amedeo/0000-0002-3571-8069",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2012-37131]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2014SGR420],Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya),"Part of the research was conducted at the Universitat d'Alacant and at Tilburg University, I am grateful to both institutions.

Because consumers are well aware of their price and quantity decisions it is likely that consumer demand for CO2 emissions from motor-gasoline are quite responsive to the overall state of the economy. Using a structurally identified Markov-switching demand model I find that CO2 emissions respond asymmetrically to changes in income and the price of gasoline in expansionary and contracting states of the economy.

A feature of our modelling approach is that we employ a Markov switching model in which we allow for both the presence of possible asymmetries within, and across, regimes and for the variance in the error term to switch over time. The extent of within-regime asymmetry is found to be much stronger than across-regime asymmetry. We provide evidence of a weakening of Okun's law since the 1981-1982 recession. We also show that jobless recovery, as witnessed most recently in the aftermath of the global financial crisis (GFC), is not a new phenomenon in the US, but also dates back to the early 1980s recession. We conclude through providing insights into the US jobless recovery and offering suggestions, based on our findings, for reducing the adverse effect of recessions in the future.

Such a conception of the world's structure seems to invite mathematical treatment. Yet, his economics is not a mathematical one, and he even explicitly rejected mathematical approach to economics. This apparent puzzle is explained by Menger's failure to deliver in his methodological writings a realistic portrayal of what he was actually doing in his economics. His implicit ambition to retain the full meaning of the natural language concepts while using them simultaneously as theoretical concepts makes his economics dependent on the general human knowledge. Because the latter is mostly non-mathematical, so has to remain the former. This makes his economics both richer as well as fuzzier as compared with mathematical economics.

The status quo established by the 1991 land reform determines the present ownership structure.

Perron (1989) has shown that neglecting structural breaks in unit root tests can lead to erroneous conclusions; therefore, we have used the Carrion-i-Silvestre et al.

By using the Bai and Perron (1998) procedure to identify the structural breaks endogenously, we have been able to show that the WAEMU countries have actually been subjected to several heterogeneous shocks. When these shocks were taken into account in the unit root tests, a stochastic convergence emerged for five countries in the WAEMU. Moreover, additional analysis in terms of beta-convergence showed that Burkina Faso and Mali are engaged in a catching-up process; Togo is converging toward the community average whereas Niger and Senegal are diverging from it.

We show that the presence of such effects in closed economies restricts the ability of the Taylor principle to prevent indeterminacy of the rational expectations equilibrium. The problem is exacerbated in open economies, particularly if the policy rule reacts to consumer-price, rather than domestic-price, inflation.

Specific human capital may allow for specialization gains, but may also lead to allocative inefficiency due to mobility barriers. We analyse the case of Switzerland, which combines a comprehensive, high-quality apprenticeship system with a lightly regulated labour market. To assess human capital transferability after standardized firm-based apprenticeship training, we analyse inter-firm and occupational mobility and their effects on post-training wages. Using a longitudinal data set based on the PISA 2000 survey, we find high inter-firm and low occupational mobility within one year after graduation. Accounting for endogenous changes, we find a negative effect of occupation changes on wages, but no significant wage effect for firm changes. This indicates that occupation-specific human capital is an important component of apprenticeship training and that skills are highly transferable within an occupational field.","[Mueller, Barbara] Univ Bern, Inst Sociol, Project TREE, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Schweri, Juerg] Swiss Fed Inst Vocat Educ & Training, CH-3052 Zollikofen, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Mueller, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Inst Sociol, Project TREE, Fabrikstr 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",barbara.mueller@soz.unibe.ch; juerg.schweri@ehb-schweiz.ch,"Schweri, Juerg/AAX-3879-2020","Muller, Barbara/0009-0002-8442-0151; Schweri, Juerg/0000-0003-2915-3476","Federal Office for Professional Education and Technology (OPET) through its Leading House on the Economics of Education, Firm Behaviour and Training Policies","Federal Office for Professional Education and Technology (OPET) through its Leading House on the Economics of Education, Firm Behaviour and Training Policies","Federal Office for Professional Education and Technology (OPET) through its Leading House on the Economics of Education, Firm Behaviour and Training Policies.",,66,23,25,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We also provide an analysis of students who seek or initially sought an occupation within the clergy. Among our findings, 56% of students report changes in the strength of their religious convictions during college, while 45% report changes in religious service attendance frequency. Of those who matriculate as religious, about 9% lose their religion by graduation. Of those who matriculate with no religious identity, an impressive 33% graduate with one. Choice of institution, major of study, academic success, and many other collegiate experiences are shown to be determinants of these changes.","[Walker, Jay K.] Niagara Univ, Econ & Finance, Lewiston, NY 14109 USA; [Routon, P.

The dictator and public goods games are conducted among rice farmers in irrigated and non-irrigated areas in the Philippines. We find the neighborhood effects but the magnitude and statistical significance of endogenous social effects vary with the irrigation availability, type of social behavior, and type of neighborhood. Altruistic and cooperative behaviors are significantly influenced by the behaviors of neighbors only in the irrigated area, where social ties are strengthened through collective irrigation management. Through this effect, irrigated farmers' social behaviors become similar to those of one another. Neighborhood effects for cooperative behavior are stronger among farm plot neighbors than among residential neighbors, which may reflect their interactions in irrigation management. Although non-dynamic, these findings are consistent with the theory of social norm evolution through common pool resource management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Due to this market power, the interest rate on deposits is relatively low; in particular it is lower than the policy interest rate. This, in turn, leads to a suboptimal level of deposits and, as a result, to a low level of intermediation. Deviations from the Friedman Rule are optimal in this setup regardless of the assumption about price rigidity; since households can hold their assets in the form of cash or deposits, taxing money, which is an imperfect substitute for deposits, is optimal in order to increase the level of deposits and encourage intermediation. The main results of the paper are robust to the introduction of market power in the loan market as well as stickiness in both the deposit and the loan markets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We show that by offering a menu of advance-purchase contracts that differ in when, and for how much, the product can be returned, a firm can more easily price discriminate between privately-informed consumers. In particular, we show that screening on when the return option can be exercised increases firm profits, relative to screening on the size of the refund alone, only if the expected gains from trade are higher for consumers who learn later. We show that in some settings (mean-preserving spread) the firm can achieve the complete-information profits and analyze the optimal contract in other settings (first-order stochastic dominance) in which the first-best allocation is not always feasible.

Social identity is an aspect of self-image based on in-group preferences and a perception of belonging to a social group. We collected survey data from retail clients of the only two banks in the Netherlands that exclusively offer socially responsible investment products and savings accounts. Our data show that almost half of the clients invest exclusively at these banks, whereas the other half also holds at least one conventional investment account. Clients vary widely in the extent to which they identify themselves with socially responsible investments (SRI). Investors with a strong social identification allocate substantially more of their wealth to these banks, both in terms of euros invested and in terms of percentage of their total portfolio invested. Social identification also mediates the effect of expected returns on SRI. Our results further show that social identification is stronger among highly educated, younger and low-wealth investors.

This approach is now used on a routine basis in CGE modelling, the measurement of the deadweight loss of distortions in consumption and a number of other areas in applied economics. Haifa century ago, Barten (1964) and Theil (1965) formulated the Rotterdam model, now an important member of the system-wide family. A path-breaking innovation, this model allowed for the first time rigorous testing of the theory of the utility-maximising consumer. This has led to a vibrant, on-going strand of research on the theoretical underpinnings of the model, extensions and numerous applications. But perhaps due to its European heritage and unorthodox derivation, there is still misunderstanding and a tendency for the Rotterdam model to be regarded with reservations and/or uncertainties (if not mistrust). This paper marks the golden jubilee of the model by clarifying its foundations, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses, elucidating its links with other models of consumer demand, and dealing with some recent developments that have their roots in Barten and Theirs pioneering research of the 1960s.

This review of the symbols most frequently used with reference to the national community also takes under consideration material objects typical of the capital city. Light is shed on how a national identity is subjectively reproduced through official and ordinary celebrations.

We examine the impact of increases in distortionary taxes and reductions in government expenditures on the macroeconomy in both the short and long run. The necessary fiscal adjustments are large and entail substantial macroeconomic costs. These costs are even greater when one takes into account realistic elasticities of the tax base and the fact that Greece is a small open economy. Delaying fiscal adjustment could yield short-term benefits, but ultimately such delays come at a high price unless Greece's creditors are willing to provide additional finance at below-market rates. The basic framework holds the growth rate of the Greek economy fixed. Naturally, fiscal adjustments become less painful under a scenario in which the Greek economy returns to a positive growth path. Whether structural reforms or other policies can generate such growth remains an open question.","[House, Christopher L.; Tesar, Linda L.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"House, CL (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,,14,2,3,0,9,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Public officials allocate budget resources-to various activities delivering public services to citizens. Officials have discretion over the use of resource, and can divert some of them for private ends. Due to a liability constraint, zero diversion can never be obtained in all states. The optimal reappointment mechanism under complete information is shown to exhibit some leniency. In the absence of information a rule with random verification in a pre-announced subset is shown to be optimal. Surprisingly, most common rules make little use of hard information about service delivery when available. By way of contrast, requesting that the public official defend his record publicly can be very useful if service users can refute false claims with cheap-talk complaints: the first-best complete information outcome can be approached.

In this study we integrate location diversification, breadth and corporate governance to examine the performance of Taiwanese enterprises investing in Chinese mainland. Examining Taiwanese manufacturing enterprises from foundational, traditional and high-technology aspects, our findings demonstrate the following: (i) diversifying the location choice negatively affects the return of assets; (ii) investments in regions with an abundant population positively affect the performance of Taiwanese traditional manufacturing enterprises; and (iii) a higher percentage of insider holdings in Taiwanese enterprises results in better FDI performance. We conclude that the performance of FDI originating from Taiwanese enterprises varies depending on industrial and governance characteristics. We suggest that the location choice for Taiwan FDI in Chinese mainland should be determined by the characteristics of the industry.

Additionally, to assess whether there is an income level threshold for a country to benefit from international trade, the sample is broken down into three mutually exclusive groups of countries: low-income, lower middle-income, and upper middle-income countries. The main novelty of the paper lies on the use, on the one hand, of a new and better trade openness measure and, on the other hand, of non-stationary heterogeneous panel cointegration techniques to cope with the problem of cross-sectional dependence. The results show a positive bi-directional relationship between trade openness and income level in the long run, thus suggesting that trade openness is both a cause and a consequence of the level of income. The results for the short run, that is, the link between openness growth and economic growth, go in the same direction.","[Sakyi, Daniel] KNUST, Dept Econ, Kumasi, Pmb, Ghana; [Villaverde, Jose; Maza, Adolfo] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, E-39005 Santander, Spain",Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology; Universidad de Cantabria,"Sakyi, D (通讯作者)，KNUST, Dept Econ, Kumasi, Pmb, Ghana.",dsakyi.cass@knust.edu.gh,"Maza, Adolfo/H-5265-2019; Sakyi, Daniel/O-7916-2017","Maza, Adolfo/0000-0002-7299-3449; Sakyi, Daniel/0000-0002-4231-0061; Villaverde, Jose/0000-0002-5393-091X",,,,,65,70,75,0,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

On the environmental front, indicators such as the share of green space, the ratio of wastes recycled, and decrease in some air pollutants show progress toward being clean and green. Per capita energy consumption has jumped to a high level by international standards, due to industrial structure, but energy efficiency and carbon emissions (per capita and per $ of GDP), have improved.","Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Coll Humanities Arts & Social Sci, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Chang, YH (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Coll Humanities Arts & Social Sci, Singapore, Singapore.",isyhchang@ntu.edu.sg,"Chang, Youngho/JUV-3163-2023",,,,,,25,3,3,2,38,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

This paper investigates the potential relationship between incarceration rates and legal origins in a large cross-section of countries. We argue that legal origins alter the relative costs associated with imprisonment as a means for social control. Using panel data from 2001 to 2011, we find countries with civil legal origins have lower prison populations. Our empirical results are highly robust after controlling for crime rates, criminal justice resources, economic factors, political institutions, and social factors. In addition, our results do not appear to be driven by the variation in criminalized activities. To explain these results, we conjecture that imprisonment is a lower cost mechanism for enforcing social order in common law countries. In civil law countries, bureaucratic infrastructures allow for methods such as day-fines, community service, seizure of property, and probation as more affordable alternatives to imprisonment.

However, rival models have very different implications for other household behaviours, such as consumption. I therefore test between two prominent models in the UK using panel data on consumption and wealth, as well as income, over 1991-2006. To operate the test, I show that long-lived income shocks transmit far less than one-for-one through to consumption, and particularly so for younger households. I then compare these estimates of transmission with estimates of households' ability to smooth shocks, captured by the data on wealth. Conditional on the suitability of the consumption model, my estimates provide evidence against the restricted income process (RIP) and in favour of an alternative heterogeneous income process (HIP). This finding also explains why cross-sectional consumption inequality grew slowly over the period even though the variance of long-lived shocks was high. Finally, I conclude that it is important to consider mean reversion of shocks when constructing life-cycle consumption models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper puts that assumption to the test. Estimating Taylor rules for the ECB using real time data, we find that there is no direct response to the usual instrument of fiscal policy, the cyclical adjusted primary balance. But there is a clear response to the level of debt. Monetary policy tightens by 25 basis points for every 2.5 pp rise in the expected debt to GDP ratio. With ex-post data, we see the opposite: the ECB appears, unfairly since they didn't have the data, to have acted as if it loosened in periods with a forecasted debt build-up (i.e. in recessions), but tightened in response to past fiscal excesses.","[Hallett, Andrew Hughes] George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, George Mason Sch Publ Policy, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Hallett, Andrew Hughes] Univ St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Lewis, John] Nederlandsche Bank, Econ & Res Dept, NL-1000 AB Amsterdam, Netherlands",George Mason University; University of St Andrews; European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV,"Hallett, AH (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, George Mason Sch Publ Policy, 3350 N Fairfax Dr,MS 3B1, Arlington, VA 22201 USA.",ahughesh@gmu.edu; j.m.lewis@dnb.nl,,,,,,,49,4,4,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2015,42.0,3,,,,,499,520,,10.1007/s10663-014-9260-4,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CN2OO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358261800002,0

The overall mean cost efficiency estimate is 0.75, indicating substantial inefficiencies in the banks averaging to 25% of total costs. Findings show that higher capital requirement tends to improve the cost efficiency but more powerful supervisors can adversely affect the efficiency of the banks. The other potential correlates that may help explain the efficiency of the banks are risk and asset quality and bank-specific variables. From a policy perspective, this study is informative to policymakers on the general direction in which to proceed with reforms (i.e., maintain higher capital requirements, curtail powerful supervisors, and enhance private monitoring) and in identifying factors that could contribute to banks' efficiency especially in light of the newly implemented Basel III in the country. In effect, this paper also assesses the readiness of the banks toward the implementation of Basel III. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Following Redding and Venables and Fugazza, we decompose export performance into the gains due to the advantageous access to foreign markets and export gains on the basis of internal supply capacity. We find that size of the economy, inward FDI penetration, most notably in the manufacturing sector, export unit values, denoting the structural changes of CEECs' exports, and the quality of institutions and infrastructure had a significant positive impact on exporting countries' supply capacity, while productivity had a negative impact. The latter is mostly due to unfavourable trends in ULC since EU accession. Unlike in EU-15 and BRIC countries, internal supply capacity is becoming decreasingly important as a basis of CEECs' export performance. At the same time, trends in cost competitiveness are worsening relative to competing countries, while benefits of EU accession have been mostly exploited.

The establishment of development zones affects surrounding firms' TFP, where TFP of newly entered firms decreases in the short term but soon rises rapidly.","[Luo, Deming; Liu, Yanjun; Zhu, Xiwei; Jin, Xiangrong] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Econ, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yiyun] Zhejiang Univ, Social Sci Acad, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University,"Wu, YY (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Social Sci Acad, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",wyyzju@zju.edu.cn,"刘, 严君/GZL-5764-2022; liu, yan/HCI-5542-2022; Wu, Yiyun/JEF-3011-2023; Luo, Deming/AAP-8421-2020; liu, yan/HGV-1365-2022","Luo, Deming/0000-0002-7973-9451","Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang [LY13G030002, LQ14G030011]; Philosophy and Social Science Project of Zhejiang [11JCLJ01YB]; Qianjiang Talent Plan [QJC1402004, QJC1302007]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373235]",Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Philosophy and Social Science Project of Zhejiang; Qianjiang Talent Plan; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Deming Luo acknowledges the financial support from the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang [grant number LY13G030002], Philosophy and Social Science Project of Zhejiang [grant number 11JCLJ01YB] and Qianjiang Talent Plan [grant number QJC1402004].

The main contribution of the article is the idea of discretizing the duration curve. Since any real duration curve can be approximated by a discretized one, the optimal capacity mix for real world situation can be derived using a linear programming software. Then, for the model with the discretized duration curve, we derive the centralized optimal solution. Also, we show that applying marginal cost pricing allows for the recovery of all generation costs when the mix of technologies is optimal. Finally, we present an application of the proposed model to the Peruvian case; we comment and compare the results with the real capacity mix of the system for the years 2008-2013.

Investors live for an arbitrary number of periods, and are asymmetrically informed about future dividends of a risky asset. I compare pricing moments, and the informational content of prices, across economies with different investment horizons. Horizons affect prices through two key mechanisms: as horizons increase, the age-adjusted risk aversion of the average investor falls, and the risk transfer from forced liquidators into voluntary buyers drops. For long enough horizons, there exist two equilibria: a stable, low-volatility equilibrium in which longer horizons reduce price variability and raise average prices, and an unstable, high-volatility equilibrium with the opposite properties. Along the stable equilibrium, longer horizons reduce non-fundamental price volatility and incite more aggressive trading by the informed investors, which impounds their knowledge into prices. Longer horizons thus improve market efficiency, and reduce the uncertainty of the uninformed investors. Expected returns and return volatility are similar to an economy with full-information about fundamentals, even if the informed are relatively few. For short horizons, cautious trading disaggregates information from prices, and the economy approaches one with no private information. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We find that higher risk tolerance and patience in intertemporal choice increase, in general, the level of donations, albeit the effects are non-linear.

I examine the role of family size in mitigating costs that arise due to these frictions. I show that an increase in family size decreases the demand for hired labor in tasks for which worker output and effort are difficult to observe (monitoring intensive tasks). In contrast, in tasks for which worker output is easily observed, I find no relationship between family size and hired labor use. I provide evidence that supervision costs drive the preference for family labor in monitoring intensive tasks. As a consequence, larger families spend less time in supervision. I develop a theoretical framework, that illustrates the empirical challenge of identifying the link between family size and labor demand: factors that determine labor demand on the farm also determine family size. To address this endogeneity problem, I use exogenous variation in fertility induced by both a family planning policy in India, which provides cash incentives for sterilization take up, and income shocks. I show that while neither incentive payments nor income shocks by themselves are valid instruments for completed fertility, their interaction is a valid instrument. I infer that population control policies must take into account market inefficiencies that make larger families profitable.

The concept of equilibrium is very widely referred to in his writings, not only as a tool to be used in the analytical apparatus, as is usually stressed, but also and more important as an element that characterises the evolutionary framework of his analysis. In the Marshallian investigation of economic and social matters, the term 'equilibrium' indicates an indispensable degree of order, whereas 'evolution' denotes a vital continuous process that characterises every economic and social body. The particular relation between equilibrium and evolution which characterises Marshall's approach allows us to better understand the balanced interplay between order and process, two categories that, in Marshall, pervade every aspect of society considered as a highly complex body.","[Caldari, Katia] Univ Padua, I-35123 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Caldari, K (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",katia.caldari@unipd.it,,,,,,,62,9,9,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In the first step, we estimate the total factor productivity (IVY) of each industry using a Cobb Douglas-type production function. In the second step, we examine the relationship between the level of TFP and the level of FDI in each industry, where we distinguish FDI spillover effects two types: short run and long run. In addition, we test FDI spillover both as an intra-industry effect and an inter-industry effect, also called backward linkage. Our main findings are that the FDI stock increases the TFP, especially through backward linkage, although the TFP level fell in the short run. (C) 2015 Society for Policy Modeling.

We also find that the differences in productivity and employment between booms and recessions are particularly larger for entering plants than for exiting plants.

It is argued that a satisfactory understanding of Hayek's conceptions of 'order' and 'process'aEuroand in particular a clear understanding of those how the two concepts relate to each other in his scheme of thought-requires an appreciation of the ontological categories of 'emergence' and 'emergent properties'. Ultimately, for Hayek the capacity of liberal market economies to co-ordinate people's actions in the face of tacit and dispersed knowledge is an emergent property that arises only when people's interactions are governed by certain sets of rules. This static analysis of the co-ordinative powers of the market as an emergent property of a given system of rules must be supplemented by a dynamic account of the process through which the set of rules in question comes into being. Hayek provides such an account in his account of society as developing through a multi-level evolutionary process. Key implications of Hayek's accounts of order and process for debates about the co-ordinative powers of free market economies are drawn out.","[Lewis, Paul] Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Lewis, P (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, Strand Bldg, London WC2R 2LS, England.",paul.lewis@kcl.ac.uk,,"Lewis, Paul Andrew/0000-0003-4367-7233",,,,,63,21,24,2,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

An infinite horizon model is estimated where labor supply is indivisible and households are ex-ante heterogeneous in their labor disutility and market skills. The model replicates key features of the distribution of employment, wages, and wealth observed in the data. Importantly, it reverses the prediction that employment falls with wealth, a pervasive feature of models without ex-ante heterogeneity. A by product of the model's empirical performance is that it implies labor supply responses to unanticipated wage changes (e.g., Frisch elasticities) that are a half to two-thirds of those recovered from models with only ex-post heterogeneity.

The literature demonstrating this relationship uses rainfall shocks to instrument for income shocks, arguing that in agriculturally-dependent regions, negative rain shocks lower income which incites violence. This identification strategy relies on the assumption that rainfall shocks affect conflict only through their impacts on income. This paper evaluates this exclusion restriction in the context of religious conflict in India. Using data on dam construction, I identify districts that are downstream from irrigation dams and show that income in these areas is much less sensitive to rainfall fluctuations. However, rain shocks remain equally strong predictors of riot incidence in these districts. I explore other channels through which rainfall might affect conflict. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The other supplies estimates of interprovincial trade using provincial input-output tables. We find that China has both a large value and a high growth rate of interprovincial trade, but there still exists a home bias in internal trade for most provinces. In addition, disaggregation by product shows that the manufacturing sector has the largest share of interprovincial trade and this share continues to grow. Finally, the spatial distribution of trade suggests that all provinces can be clustered into a smaller number of trade areas with large intra-cluster trade. Therefore, China's central government should make more effort to reduce local protection, stimulate domestic demand and coordinate interregional trade among local jurisdictions.","[Xing, Weibo] UIBE, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Whalley, John] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Li, Shantong] State Council, Res Dev Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Xing, WB (通讯作者)，UIBE, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xingweibo@uibe.edu.cn; jwhalley@uwo.ca; shantong@drc.org.cn,,"Xing, Weibo/0000-0002-1703-0674",UIBE [XK2014108]; Ontario Research Fund,UIBE; Ontario Research Fund,This study is supported by the UIBE (Grant No. XK2014108) and the Ontario Research Fund.

Using confidential data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 Cohort (NLSY97), I find that granting legal access to alcohol at age 21 leads to an increase in several measures of alcohol consumption. The discrete jump in the alcohol consumption at the MLDA has also negative spillover effects on the labor market outcomes of young adults. In particular, I document that the MLDA is associated with a 1 hour decrease in weekly working hours. However, the effect of the MLDA laws on wages is negative only under certain specifications.

The volatilities of the swap yield and spreads are decomposed into long and short term components enabling an assessment to be made of the strength and direction of the volatility transmission process between the three markets. Strength is measured through the dynamic correlation between the long- and short-term components, while direction is measured through the causality of these components. The contagion effects of key economic events are also considered. The paper presents three key findings. First, cross-market correlations of both short- and long-term components between Japan and the US, and Japan and the UK are very low, which is consistent with weak integration. This would motivate international investors to take advantage of the differential between the lower long-term yields of Japanese Government bonds and the higher long-term yields of US bonds. On the other hand the cross-market correlations between the UK and the US are high, which is consistent with strong integration. Second, contagion exists in both the long- and short-term volatility components of the swap spread, but not on the swap rates. Third, in terms of the direction of transmission, the volatility spillovers (both components) are mostly multidirectional between the markets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Azad, A.

We show that an increase in household mobility favors centralization. This results from two effects. First, mobility increases competition between jurisdictions in the decentralized r,gime, resulting in lower levels of public good provision. Second, while tyranny of the majority creates a gap between social welfare in different jurisdictions in the centralized r,gime, mobility allows agents to move to the majority jurisdiction, raising average social welfare. Our main result is obtained in a baseline model where jurisdictions first choose taxes, and households move in response to tax levels.

In contrast to the other positive instincts, the parental bent is specifically other-regarding in that Veblen described it in terms of utilizing knowledge for the betterment of society. Veblen's parental bent stresses the social embeddedness of humanity and the human instinct to care. Our ability to care is partially predicated on our social roles and the values embedded within those roles. Critically, this is influenced by the configuration of institutions within a society. Care is grossly under-valued. By drawing upon recent contributions to care in the context of an increased financialization of the economy and society, we seek to expand upon Veblen's insight, and to argue that the most significant deficit confronting our capitalist society is not of the fiscal variety, but resides in care.","[Cumbers, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Geog Polit Econ, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [McMaster, Robert] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Polit Econ, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Davis, John] Marquette Univ, Dept Econ, Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA",University of Glasgow; University of Glasgow; Marquette University,"Cumbers, A (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Geog Polit Econ, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,,,,,26,10,10,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Wages are shares of capital outlays sustaining production and circulation of goods; profits are shares of sales. This ensures that the functional distribution of income and the level of output are jointly conditioned by the measure of aggregate demand relative to capital outlays. It is spurious to attribute causal significance to associations between functional distribution and output. The paper develops a series of comparative exercises to consider the relationships between the real wage, output, and distribution once functional income flows are understood not as a sharing of output but in relation to the expenditures funding them. This generalizes and challenges neo-Kaleckian appreciations of those relationships. Finally, the paper advances a new analytical and policy taxonomy concerning growth and distribution, centered on the distinction between the consumption-led regimes recently experienced by the United States, Britain, and many middle-income economies, and alternative investment-led growth regimes that may support the high-growth, high-wage-share evolutions sought by adherents of wage-led growth.","New Sch Social Res, Econ, Nyc, NY 10003 USA",The New School,"Dos Santos, PL (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, Econ, Nyc, NY 10003 USA.",,,,,,,,31,5,7,3,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Contrary to an interest rate shock, however, a positive reserve requirement shock leads to an exchange rate depreciation, a current account improvement, and an increase in prices. The different effects highlight the role of reserve requirement policy as a complement to rather than a substitute for interest rate policy.

His argument remains relevant today, given that many observers claim that higher education is headed for fundamental transformation. These changes are occurring in response to a number of challenges facing higher education in the United States financial, demographic, and cultural, aiming both to reform what is seen by many as a system resistant to change and accountability, and to take advantage of new technologies seen as improving accessibility and convenience for its consumers, the students. I briefly review Veblen's argument by using its general contours as a lens for the major disruptions occurring in higher education today, and specifically the rise of for-profit universities, the expansion of online learning and massive open-online courses (MOOCs), and the growing movement to unbundle the educational experience.","Bucknell Univ, Econ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA",Bucknell University,"Knoedler, JT (通讯作者)，Bucknell Univ, Econ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA.",,,,,,,,81,2,7,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

While there is evidence that between inequality in the last decade significantly declined due to the rapid Chinese growth, within inequality and overlapping went in the opposite direction. Furthermore, with the exception of some Asian countries, the rest of the world has not moved significantly.

We criticize the assumptions of exogenous money supply, 'perfect' international capital markets and inelastic exchange-rate expectations. We show that in a more realistic framework none of the main results of the Mundell-Fleming model on the relative effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies is valid, either in floating and fixed exchange-rate regimes. We conclude that, within certain very asymmetric bounds, the Central Bank has the power to determine the domestic interest rate exogenously even in open economy with free capital mobility and that there is no automatic market mechanism to ensure the automatic adjustment of the interest rate and exchange rate to sustainable levels.","[Serrano, Franklin; Summa, Ricardo] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Serrano, F (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,,,,,,,40,14,17,0,12,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

I utilize the concept of a social process and discuss how unpaid household activities are part of labor, care, recreation, and consumption processes. Next, I explain the importance of introducing economic class and social class processes into the framework, as well as the importance of making a distinction between the two. Economic class accounts for the basics of the capitalist economy, and social class opens contexts of variation. The framework allows for a multidimensionality of individuals and opens the question of unpaid activities varying in categorization based on economic class. Also, it helps the economic analysis of capitalism consider that maintaining a household lifestyle directly involves and pertains to unpaid household activities that are part of each of the delineated labor, care, recreation, and consumption processes.","Wright State Univ, Dept Econ, Dayton, OH 45435 USA",University System of Ohio; Wright State University Dayton,"Todorova, Z (通讯作者)，Wright State Univ, Dept Econ, Dayton, OH 45435 USA.",,,"Todorova, Zdravka/0000-0003-3588-6756",,,,,13,1,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

In a competitive global economy increases in productivity in any country are generally welfare-enhancing. The established industrialized countries can suffer from the collapse of some industries, and from the associated increase in unemployment. We model this process and analyze the interactions between various rigidities that cause it, such as the minimum viable scale of an industry or the number of workers who lack the necessary skills to change jobs. When, under free trade, the technology transfer causes the manufacturing industry to collapse in the home country, it experiences a discrete drop in welfare and the price of the manufactured good rises sharply. Further transfers may reverse these results. The optimal level of protection is the minimum size required to operate. Conditions that make supporting an ailing industry worthwhile can be interpreted in several ways but the conclusion is inescapable: technology transfers fundamentally affect arguments for industry protection at home.","[Leonard, Daniel] Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Business Sch, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Van Long, Ngo] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada",Flinders University South Australia; McGill University,"Leonard, D (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Business Sch, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",Daniel.Leonard@flinders.edu.au,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Using state level variation in legal changes to women's property rights, we show that better property rights for women are associated with a decrease in the difference between female and male suicide rates, but an increase in both male and female suicides. We conjecture that increasing female property rights increased conflict within household and this increased conflict resulted in more suicides among both men and women in India. Using individual level data on domestic violence we find evidence that increased property rights for women did increase the incidence of wife beating in India.

We investigate whether globalization induces parents to want to instill tolerance in their children, the main idea being that this quality would equip children for greater success in a more integrated world. Using a survey measure, we indeed find that globalization enhances the willingness to transmit such social values. More precisely, economic and social, but not to the same extent political, globalization has this effect, as shown by using the KOF Index of Globalization in regression analysis of up to 59 countries. Extreme bounds analysis and outlier tests indicate robustness. Overall, our results suggest that certain kinds of globalization seem able to shape values in ways considered desirable by many.

The present paper shows that a straightforward adaptation of Nash's axioms in a natural economic environment with lotteries does characterize his solution. A similar result holds for Kalai and Smorodinsky's [8] characterization of their solution if and only if the domain contains multiple goods.

We provide a detailed theoretical analysis enabling us to derive relevant bifurcation loci and to characterize the steady-state local stability properties as a function of various structural parameters. We show that local indeterminacy occurs through flip and Hopf bifurcations for a large set of values for the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption, provided that the labor supply is sufficiently inelastic. Finally, we provide a detailed quantitative analysis of the model. Computing, on a quarterly basis, a new set of empirical moments related to two broadly defined consumption and investment sectors, we are able to identify, among the set of admissible calibrations consistent with sunspot equilibria, the ones that provide the best fit of the data. The model properly calibrated solves several empirical puzzles traditionally associated with two-sector RBC models. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

By examining differences in nutritional status of treated younger children and a placebo group of older children, the analysis finds that the program improved the nutritional status of treated children, and most significantly, led to 7 and 15% declines in rates of moderate and severe stunting, respectively, for children aged 12 to 24 months who were exposed to the program for at least 12 months over two years.

Prices for the grants and loans overlapped substantially in order to more clearly distinguish the impact of loan aversion on the decision to take up financial assistance to pursue PSE. The study featured paid experimental decisions (ranging from $25 to $700 in cash and from $500 to $4,000 in education financing), a numeracy assessment, a student survey and a parental telephone survey.

In this model, there are three patterns governing the evolution of wage inequality, but only if the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption is sufficiently low: (a) skill-biased technological change, i.e., technological progress leads to a widening of wage inequality; (b) unskill-biased technological change, i.e., technological progress leads to a contraction of wage inequality; and (c) unbiased technological change, i.e., technological progress is independent of wage inequality. By conducting comparative dynamics of an unexpected permanent increase in research productivity in any sector, which we interpret as the arrival of new general purpose technologies, we show that the property of technological change shifts entirely from unskill-biased to skill-biased. The evolution of wage inequality in the model is then consistent with the shift in the trend in wage inequality beginning in the 1970s in the US economy.","Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Osaka University,"Kishi, K (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",ba000069@gmail.com,,,"Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT)","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","I am grateful to two anonymous referees for their constructive comments and suggestions on an earlier version of this paper and the encouragement of the editor-in-chief (Giacomo Corneo) in submitting a revision.

Nevertheless, being very sensitive to structural characteristics or stages of economic development, the strength of this link differs among countries. This study analyzes the role of energy in economic growth from a geographical standpoint by estimating an aggregate translog production function, with human and physical capital and productive energy use as production factors, within a growth framework. Panel data of 38 major countries for the period from 1995 to 2007 were used. The strength of the link between energy and growth is analyzed for the whole sample and the following relevant country groups: OECD, BRIC, NAFTA, East Asian, East European and EU15 countries. Obtained results show that the calculated productivity elasticities with respect to energy use are positive for all country groups. BRIC countries have higher elasticities, around 0.37, and EU15 countries have lower elasticities, around 0.12. Weak substitutability relationships between energy and capital are observed for all groups, except for BRIC and East European countries, which show complementarity relationships.

The central bank sets the policy rate and can, additionally, control the amount of money by rationing money supplied against eligible securities. Optimal policy under money rationing is shown to enhance welfare in the longrun and in the short-run compared to a conventional optimal policy regime where money supply is not rationed and satiates money demand. Specifically, this property is shown to apply when privately issued debt is eligible in open market operations, which allows the central bank to separately alter costs of borrowing and the size of transactions for which money is required.

Using EU-SILC data covering 16 EU countries from 2005 to 2011 we find that the level of capital income shares is positively associated with the concentration of gross household income. Moreover, we show that the transmission of a shift in capital income shares into the personal distribution of income depends on the concentration of capital income in an economy. At the mean of the distribution of capital income a 1 percentage point increase of the capital share is associated with a 0.8 percentage point increase of the Gini coefficient of gross household income. Our findings imply that in many industrialized countries income inequality has by no means evolved independently from the observed structural shift in factor income towards a higher capital income share over the last decades.","[Schlenker, Eva] Univ Hohenheim, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Schmid, Kai D.] Macroecon Policy Inst, D-40476 Dusseldorf, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Schmid, KD (通讯作者)，Macroecon Policy Inst, Hans Bockler Str 39, D-40476 Dusseldorf, Germany.",e-schlenker@gmx.de; kai-daniel-schmid@boeckler.de,,,,,,,28,11,11,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2015,42.0,2,,,SI,,241,268,,10.1007/s10663-015-9282-6,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,CG5UP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353361700004,0

Meanwhile, the factors that influence the formation of oil trade patterns are identified by constructing four different kinds of spatial econometric models. The findings indicate that most oil exporters have an obvious export focus in North America and a relatively balanced export in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Besides supply and demand factors, technological progress and energy efficiency have also significantly influenced the oil trade. Moreover, there is a spillover effect of trade flow among different regions, but its impact is weak. In addition, oil importers in the same region have the potential to cooperate due to their similar import sources. Finally, promotion of oil importers' R&D investments can effectively reduce the demand for global oil trade. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Accordingly, there is a need to utilise the benchmarking techniques in order to fathom the underlying trends and sources of efficiency and productivity. This paper therefore aims at analysing the productive efficiency and the total factor productivity in the Lithuanian family farms. The research is based on the Farm Accountancy Network Data covering the period of 2004-2009. The Fare-Primont Indices were employed to estimate and decompose the total factor productivity changes. Furthermore, the stochastic kernels were applied to analyse the distributions of the efficiency scores along with the econometric analysis which aimed at revealing the relationships of the environmental variables and the efficiency scores. The results do indicate that the technical efficiency was a decisive factor causing decrease in TFP efficiency for crop and mixed farms. Meanwhile, the scale efficiency constituted a serious problem for mixed farms. Indeed, these farms were the smallest ones if compared to the remaining farming types. Finally, the mix efficiency was low for all farming types indicating the need for implementation of certain farming practices allowing for optimisation of the input-mix.","[Balezentis, Tomas] Lithuanian Inst Agrarian Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Balezentis, Tomas] Vilnius State Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics; Vilnius University,"Balezentis, T (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Inst Agrarian Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania.",tomas@laei.lt,"Balezentis, Tomas/D-8609-2015","Balezentis, Tomas/0000-0002-3906-1711",European Social Fund,European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),This research was financed by the European Social Fund under the Global Grant.,,30,14,14,0,18,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The market is frictionless and features on-the-job search, in that all acceptable vacancies are immediately filled and the employed compete with the unemployed for vacancies. While firms and workers are ex ante identical, the unique equilibrium exhibits a continuous distribution of contracts in which high wage firms have higher retention rates, more motivated workers and higher productivity. The model thus generates dispersion in wages, productivity and human resource strategies, and gives rise to endogenous job ladders. An exogenous increase in on-the-job search increases the quantity of jobs but decreases their quality; with sufficient on-the-job search there is full employment, and wage dispersion rather than unemployment motivates workers.","[Board, Simon; Meyer-Ter-Vehn, Moritz] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Board, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",,,,,,,,54,17,20,1,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The mechanism works better against more distortionary forms of corruption than harassment bribes, provided monetary rewards can compensate bribers for losing the object of the corrupt exchange. Results highlight strong complementarities with policies aimed at improving independence and accountability of law enforcers.

This paper studies the design of optimal unemployment insurance in an economy with unemployment as well as part-time unemployment. Part-time work provides income insurance and serves as a stepping stone to full-time jobs. Unemployment benefits for part-timers reduce the outflow from part-time work to full-time employment. However, such benefits also increase the outflow from unemployment to part-time work, thereby reducing unemployment. We examine the optimal structure of benefits for unemployed and underemployed workers. The results indicate that there are welfare gains from part-time benefits. Moreover, there are welfare gains associated with time limits for unemployment benefits as well as for part-time benefits. The welfare gains from optimal insurance are larger when wages are fixed than when they are flexible.","[Ek, Susanne; Holmlund, Bertil] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Holmlund, Bertil] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Holmlund, Bertil] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Holmlund, Bertil] UCLS, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Holmlund, B (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden.",susanneekspector@gmail.com; Bertil.Holmlund@nek.uu.se,,,,,,,30,5,5,1,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Namely, technical-actuarial links among insurance variables observed in annually published summary balance sheets of life insurers are described by means of an econometric system of linear simultaneous equations. The suggested model is statistically verified and thus it can provide useful economic interpretations. Further, adjusted residual bootstrapping is introduced in this context as a straightforward alternative which can solve possible problems with questionable asymptotic distribution properties of residuals. This technique can be applied e.g. for significance testing purposes. Finally, an important practical illustration of scenario analysis is considered. Such an analysis might be really useful, e.g. for internal calculations of the Czech life insurers, financial planning or stress testing in the framework of Solvency II. Two general approaches are presented: deterministic and stochastic.

Specifically, we consider business-cycle synchronization (correlation of demand and supply shocks) among Chinese provinces during the period 1955-2011. We find that the symmetry of supply shocks has declined after the liberalization initiated in 1978. In contrast, the correlation of demand shocks has increased during the same period. We then seek to explain these correlations by relating them to factors that proxy for interprovincial trade and vulnerability of regions to idiosyncratic shocks. Interprovincial trade and similarity in factor endowments tend to make shocks more symmetric. Surprisingly, foreign trade and inward FDI have little effect on the symmetry of shocks.

Volatility for both variables rises quickly with World War I and its aftermath, stays high until the end of World War II, and drops rapidly until the 1960s. This Postwar Moderation yields the largest decline in volatilities, surpassing the Great Moderation. Conditional on temporary shocks, inflation and output growth are positively correlated. Our model implies that aggregate demand played a key role in inflation volatility fluctuations. Conversely, the two variables are negatively correlated conditional on permanent shocks. Our model suggests that aggregate supply played an important role in output volatility fluctuations. Most impulse responses support an aggregate supply interpretation for permanent shocks. However, before World War I, a permanent increase in output raised the price level at longer horizons, and these responses are frequently statistically significant. This evidence supports the hypothesis that aggregate demand had a long-run positive effect on output during the pre-World War I period.","[Keating, John W.] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Valcarcel, Victor J.] Texas Tech Univ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",University of Kansas; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Keating, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, 334 Snow Hall, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",jkeating@ku.edu,"Valcarcel, Victor/H-5590-2017","Valcarcel, Victor/0000-0002-6642-3239",,,,,44,14,14,0,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

To highlight another potential mechanism, the disincentive effects of labor market taxation and redistribution, we present a simple model that can explain cross-country differences in intergenerational mobility and other previously observed empirical patterns. Empirical tests using data on income mobility, tax rates, and public expenditures largely support the model predictions. We conclude that the common presumption that intergenerational mobility largely measures fairness or opportunity, and the resultant policy recommendations, are premature.

This paper contends that the effectiveness of online feedback mechanisms passes through two channels, namely a 'reputational' effect that has been largely documented in the literature, but also a '(dis)approval' effect that has received less attention. We attempt to isolate these two effects using an experimental approach. For this purpose, we compare two experimental feedback systems that differ in the set of information available to participants. In the first feedback system, each player can observe the feedback profile of the other party, whereas in the second feedback system, this information is private. Our findings indicate that both systems improve cooperation. However, we observe that Private Feedback is less efficient in enhancing trust and trustworthiness than systems in which rating profiles are observed by partners. This finding is due to both a reduction of the number of assigned ratings and a lower impact of private ratings on subsequent decisions. All these results suggest that even if social (dis)approval matters, rating observability and thus reputation remains critical to induce honest behavior and improve efficiency in markets characterized by imperfect information.

The households consume both tradable and non-tradable goods with inelastic labor supply. The economy produces both goods with labor and capital as inputs. Factors of production are mobile across sectors. The effects of monetary policy very much depend on the role of money in the economy as well as relative capital intensities. For example, when the nontraded sector is more capital intensive and households need cash for purchasing tradable goods, higher inflation will generate more investment in the economy leading to a higher level of capital stock and a lower level of net foreign assets in the long run. However, the long run effects are completely opposite if households need real balances for purchasing nontradable goods instead. All other possible cases are examined. We also calibrate the model with standard parameter values for quantitative analysis. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A panel VAR model is employed to assess the dynamic relationships. Our results generally confirm the significant impacts of a monetary shock on real economic activity but the effect of fiscal policy appears to be much weaker from the cross-country perspective. We do not find evidence supporting the twin deficits hypothesis but the positive interaction between inflation and interest rates - the price puzzle - is documented. When bilateral exchange rates and trade deficits (vis-a-vis the US) are used, we find that the BRICS-US bilateral trade balances do not react considerably to currency depreciation shocks, indicating that exchange rates may not play a critical role in the adjustment of large trade deficits for the U.S. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

As a by-product, we find that the inverted-U relationship between inequality and development, that is, the Kuznets' hypothesis, holds only in the Non-IT countries, not in the IT economies.

We show that, with the buy-it-now option, some high valuation buyers buy the item before the start of the auction. In the case of a single seller with many items for sale, this not only reduces the allocative inefficiency, but also increases the seller's expected revenue. In the case of many competing sellers, if sellers choose between the strategies of (i) auction only or (ii) auction, with buy-it-now option, the option of buy-it-now will be used with positive probability in any equilibrium.

This is necessary because the underlying theory is ambiguous and because earlier papers failed to uncover significant results at a higher degree of aggregation. This paper examines the case of Japan and Thailand over the period from 1970 to 2010. We find that slightly more than half of 117 export industries and 54 import industries are affected by volatility in the short run. In the long run, 6 export and 2 import industries are affected positively, and 22 export and 9 import industries are affected negatively. Small Japanese export industries are more likely to be negatively affected, while imports show no differences regarding industry size. In a sectoral analysis, we find some evidence that Japanese exports of manufactures and certain machinery and transport equipment might be relatively more affected by the exchange-rate risk. Raw material imports are least affected. These findings therefore suggest which industries might benefit most by a policy promoting a stable yen.","[Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen; Satawatananon, Kaveepot] Univ Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Hegerty, Scott W.] No Illinois Univ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Northern Illinois University,"Bahmani-Oskooee, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Res Int Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",bahmani@uwm.edu,"Hegerty, Scott/AAF-5659-2020",,,,,,16,2,2,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

This paper reports a laboratory experiment studying whether peer punishment promotes socially efficient behavior in such environments, which have been ignored in most experimental studies of peer punishment. It compares the effectiveness of peer punishment in a linear public good game to the effectiveness of this decentralized enforcement mechanism in two nonlinear social dilemma games: a piecewise linear public good game and a common pool resource game. While peer punishment improves cooperation in these new environments, the impact of punishment is weaker and takes longer to be effective. This appears to be due to the greater complexity of the nonlinear settings, which makes socially optimal choices more difficult to identify.","[Cason, Timothy N.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Gangadharan, Lata] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Monash University,"Cason, TN (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",cason@purdue.edu,"Gangadharan, Lata/X-9890-2019","Gangadharan, Lata/0000-0003-3827-3090","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Center for Environmental Research (NCER) Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program; EPA [R833672]; Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities (CRC) [20110044]; EPA [909242, R833672] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Center for Environmental Research (NCER) Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program; EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency); Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities (CRC)(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency)","We are grateful for valuable comments provided by two anonymous referees, Marco Casari, Nikos Nikiforakis, Elinor Ostrom, Michael Price, Steven Tucker, Jimmy Walker, and audiences at Indiana University (Bloomington), the Universities of Tennessee, Warwick and Zurich, the European Workshop on Experimental and Behavioral Economics and the Australia-New Zealand Experimental Economics Workshop.

In these games a large population of players shares the same strategy set and, while players may have different payoff functions, the payoff of each depends on her own choice of strategy and the number of the other players playing each strategy (not the identity of these players). We show that, the intractability results of [12] and [10] for general games notwithstanding, approximate mixed Nash equilibria in anonymous games can be computed in polynomial time, for any desired quality of the approximation, as long as the number of strategies is bounded by some constant. In addition, if the payoff functions have a Lipschitz continuity property, we show that an approximate pure Nash equilibrium exists, whose quality depends on the number of strategies and the Lipschitz constant of the payoff functions; this equilibrium can also be computed in polynomial time. Finally, if the game has two strategies, we establish that there always exists an approximate Nash equilibrium in which either only a small number of players randomize, or of those who do, they all randomize the same way. Our results make extensive use of certain novel Central Limit-type theorems for discrete approximations of the distributions of multinomial sums. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A computational model is used to assess the resilience of the Czech banking system to interbank contagion, taking into account the size and structure of interbank exposures as well as balance sheet and regulatory characteristics of individual banks in the network. The simulation results suggest that the potential for contagion due to credit losses on interbank exposures was rather limited. Even after the introduction of a liquidity condition into the simulations, the average contagion was below 3.8% of the remaining banking sector assets, with the exception of the period from December 2007 to September 2008. Activation of the asset price channel further increases the losses due to interbank contagion, showing that the liquidity of government bonds would be essential for the stability of Czech banks in stress situations. Finally, the simulation results for both idiosyncratic and multiple bank failure shocks suggest that the potential for contagion in the Czech banking system has decreased since the onset of the global financial crisis.

Subsequently, we estimate a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model to investigate the effects of two types of fiscal policy shock: unanticipated and anticipated. The results are subjected to robustness checks and reveal that the share of ROT households rises after large negative shocks (i.e., oil shock, economic bubble burst, Lehman shock), and then (unanticipated) fiscal policy shock stimulates private consumption more effectively in the high ROT households' period.

To answer such fundamental questions and much more, the European Commission published, in August 2009, its Communication on GDP and Beyond: Measuring Progress in a Changing World. Through a co-operative project, co-chaired by Eurostat and INSEE (France), the ESS acted decisively and established an action plan to be carried out by 2020 in the context of the European Statistical Programme. This plan which also builds on Eurostat's work on Sustainable Development Indicators. For most of these actions, work has either been accomplished or is in good progress. Further challenges lie ahead, including reconciling macro- and micro-data sources on household economic resources and completing the indicators set on Quality-of-Life.

J,"Swagel, P",,,,"Swagel, Phillip",,,"Legal, Political, and Institutional Constraints on the Financial Crisis Policy Response",JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"As the financial crisis manifested itself and peaked in 2007 and 2008, the response of US policymakers and regulators was shaped in important ways by legal and political constraints. Policymakers lacked certain legal authorities that would have been useful for addressing the crisis, notably to use public capital to stabilize the banking sector or to deal with the failure of large financial firms such as insurance companies and investment banks that were outside the scope of bank regulators' authority to resolve deposit-taking commercial banks. Legal constraints were keenly felt at the US Department of the Treasury, where I served as a senior official from December 2006 to January 2009. Treasury had virtually no emergency economic authority at the onset of the crisis in 2007, with the exception of the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund, which was intended for use in exchange rate interventions. As the systemic risks of the financial crisis became apparent, the initial policy response largely fell to the Federal Reserve, which had the authority to act under emergency circumstances. There will inevitably be another financial crisis, and the response will be shaped by both the lessons learned from recent history and the statutory and political changes in the wake of the crisis. The paper thus concludes by discussing changes in constraints since the crisis, with a focus on two developments: 1) the political reality that there will not in the near future be another wide-ranging grant of fiscal authority as was given with the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and 2) the new legal authorities provided in the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, commonly known as the Dodd-Frank law.","[Swagel, Phillip] Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, Int Econ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Swagel, Phillip] US Dept Treasury, Econ Policy, Washington, DC USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; United States Department of the Treasury,"Swagel, P (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Publ Policy, Int Econ Policy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",pswagel@umd.edu,,,,,,,13,11,13,2,11,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Using a flexible approach based on a structural time series model, I have assessed the extent to which price competitiveness and non-price competitiveness affect Italian export behaviour. The results of analysis reveal that Italy has experienced a shift to the left of its export demand, which suggests a decline in the country's international competitiveness since the mid-1990s. More specifically, a 1 % drop in price competitiveness has contracted Italian export volumes by 0.8 %, while a 1 % decrease in non-price competitiveness has narrowed export volumes by 2.9 %. Altogether, these and other findings indicate that erosion to non-price competitiveness plays a role more significant than price in affecting export performances.","Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",University of Calabria,"Algieri, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.",b.algieri@unical.it,,,,,,,62,10,10,3,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2015,42.0,1,,,,,157,183,,10.1007/s10663-014-9257-z,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AZ4IK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348184600007,0

Evidence from a Chinese Experiment,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MANAGEMENT; PRODUCTIVITY; EFFICIENCY; ECONOMICS,"A rising share of employees now regularly engage in working from home (WFH), but there are concerns this can lead to shirking from home. We report the results of a WFH experiment at Ctrip, a 16,000-employee, NASDAQ-listed Chinese travel agency. Call center employees who volunteered to WFH were randomly assigned either to work from home or in the office for nine months. Home working led to a 13% performance increase, of which 9% was from working more minutes per shift (fewer breaks and sick days) and 4% from more calls per minute (attributed to a quieter and more convenient working environment). Home workers also reported improved work satisfaction, and their attrition rate halved, but their promotion rate conditional on performance fell. Due to the success of the experiment, Ctrip rolled out the option to WFH to the whole firm and allowed the experimental employees to reselect between the home and office. Interestingly, over half of them switched, which led to the gains from WFH almost doubling to 22%. This highlights the benefits of learning and selection effects when adopting modern management practices like WFH.

Using data from the Chinese Household Income Project 2002 and the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey 2002, this paper aims to understand the sources of the wage differences between the two countries. The decomposition results show that for men (women), differences in returns to observed wage determinants contribute more to the inter-country wage gap for most of the wage distribution (the part of the distribution beyond the 20th quantile). Differences in returns to industry are especially important contributor to the wage structure effect for males. For females, differences in the returns to education and experience are the important contributors to the wage structure effect at the middle of the wage distribution. At the low end of the female wage distribution, differences in the distribution of education and experience are the main factors. Despite the lower wages, the relatively lower skilled workforce and the less competitive industry, as a result of the less extensive ownership and trade reforms and slower pace of change in education policy, may erode Vietnam's attractiveness.

This paper investigates the degree to which the timing of payments affects behavior in four commonly studied strategic settings: a Prisoners' Dilemma, a Stag-Hunt Game, a First Price Auction, and a Second Price Auction. In general, a two week delay in the date of payment has a comparable effect on outcomes as a substantial reduction in current payoffs. A follow-up study compares individual's own discount rates with their beliefs of others' discount rates and finds that people generally think they are more patient than others. This belief can drive behavior in strategic settings: we find clear evidence for this in the Stag-Hunt Game. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The Arrow-Hansmann theory of hidden action on the part of providers predicts higher quality for not-for-profit suppliers. This prediction has a puzzling lack of support in the empirical literature. We propose a theory that resolves the empirical puzzle and generates additional testable implications. The theory starts with the traditional assumptions of hidden action and supplier altruism. It then incorporates two additional features of real-world markets: hidden information on supplier ability to provide high quality and a variation across buyers in the degree of informational asymmetry. The central prediction of the theory is that quality has a higher variance across for-profits than across not-for-profits. Preliminary evidence from the US market for hospital care is consistent with this prediction.","[Dubrovinsky, Mati] Univ Winnipeg, CD Howe Inst, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada; [Winter, Ralph A.] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of Winnipeg; University of British Columbia,"Winter, RA (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",ralph.winter@sauder.ubc.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors.

Our benchmark model shows that incentives decrease in a severe crisis, but are boosted given a minor crisis since efforts are strategic complements in the former case but strategic substitutes in the latter one. We tested our predictions in a laboratory experiment. The results confirm the effort ranking but show that in a severe crisis individuals deviate from equilibrium significantly stronger than in other situations.

Consistenly with our model and using disaggregated data over 1995-2007 for the 11 founding members of the EMU, we find that trade intensity has a positive direct effect while new trade flows have a negative effect on business cycle synchronization.

The main aim of the paper is thus to challenge the common view that China crowds out exporters from European markets. The paper takes a comprehensive approach in terms of empirical methods and data. We analyze export growth, export market shares, extensive and intensive margins and the dynamics in the number of joint trade links (Dynamic Trade Link Analysis), applying highly disaggregated data at the 6-digit HS level over the period 1995-2010. We show that the most contested markets are those for capital goods and transport equipment, product categories where both regions have gained market shares and comparative advantage. We show-that the number of trade links at the product level where both regions are active has increased substantially, indicating intensified competition. At the same time hardly any trade links were lost, which points against cut-throat competition between CESEE and China. The decomposition of export growth along the extensive versus the intensive margin shows that in line with the literature, the deepening of already existing trade relationships (i.e. the intensive margin) contributed most strongly to export growth in both regions, whereas the contribution of new trade links (i.e. the extensive margin) had only a minor contribution, apart from the instance of EU accession, which boosted the extensive margin considerably. We further decompose intensive margin growth into demand related structural effects and a supplier related competitiveness effect. Both the CESEE region and China successfully intensified their trade linkages above all as a result of their outstanding competitiveness as shown by the econometric shift-share analysis. While this suggests that both regions pursue a suitable export strategy, further diversification of production towards promising new industries and markets will become increasingly crucial for both, especially in face of projected slower EU-15 market growth in the longer run.

Derivative user firms turn out to have better stock market performance especially during period with the tight credit market. Unexpected contractionary monetary policy is negatively correlated with corporate stock return and the negative relationship becomes more significant in case of the derivative non-user firms.

The government's framework of absorbing marketization while maintaining planning control through decentralization has been critical in the development of technological capabilities in manufacturing. Although the nature of economic development after reforms has also widened regional inequalities with the Eastern coastal provinces enjoying higher growth and structural change than the Western and other inland provinces, rising wages suggest that the material conditions of the majority of workers in China have improved.","[Zhang, Miao; Rasiah, Rajah] Univ Malaya, Dept Dev Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Zhang, M (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Dept Dev Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",miaomiao@siswa.um.edu.my,"RASIAH, RAJAH/B-9552-2010; Rasiah, Rajah/X-9122-2019","RASIAH, RAJAH/0000-0002-6654-3011;",,,,,23,12,13,3,65,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Although researchers always blame the deviations from purchasing power parity as the reason for the failure of the monetary model, our analysis indicates that invalidity of Keynesian money demand function is also responsible for unfavourable results.","[Afat, Dincer; Gomez-Puig, Marta] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Theory, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon] Univ Complutense Madrid, Complutense Inst Int Studies, Madrid 28223, Spain",University of Barcelona; Complutense University of Madrid,"Sosvilla-Rivero, S (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Complutense Inst Int Studies, Madrid 28223, Spain.",sosvilla@ccee.ucm.es,"Gómez-Puig, Marta/E-4408-2016; Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon/H-4163-2015","Gómez-Puig, Marta/0000-0001-8349-2829; Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon/0000-0003-2084-0640","Government of Spain; FEDER [ECO2011-23189, ECO2013-48326]",Government of Spain(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government),"This work was supported by the Government of Spain and FEDER [grant number ECO2011-23189], [grant number ECO2013-48326].",,33,1,1,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We rely on a re-examination of the empirical performance of a monetary exchange rate model. This is basically not a new topic; however, we focus on two new questions. First, does the consideration of periods of massive interventions in the foreign exchange market uncover a potential long-run relationship between the exchange rate and its fundamentals? Second, do Forex interventions support the adjustment towards a long-run equilibrium value? Our results suggest that taking periods of interventions into account within a monetary model does improve the goodness of fit of an identified long-run relationship to a significant degree. Furthermore, Forex interventions increase the speed of adjustment towards long-run equilibrium in some periods, particularly in periods of coordinated forex interventions. Our results indicate that only coordinated interventions seem to stabilize the dollar-yen exchange rate in a long-run perspective.","[Beckmann, Joscha] Univ Duisburg Essen, Chair Macroecon, Dept Econ, D-45117 Essen, Germany; [Belke, Ansgar] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Kuehl, Michael] Deutsch Bundesbank, Dept Econ, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Deutsche Bank,"Belke, A (通讯作者)，IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany.",ansgar.belke@uni-due.de,"Beckmann, Joscha/J-4234-2019",,,,,,50,2,2,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper aims to explore this issue, starting from the assumption that a planned and systematic approach to KM, as is used in large companies, is rarely applicable in small organizations. It is more likely that small companies adopt an approach to KM that could be defined as emergent, i.e. KM is not planned rationally and in advance, but emerges and is developed along with time. In the paper, the concept of emergent KM approach will be defined and discussed, and three research questions will be examined: a. Is it possible to detect an emergent KM approach in the practice of small KIBS? b. If so, why small KIBS companies follow an emergent KM approach? c. What particular features this approach can have in those companies? The study is based on the results of a qualitative survey involving several owners and managers of small companies operating in the KIBS sector. The survey uses the case study method, and gives grounds for a preliminary analysis of emergent KM approach is small companies offering KIBS. The findings confirm that it is easy to find small companies adopting an emergent approach to KM: in the analysed cases there were no formal KM plans, despite the fact that they have all introduced various KM practices. This shows that there can be the need to define KM approaches that better fit smaller companies. Two possible implications for managers arise. First, although an emergent approach may be seen as unplanned, companies should at least learn how to be aware of their KM practices that grow from the bottom, and how to develop and establish them properly. Second, for executives to be able to recognize emergent KM practices, notions and elements of KM need to be introduced in their business background and professional education (e.g. how KM fits into an organization, what KM processes are, what KM tools and practices exist). This may be especially important for executives and owners of small companies.","[Bolisani, Ettore] Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, Vicenza, Italy; [Scarso, Enrico] Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, Engn Management, Vicenza, Italy; [Zieba, Malgorzata] Gdansk Univ Technol, Div Management, Gdansk, Poland",University of Padua; University of Padua; Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Bolisani, E (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, Vicenza, Italy.",ettore.bolisani@unipd.it; enrico.scarso@unipd.it; mz@zie.pg.gda.pl,"Zieba, Malgorzata/B-2788-2014","Zieba, Malgorzata/0000-0002-5138-9330",,,,,34,4,4,0,10,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,25,33,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600004,0

This paper examines two roles that informal sector jobs play in the early stages of a worker's career: informal jobs may (i) provide the opportunity to accumulate skills, and (ii) act as a screening device that enables employers to learn a worker's ability. The paper develops a matching model of the informal and formal sectors that can accommodate both roles. Implied hazard rates from informal to formal sectors as a function of tenure are shown to differ depending on the role of informal sector jobs: human capital accumulation or screening. Using the ENOE, a longitudinal employment survey from Mexico, hazard functions are estimated for less-educated workers. The estimated hazard functions indicate that informal sector jobs play an important role by screening young less-educated workers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In a laboratory experiment, contributions indeed fall short of the equilibrium prediction.

Our analysis has two special features. First, apart from the two labour market states - employment and unemployment we consider a third state - out of the labour force. Second, we study net rather than gross flows, where net refers to the balance of flows between any two labour market states. Distinguishing a third state is important because the labour market flows to and from that state are quantitatively important. Focusing on net flows simplifies the complexity of interactions between the flows and allows us to perform a dynamic analysis in a structural vector-autoregression framework.

First, their broad perspectives on economic evolution are compared and contrasted. It is argued that Kuznets assigned a greater role for institutional change in economic evolution and he had a greater interest in the distribution of income and how it changes with economic development. Second, Kuznets' controversial review of Schumpeter's two volume book, Business Cycles, is reassessed. This leads directly to discussion of their differing methodological approaches. Third, their respective views on the determination of economic growth are compared and it is argued that Kuznets' laid a stronger foundation for future neo-Schumpeterian research on economic growth. The paper concludes with some discussion of how evolutionary economists using modern perspectives, such as 'micro-meso-macro', can draw upon the works of these great economists to provide an empirical methodology that can be used to explain economic growth and its fluctuation.","Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Foster, J (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",j.foster@uq.edu.au,,"Foster, John/0000-0002-2601-1539",,,,,36,8,8,4,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Second, stock market valuation affects investments through the channel of corporate financing, supporting the financing hypothesis.

Investments driven by market valuation of firm-specific information have a positive effect on future performance. In contrast, investments driven by market-wide sentiment have a negative effect on future performance.

For each inefficient fund, DEA provides a set of role model funds whose best practices may be emulated for performance improvement. We find that the role models of most inefficient funds consist entirely of funds different from their own type. To overcome this situation, we suggest a multi-step DEA procedure. The procedure starts by categorizing funds on a hierarchical basis. We establish the hierarchy based on the frequency of efficient funds that belong to each fund type. Thereafter, a set of role model funds for each inefficient fund is found by pooling the funds in its own category and the funds that belongs to the categories at the lower levels in the hierarchy and applying DEA. This procedure is repeated by augmenting the pool with funds at the next higher level and so on until all the sampled funds are included. At each step, a set of role models is identified. An inefficient fund can thus reach the efficient frontier in stages. Statistical evidence suggests that membership and proportion of risky assets may have a negative association, and the fund size may have a positive association with fund performance.","[Galagedera, Don U.

Using the mixture models clustering approach of Chris Fraley and Adrian Raftery (2002), we find that provinces can be classified among seven major clusters as a function of standard measures of cyclical characteristics. The results show that while the majority of coastal provinces remained in expansion around the Asian crisis, the nation as a whole was in recession. We uncover that all Coastal provinces are synchronized with the national cycle except Hainan.

The dairy farmers are represented in negotiation with the processors by a cooperative. This research builds a theoretical model of bargaining between the processors and a cooperative. The model is applied to the Florida dairy market to examine price negotiations between Florida milk processors and a dairy cooperative. An expectation maximization (EM) algorithm along with maximum likelihood estimation is used to estimate the econometric disequilibrium model with time series data for the period of October 1998 to May 2009. The results show that the class I price set by the Federal Milk Marketing Order is the major factor influencing the cooperative's supply reservation price. Negotiated quantity and production seasonality affect the processors' demand reservation price. The processors appear to be more patient and have higher average bargaining power (0.8804) than the cooperative (0.1196).

The Excellence Model of the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) provides guidance for companies that wish to achieve excellence and to get better organizational results. Among factors that allow companies to achieve excellence and gain a competitive advantage are the organizational culture (Metri, 2005) and human capital (Wright, McMaham, & McWilliams, 1994), as key components of intellectual capital. The objectives of this research are firstly, to analyze whether the type of organizational culture that facilitates the successful implementation of the EFQM model (Culture of Excellence) also promotes the development of human capital to improve organizational performance, and, secondly, to study whether this human capital exerts an effect on the performance. To this end, it is proposed a model whose relationships have been tested using structural equations and in which organizational culture and human capital are classified according to Cameron and Quinn (2005), and Lepak and Snell (1999) respectively, and organizational performance has been measured by EFQM Excellence Model. The sample was obtained from the SABI database and data was collected through a structured questionnaire via webpage. 200 valid questionnaires were obtained that were answered by 4 managers of each of the 200 organizations. The results of the empirical analysis support the established relationships and also confirm the findings of previous studies, according to which human capital is a source of competitive advantage and is a key intangible variable for improving results.","[Gimenez Espin, Juan Antonio; Jimenez Jimenez, Daniel; Martinez Costa, Micaela] Univ Murcia, Dept Org Empresas & Finanzas, E-30001 Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Espín, JAG (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Dept Org Empresas & Finanzas, E-30001 Murcia, Spain.",jagimenez@um.es; danieljj@um.es; mili@um.es,"Costa, Micaela Martínez/H-7224-2015; Giménez Espín, Juan Antonio/AHB-0213-2022","Costa, Micaela Martínez/0000-0001-8823-6947; Giménez Espín, Juan Antonio/0000-0002-3164-8278",,,,,58,0,1,1,15,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,122,130,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600015,0

They therefore become natural candidates to take over all cyclical policy objectives. This is often the case in policies for controlling capital inflows. Giving the duty of controlling capital flows to central banks, explicitly or implicitly, without giving them the appropriate policy tools, leads to inefficient outcomes. It is clear that when a central bank has to use its interest rate tool to satisfy multiple objectives, it will have to make sacrifices. More subtly, but perhaps more importantly, when central banks incur the cost of capital inflows, mostly in terms of taking the public blame, other policymakers often engage in policies that have the side effect of increasing these flows. It then becomes doubly important to give the capital flow management mandate to the policymaker who fosters the inflows, so their possible negative effects will be internalized.","[Gurkaynak, Refet S.] Bilkent Univ, Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Gurkaynak, Refet S.] Ctr Financial Studies, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Frankfurt, Germany; [Gurkaynak, Refet S.] CESIfo, Oxford, England",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Gürkaynak, RS (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",,"GURKAYNAK, REFET SOYKAN/Y-9672-2018","GURKAYNAK, REFET SOYKAN/0000-0003-4266-7463",,,,,2,1,1,0,1,PALGRAVE,BASINGSTOKE,"HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-137-42768-7; 978-1-137-42766-3,INT ECON ASSOC SERIE,,,2015,154.0,,,,,,82,92,,10.1057/9781137427687.0010,0.0,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF4AA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380610700005,0

In doing so, we overcome a large number of problems that have plagued spatial price index measurement. We identify two important sources of bias. Heterogeneity bias arises from comparing different goods in different locations, and variety bias arises from not correcting for the fact that some goods are unavailable in some locations. Eliminating heterogeneity bias causes 97% of the variance in the price level of food products across cities to disappear relative to a conventional index. Eliminating both biases reverses the common finding that prices tend to be higher in larger cities. Instead, we find that price level for food products falls with city size.","[Handbury, Jessie] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Handbury, Jessie; Weinstein, David E.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Weinstein, David E.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University,"Handbury, J (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,"NSF [1127493]; Zell-Lurie Real Estate Center at Wharton; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1127493] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Zell-Lurie Real Estate Center at Wharton; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We wish to thank Paul Carrillo, Donald Davis, Jonathan Dingel, Gilles Duranton, Zheli He, Joan Monras, Mine Senses, and Jonathan Vogel for excellent comments.

More specifically, we distinguish between two different types of financial reforms, i.e. financial liberalization measures and measures of the quality of bank regulation and supervision (i.e. financial regulation), and study their relationship to bank efficiency separately. Moreover, we analyse whether the impact of financial liberalization on bank efficiency is conditional on the quality of regulation and supervision of the banking system. We apply stochastic frontier analysis to calculate bank efficiency at the individual bank level and use a new and detailed database that measures different aspects of financial reforms. The data-set consists of 87312 bank-year observations covering 61 countries for the period 1996-2005.

Based on the results from the GSADF tests, we find strong evidence of explosive behaviour in the nominal exchange rate and investigate two bubbles there. The first bubble is during 2005-2006 which is determined neither by the relative prices of traded goods nor the relative price of nontraded goods. The second bubble busts in 2008 during subprime crisis period, and which is determined by the relative prices of traded goods but not the relative price of nontraded goods. There is no bubble before 2005 as the exchange rate is under fixed regime. As for this result, some expansionary monetary and fiscal policies are required in China since these are the most efficient and effective under a bubble burst scenario.","[Jiang, Chun; Wang, Yi] Wuhan Univ, Dept Finance, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Chang, Tsangyao] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; [Su, Chi-Wei] Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Feng Chia University; Ocean University of China,"Su, CW (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.",cwsu@ouc.edu.cn,"Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021","Wang, Yi/0000-0003-4363-9421","Ministry of Education Humanities and Social Science Research Project 'The Renminbi internationalization in Asian regional monetary integration based on interest rate parity' [14YJA790049]; National Science Foundation of China project 'The interaction of Chinese interest rate, exchange rate and the balance sheet of central bank and money supply: Empirical analysis and policy implication' [71373187]","Ministry of Education Humanities and Social Science Research Project 'The Renminbi internationalization in Asian regional monetary integration based on interest rate parity'; National Science Foundation of China project 'The interaction of Chinese interest rate, exchange rate and the balance sheet of central bank and money supply: Empirical analysis and policy implication'","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education Humanities and Social Science Research Project 'The Renminbi internationalization in Asian regional monetary integration based on interest rate parity' [grant number 14YJA790049] and the National Science Foundation of China project 'The interaction of Chinese interest rate, exchange rate and the balance sheet of central bank and money supply: Empirical analysis and policy implication' [grant number 71373187].",,99,7,9,4,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Moreover, the mother-child income elasticity increases slightly over children's birth year, while the father-child elasticity is stable, but we do not find any time trend in elasticities. Since mean-regression results may not be informative in fast growing economies, we estimate relative mobility via structural quantile regression models.

Schumpeter, who was by then preparing to leave Germany for his American life-long exile, was twelve years older than Frisch and had a previous intense career as the most frequently quoted economist in the first decades of the century, only to be shadowed later by the glittering triumph of Keynes's 'General Theory'. Comparatively, Frisch was just a young economist with no publications. Furthermore, Frisch invited his colleague to the most daring adventure: to create econometrics as the tool to reconstruct economics as a mathematically based social science. Surprisingly, Schumpeter, who was totally innocent of mathematics, embarked and enthusiastically supported the construction and workings of the Econometric Society, which would become the Olympus of economics since those frightful years of what a novelist called the midnight of the century. This paper presents some evidence on this improbable econometric connection.","Univ Tecn Lisboa, UECE Res Unit Complex & Econ, ISEG Sch Econ & Management, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa,"Louça, F (通讯作者)，Univ Tecn Lisboa, UECE Res Unit Complex & Econ, ISEG Sch Econ & Management, Rua Quelhas 6, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal.",flouc@iseg.utl.pt,,,FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia),FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"Research Unit on Complexity and Economics, ISEG (School of Economics and Management), University of Lisbon.

The abolition of Ontario's Grade 13 generated a very large cohort of high-school graduates that simultaneously entered the Ontario labour market, generating a sudden increase in the labour supply. This provides a rare occasion to measure the impact of cohort size on earnings without the supply shock being possibly confounded with unobserved trends-a recurring problem in the literature. The Census findings suggest that the effect of the supply shock is statistically and economically important, depressing weekly earnings by 5 to 9%. The findings from the Census are supported by the LFS results that suggest that the immediate impact of the supply shock-measured about six months after high-school graduation-is also important.

Buyer groups purchase inputs more economically. In a repeated game, abandoning the buyer group altogether or excluding single firms constitute credible threats. Hence, in theory, buyer groups facilitate collusion. We run several experimental treatments using three-firm Coumot markets to test these predictions and other effects like how buyer groups affect outcomes when group members can communicate. The experimental results show that buyer groups lead to lower outputs when groups can exclude single firms. Communication is often abused for explicit agreements and this strongly reduces competition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

With the subsequent introduction of the Internet and online trading systems in South Korea in 1997, the participation of individual investors in the Korean stock market has greatly expanded. However, few studies have investigated their activities and earning rates. To address this research shortcoming, this study investigates the antecedents of individual investors' earning rates in the Korea stock market by employing multiple constructs of information channels and perceived usefulness. Structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis of survey data collected from 1555 individual investors reveals that the information quality of online trading systems and of companies' public announcements largely determines the individual investors' perceptions of their usefulness, whereas the information quality of two Internet channels (Internet news and other web pages) only moderately affects perceived usefulness. Additionally, the information quality of two TV channels significantly affects perceived usefulness, but the effects are weaker than for the other channels. In addition, our findings confirm a close relationship between the perceived usefulness of information and individual investors' earning rates. Last, we discuss the implications and present suggestions for future research.","[Park, Eunil] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol KAIST, Grad Sch Innovat & Technol Management, Daejeon, South Korea; [Kwon, Sang Jib] Dongguk Univ, Dept Business Adm, Gyeongju, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Dongguk University,"Kwon, SJ (通讯作者)，Dongguk Univ, Dept Business Adm, Gyeongju, South Korea.",risktaker@dongguk.ac.kr,"Park, Eunil/S-9770-2019","Park, Eunil/0000-0002-3177-3538",Dongguk University of Research Fund,Dongguk University of Research Fund,This study was supported by the Dongguk University of Research Fund of 2015.,,57,0,0,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Using the CDM project data, the costs of CERs and their variation across technology and over time and space are estimated by applying alternative functional forms and specifications. Results show that the average cost of CERs decreases with the project scale and duration, scale and duration effects significantly vary across project types, and there is an upward trend in costs. The results also show that the distribution of the projects in the CDM portfolio or a given location does not strictly follow the relative cost structure, nor does the distribution of the CDM projects in different host countries follow the principle of comparative advantage. More than 84% of the CDM portfolio consists of various energy projects with substantially higher costs of CERs than afforestation and reforestation, industrial and landfill gas reduction, and methane avoidance projects, which are only 12% of all projects. While per unit cost of abatement plays an important role in the bottom-up and top-down models to evaluate emission reduction potential and analyze policy alternatives, the findings contradict the presumption of such models that project investors seek out low-cost opportunities. At the aggregate level, the cost of CER by the projects in Asia and Europe is similar but higher than those hosted in Africa, Americas, and Oceania. Yet more than 83% of the projects in the CDM portfolio are located in Asia; more than 69% of the projects are in China and India alone. China appears to have a comparative advantage (i.e., lowest opportunity cost) in energy efficiency projects, while India has a comparative advantage in hydro power projects and Brazil has a comparative advantage in wind power projects. In contrast, energy efficiency category accounts for only 8% of the CDM projects in China, hydro power accounts for 12% of the projects in India, and wind power accounts for 18% of the projects in Brazil. The results provide a basis for evaluating the incentives that the mechanism offers as a cost effective policy instrument that balances greenhouse gas mitigation across sectors and regions, while fulfilling the objective of the convention.

What is the reason for this gap? Are banks perceived to be less risky? This study empirically decomposes CDS premia for 45 major banks and 167 large industrial firms from Europe and the US. It turns out that expected losses are usually somewhat lower for banks than for nonbanks, but expected losses contribute relatively little to the observed CDS premia. CDS spreads for banks and nonbanks differ mainly because market participants require a lower compensation for bearing bank credit risk. The quite persistent difference in the credit risk premia for banks and nonbanks disappears only temporarily during the crisis.","Cent Bank Austria, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",UniCredit Group,"Raunig, B (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Austria, Otto Wagner Pl 3, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",burkhard.raunig@oenb.at,,,,,,,37,10,11,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In fact, when firms are under financial distress, the benefits of tax avoidance outweigh the costs, increasing the incentive to avoid tax. The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008 provides a unique setting to consider whether tax avoidance differs from the pre-GFC and post-GFC periods, and whether firm management is compelled to engage in aggressive tax avoidance during periods of severe financial distress. This study examines the impact of financial distress on tax avoidance and in particular, the impact of the GFC on the association between financial distress and tax avoidance. Based on a sample of 203 publicly-listed Australian firms covering the 2006-2010 period, the regression results show that financial distress is significantly and positively associated with tax avoidance across several proxy measures of tax avoidance and financial distress. More importantly, according to the regression results, the association between financial distress and tax avoidance was magnified on account of the GFC. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Standard microfounded macroeconomic models account for these patterns through exogenous and persistent shocks. In this article, we develop a fully decentralized and microfounded macroeconomic agent-based model, augmented with an opinion model, which produces endogenous waves of pessimism and optimism that feed back into firms' leverage and households' precautionary saving behaviour. A major emergent property of our model is precisely the complex successions of stable and unstable macroeconomic regimes. The model is further able to account for a wide spectrum of macro and micro empirical regularities. Within this framework, we analyse a series of macroeconomic phenomena of key relevance in the current macroeconomic debate, especially the occurrence of deleveraging crises and Fisherian debt-deflation recessions. Our analysis suggests that the relative dynamics of prices and wages and the resulting income distribution along a deflationary path are critical determinants of the severity of the recession and the chances of recovery.","[Seppecher, Pascal] Univ Paris 13, CEPN, CNRS, UMR 7234, Paris, France; [Seppecher, Pascal] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, CNRS, GREDEG, UMR 7321, F-06189 Nice, France; [Salle, Isabelle] UvA, Amsterdam Sch Econ, CeNDEF, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Salle, Isabelle] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Salle, Isabelle] Univ Bordeaux, GREThA, CNRS, UMR 5113, Bordeaux, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite Paris 13; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite Cote d'Azur; University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Bordeaux; CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Seppecher, P (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, CEPN, CNRS, UMR 7234, Paris, France.",pascal.seppecher@univ-paris13.fr,"Salle, Isabelle/GOP-1243-2022","Seppecher, Pascal/0000-0002-9059-9242",EU [320278],EU(European Union (EU)),The author Isabelle Salle acknowledges financial support from the EU FP7 RAstaNEWS project [grant number 320278].,,50,28,29,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

These new datasets are highly valuable for assessing the extent of the integration into the GVCs, and enable international comparisons. Nonetheless, the construction of the input-output tables affects the results, therefore, the data need to be interpreted with caution, especially at the level of industries. Overall, both qualitative and quantitative methods are needed to assess the impact of GVCs on the Visegrad economies.","[Vlckova, Jana] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Vlcková, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",jana.vlckova@vse.cz,,,,,,,87,2,2,0,4,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2111-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,7,37,,,,,,31,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF4CR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380618300001,0

We find that our approximation has a higher power to detect U-shaped breaks and smooth breaks than the linear method if the true data-generating process of exchange rate convergence is in fact a stationary non-linear process. We examine the validity of Taylor rules from the non-linear point of view and provide robust evidence that Taylor rules holds true for seven Central Eastern European countries. These results imply that the choices and effectiveness of the monetary policies in Central Eastern European economies are highly influenced by Taylor rule, and also influenced by external factors originating from the United States.","[Wang, Yi; Jiang, Chun] Wuhan Univ, Dept Finance, Wuhan, Hubei Province, Peoples R China; [Chang, Hsu-Ling] Ling Tung Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat, Taichung, Taiwan; [Su, Chi-Wei] Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Ocean University of China,"Wang, Y (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Dept Finance, 299 Bayi Rd, Wuhan, Hubei Province, Peoples R China.",alicewang@whu.edu.cn; jiachun@whu.edu.cn; hsulingchang@yahoo.com.tw; cwsu7137@gmail.com,"Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021","Wang, Yi/0000-0003-4363-9421",National Social Science Foundation [15BJY155]; Ministry of Education's Humanities and Social Science Research Project [14YJA790049],National Social Science Foundation; Ministry of Education's Humanities and Social Science Research Project,"This research is supported by the National Social Science Foundation (Grant number: 15BJY155), and Ministry of Education's Humanities and Social Science Research Project (Grant number: 14YJA790049).",,78,3,3,0,14,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

The results find that the effect of changes of the share of SOEs is twofold. First, the contraction of SOEs promoted productivity growth, and the promoting effect was skill-biased, which tended to increase the skill premia in China. Second, the drop of product prices resulting from falling SOEs share was more magnificent in skill-intensive industries, which helped to mitigate wage inequality through product prices. The accounted-for portion of price changes by productivity growth was skill-biased, significantly raising skill premia through product prices. However, the portion of price changes accounted for by foreign price was unskill-biased, and world price competition diminished the growing income disparity in China.","[Xu, Yun; Ouyang, Alice Y.] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Chinese Acad Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Xu, Y (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Chinese Acad Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",Xuyun29@gmail.com,,,CUFE Youth Innovation Fund,CUFE Youth Innovation Fund,This work was supported by the CUFE Youth Innovation Fund.,,37,7,7,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Since 2010, Hungarian cultural policy cannot be viewed as one of the governmental sectors separable from prime minister Viktor Orban's concept of power and symbolic politicking. The authoritarian worldview and the nationalist political culture represented by his rule are closely related to what his underlings perform under the rubric cultural policy. After explaining and interpreting the basic pillars of the regime, cultural policies of the first Orban government (1998-2002) are contrasted to his second government represented by the illiberal turn (since 2010). The latter era can be characterized by the dominance of nationalist discourse and symbolic politics referring to the pre-communist past. Propaganda campaigns identify culture as servant of nation, by constantly referring to national culture. In the meantime, alternative, non-state driven cultural initiatives are marginalized and even ghettoized. The Orbcin government in contemporary Hungary aims to colonize culture, although it is unable to reach monopolistic control, due to the diversity of and resistance in that sphere.","[Bozoki, Andras] Cent European Univ, Polit Sci, Budapest, Hungary",Central European University,"Bozóki, A (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Polit Sci, Budapest, Hungary.",bozokia@ceu.edu,,,,,,,40,7,7,1,20,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Policies are executed in the urban sector which sends waves of adjustments in the rest of the economy. I show that with liquidity constraints and immobility in labor and capital, the sector-specific effects are markedly different from those in a one-sector economy. In particular, they are asymmetric and the rural sector lags behind the urban sector during adjustment process. This explains temporary phases of significantly high inflation with uneven sectoral effects which often accompany major reforms in the banking and monetary institutions of such economies, e.g. in case of India.

Borrowing from the literature on property rights, it demonstrates that the emergence of modern', and state-connected money markets was the result of a certain kind of power relationship between rulers and financial capital holders where the two were forced to mutually cooperate; financial systems represented the institutionalization of this mutual cooperation. Specific kinds of colonialism' represent just one special case of a relationship where the latter did not obtain.

This paper investigates whether a child's popularity affects his/her generosity. Our participants - 231 children, six to twelve years old - decide how many of their four colored wristbands they want to share with another anonymous child. We manipulate the visibility of this decision: in treatment Public, the decisions are revealed to the entire class at the end of the game, whereas in treatment Private children's decisions remain secret. In addition, we elicited each child's network of friends using an innovative seating map mechanism. Our results reveal that more popular children are more generous in Public than Private decision environments, while less popular children behave similarly in both cases. Moreover, older children in Public display greater generosity than (i) older children in Private and (ii) younger children in either Public or Private. Finally, in Public, older and more popular children share more than less popular older children, and more than younger children regardless of popularity; whereas, in Private there is no effect of popularity on children of any age. Our findings point to another reason to adopt transparent decision making in teams and organizations: it may promote the generosity of some (perhaps especially popular leaders) without detrimentally impacting the pro-sociality of others.

We analyze the effect of imposing a charge for the individual appropriation of common resources. In our design, withdrawing the maximum amount is the dominant strategy for every player, but the resulting equilibrium is socially inefficient. We find that the presence of a price that is small enough to leave intact the conflict between individual incentives and collective welfare is not effective in reducing appropriation among agents who have previously been acting without it. In fact, the upward trend in the average extraction of common funds continues after the introduction of a price. In an alternative treatment in which we impose copayment from the outset of the experiment, withdrawals are lower than in the free-access baseline. Our results provide insights on the conditions for the effectiveness of co-payment in curbing the over-consumption of public resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We show that in such processes a higher variance parameter may reduce the probability mass of realizations above the expected value. When the volatility approaches infinity, the probability of hitting a barrier above the mean goes to zero. Our finding is in contrast to the common belief that a higher volatility always increases all option values.

We combine data from a novel valuation experiment, in which participants received information about and bid on wines sequentially, with data on participants' wine knowledge to examine knowledge and bid updating. High knowledge participants did not value wines differently, but did update bids more with objective information, such as appellation and expert rating, than did low knowledge participants. Both low and high knowledge participants updated their bids significantly after taste-testing the wines. Our findings provide evidence that knowledge and preference are separable, and that knowledge captures a factor giving consumers the ability to process information to form expectations of product quality. Though both low and high knowledge consumers use sensory information, we find differences in preference for wines based on sensory information between low and high knowledge consumers. Our results suggest that knowledge is an important variable to consider in markets for complex, multi-attribute products. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper we evaluate this reform based on a structural labor supply model with unitary households which has been estimated on the European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions cross-sections 2004-2008. We find that the reform had only small employment effects, most of them being generated through the introduction of a child care deductible. However, to illustrate the employment potential of a shift from universal child transfers to tax deductibles we propose additional simulations showing that such a policy shift would yield an increase in full time equivalents of approximately .70 % of overall employment, with married females increasing their labor supply by up to 1.5 %. While the proposed policy shifts have regressive effects in terms of their distributional impact, we show that phasing-out the tax deductible at higher income allows for the compensation of lower-income households without jeopardizing positive employment effects.","[Hanappi, Tibor Paul] Univ Linz, Linz, Austria; [Hanappi, Tibor Paul; Muellbacher, Sandra] IHS Vienna, Inst Adv Studies, Stumpergasse 56, A-1060 Vienna, Austria",Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Hanappi, TP (通讯作者)，IHS Vienna, Inst Adv Studies, Stumpergasse 56, A-1060 Vienna, Austria.",hanappi@ihs.ac.at,,,Austrian Central Bank [13358],Austrian Central Bank,"For helpful discussion and comments we would like to thank Rudolf Winter-Ebmer, Tamas Papp, Raphaela Hyee and Helmut Hofer as well as the Austrian Central Bank for financial support by means of the Jubilaumsfonds (project 13358)",,42,4,4,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Based on their comparative advantages in a particular market, heterogeneous agents constantly revise their investment portfolios by taking into account the time-varying stock-bond return comovements and the changing market conditions. Agents' collective investment behavior shapes the stock-bond interlinkage, which feedbacks on their subsequent capital allocations. Using monthly US stock and bond data from January 1990 to June 2014, we estimate the vector autoregression model with threshold and Markov switching mechanisms. We find evidence in support of flight-to-quality and show that it is mainly driven by the technical traders who actively sell stocks and buy bonds during periods of high market uncertainty.

In the system model of autocatalytic growth we introduce endogenous and exogenous variables that provide negative feedbacks to material growth and push the economic system into the mature stage of development. Based on general developmental stages for dissipative systems, we identify variables that would uniquely mark the transition to maturity: p.c. energy consumption, GDP and energy consumption distribution, and sector composition of labor and GDP. Empirical findings suggest that the observed groups of economies may have terminated their historic phase of intensive economic growth and are entering the mature stage. This provides a tentative explanation of the observed slow-down of long-run rates of GDP growth in the G7 economies and in Western Europe. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

I use a differences-in-differences approach to examine the effects on teen childbearing, fertility at older ages, educational attainment, and labor market outcomes of the affected women. I also study several outcomes for the first-born children of these women. I find that abortion availability delayed fertility but did not reduce completed family size.

We propose to solve the large CVaR-based portfolio model with weight constraints using penalized quantile regression techniques, which overcomes the difficulties of large scale optimization in traditional methods. We illustrate the method via empirical analysis of optimal portfolios on Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 (HS300) index and Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite (SSEC) index of China.

We control for 35 aspects of study design and employ Bayesian model averaging to tackle the resulting model uncertainty. Our findings suggest that the definition of financial stability and bank competition used by researchers influences their results in a systematic way. The choice of data, estimation methodology, and control variables also affects the reported coefficient. We find evidence for moderate publication bias. Taken together, the estimates reported in the literature suggest little interplay between competition and stability, even when corrected for publication bias and potential misspecifications.","[Zigraiova, Diana; Havranek, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech National Bank; Charles University Prague,"Zigraiova, D (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic.",diana.zigraiova@cnb.cz,"Havranek, Tomas/M-8888-2015; Zigraiova, Diana/N-5920-2017","Havranek, Tomas/0000-0002-3158-2539; Zigraiova, Diana/0000-0002-6195-1091","Czech Science Foundation [15-02411S, P402/12/G097]",Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"We are grateful to Jan Babecky, Pedro Bom, Josef Brechler, Jost Heckemeyer, Martin Paldam, Tom Stanley, Borek Vasicek, seminar participants at the Czech National Bank, participants of the 2014 MAER-Net Colloquium in Athens, and anonymous reviewers of the Journal of Economic Surveys for their helpful comments on previous versions of the manuscript.

Job placement agencies help unemployed persons find appropriate job vacancies by improving their search effectiveness and by sharing job advertisements. These agents cooperate in an artificial labor market where the key economic conditions are imposed. The interactions between the participants are drawn directly from labor market search theory. The main research task was to measure the direct and indirect impacts of labor market policies on labor market outcomes. The global parameters of the ABSAM model were calibrated with the Latin hypercube sampling technique for one of the largest urban areas in Poland. To study the impact of parameters on model output, two global sensitivity analysis methods were used, i.e. Morris screening and Sobol indices. The results show that the job placement agencies' services, as well as minimum wage and unemployment benefits, considerably interact with and influence unemployment and long-term unemployment ratios, wage levels, duration of periods of unemployment, skills demand, and worker turnover. Moreover, strong indirect effects were detected, e.g. programs aimed at one group of job seekers affected other job seekers and the whole economy. This impacts are sometimes positive and sometimes negative.","[Wozniak, Marcin] Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Labor & Social Policy, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Wozniak, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Labor & Social Policy, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland.",wozniac@gmail.com,"Wozniak, Marcin/B-6319-2018","Wozniak, Marcin/0000-0002-3213-229X",,,,,83,0,2,1,1,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,NOV 7,2016,10.0,,,,,,,,201629.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2016-29,0.0,,,53,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EC2BX,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387915600001,0

In a probabilistic voting model, candidates representing two groups of voters compete for office. In equilibrium, the candidate representing the majority wins with a probability that increases in the degree of political disagreement the difference in expected payoffs from the candidates' policies. Prior to the election, the office-motivated incumbent party (IP) can influence the degree of disagreement through policy experimentation a public signal about a payoff-relevant state. We show that if the IP supports the majority candidate, then it strategically designs this experiment to increase disagreement and, hence, the candidate's victory probability. We define conditions such that the IP chooses an upper-censoring experiment and the experiment's informativeness decreases with the majority candidate's competence. The IP uses the experiment to increase disagreement even when political disagreement is due solely to belief disagreement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Undocumented in the existing literature, we offer new evidence that while CSR strengths have little impact on loan covenants, CSR concerns lead to stricter loan covenants. These asymmetric results suggest that while lenders view CSR strengths as discretionary, they are more concerned about value-destroying CSR concerns, which induces the lenders to screen out firms engaging in nonsocially responsible activities and penalize these firms with stricter loan covenants. Combined with the evidence on the CSR-loan spread association in the existing literature, our results provide strong evidence that CSR matters to both pricing and nonpricing terms of loan contracts.","[Bae, Sung C.] Bowling Green State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA; [Chang, Kiyoung] Univ South Florida Sarasota Manatee, Coll Business, Sarasota, FL USA; [Yi, Ha-Chin] Texas State Univ, McCoy Coll Business Adm, San Marcos, TX USA",University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University; Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos,"Bae, SC (通讯作者)，Bowling Green State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA.",bae@bgsu.edu,,,,,,,7,7,7,0,53,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Using the 2010--2012 round of the Asian Barometer Survey, we constructed seven indicators of support for democracy and three socioeconomic classes for Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. The tests of proportions indicate that for each country, a high percentage of each class generally expresses support for democracy. Where inter-class differences are significant, the Oaxaca decompositions reveal that in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand these are largely due to dissimilarities in class characteristics (like average education). In Indonesia and the Philippines, the differences in average class characteristics matter less than the heterogeneous effects of the characteristics. Thus, democratic consensus among socioeconomic classes can be promoted through policies that promote class parity in, say, educational attainment or employment status, but more directly in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand than in Indonesia and the Philippines.","[Capuno, Joseph J.] Univ Philippines, Sch Econ, Quezon City, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman,"Capuno, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Philippines, Sch Econ, Quezon City, Philippines.",jjcapuno@up.edu.ph,,,Philippine Center for Economic Development; Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies at the Albert-Ludwigs University Freiburg; People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union [REA] [609305],Philippine Center for Economic Development; Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies at the Albert-Ludwigs University Freiburg; People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union [REA],"Research grant from the Philippine Center for Economic Development and a visiting fellowship in the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies at the Albert-Ludwigs University Freiburg, with funding support from the People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) [REA grant agreement number 609305] are gratefully acknowledged.",,45,0,0,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

The article adopts the historical data of China's industry from 2003 to 2012, establishes a managerial disposability intensity analysis framework based on the directional distance function, and designs four energy conservation scenarios and nine CO2 emission paths for a total of 36 kinds of alternative policy combinations to predict the win-win development and find the optimal path of industrial ECER from 2013 to 2050. Research shows that on the whole, industry will fail to achieve a win-win development in the future, while 6% growth rate of industrial output, 2.8% growth rate of energy consumption, and the peak of CO2 in 2040 is the most optimum path. At the same time, the feedbacks of ECER constraints on specific industrial sectors are different, there are 16 industrial sectors that can achieve win-win development in the future.","[Chen, C.

Property price bubbles often lead to financial crises; those experienced during the 20th century were often triggered by commercial property price movements. Yet property poses significant challenges for national accountants in producing key economic variables used in informing policy assessment and formulation. To address these challenges, this paper formalizes a framework for measuring prices and quantities of capital inputs for a commercial property. In particular, it addresses problems associated with obtaining separate estimates for the land and structure components of a property, a decomposition of property value that is important for the national accounts, productivity measurement and taxation. A key contribution is to address the problem of estimating structure depreciation taking into account the fixity of the structure. We find that structure depreciation is determined primarily by the cash flows that the property generates rather than physical deterioration of the building. Finally, we provide a framework for the determination of the optimal length of life for a structure.","[Diewert, W. Erwin] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Diewert, W.

The mechanisms differ with respect to the desirable properties they possess and they are compared in terms of efficiency and perceived allocative and procedural fairness. Successful in terms of both fairness and efficiency are two mechanisms that explicitly ask for an assessment of the partners' fair shares and that do not induce agents to exaggerate their assessment of the own fair share.

We show that these questions were central in the deliberations of lawyers in 17th century England, a critical historical juncture that has motivated important institutional theories. We argue that the lawyers held a conceptualization of institutional development that foreshadowed many elements of Darwinism, more than two centuries before Darwin's great contributions. To this end, we first identify a set of features characteristic of Darwinian evolutionary social-science theories. We then match the lawyers' own words to these features, revealing the many congruities between a Darwinian approach and the lawyers' evolutionary model of institutional construction and change.

We contribute to the growing evidence of corporate tax base erosion and profit-shifting by testing multinational companies' ownership links to individual tax havens rather than to groups of them, as is the case with most previous research.

We have ascertained that tax havens are not limited to tiny islands and may actually be found among European countries.

This research provides complementary explanations for nineteen major oil-related countries/regions' macroeconomic effects caused by unexpected oil price changes. It focuses on the macroeconomic performance of oil price shocks from outlier perspective, investigating the inner hidden factors of co-movements between oil price shocks and macroeconomy. Three methods called Empirical Covariance (EC) method, Robust Covariance (RC) method and one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) method are used in the outlier detection. Empirical results show that: (a) one-class SVM method has the best environmental adaptability for detecting the outlier performance of the co-movements between oil price shocks and macroeconomy, followed by EC and RC methods; (b) according to the time axis, the outlier performances of gross domestic production, consumer price index and unemployment rate are all concentrated in 2005-2014, which is highly consistent with the oil price shock process; and (c) according to the spatial axis (countries), four categories with similar outlier performances are obtained. Outlier performance of macroeconomy of oil-related country/region in lower levels seems to be worse than that of the country/region in higher levels, which can be attributed to more attentions paid by higher-leveled oil-related countries on the oil price shock response system to relieve the severe macroeconomic impacts caused by oil price shocks.

This study examines the effect of military expenditure on economic growth in Greece and Turkey, which have higher military expenditure burden among the NATO(1) countries using a modified Barro model. The autoregressive distributive lag bounds testing (ARDL) for cointegration is used to determine the long run effect. A vector error correction model (VECM) has been used to analyze the short run effect between the variables. The military expenditure displays a significant negative effect on economic growth for Turkey for both short and long run.

This literature is mostly, if not exclusively, focused on the impact of Internet on the distribution of sales by product. However, the long tail also raises the issue of a possible change in the usual market structure of cultural industries: an oligopoly with a competitive fringe. To our knowledge, no paper addresses the following question: If the long-tail effect does exist, is it of more benefit to small or dominant publishers? The aim of this paper was to address this issue in the context of the French publishing industry. Our main findings are as follows: (1) the market concentration of the French book industry is lower online than offline and (2) the difference in concentration between the two channels of distribution tended to widen over the period 2004-2010. Strategies adopted by leading publishers on the Web do not allow them to maintain the market share obtained with bricks-and-mortar retailers. Furthermore, we show that the market share lost by dominant firms is captured by small publishers online and by medium-sized publishers in conventional stores.","[Peltier, Stephanie] Univ La Rochelle, LR MOS CEREGE, La Rochelle, France; [Peltier, Stephanie] Univ Sorbonne Nouvelle, IRCAV, Paris, France; [Peltier, Stephanie] Fac Lettres Langues Arts & Sci Humaines, Dept LEA, 1 Parvis Fernand Braudel, F-17042 La Rochelle 01, France; [Benhamou, Francoise; Toure, Mamoudou] Univ Paris 13, CEPN, 99 Ave Jean Baptiste Clement, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France; [Toure, Mamoudou] BETA Univ Strasbourg, PEGE, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France",La Rochelle Universite; Universite Sorbonne Nouvelle - Paris 3; Universite Paris 13; Universite de Lorraine; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Peltier, S (通讯作者)，Univ La Rochelle, LR MOS CEREGE, La Rochelle, France.;Peltier, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sorbonne Nouvelle, IRCAV, Paris, France.;Peltier, S (通讯作者)，Fac Lettres Langues Arts & Sci Humaines, Dept LEA, 1 Parvis Fernand Braudel, F-17042 La Rochelle 01, France.",stephanie.peltier@univ-lr.fr; francoise.benhamou@univ-paris13.fr; toure@unistra.fr,,"PELTIER, Stephanie/0009-0004-2346-9335",French National Research Agency [ANR-08-CORD-018],French National Research Agency(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),This research was supported by a grant from the French National Research Agency (ANR-08-CORD-018).

Monitoring adds value by allowing the principal to reduce the intensity of performance-based incentives, reducing the likelihood of costly termination. We present a novel characterization of optimal dynamic incentive provision when performance based incentives may decline continuously to zero. Termination happens in equilibrium only if its costs are relatively low. In general, the intensity of both monitoring and performance-based compensation can be non-monotonic functions of the quality of past performance. Our results can also help explain puzzling empirical findings on the relationship between performance history and future pay-performance sensitivity and on the linkage between termination, performance, and monitoring. We also discuss implications of our model for optimal security design and endogenous financing constraints. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

When the buyer-seller ratio is low, the equilibrium is separating between related and unrelated individuals. When the buyer-seller ratio is high, the equilibrium is partially mixing because a newly related seller attracts both the related buyer and unrelated buyers. Customer relationships improve welfare by reducing coordination frictions and helping sellers learn about the related buyer's utility. However, an equilibrium is constrained efficient only when it is separating and when the buyer seller ratio is low. Moreover, customer relationships induce microprice dynamics, including sales, even when market conditions are constant.

Using data from the Dutch wholesale market for natural gas where we observe the number of players, spot and forward sales, churn rates and prices, this paper presents evidence that strategic reasons play an important role at explaining the observed firms' hedging activity. Our test for strategic behavior is based on the theoretical relationship between the number of sellers and the incentives to sell forward: if risk-hedging is the only motive behind firms' decision to sell forward, then hedging activity ought to decrease in the number of firms; otherwise, if strategic reasons are relevant, then firms incentives to sell forward should increase in the number of competitors.

We find a strong negative correlation between pre-crisis leverage and the change in spending during the crisis. This reflects that highly levered households spent a larger share of their income than their less-levered peers prior to the crisis, resulting in larger increases in debt in these years. Once we condition on the size of the pre-crisis change in debt, a high level of debt is no longer associated with a larger spending decline. Our results suggest that the larger decline in spending among high-leverage households is the result of a spending normalization pattern that is also found in other years, rather than a causal effect of high.debt levels suppressing household spending during the crisis.

Given the partial integration of both goods and financial markets, what can account for the remarkable global business cycle synchronicity during this period? To address this question, we develop a -two-country model allowing for self-fulfilling business cycle panics. We show that a business cycle panic will necessarily be synchronized across countries as long as there is a minimum level of economic integration. Several factors, including tight credit, made the global economy particularly vulnerable to a global panic in 2008.","[Bacchetta, Philippe] Univ Lausanne, HEC Lausanne & Swiss Finance Inst, Internef 523, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [van Wincoop, Eric] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, POB 400182, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Lausanne; University of Virginia,"Bacchetta, P (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, HEC Lausanne & Swiss Finance Inst, Internef 523, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",philippe.bacchetta@unil.ch; vanwincoop@virginia.edu,,"Bacchetta, Philippe/0000-0001-9233-5040",National Science Foundation [SES-0649442]; Bankard Fund for Political Economy; Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research; ERC Advanced Grant [269573]; European Research Council (ERC) [269573] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Bankard Fund for Political Economy; Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research; ERC Advanced Grant(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We would like to thank three anonymous referees, Antoine Goujard, Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, Anton Korinek, Andrew Levin, Fabrizio Perri, Vincenzo Quadrini, Alan Sutherland, Alan Taylor, Mathias Thoenig, and many seminar participants for suggestions that helped improve the paper.

Using a unique data set in China from 2005 to 2012, we find a significantly different effect of analyst coverage on synchronicity before and after the implementation of important 2009 IPO regulation changes in China. Specifically, we document that analyst coverage reduces synchronicity but that this effect is significant only after 2009. In addition, we extend this research to further distinguish the information production role of underwriter and independent analysts. We find that prior to 2009, underwriter analysts' coverage decreases synchronicity but independent analysts' coverage does not. However, in the post-2009 period, both types of analyst coverage are significantly and inversely associated with synchronicity. Overall, our results support analysts' role as producers of firm-specific information in an emerging IPO market and shows that this role depends on the institutional environment.","[Bai, Xuelian; Wang, Fangjun; Zhang, Junrui] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Wang, FJ (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",wangfangjun@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Fund of China [11CGL062]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71472148]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [sk2016011]; Accounting Expert Training Project of National Finance Ministry [MOF[2015]14],National Social Science Fund of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Accounting Expert Training Project of National Finance Ministry,"This work was supported by National Social Science Fund of China (11CGL062), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71472148), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (sk2016011), and the Accounting Expert Training Project of National Finance Ministry in 2015 (MOF[2015]14).",,35,8,8,4,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Given recent interest in theories of reciprocity and intrinsic motivation and their implications for effort provision, the neoclassical prediction seems less obvious today. To better understand the motivation of these workers, I estimate their labor supply using a real effort experiment. Two results stand out. First, no one theory seems to fit the pooled data. On average, people work considerably harder than the minimum but they do not respond to changes in the wage. Second, pooling the data is deceptive because there seem to be distinct types with differing responses to the wage. Most workers can be classified as reciprocal or intrinsically motivated and, indeed, these types respond as theory would predict: reciprocators return wage gifts with increased effort and extrinsic incentives crowd out motivation for intrinsic workers.

Cost of debt is used as a measure of bank riskiness for the first time in a FHLB study. A two-equation model of FHLB advances and cost of debt is estimated. Three main results are obtained. First, greater reliance on advances by BHCs and THCs is associated with lower cost of debt in the pre-crisis period, and more strongly so during the crisis, because granting of advances sends a positive signal to the market about FHLB's support. Second, greater holding company (HC) cost of debt, as an explanatory variable, is associated with smaller advances as FHLBs restrict advances to riskier HCs. Third, we find no separate effect on the cost of debt from FHLB membership. Our results are robust to 3SLS estimation, used to address endogeneity, and to alternative model specifications. The negative association between cost of debt and advances suggests that BHCs and THCs do not use advances to make riskier loans and that FHLB policies and services have some risk-reducing effects which more than offset the effect of potential moral hazards.","[Deacle, Scott] Ursinus Coll, Collegeville, PA 19426 USA; [Elyasiani, Elyas] Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business & Management, Alter Hall 413, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Elyasiani, E (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business & Management, Alter Hall 413, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",elyas@temple.edu,,,Temple University,Temple University,The second author would like to thank Temple University for Summer Research Grants 2013 and 2014.,,28,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We analyse the trade-off between coordination and learning about candidate quality under different temporal election systems in the context of the U.S. presidential primary system. In our model, candidates with different policy positions and qualities compete for the nomination, and voters are uncertain about the candidates' valence. This setup generates two effects: vote splitting (i.e. several candidates in the same policy position compete for the same voter pool) and voter learning (as the results in earlier elections help voters to update their beliefs on candidate quality). Sequential voting minimizes vote splitting in late districts, but voters may coordinate on a low-quality candidate. Using the parameter estimates obtained from all the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries during 2000-12, we conduct policy experiments such as replacing the current system with a simultaneous system, adopting the reform proposal of the National Association of Secretaries of State, or imposing party rules that lead to candidate withdrawal when prespecified conditions are met.","[Deltas, George; Polborn, Mattias K.] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Herrera, Helios] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Deltas, G (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",,,"Polborn, Mattias/0000-0001-7775-1716",Spanish Ministry of Science [ECO2008-01300]; National Science Foundation [SES-1261016],Spanish Ministry of Science(Spanish Government); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We are grateful for the comments of five referees that helped us enormously to improve the article.

Policymakers typically face a choice between two strategies: targeting criminal groups via law enforcement, and offering producers incentives to engage in alternate activities. Yet, little is known about how the returns to alternate legal activities affect drug supply. We contribute to this literature by examining how shocks to legal commodity prices affect the drug trade in Mexico. Our analysis exploits exogenous movements in the Mexican maize price stemming from weather conditions in US maize-growing regions, as well as exports of other major maize producers. Using data on over 2200 municipios spanning 1990-2010, we show that lower prices differentially increased the cultivation of both marijuana and opium poppies in municipios more climatically suited to growing maize. We also find impacts on downstream drug-trade outcomes, including drug cartel operations and killings perpetrated by these groups. Our findings demonstrate that maize price changes contributed to the burgeoning drug trade in Mexico, and point to the violent consequences of an expanding drug sector.","[Dube, Oeindrila; Garcia-Ponce, Omar; Thom, Kevin] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Dube, O (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",odube@nyu.edu; garcia.ponce@nyu.edu; kevin.thom@nyu.edu,"García-Ponce, Omar/JUU-7937-2023","García-Ponce, Omar/0000-0001-9187-0113",Center for Global Development; America Latina Crime and Policy Network/CAF Development Bank,Center for Global Development; America Latina Crime and Policy Network/CAF Development Bank,"We are grateful to Chris Blattman, Konrad Burchardi, Michael Clemens, Arindrajit Dube, Joseph Kaboski, Nancy Qian, Craig McIntosh, Torsten Persson, Debraj Ray, Sendhil Mullainathan, and participants at the Yale Development Seminar, UCSD Development Seminar, Berkeley Development Lunch, Barcelona GSE Summer Forum 2014, Princeton Political Economy Seminar, the Institute for International Economic Studies Seminar, the Harris School Political Economy Seminar, Stanford Comparative Politics Workshop, Stanford SITE Workshop on Governance and Development, the Kellogg Conflict and Cooperation Conference, the UPenn Conference on Crime in Latin America, LACEA-2013 and the US-Mex Associates Conference, for highly valuable comments and suggestions.

The analysis is based on a large panel for 2031 German municipalities for which we have collected information on municipal budgets as well as the election results and qualification levels of mayoral candidates. We principally use a regression discontinuity design focusing on close elections to estimate causal effects. We find that mayors with prior experience in office have a tendency to reduce the level of local public debt, lower total municipal expenditures and decrease the local taxes, even though these results are only significant in some specifications. In contrast, the education level of the mayor exerts no significant effects on the overall fiscal performance of the municipality. The results are partly surprising as both education and experience are shown to matter greatly in the electoral success of mayoral candidates.","[Freier, Ronny] DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Freier, Ronny; Thomasius, Sebastian] FU Berlin, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Thomasius, Sebastian] German Fed Minist Finance, Wilhelmstr 97, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Free University of Berlin,"Freier, R (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.;Freier, R (通讯作者)，FU Berlin, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",rfreier@diw.de; sebastian.thomasius@fu-berlin.de,,"Thomasius, Sebastian/0000-0003-4683-1785",Fritz Thyssen Foundation [10.12.2.092],Fritz Thyssen Foundation,"We would like to thank Florian Ade, Giacomo Corneo, Peter Haan, Beate Jochimsen, Henrik Jordahl, and Christian Odendahl as well as participants at Seminars at the DIW Berlin, Freie Universitat Berlin, Verein fur Socialpolitik in Gottingen, and the Bertelsmann Foundation.

We estimate wage distributions in the presence of covariates separately for men and women in the public and in the private sectors, and we take advantage of the longitudinal structure of the data to control for selection. We find a positive public wage premium for men and women even after accounting for characteristics and endogenous selection; the observed average gap in hourly wages of 35 log points is reduced to 20 when accounting for observed characteristics, and to 10 once endogenous selection is also taken into consideration. We also find substantial variation in the public premium along the wage distribution once observed characteristics are accounted for. This variation, however, is offset by opposite patterns of selection into the public sector: while we observe positive selection into the public sector at the bottom of the wage distribution, workers at the top of the distribution select negatively into the public sector.

The driving force of the model is the intergenerational conflict over the allocation of the public budget. Successive generations of voters choose fiscal policies through repeated elections. The political power of elderly voters creates the motive for adults to support public investment in the human capital of future generations since it expands future pension possibilities.

In our experiment, the participant makes a selection from a list of differently-valued objects with multiple attributes. We compare presenting information in static form to two methods of interactive presentation. In the first, the participant can manually sort objects by attribute, a capability similar to that found in spreadsheet software. In the second, we present an interactive visual tool that (1) automatically sorts all objects by attribute and (2) uses visual cues for comparisons. Manual sorting capability does not cause an improvement in decisions in this context. On the other hand, the visual tool increases the value of the objects selected by the participant and decreases time spent deliberating. We also find that our interactive presentations affect the decision-making process of participants by changing the number of intermediate options considered. Our results highlight the importance of investigating the effect of technology on information search, and suggest that appropriate interactive visual displays may improve search in practice.

A laboratory experiment,LATIN AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Corruption; Cooperation; Leader; Public goods; Laboratory experiment,FIELD EXPERIMENT; PUNISHMENT; ENFORCEMENT; TRUST; PROVISION; GAMES,"In this paper, we analyze the nature of cooperation in different corruption regimes. In a laboratory experiment with university students in Mexico, individuals play first a corruption game and then a public goods game. The corruption game is divided into three groups: high- and low-monitoring scenarios as well as a control group not exposed to the game. The public goods game is divided into three groups: the standard game, a game with centralized punishment executed by an exogenously assigned leader, and a game similar to the second one, but adding the possibility of counter-punishment. There are four key results. First, there is more corruption in the low-monitoring group. Second, in the public goods game there is less cooperation in the low-monitoring group than in the group with more intensive monitoring. Third, the option of punishment increases cooperation, but the sensitivity to punishment is greater in the high-monitoring (low-corruption) group. Fourth, the option of counter-punishment of the leader decreases cooperation. Our results highlight the importance of corruption in decreasing trust and social capital and show the difficulty of promoting cooperation when corruption is prevalent.","[Campos-Vazquez, Raymundo M.; Mejia, Luis A.] Colegio Mexico, Dept Econ, Camino Ajusco 20, Mexico City 10740, DF, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico,"Campos-Vazquez, RM (通讯作者)，Colegio Mexico, Dept Econ, Camino Ajusco 20, Mexico City 10740, DF, Mexico.",rmcampos@colmex.mx; lmejia@colmex.mx,,"Campos-Vazquez, Raymundo M./0000-0003-0251-5051",Centro de Estudios Espinosa Yglesias (CEEY),Centro de Estudios Espinosa Yglesias (CEEY),We are grateful for financial support from the Centro de Estudios Espinosa Yglesias (CEEY).

We identify Suppes' doctrine with the major deviation from ordinalism that conceives of utility functions as representing preference differences, while being nonetheless empirically related to choices.

In the model economy, young agents need to borrow to finance human capital investments but cannot commit to repaying their loans. Creditors can punish defaulters by banishing them permanently from the credit market. At equilibrium, loan default is prevented by imposing a borrowing limit tied to the borrower's inheritance. The heterogeneity in inheritances translates into heterogeneity in borrowing limits: endogenously, some borrowers face a zero borrowing limit, and some are partly constrained, whereas others are unconstrained. Depending on the initial distribution of inheritances, it is possible that all lineages are attracted either to the zero-borrowing-limit steady state or to the unconstrained-borrowing steady state-long-run equality. It is also possible that some lineages end up in one steady state and the rest in the other-complete polarization.","[Bhattacharya, Joydeep] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA USA; [Qiao, Xue] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Min] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Iowa State University; Tsinghua University; Peking University,"Wang, M (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",wangmin@nsd.pku.edu.cn,"Bhattacharya, Joydeep/HSG-3653-2023","Bhattacharya, Joydeep/0000-0003-3443-9049; Qiao, Xue/0000-0002-4070-9095",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473141]; Beijing Youth Talent Grant [YETP0138],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Youth Talent Grant,"We are grateful to the editor and two anonymous referees for their valuable suggestions.

The two databases are merged at fiscal year frequency and an OLS regression with fixed effect is used to analyze the impact of price target on CEO compensation. The analysis reveals that analysts' price targets affect top executives' compensation: when analysts predict a growth in the share price for a company, the compensation package tilts towards stock options, when analysts forecast a drop in the share price, the compensation package tilts towards cash-based compensation and restricted stocks. I argue that the result is more aligned with the managerial power model of compensation (which assumes the board of directors maximizes managers' compensation) than with the arm's length bargaining model (that states that managers' compensation is set to maximize shareholders' profit).","[Bianchi, Giuliano] Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland, Ecole Hoteliere Lausanne, HES SO, Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland,"Bianchi, G (通讯作者)，Ecole Hoteliere Lausanne, Route Cojonnex 18, CH-1000 Lausanne, Switzerland.",giuliano.bianchi@ehl.ch,,,,,,,24,0,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In particular, we test if gift exchange based on a commonly accepted norm for wage differentiation can emerge in a setting where the wage demands of agents are heterogeneous. We also analyse how communication by principals responds to the unequal wage demands and how it influences agents' decisions about working effort in the presence of varying degrees of bargaining power. We find that differences in productivity and the resulting entitlements lead to differentiation in wages. High productivity agents are offered substantially higher wages than low productivity agents. Results from a control experiment suggest that a large part of this wage markup is related to the future productivity potential of high performers. At the same time, unequal wage schemes do not substantially crowd out effort exertion: we observe no strong detrimental effects from disadvantageous relative wage positions. Certain communication patterns significantly influence effort exertion.","[Bolton, Gary] Univ Texas Dallas, Jindal Sch Management, 800 West Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Werner, Peter] Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; University of Cologne,"Werner, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",gbolton@utdallas.edu; peter.werner@uni-koeln.de,,,German Research Foundation through the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize; German Research Foundation through the research unit Design and Behavior [FOR 1371],German Research Foundation through the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize; German Research Foundation through the research unit Design and Behavior,"Financial support of the German Research Foundation through the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize awarded to Axel Ockenfels and through the research unit Design and Behavior (FOR 1371) is gratefully acknowledged.

Cognitive hierarchy (CH) and level k (LK) are two prevailing structural models that capture such behaviors well. This paper proposes a generalized CH (GCH) model that nests a variant of the LK model, called LM. GCH differs from CH in two ways. First, each lower level's actual frequency is exponentially weighted with a to form level-k's belief on relative proportions; alpha captures stereotype bias. CH assumes no stereotype bias (alpha = 1) and LM assumes extreme bias (alpha = infinity). Second, GCH replaces random choice with minimum aversion for level 0. Level 0s are more likely to choose strategies that never yield the minimum payoff for any of the opponent's strategies. GCH captures behaviors better than CH and LK in fifty-five n x m games from four datasets. Robustness tests using three new games further validate GCHs descriptive strength over CH and LK.

J,"Dogan, B",,,,"Dogan, Battal",,,Responsive affirmative action in school choice,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,School choice; Affirmative action; Minimal responsiveness,MATCHING MARKETS; TRUNCATION STRATEGIES; DESIGN,"School choice programs aim to give students the option to choose their school. At the same time, under-represented minority students should be favored to close the opportunity gap. A common way to achieve this is to have a majority quota at each school, and to require that no school be assigned more majority students than its majority quota. An alternative way is to reserve some seats at each school for the minority students, and to require that a reserve seat at a school be assigned to a majority student only if no minority student prefers that school to her assignment. However, fair rules based on either type of affirmative action suffer from a common problem: a stronger affirmative action may not benefit any minority student and hurt some minority students. First, we show that this problem is pervasive. Then, we uncover the root of this problem: for some minority students, treating them as minority students does not benefit them, but possibly hurts other minority students. We propose a new assignment rule that treats such minority students as majority students, achieves affirmative action, and never hurts a minority student without benefiting another minority student.

The program uses in-kind incentives conditional on achievement of a specific target for academic grades, classroom behaviour and attendance, coupled with information sessions on the importance of educational achievement. In 2012, all indigenous students enrolled in 21 high schools in Queensland were invited to take part in the program. Using a differences-in-differences design, we find that the program improved classroom behaviour and academic grades and reduced unexplained absences for female students only. In contrast, the program improved scores on a standardised national assessment test for male students.

In the first period, there is an incumbent who provides a service. In the second period, there is a contest stage in which the principal selects the next service provider. The agents' effort is non-contractible and the contest stage is the mechanism to mitigate potential moral hazard problems. The principal takes account of the past service effort in the contest stage by choosing the weight of past effort and the degree of substitutability between past and current efforts. The results show that, when the principal does not value contest effort, considering past effort as the relevant effort in the contest is optimal. When the principal values contest effort and effort cost increases, decreasing substitutability between efforts is optimal. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Sign restrictions are used to identify all the shocks in the SVARs, while being agnostic about the sign of the response of the real exchange rate to a relative monetary policy shock. The large number of sets of impulse responses to be judged by sign restrictions for either retention or rejection is generated by a newly proposed method which utilizes instrumental variable estimation. The responses show an absence of an exchange rate puzzle in each economy. The peak appreciation following a contractionary monetary policy shock occurs with at most a one quarter delay in the small countries and, for the United States, on impact. For the Euro region and Japan, the peak appreciation is in the long. run. There is considerable model uncertainty in the responses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The results suggest that a higher degree of fiscal decentralization leads to lower government consumption volatility. This result holds for the sub-sample of advanced economies, while it is not confirmed for those less-developed. This mechanism seems to work mainly through a lower volatility of the non-discretionary spending, which typically belongs to the central government's policy. We also confirm existing findings according to which country size lowers government spending volatility. Thus, given a minimum level of development, fiscal decentralization reforms can reduce spending volatility by distributing power to sub-central governments, particularly in smaller countries which are usually more prone to volatility.","[Furceri, Davide] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Furceri, Davide] Univ Palermo, Palermo, Italy; [Sacchi, Agnese] Univ Mercatorum, Rome, Italy; [Sacchi, Agnese] GEN, Governance & Econ Res Network, Orense, Spain; [Salotti, Simone] European Commiss, JRC, IPTS, C Inca Garcilaso 3, E-41092 Seville, Spain",International Monetary Fund; University of Palermo; Universita Telematica Mercatorum; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Furceri, D (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.;Furceri, D (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Palermo, Italy.",dfurceri@imf.org; a.sacchi@unimercatorum.it; Simone.SALOTTI@ec.europa.eu,"Salotti, Simone/N-7916-2019","Salotti, Simone/0000-0003-1898-6683",,,,,72,2,2,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

At the optimum, the costs of procuring agents-inputs are compensated by the gains from agents-consumers. We show how such cross-subsidization can be achieved through matching rules that have a simple threshold structure, and deliver testable predictions relating the optimal price schedules to the distribution of the agents' characteristics.

Ultimately, we utilize the recently developed technique of Mallows model averaging to explore the potential of improving upon the predictions through combinations.

It presents an efficient bargaining model incorporating imperfect competition in product markets. This model shows how capital-labor substitution due to capital-augmenting technological progress or other factors, and changes in markups and the bargaining power of workers affect the labor share. Empirical analyses show that there is little support for explanations based on capital-labor substitution. Furthermore, a structural vector autoregression (VAR) model is proposed that can identify the effects of changes in markups and the bargaining power on the labor share. The VAR model applied to the period since the early 1980s demonstrates that both changes are influential, and especially for the manufacturing sector, long-run movements of the labor share are explained almost equally by variations in the markup and bargaining power.","[Kim, Bae-Geun] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Econ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 156756, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Kim, BG (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Dept Econ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",kimbg@cau.ac.kr,,,,,,,27,7,7,2,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

When workers are purely selfish, the tournament outperforms independent bonus contracts, while the result is reversed for envious workers if the firm's commitment ability is sufficiently high. Moreover, bonus contracts may become superior more often as envy among workers gets more pronounced.","[Kragl, Jenny] EBS Univ Wirtschaft & Recht, EBS Business Sch, Dept Management & Econ, Rheingaustr 1, D-65375 Oestrich Winkel, Germany",European Business School (EBS) University,"Kragl, J (通讯作者)，EBS Univ Wirtschaft & Recht, EBS Business Sch, Dept Management & Econ, Rheingaustr 1, D-65375 Oestrich Winkel, Germany.",jenny.kragl@ebs.edu,,"Kragl, Jenny/0000-0003-2533-1271",DFG [DE 1169],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Finally, financial support by the DFG through research grant DE 1169 is gratefully acknowledged.",,66,2,2,0,10,J C B MOHR,TUBINGEN,"POSTFACH 2040, W-7400 TUBINGEN, GERMANY",0932-4569,1614-0559,,J INST THEOR ECON,J.

The findings indicate that under a fixed exchange rate regime, an increase in remittances creates increased demand for nontradable goods, and hence a rise in nontradable inflation, as well as expansion in output of nontradables. Under a nontradable inflation targeting regime, however, a decrease in nontradable inflation and an expansion in tradable goods production are observed following an increase in remittances. A near-zero nontradable inflation rate and managed variability in the nominal exchange rate typify the optimal monetary policy, suggesting that an inflation targeting regime is preferable to a fixed exchange regime under such a scenario. A VAR analysis shows that the dynamics of inflation in El Salvador and the Philippines is in consonance with those observed in the model under the fixed exchange rate and nontradable inflation targeting regimes, respectively.","[Lartey, Emmanuel K.

Little is known about why group effects on economic choices vary. We use a survey method developed in social psychology to measure stereotyped attitudes of one group toward another. These attitudes are then associated with prosociality in five experimental games (also using an unusual amount of individual-level sociodemographic control). We present evidence from an artificial field experiment of a majority group with high status (Vietnamese) exhibiting no disfavoritism toward a lower-status out-group (Khmer) and typical disfavoritism to a second out-group (Chinese). Both Vietnamese and Chinese groups see the Khmer as warm but incompetent, attitudes which seem to activate empathy rather than contempt. The results suggest that measuring between-group stereotype attitudes can be used to predict the sign of cross-group favoritism in other natural settings.","[Tanaka, Tomomi] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Camerer, Colin F.] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91106 USA",The World Bank; California Institute of Technology,"Camerer, CF (通讯作者)，CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91106 USA.",ttanaka@worldbank.org; camerer@hss.caltech.edu,,,Russell Sage Foundation; Betty and Gordon Moore Foundation,Russell Sage Foundation; Betty and Gordon Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation),"The Russell Sage Foundation (TT) and Betty and Gordon Moore Foundation (CFC) supported this research.

Compared with remaining in the European Union, there will inevitably be higher trade costs with the rest of Europe, which accounts for about half of all U.K. trade. This will mean lower trade and foreign investment, and thus lower average U.K. incomes. These trade costs will arise from some combination of tariff and non tariff barriers, and will be larger if there is a hard Brexit, whereby the United Kingdom would leave the Single Market and trade under World Trade Organization rules, rather than a soft Brexit option of staying in the Single Market (like Norway). Calculations using a standard multicountry, multisector, computable general equilibrium model show welfare losses of 1.3 to 2.6 percent, but dynamic models that incorporate productivity effects suggest that these could rise to 6.3 to 9.5 percent. Brexit's supposed benefits such as lower immigration, better regulations, and more trade deals with non-EU countries would do little or nothing to offset these losses. It seems unlikely that voters were fully aware of the magnitude of these costs at the time of the vote.","[Van Reenen, John] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Van Reenen, J (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Van Reenen, John/AAG-9587-2019",,Economic and Social Research Council,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I am grateful for comments from Janice Eberly and participants in the Fall 2016 Brookings Papers conference.

The empirical results suggest that both inflation perception and past actual inflation have significant effects on the formation of inflation expectations, and the Idiosyncratic Adaptive Expectation model is valid in capturing the dynamics of inflation expectations. Investigations of demographic groups provide robust supportive evidence for this novel model. The results suggest that agents are more concerned about inflation perception, which is less costly to understand, than about actual inflation, which entails higher costs. Furthermore, the Granger causality test reveals that more heterogeneous inflation perceptions cause statistically higher heterogeneity in inflation expectations. Compared with rational expectation, adaptive expectation, static expectation and idiosyncratic static expectation models, the Idiosyncratic Adaptive Expectation model is better at capturing inflation expectations empirically. The results have implications for macroeconomic modeling, stressing the significance of perceived and expected inflation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A bubble can arise when the pursuit of status is modeled explicitly, capturing the notion of the spirit of capitalism. Using a parameterized model, I demonstrate the specific conditions for the existence of bubbles and their implications. Bubbles crowd out investment, stimulate consumption, and slow economic growth. I also discuss a stochastic bubble that bursts with an exogenous probability. I show that there could be multiple stochastic bubbly equilibria.

These bubbles had very different effects on investment and debt of manufacturing firms. In this paper I develop a framework to understand the differential effect of two types of rational bubbles. I distinguish between (i) Outside Bubbles, which I define as savers purchasing and selling costless assets not-attached to inputs of production and (ii) Inside Bubbles, which I define as savers buying an input of production (e.g., land or houses) only as a store of value. The model is an OLG economy with savers and entrepreneurs. Savers save to consume when they are old. Entrepreneurs can borrow to invest but they face a collateral constraint. In this environment, rational bubbles can emerge. I show that the size of an Inside Bubble is larger. I also find that when the economy switches from an Outside to an Inside Bubble, manufacturing (or non-housing) investment and debt is lower, consistent with the U.S. experience. Finally, I show that even though steady-state consumption is higher with an Outside Bubble, a social planner would prefer an Inside Bubble when the productivity of entrepreneurs is low.

We apply a multiple-factor panel data model to show that a high degree of market failure is associated with a high ratio of persistent components in the gap between price and equilibrium. As the persistent components will cause the market's instability, we can use the ratio between persistent and mean reverting components as an indicator to supervise the status of the housing market. We investigate the new and second-hand markets in 19 major cities, including 4 municipalities and 15 vice-provincial cities. Through our multiple-factor model, we explore the situation for each city. The results indicate these policies did improve the housing market's efficiency. It is therefore useful for the Chinese government to extend these policies to other areas to include not only big cities, but entire provinces which can improve its economic system efficiency and fairness even when its economic growth is slowing down.

By contrast, due to labor regulations, the high-educated can get stuck in low-wage jobs. We find that a typical recession leaves the wages of the low-educated unaffected, but reduces their working time and earnings by about 4.5% for up to twelve years after graduation. For the high-educated, working time is not persistently affected, but hourly wages and earnings are. This wage and earnings penalty increases with experience, and reaches roughly - 6% ten years after labor market entry. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our findings challenge the popular belief in international circles that there is mistrust between the two communities living in Cyprus. First of all, we find that Cypriots have similar levels of trust towards others in general, although the two communities have different ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic characteristics. Furthermore, we find no inter-cultural differences in trust among Cypriots. However, Turkish Cypriots are less reciprocal towards Greek Cypriots than they are towards members of their own community. Finally, we find that the Greek Cypriots who had at least one parent displaced after the civil war in Cyprus trust Turkish people less compared to those whose parents were not displaced, but no such mistrust exists against Turkish Cypriots. These findings indicate that in terms of trusting behavior, Cypriots on the island are more similar than what is portrayed by the politicians. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It was used as socioeconomic development indicator the Index of Municipal Development (IFDM), provided by the Federation of the State of Rio de Janeiro Industries (FIRJAN). A dynamic spatial panel model was built using the System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM-SYS) to assess the impacts of the sugarcane industry, caused by the expansion of both the cultivated area and the presence of ethanol and sugar processing plants. We found that the presence of a processing plant has a positive effect in the socioeconomic development of the municipality where the plant is located and in neighboring municipalities. Besides, we found a small negative relationship between increases in the amount of area devoted to sugarcane cultivation in a municipality and the IFDM value for that municipality, which can be explained by job losses in the farming sector, most likely by the recent mechanization process of sugarcane harvesting.

We find that, from a welfare perspective, a pay-TV regime always generates inadequate quality and advertising, whereas free-to-air might produce excessive quality and advertising. In the case of asymmetric competition, a pay-TV broadcaster always has a stronger incentive to conduct research and development than a free-to-air broadcaster does.

The 1988 reform where a charitable tax deduction was converted to a credit and the 2000 reform in provincial income taxes provide tax price variations plausibly exogenous to individuals' unobserved heterogeneity. Our estimates on cross-price effects imply that individuals make more time donations as the tax price of charitable donations increases and hence money and time donations are substitutes, as some theories would imply. This contrasts with earlier findings using cross-sectional data.","[Yang, Wei] Univ N Dakota, Dept Econ, 293 Centennial Dr Stop 8098, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA",University of North Dakota Grand Forks,"Yang, W (通讯作者)，Univ N Dakota, Dept Econ, 293 Centennial Dr Stop 8098, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA.",wei.yang@und.edu,,,,,,,29,4,4,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

By the time an assistance program was agreed with the Troika of international lenders, the problem had become so complex that a depositor bail-in was implemented to safeguard financial stability. The bail-in was an ad hoc solution applied for the first time in the eurozone but is now the blueprint for dealing with future banking crises. This paper examines the events for the 18-month period before the two eurogroup meetings on Cyprus in March 2013, and the resolution and restructuring of the two systemic banks of the country with depositor bail-in. We show how delays in dealing with the crisis exacerbated the problem but also how the tools brought into solve the problem had significant unintended consequences that fit the reflexivity principle. Available evidence questions the validity of confidential studies guiding the policy decisions on depositor haircut and supports the argument that the bail-in, as implemented in Cyprus, violated international principles of fairness. We use the analysis to draw some lessons on the use of bail-in for future crises.","[Zenios, Stavros A.] Univ Cyprus, Dept Accounting & Finance, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Zenios, Stavros A.] Wharton Financial Inst Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Cyprus; University of Pennsylvania,"Zenios, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Dept Accounting & Finance, Nicosia, Cyprus.;Zenios, SA (通讯作者)，Wharton Financial Inst Ctr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",zenios.stavros@ucy.ac.cy,"Zenios, Stavros A/F-3346-2013","Zenios, Stavros A/0000-0001-7576-4898",,,,,38,11,13,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2016,43.0,3,,,,,579,606,,10.1007/s10663-015-9306-2,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DR9PW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380229600006,0

The article focuses on the impact of participatory ownership on conflict resolution and social welfare in the presence of asymmetric information and imperfect quality monitoring. We show that in such situations the participatory solution may help solve deadlocks that money transfers to a for-profit operator cannot solve. The analysis highlights three main factors behind this fact. First, a customer-owned cooperative internalizes, at least partially, the external effects generated by the project. Second, the alignment of cooperative members' preferences with those of the social planner reduces (in some cases eliminates) the distortions caused by information asymmetries. Third, cooperatives require less costly monitoring than their for-profit counterparts. We also show that cooperatives' productive inefficiency with respect to for-profits may emerge endogenously as a consequence of a lower pressure to compete on costs for the market.","[Abrardi, Laura] Politecn Torino, Dept Management & Prod Engn, Turin, Italy; [Colombo, Luca] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Finance, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Mori, Pier Angelo] Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Florence, Italy; [Mori, Pier Angelo] Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Euricse, Trento, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Florence; University of Florence,"Mori, PA (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Florence, Italy.;Mori, PA (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Euricse, Trento, Italy.",laura.abrardi@polito.it; lucava.colombo@unicatt.it; pierangelo.mori@unifi.it,"Abrardi, Laura/AAT-3408-2020","Abrardi, Laura/0000-0002-3910-7097",Euricse; Trento; Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Trento e Rovereto,Euricse; Trento; Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Trento e Rovereto(Fondazione Caritro),"We are grateful to the Journal's Editor and two anonymous referees for insightful suggestions that have stimulated substantial improvements over the previous version.

Bearing in mind some recent literature, we improve the R&D technology, by considering that R&D is more labour intensive through time as complexity increases, that the diffusion of designs is affected by coordination, organizational and transportation costs, and that a potential entrant will come up with the right idea is reduced because of the presence of a larger number of entrants. We show that when the economy is not initially in a steady state, it can take a saddle path towards the unique and locally saddle-path stable interior steady state. Both transitional-dynamics and steady-state behaviours of our theoretical model are then consistent with, respectively, the time-series and the cross-sectional evidence.","[Afonso, Oscar] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, OBEGEF, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Afonso, O (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal.",oafonso@fep.up.pt,"Afonso, Oscar/B-6016-2009",,,,,,50,8,10,0,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In the model, the stock and appropriately-deflated price of housing increase with inflation or nominal interest rates. We document this in data for the U.S. and other countries. A calibrated model accounts for up to 52% (87%) of the relationship between interest rates and housing wealth deflated by nominal output (by the money supply).

The U.S. federal government matches every state at least one dollar for each dollar that the state spends on Medicaid. We measure the effect of the subsidy by constructing a multi-regional, heterogeneous-agent, dynamic general equilibrium model with incomplete insurance markets and calibrating it to the U.S. economy. In the model, state governments take the federal subsidy as given and implement Medicaid policy according to the decision of the median voter. The benchmark economy delivers a close approximation to the Medicaid coverage rate in 2012. To measure the effect of the federal subsidy, we set the subsidy to zero and find that state Medicaid coverage declines by 9%. We then study the mechanism determining Medicaid provision and find a positive relationship between progressivity of the tax structure and Medicaid coverage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The jury is out on the extent to which they have lived up to the first promise; they have failed to deliver the second. Anemic global trade growth rates since 2010 imply that trade has not been a driver of much-needed economic dynamism. This paper argues that the G20 should pursue a more ambitious trade agenda and that there is much that greater leadership by the G20 could do to reinvigorate the trading system. A first step would be to commit to concrete actions that can be implemented by individual governments on a concerted basis and that center on reducing trade costs and improving access to services for firms. The Chinese presidency should also seek to have the G20 commit to more effective monitoring and analysis of trade policy broadly defined (including subsidies and investment incentives) and the impact of the many preferential trade agreements involving China, the EU and the USA, the world's largest trading powers.","[Hoekman, Bernard] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Florence, Italy",European University Institute,"Hoekman, B (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Florence, Italy.",Bernard.hoekman@eui.eu,,,,,,,27,4,4,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2016,24.0,4,,,SI,,34,54,,10.1111/cwe.12166,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DR5QM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379957500004,0

Consequently, the entrepreneur will be more likely to take on additional roles beyond providing the essential idea. The evidence supports the hypothesis that, other things being the same, an entrepreneur with a more complex idea will have greater difficulty obtaining outside finance and will be more likely to take on the additional roles of development, production, marketing and distribution that are necessary for successful innovation.

In the model, manufacturers produce new as well as remanufactured products, whereas sellers distribute them. In stable circumstances, this article presents the functional formula of the optimal manufacturing pricing decisions. The results show that when the cost of new products is significantly lower than that of remanufactured ones, manufacturers choose to produce new products only. When the difference between cost of new and remanufactured products is moderate, manufacturers tend to produce both new and remanufactured products, and in some regions, production of new and remanufactured products is proportional to each other. When the difference between cost of new and remanufactured products is enormous, their production and sale tend to stop. Also, this article analyses the effects of varying cost of new and remanufactured products and the recycling rate on pricing decisions of supply chain members. This article contributes to the management of manufacturers' and sellers' remanufacturing decisions and also provides advice on how governments can guide consumer preferences.","[Shu, Tong; Liao, Huaisi; Chen, Shou; Wang, Shouyang] Hunan Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shouyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lai, Kin Keung] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Int Business Sch, Xian, Peoples R China; [Lai, Kin Keung] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Management Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Gan, Lu] Hunan Univ, Off Humanities & Social Sci, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China","Hunan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS; Shaanxi Normal University; City University of Hong Kong; Hunan University","Shu, T (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.",shutong@hnu.edu.cn,"li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023; Gan, Lu/JXX-1314-2024; Lai, Kin Keung/AEB-4278-2022","Lai, Kin Keung/0000-0003-0014-2095; Wang, Shouyang/0000-0001-5773-998X","Natural Science Foundation of China [71172194, 71390330, 71390331, 71221001]; Project granted by Hunan Provincial Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [15YB064]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project granted by Hunan Provincial Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science,"This article is financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 71172194, 71390330, 71390331 and 71221001]; the Project granted by Hunan Provincial Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science in 2015 [grant number 15YB064].",,25,13,13,2,93,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In particular, focusing on fifteen countries whose largest city is a port, I find that an oil price increase of the magnitude experienced between 2002 and 2008 induces the income of cities near that port to increase by 7% relative to otherwise identical cities 500 km farther away. Combined with external estimates, this implies an elasticity of city economic activity with respect to transport costs of -0.28 at 500 km from the port. Moreover, the effect differs by the surface of roads between cities. Cities connected to the port by paved roads are chiefly affected by transport costs to the port, while cities connected to the port by unpaved roads are more affected by connections to secondary centres.","[Storeygard, Adam] Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Tufts University,"Storeygard, A (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",adam.storeygard@tufts.edu,"Storeygard, Adam/H-2633-2017",,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [T32HD007338]; North American Regional Science Council; World Bank's Research Support Budget and Knowledge for Change Program; Global Research Program on Spatial Development of Cities - Multi Donor Trust Fund on Sustainable Urbanization of the World Bank; U.K. Department for International Development,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); North American Regional Science Council; World Bank's Research Support Budget and Knowledge for Change Program; Global Research Program on Spatial Development of Cities - Multi Donor Trust Fund on Sustainable Urbanization of the World Bank; U.K. Department for International Development,"I thank Managing Editor Francesco Caselli and three anonymous referees for comments that substantially improved the article.

This paper contributes to the literature by offering significant empirical evidence using Taiwanese internet auction data. Our study reveals that the influence of seller reputations on auction prices is significant, irrespective of the assumptions of linear or non-linear relationships with price. However, failure to consider the non-linear setting of seller reputation leads us to underestimate the impact of reputation when the seller's reputation score is low, but overestimates it when the seller's reputation becomes high. Using quantile regression, this study finds evidence of considerable differences in their impact on auction prices that are dependent on the distribution of price levels.","[Sun, Chia-Hung D.] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi 62102, Minhsiung, Taiwan; [Chiu, Yi-Bin] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Hsu, Ming-Fei] Bank Taiwan, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Sun, CHD (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi 62102, Minhsiung, Taiwan.",ecdchs@ccu.edu.tw,"Chiu, Yi-Bin/JYQ-2605-2024",,National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC 97-2410-H-194-008],"National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","We thank the anonymous referees, Kang E.

To this end, we employ simulation analysis using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. Our model includes two building blocks that are not included in the standard models: the banking sector and matching friction in the labor market. By introducing the banking sector, we can confirm that if economic agents fallaciously expect a rise in future asset prices, such expectations will cause an economic boom and bust.

Three players bargain over one-dimensional policies in an infinite horizon. In each period, a sequential protocol of proposal-making and voting, with random proposer recognitions and a simple majority, produces a policy that becomes the next period's status-quo. An equilibrium exists for any profile of proposer recognition probabilities, any profile of players' ideal policies, and any discount factor. In equilibrium, policies converge to the median's ideal policy, players moderate and propose policies close to the median's ideal in an attempt to constraint future proposers, but the tendency to moderate is a strategic substitute as the opponent of a moderating player does not moderate.

His conjectures about the determinants of long-term interest rates were made in the context of advanced capitalist economies and were based on his views on liquidity preference, ontological uncertainty, and the formation of investors' expectations. Is Keynes's conjecture that the central bank's action is the main driver of long-term interest rates valid in emerging markets, such as India? This paper empirically investigates the determinants of changes in Indian government bonds' nominal yields. Changes in short-term interest rates, after controlling for other crucial variables, such as changes in the rate of inflation and the rate of economic activity, take a lead role in driving the changes of the nominal yields of Indian government bonds. This suggests that Keynes's views on long-term interest rates can also be applicable to emerging markets. The empirical findings reveal that higher fiscal deficits do not appear to exert upward pressures on government bond yields in India.","[Akram, Tanweer] Thrivent Financial, Global Publ Policy & Econ, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Das, Anupam] Mt Royal Univ, Dept Econ Justice & Policy Studies, Calgary, AB, Canada",Mount Royal University,"Akram, T (通讯作者)，Thrivent Financial, Global Publ Policy & Econ, Minneapolis, MN USA.",,"Akram, Tanweer/AAB-9416-2021","Akram, Tanweer/0000-0002-6646-0902; Das, Anupam/0000-0002-4910-6290",,,,,33,10,10,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

We find that for the whole sample (1985-2010) Vietnam grew less than the rate predicted by the model. We also find that the balance-of-payments-constrained growth rate shifted after the 1997 Asian crisis. Since the relative price effect is neutral, the volume effects dominate in setting the balance-of-payments constraint. On the one hand, owing to the high income elasticities of exports, growth in advanced countries has a strong multiplier effect on the Vietnamese economy. On the other hand, this effect is hindered by a strong appetite for imports coming from Asia. Finally, we assess the impact of the current crisis on Vietnam's growth for the period 2011 to 2017.","[Bagnai, Alberto] Gabriele DAnnunzio Univ, Dept Econ, Econ Policy, Pescara, Italy; [Rieber, Arsene; Thi Anh-Dao Tran] Univ Rouen, Econ, CREAM, Dept Econ, F-76821 Mont St Aignan, France",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara; Universite de Rouen Normandie,"Bagnai, A (通讯作者)，Gabriele DAnnunzio Univ, Dept Econ, Econ Policy, Pescara, Italy.",,,"Rieber, Arsene/0000-0001-9452-5091; Bagnai, Alberto/0000-0002-3668-7567; TRAN, Thi Anh-Dao/0000-0002-9221-2654",,,,,23,3,4,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

We estimate the effects of multiple socio-environmental factors (e.g., physical demands at work, restaurants, food prices, cigarette smoking, food stamps, and urban sprawl) on obesity using NLSY data. Then we use the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition technique to approximate the contribution of each socio-environmental factor to the increase during this time. Many socio-environmental factors significantly affect weight, but none are able to explain a large portion of the obesity increase. Decreases in cigarette smoking consistently explains about 2-4 % of the increase in obesity and BMI. Food stamp receipt also consistently affects the measures of weight, but the small decrease in food stamp program participation during the period we examine actually dampened the increases in obesity and BMI. Collectively, the socio-environmental factors we examine never explain more than about 6.5 % of the weight increases.","[Baum, Charles L.] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Econ & Finance Dept, POB 27, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA; [Chou, Shin-Yi] Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Chou, Shin-Yi] NBER, 1050 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Middle Tennessee State University; Lehigh University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Baum, CL (通讯作者)，Middle Tennessee State Univ, Econ & Finance Dept, POB 27, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA.",cbaum@mtsu.edu; info@nber.org,,"Chou, ShinYi/0000-0003-3871-3527",Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF),Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF),"Financial support for this research has been generously provided by the Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF), although the opinions expressed in this paper are solely those of the authors.",,45,1,2,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

J,"Benavente, JMG",,,,"Benavente, Jose Miguel Garcia",,,Impact of a carbon tax on the Chilean economy: A computable general equilibrium analysis,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Applied general equilibrium; Climate change; Carbon tax; Chile,EMISSIONS,"In 2009, the government of Chile announced their official commitment to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions by 20% below a business-as-usual projection by 2020. Due to the fact that an effective way to reduce emissions is to implement a national carbon tax, the goal of this article is to quantify the value of a carbon tax that will allow the achievement of the emission reduction target and to assess its impact on the economy. The approach used in this work is to compare the economy before and after the implementation of the carbon tax by creating a static computable general equilibrium model of the Chilean economy. The model developed here disaggregates the economy in 23 industries and 23 commodities, and it uses four consumer agents (households, government, investment, and the rest of the world). By setting specific production and consumptions functions, the model can assess the variation in commodity prices, industrial production, and agent consumption, allowing a cross-sectoral analysis of the impact of the carbon tax. The benchmark of the economy, upon which the analysis is based, came from a social accounting matrix specially constructed for this model, based on the year 2010. The carbon tax was modeled as an ad valorem tax under two scenarios: tax on emissions from fossil fuels burned only by producers and tax on emissions from fossil fuels burned by producers and households. The abatement cost curve has shown that it is more cost-effective to tax only producers, rather than to tax both producers and households. This is due to the fact that when compared to the emission level observed in 2010, a 20% emission reduction will cause a loss in GDP of 2% and 2.3% respectively. Under the two scenarios, the tax value that could lead to that emission reduction is around 26 US dollars per ton of CO2-equivalent. The most affected productive sectors are oil refinery, transport, and electricity - having a contraction between 7% and 9%. Analyzing the electricity sector by energy source, the production of electricity from fossil fuels will decrease by 11%, but electricity from renewables will increase by 43%. Electricity producers will pass the cost of the carbon tax to the consumer by increasing the price of electricity by 8%. The findings of this paper will allow policy makers to take better and more informed decisions, by providing a cross-sectoral analysis of the impact on the economy of reducing emissions by 20% by implementing a national carbon tax.

People have access to multiple, discrete motives. Different motives may be activated by different social settings. Inter individual differences in dispositional types affect the responsiveness of people's motives to their social settings. The evolution of these dispositional types is driven by changes in the frequencies of social settings. In this context, economic policies can influence economic decisions not merely by modifying incentives operating through given preferences, but also by influencing people's motives (thereby changing their preferences) and by changing the distribution of dispositional types in the population (thereby changing their motivational responsiveness to social settings).

Through empirical testing, we find that the portfolio with the lowest union labor coverage has the lowest leverage, while the portfolio with the highest union labor coverage has the highest leverage. We also find that collective bargaining power positively affects leverage through the regression of leverage on the bargaining power of the labor union, regardless of the analysis methods, such as static and dynamic models. With a robustness test model that used the industry adjusted labor union concentration index (IUCI), we obtain evidence that collective bargaining power positively influences leverage, which corresponds with the regression results. In conclusion, we suggest the existence of evidence demonstrating that variables related to labor unions affect leverage levels, as suggested in previous studies.","[Choi, Chil Sun] Dong A Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, 2-1 Bumin Dong, Busan 602760, South Korea; [Sohn, Pando] Dong A Univ, Int Arbitrat Dept, 2-1 Bumin Dong, Busan 602760, South Korea; [Seo, Ji-Yong] Sangmyung Univ, Dept Business Adm, 20,Hongjimun 2 Gil, Seoul 110743, South Korea",Dong A University; Dong A University; Sangmyung University,"Sohn, P (通讯作者)，Dong A Univ, Int Arbitrat Dept, 2-1 Bumin Dong, Busan 602760, South Korea.",pdsolm@dau.ac.kr; jyseo@smu.ac.kr,,,Dong-A University,Dong-A University,"This paper is a re-tested and revised manuscript with recent sample data based on the conceptual idea of the unpublished master's dissertation by Chil Sun Choi (2013) at Dong-A University.

Short positions in long-term loans are backed by collateral, the value of which depends on monetary policy. The Quantity Theory of Money turns out to be compatible with long-run non-neutrality of money. Moreover, we show that, provided it does not lead to a liquidity trap, an expansionary monetary policy reduces markets' inefficiency. Finally, we prove that, as the quantity of Bank money injected in the economy grows to infinity, only three scenarios can asymptotically emerge: (1) either the economy enters a liquidity trap in the first period, because the monetary expansion is not credible; (2) or a credible expansionary monetary policy accompanies the orderly functioning of markets at the cost of fueling inflation on the commodity market; (3) else, the money injected by the central bank increases the leverage of indebted investors, fueling a financial bubble whose bursting may lead to debt-deflation in the next period. This dilemma of monetary policy highlights the default channel affecting trades and production and provides a rigorous foundation to Fisher's debt-deflation theory as being distinct from Keynes' liquidity trap. It sheds some light on the pros and contrast of non-conventional monetary policies.","[Giraud, Gael] Agence Francaise Dev, CNRS, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France; [Pottier, Antonin] PSL Res Univ, MINES ParisTech, CERNA Ctr Ind Econ, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech,"Giraud, G (通讯作者)，Agence Francaise Dev, CNRS, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France.",gael.giraud@univ-paris1.fr,"Pottier, Antonin/Q-1171-2017",,,,,,31,4,4,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The study makes use of unbalanced panel data of 21 conventional banks and 16 Islamic banks covering mostly the period 2001-2013. Applying dynamic GMM estimators, we find the aggregate loans by banks to be pro-cyclical in conformity with existing studies. However, when we segregate the lending/financing behaviour of conventional and Islamic banks, the cyclicality of bank lending seems to be true only for conventional banks. As for the Islamic banks, the business cycle does not seem to affect their financing decisions. Indeed, there is indication that the Islamic banks in general and the full-fledged Islamic banks in particular can even be counter-cyclical in their financing decisions. This conclusion is fairly robust to a different loan measure, alternative model specifications, and to an alternative business cycle measure. Hence, our results provide further support to the stability view of the Islamic banks in that they have the ability to stabilize credit. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To achieve this, we classify Australia's bilateral trade and investment partners into major, medium and minor. Empirical findings of an asymmetric generalised dynamic conditional correlation generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model show that correlations are time varying and increased significantly during the global financial crisis (GFC). Results of multivariate cointegration test confirm the long-run equilibrium relationship between the stock markets of Australia and its major partners in the pre-GFC and during GFC. Based on the full-sample results, it indicates that the GFC has segmented the stock markets from the long-run equilibrium relationship. Granger non-causality test results on full sample show that Australian stock market causes only the New Zealand market while the USA, the UK, Germany, Canada, Switzerland and Italy drives the Australian market.

The estimated elasticity of bank deposits to the rate of return of 0.3 and the estimated elasticity of employment income to a labour tax wedge of -0.38 suggest that income tax function aimed at minimising the efficiency losses should not considerably differentiate the tax burden on labour and capital income. We show that in the case of the introduction of a revenue-neutral income tax, with a single marginal tax rate of 15% and considerably larger labour income exemption, households' savings in Serbia would decline by 0.27%. This means that the negative impact of a rise in the capital income tax wedge on savings would prevail over the positive effects of a labour tax wedge cut. The results imply that the overall possibility to boost savings using tax policy is modest.","[Randjelovic, Sasa] Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade 11001, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Randjelovic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade 11001, Serbia.",randjelovic@ekof.bg.ac.rs,"Ranđelović, Saša/AAZ-6951-2020","Ranđelović, Saša/0000-0001-8445-9756",,,,,37,0,0,2,11,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

While there is evidence of information asymmetry related differences in the share market reaction on announcement of acquisition of acreage or reserves, we also identify greater sensitivity to crude oil price volatility for acreage acquisitions, consistent with the creation of valuable real options on acquisition of acreage. This is not evident to the same extent with acquisition of reserves. For example, acreage investment announcements reveal a statistically significant 1.22% premium (3-day CAR) in periods of high crude oil volatility compared with periods of low volatility. The premium on reserve acquisitions across these periods is a statistically insignificant 0.12%. This is supported in a multiple regression setting, with share price sensitivity to crude oil price volatility being higher for acreage acquisitions than for reserve acquisitions. Our sample consists of 1391 separate acreage or reserve acquisition announcements made by oil and gas firms listed on the U.S. equity market over the period from 1992 to 2011.

The estimation results of the generalized ordered logit model provide statistical evidence that environmental perceptions are critical factors in directing DIY consumers to purchase ONFs frequently. The results imply that educational programmes, informational campaigns, or advertisements to improve their perceptions on the potential negative impacts of fertilization on the environment may increase the purchase frequencies of ONFs. In addition, the results show that DIY consumers perceive that it is worth using ONFs despite their higher prices than chemical fertilizers. Their purchase frequencies will increase if they positively perceive the values of ONFs and are willing to pay a premium for ONFs. Moreover, the purchasing behaviour of DIY consumers is associated with their perceptions of neighbourhood landscaping. If neighbours or homeowner associations encourage landscaping improvements in their community, DIY consumers may increase their purchase frequencies of ONFs accordingly.","[Suh, Dong Hee; Khachatryan, Hayk; Guan, Zhengfei] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Khachatryan, H (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL USA.",hayk@ufl.edu,"Khachatryan, Hayk/GLQ-6541-2022","Khachatryan, Hayk/0000-0003-2387-3624; Suh, Dong Hee/0000-0002-6154-3864",,,,,78,8,9,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Passive cross-ownership dramatically alters the participating and participated firms' governments' choice to apply the strategic trade policy instrument, the equilibria typology and their efficiency properties. In fact, if the share of cross-ownership is sufficiently large, the participated firm's government finds optimal to tax export. Moreover, beyond an adequately high threshold, cross-ownership modifies the equilibrium from the activist regime for both countries to an asymmetric regime in which only the participating firm's government intervenes. In addition, in the case of the traditional common activist regime equilibrium, the classical prisoner's dilemma game structure may disappear.","[Fanti, Luciano] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, I-56100 Pisa, Italy; [Buccella, Domenico] Kozminski Univ, Dept Econ, Warsaw, Poland",University of Pisa; Kozminski University,"Buccella, D (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Dept Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",lfanti@ec.unipi.it; buccella@kozminski.edu.pl,"Buccella, Domenico/F-8981-2019","Buccella, Domenico/0000-0002-9594-0630",,,,,46,3,3,1,9,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAY 9,2016,10.0,,,,,,,,201610.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2016-10,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DM6MA,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376465600001,0

In this paper we investigate the impact of fiscal consolidation on trade using bilateral trade data. The use of bilateral trade data allows us to demonstrate three novel empirical results. First, while fiscal consolidation is associated with an increase in own-country exports, it is also correlated to an equal extent with a decrease in foreign-country exports (i.e. imports); indeed, simultaneous austerity has no statistically significant impact on bilateral trade. Second, the positive effect of austerity on exports disappears when trading partners share a common currency. Third, the increase in exports as a result of austerity is associated entirely with an increase in the range of goods exported (the extensive margin), at the expense of trade volume among existing trade relationships (the intensive margin).","[Ederington, Josh] Univ Kentucky, Dept Econ, Gatton Bldg, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Bista, Rishav] Marshall Univ, Div Finance & Econ, 1 John Marshall Dr, Huntington, WV 25755 USA; [Minier, Jenny] Univ Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Sheridan, Brandon J.] North Cent Coll, Naperville, IL 60540 USA",University of Kentucky; Marshall University; University of Kentucky,"Ederington, J (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, Dept Econ, Gatton Bldg, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",ederington@uky.edu,"Sheridan, Brandon/AAO-5929-2020; Sheridan, Brandon/AAU-7131-2021","Sheridan, Brandon/0000-0001-8780-8560; Minier, Jenny/0000-0003-3781-1686",,,,,36,0,0,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We propose an n-firm oligopoly model to study the effect of the degree of coop eration in pro duct development (i.e., the number of jointly developed pro duct components) on the size of the RJV (i.e., the number of RJV participants). We assume that a higher degree of cooperation in pro duct development restricts the firms' ability to differentiate their products, and hence intensifies competition among the participating firms. We find that the equilibrium size of the RJV can vary non-monotonically with the degree of cooperation. If the degree of product differentiation is not very sensitive to the degree of cooperation, then the RJV is industry-wide. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the model, individuals consume market- and home-produced goods, and home production is facilitated by marriage. Market frictions, including taxes, search, and bargaining problems, increase the marriage propensity. The inflation tax encourages marriage because being single is cash intensive. Microdata confirm singles use cash more than married people.

Data from a novel 34-year panel on regional annual theatre attendance are used to estimate market demand. Four models are applied to investigate the demand function, and all of these also include per capita income and other control variables as regressors. The first two models are estimated to check whether theatregoers are myopically addicted to theatre. The results suggest that the theatre is an addictive good because past consumption (and prices) significantly raises the marginal utility of current consumption. The third model tests the rational addiction hypothesis, which assumes that future attendance also influences current attendance, whilst past and future prices influence current attendance only indirectly through their impact on past and future attendances. However, our most highly specified model, introducing past and future prices, demonstrates that Italian theatregoers are not myopic but fully rational as outlined in Becker and Murphy (1988). The results demonstrate that the rational addiction hypothesis is applicable not only to harmful addictions such as alcohol, cigarettes and drug consumption, but also to beneficial addictions, such as theatre attendance. This result has important policy implications because theatre is one of the most subsidised performing arts in Italy; if theatregoers are fully rational, policy makers can influence theatre attendance using alternative policy instruments (price and income), thereby reducing government expenditure on theatre subsidies.","[Castiglione, Concetta] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Bologna, Italy; [Infante, Davide] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Calabria,"Castiglione, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Bologna, Italy.",castiglc@tcd.ie; davide.infante@unical.it,"Castiglione, Concetta/N-1037-2015; Castiglione, Concetta/HKE-0235-2023","Castiglione, Concetta/0000-0002-9397-110X; Infante, Davide/0000-0001-8520-7008","Department of Economics, Statistics and Finance of University of Calabria","Department of Economics, Statistics and Finance of University of Calabria","The authors wish to thank Trine Bille, Victor Fernandez-Blanco, Carol Newman, John O'Hagan, Antonello E.

Using ordered probit models based on data for 350,000 adults in 24 EU countries, we find that the likelihood and number of such visits depend mainly on per capita household income, education, labor market status, and country of birth. Attained characteristics such as education and income have remarkably similar positive effects on cultural participation across the countries in our sample, while the effects of age and gender are both weaker and less consistent across countries. We conclude that cultural distinctions along the lines of socioeconomic attainment are stable even in very different country contexts with varying cultural policies and economic conditions. We discuss the way these results inform three research topics: identification of the characteristics of visitors to museums and historical sites in order to attract new audiences; the effect of public spending on culture on accessibility to cultural sites; and cross-national variation in cultural stratification.","[Falk, Martin] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Katz-Gerro, Tally] Univ Haifa, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Katz-Gerro, T (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",Martin.Falk@wifo.ac.at; tkatz@soc.haifa.ac.il,"Falk, Martin Thomas/T-8325-2019","Falk, Martin Thomas/0000-0003-0518-6513",,,,,42,95,99,5,47,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Those trained with a friend were more likely to have taken out business loans, were less likely to be housewives, and reported increased business activity and higher household income, with stronger impacts among women subject to social norms that restrict female mobility.","[Field, Erica] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 213 Social Sci Bldg,Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Jayachandran, Seema] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2001 Sheridan Rd,Room 302, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Pande, Rohini] Harvard Univ, Harvard Kennedy Sch, Mailbox 46,79 John F Kennedy St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rigol, Natalia] MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA",Duke University; Northwestern University; Harvard University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Field, E (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, 213 Social Sci Bldg,Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;Jayachandran, S (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2001 Sheridan Rd,Room 302, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Pande, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Harvard Kennedy Sch, Mailbox 46,79 John F Kennedy St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Rigol, N (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",emf23@duke.edu; seema@northwestern.edu; rohini_pande@harvard.edu; nrigol@mit.edu,"Peter, Serin/ITR-8938-2023; Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022","Jayachandran, Seema/0000-0002-6015-2300",Harvard Kennedy School Women and Public Policy Program; CMF-IFMR research grant,Harvard Kennedy School Women and Public Policy Program; CMF-IFMR research grant,"We are grateful to Manasee Desai, Katherine Durlacher, Mallika Thomas, and Divya Varma for excellent research assistance, to the staff of SEWA for their cooperation and support.

Using novel survey data from nineteen countries in Sub-Saharan Africa we establish a robust negative association between the prevalence of witchcraft beliefs and multiple measures of trust which holds after accounting for country fixed effects and potential confounding factors at the individual, regional, and ethnic-group levels. This finding extends to other metrics of social capital, namely charitable giving and participation in religious group activities. Such coexistence of witchcraft beliefs and antisocial attitudes stands in stark contrast to a well-explored alternative cultural equilibrium characterized by religious prosociality. Evidence from societies beyond Africa shows that in preindustrial communities where witchcraft is believed to be an important cause of illness, mistrust and other antisocial traits are inculcated since childhood. Furthermore, second-generation immigrants in Europe originating from countries with widespread witchcraft beliefs are generally less trusting. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we measure the influence of naval power projections on global trade during the latter 19th and early 20th centuries, a time of relative peace and robust commercial activity. We use archival data on the navies of Britain, France, the United States and Germany, capturing longitudinal measures of ship deployment, tonnage, and ship personnel. First we develop an empirical naval arms race model, and demonstrate that the navies of Britain and France in particular responded rigorously to each other. We then use our estimates of naval power projected around the world by Britain and France to measure their effects on bilateral trade in a panel-data gravity model. Results indicate that while navies had some positive impact on their own nation's trade, other nations' trade suffered. Our results show that rather than bolster globalization, the first global arms race damaged commercial interests and lowered trade potential around the world.

Evidence from Chinese counties,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Government spending; Fiscal multiplier; Fiscal stimulus,SPENDING EVIDENCE; GOVERNMENT; TAXES,"The paper estimates local fiscal multipliers using annual data for 1800 China counties. The identification exploits a peculiar feature of the allocation mechanism of China's intergovernmental transfers that triggers exogenous variations on local public spending. When aggregate central-local transfers go up at the national level, National Poor Counties can receive a disproportionate amount of transfers. We therefore construct an instrument that captures this heterogeneity in the response of local public spending to national central-local transfers. The analysis points to local fiscal multipliers of approximately 0.6, which is much lower than the estimates in most previous studies. The effects of local public spending are concentrated on non-tradable industries. Finally, we find local public spending has striking effects on stimulating in-county investment, but has negligible effects on stimulating in-county consumption.

Under a quite general tax scheme, these costs turn out to be lower the wider the firms' product ranges, the lower the degree of market concentration and the lower the degree of product differentiation. Moreover, marginal costs of taxation are lower in Bertrand markets compared to Cournot markets. In cases when marginal costs of public funds cannot easily be assessed we ask if pass-through rates can provide useful information for policy makers. The market characteristics that we analyze are shown to have opposite effects on pass-through and marginal costs of public funds. It is also demonstrated that the marginal cost of public funds is generally lower for ad valorem taxes than for unit taxes. The main results are based on a linear demand system, but a number of extensions confirm that our main results are reasonably robust. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Evidence from Switzerland,KYKLOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,POLITICAL-ECONOMY; INFORMATION; REFORM; TRADE; COSTS,"Direct democracy may impose significant information demands on voters, especially when individual propositions are highly complex. Yet, it remains theoretically ambiguous how proposition complexity affects referendum outcomes. To explore this question, I use a novel dataset on 153 Swiss federal referendums that took place between 1978 and 2010. The dataset includes hand-collected data on the number of subjects per proposition based on official pre-referendum information booklets as a measure of complexity. My estimation results suggest that the relationship between proposition complexity and the share of yes-votes follows an inverse U-shape. Using micro-data from representative post-referendum surveys, I provide evidence for two opposing channels. More complex propositions are supported by a more diverse group of voters. On the other hand, voters find it more difficult to estimate the personal consequences of complex propositions and are therefore more likely to reject them.","[Hessami, Zohal] Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Box 138, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Hessami, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Box 138, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",Zohal.Hessami@uni-konstanz.de,,"Hessami, Zohal/0000-0002-0669-6913",German National Science Foundation (DFG) [884]; Young Scholar Fund at the University of Konstanz,German National Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Young Scholar Fund at the University of Konstanz,"The author thanks Kira Gahrken and Christoph Siemroth for excellent research assistance and gratefully acknowledges funding by the German National Science Foundation (DFG) through Collaborative Research Center 884 (Political Economy of Reforms) at the University of Mannheim, where substantial parts of this paper were completed.

Different measures can help mitigate the value drop, including electricity storage, flexible conventional plants, expansion of transmission, and demand response. This study assesses another option: a change in design of wind power plants. Advanced wind turbines that are higher and have a larger rotor compared to rated capacity (lower specific rating) generate electricity more constantly than classical turbines. Recent years have witnessed a significant shift towards such advanced technology. Our model-based analysis for Northwestern Europe shows that such design can substantially increase the spot market value of generated electricity. At a 30% penetration rate, the value of 1 MWh of electricity generated from a fleet of advanced turbines is estimated to be 15% higher than the value of 1 MWh from classical turbines. The additional value is large, whether compared to wind generation costs, to the value drop, or to the effect of alternative measures such as electricity storage. Extensive sensitivity tests indicate that this finding is remarkably robust. The increase in bulk power value is not the only advantage of advanced turbines: additional benefits might accrue from reduced costs for power grids and balancing services.

To investigate the origins and effects of such change, the paper formally models the historical evolution of digital control. In the model, the economy-wide features of the digital space emerge as a result of the endogenous adaptation (co-evolution) of users' preferences (culture) and platform designs (technology). The model shows that: a) in the digital economy there exist two stable cultural-technological equilibria: one with intrinsically motivated users and low control; and the other with purely extrinsically motivated users and high control; b) before the opening of the Internet to commerce, the emergence of a low-control-intrinsic-motivation equilibrium was favored by the specific set of norms and values that formed the early culture of the networked environment; and c) the opening of the Internet to commerce can indeed cause a transition to a high-control-extrinsic-motivation equilibrium, even if the latter is Pareto inferior. Although it is too early to say whether such a transition is actually taking place, these results call for a great deal of attention in evaluating policy proposals on Internet regulation.","[Landini, Fabio] SEP LUISS Univ, Via Villa Emiliani 14, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Landini, Fabio] CRIOS Bocconi Univ, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Landini, F (通讯作者)，SEP LUISS Univ, Via Villa Emiliani 14, I-00197 Rome, Italy.;Landini, F (通讯作者)，CRIOS Bocconi Univ, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",fabio.landini@unibocconi.it,,"Landini, Fabio/0000-0001-7523-458X",,,,,72,3,4,6,60,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

First, we show that RI by itself creates an additional demand for robustness that leads to higher induced uncertainty facing consumers. Second, if we allow capacity to be elastic, RB increases the optimal level of attention. Third, we explore how the induced uncertainty composed of (i) model uncertainty due to RB and (ii) state uncertainty due to RI, affects consumption and wealth dynamics, the market price of uncertainty, and the welfare losses due to incomplete information. We find that induced uncertainty can better explain the observed consumption-income volatility and market price of uncertainty low attention increases the effect of model misspecification.

It accounts for cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity in the analysis and employs robust panel econometric techniques. The empirical results on long run elasticities display that economic output, FDI inflows and stock market developments have all a significant positive impact on clean energy consumption. Finally, the results on heterogeneous panel non-causality tests indicate the presence of unidirectional causality running from FDI to clean energy consumption in the short-run. For robustness purposes, the paper also estimates long-run elasticities for individual countries, with the findings documenting that both FDI inflows and stock market developments have a considerable positive impact on clean energy uses. The findings urge that both policy makers and governments in these emerging market economies should initiate effective public-private-partnership investments in clean energy projects by providing lucrative incentives, which, in turn, will encourage both domestic and foreign investors to invest more in clean energy projects and, eventually, moving these economies towards sustainable economic growth.

We show that, whereas male part-time workers are less likely to receive training than male full-timers, part-time working women are as likely to receive training as full-time working women. Although we cannot rule out gender-working time specific monopsony power, we speculate that the gender-specific effect of working hours on training has to do with gender-specific stereotyping. In the Netherlands, for women it is common to work part-time. More than half of the prime age female employees work part-time. Therefore, because of social norms, men working part-time could send a different signal to their employer than women working part-time.

The results are obtained by applying an aggregated theatre demand function for both residents and tourists. The elasticity of theatre attendance in response to tourism is estimated along with other standard demand variables such as ticket price and income. The quality factors and theatre-specific effects are also included. The tourism flows variables are derived using detailed data set on tourist arrivals and their overnight counts, and they are also split between domestic and foreign tourists. To measure the impact of tourism flows on theatre demand, three alternative theatre markets specifications are considered. The total elasticity of attendance per capita in response to tourism is estimated between 15 and 20 %, indicating that increasing the number of arrivals by two tourists per resident in the relevant market would generate an increase in theatre attendance by 581-680 thousand visitors per year. The role of tourism flows is found to be particularly important for attendance at opera, operetta and musicals as opposed to attendance at drama performances. The analysis also reveals that foreign, non-German tourists have a positive impact on theatre attendance, whereas domestic tourists do not contribute significantly to higher demand for Austrian theatres.","[Zieba, Marta] Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Dept Econ, Limerick, Ireland",University of Limerick,"Zieba, M (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Dept Econ, Limerick, Ireland.",marta.zieba@ul.ie,"Zieba, Marta/JAZ-0878-2023; Zieba, Marta/A-8283-2018","Zieba, Marta/0000-0002-9116-2413",,,,,32,20,20,3,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Producers must pay a cost to observe the determinants of the current profit maximizing price, and hence observe them infrequently. To generate large real effects of monetary shocks in such a model the time between observations must be long and/or highly volatile. Previous work on rational inattentiveness has allowed for observation intervals that are either constant-but-long (e.g. Caballero, 1989 or Reis, 2006) or volatile-but-short (e.g. Reis's, 2006 example where observation costs are negligible), but not both. In these models, the real effects of monetary policy are small for realistic values of the duration between observations. We show that non-negligible observation costs produce both of these effects: intervals between observations are infrequent and volatile. This generates large real effects of monetary policy for realistic values of the average time between observations.","[Alvarez, Fernando E.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Alvarez, Fernando E.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lippi, Francesco] Univ Sassari, Einaudi Inst Econ & Finance, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Lippi, Francesco; Paciello, Luigi] CEPR, London, England; [Paciello, Luigi] Einaudi Inst Econ & Finance, London, England",University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Sassari; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,,gigipaciello@gmail.com,"Lippi, Francesco/HNJ-6445-2023","Paciello, luigi/0000-0003-0693-9820",ERC [324008]; European Research Council (ERC) [324008] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank Carlos Carvalho, Xavier Gabaix, Christian Hellwig, Pat Kehoe, Herve Le Bihan, Bartosz Mackowiak, Ricardo Reis, Victor Rios-Rull as well as seminar participants at UCL, EIEF, the Bank of England, ECB, International Network on Expectations and Coordination at NYU, NBER Summer Institute 2012, Rational Inattention and Related Theories Prague 2012 and Oxford 2014, SED Annual meeting 2015, Tor Vergata University, and T2M Conference at Lausanne University for their comments.

Prominent among our results is that firms' owners choose relative performance over profit revenue contracts more frequently. Further, firms' owners successfully induce a more aggressive behaviour by their managers in the market, by setting incentives which deviate from strict profit maximization. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A common finding is that potential donors give less when there is greater risk that their donation will have less impact. While this behaviour could be fully rationalized by standard economic models, this article shows that an additional mechanism is relevant: the use of risk as an excuse not to give. In a laboratory study, participants evaluate risky payoffs for themselves and risky payoffs for a charity. When their decisions do not involve tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, they respond very similarly to self risk and charity risk. By contrast, when their decisions force tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, participants act more averse to charity risk and less averse to self risk. These altered responses to risk bias participants towards choosing payoffs for themselves more often, consistent with excuse-driven responses to risk. Additional results support the existence of excuse-driven types.","[Exley, Christine L.] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,,clexley@gmail.com,,,"NSF (SES) [1159032]; Stanford Economics Department; Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society; Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research via the E.S.

We combine macro data coming from a pool of observations corresponding to the vehicle fleet and per capita income in a broad set of countries, with micro data coming from the Survey of Household Finances, elaborated by the Banco de Espana (Bank of Spain) for the Spanish case. This double approach estimation allows taking advantage of both types of data, so that the results can be complemented for a more detailed understanding of the automobile market. Macro data capture the dynamics inherent to the process of diffusion in the automobile market as income per capita rises. Micro data are not affected by socio-institutional disparities at the country level and, at the same time, offer a much more detailed level of information in terms of vehicle owner characteristics.","[Felis Rota, Marta; Moral Carcedo, Julian; Perez Garcia, Julian] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Anal, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Rota, MF (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Anal, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",marta.felis@uam.es,"Pérez-García, Julián/ABF-5975-2021; MORAL CARCEDO, JULIAN/L-2361-2013","Pérez-García, Julián/0000-0002-4214-5991; MORAL CARCEDO, JULIAN/0000-0002-7142-3110",,,,,28,5,5,0,8,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, INST GEOGRAFIA",COYOACAN C P,"CIUDAD UNIV, FAC ECONOMIA, CIRCUITO INTEROR S-N, 1ER PISO, EDIFICIO B, COYOACAN C P, 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

We investigate how shocks originating in the euro area affect output and prices in the rest of Europe. We examine four different policy relevant shock scenarios: (i) increase in the euro area interest rate; (ii) increase in the euro area industrial production; (iii) decrease in the euro area consumer prices and (iv) decrease in global oil prices. In general, we find that these shocks have an effect of same (and expected) sign but of different size across the European Union. Our results suggest that the response of Central European countries to the euro area shocks is almost as strong as the response of the euro area countries itself. On the other hand, our results indicate that South East Europe is somewhat less sensitive to the euro area shocks and oil price shocks.","[Hajek, Jan] Czech Natl Bank, Na Prikope 28, Prague 11503 1, Czech Republic; [Hajek, Jan; Horvath, Roman] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic",Czech National Bank; Charles University Prague,"Horváth, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic.",hajek.ja@gmail.com; roman.horvath@gmail.com,"Horvath, Roman/AAD-8248-2019; Horvath, Roman/AAX-8903-2020","Horvath, Roman/0000-0002-9036-9746",Grant Agency of the Charles University [238515]; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P402/12/G097],Grant Agency of the Charles University; Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"We thank the anonymous referee, Christina Strobach, George Tavlas and seminar participants at INFER Workshop on The European Integration and Its International Dimension (Cologne, Germany) for helpful comments.

Using three measures for the GLF, we find that it still exerts a significant negative effect on output per worker in 2004 across Chinese provinces. This result is robust to the use of political factors from the GLF period as instruments. The causal relationship persists after controlling for climate conditions and initial output per capita. Moreover, the causal relationship exists when we change the dependent variable to output per worker in 1978, which refutes the notion that market-oriented reforms alone explain the difference in income in 2004. Therefore, the GLF has had a lasting, negative effect on output.","[He, Qichun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Sun, Meng] Beijing Normal Univ, SEBA, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics; Beijing Normal University,"He, QC (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",qichunhe@gmail.com,,", Qichun/0000-0001-7643-3150",,,,,35,1,1,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

I study this question in a model of financial intermediation with limited commitment. When a crisis occurs, the policy maker will respond with fiscal transfers that partially cover intermediaries' losses. The anticipation of this bailout distorts ex ante incentives, leading intermediaries to become excessively illiquid and increasing financial fragility. Prohibiting bailouts is not necessarily desirable, however: while it induces intermediaries to become more liquid, it may nevertheless lower welfare and leave the economy more susceptible to a crisis. A policy of taxing short-term liabilities, in contrast, can both improve the allocation of resources and promote financial stability.","[Keister, Todd] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,,todd.keister@rutgers.edu,"Keister, Todd/B-5951-2008","Keister, Todd/0000-0002-1026-1242",,,,,35,62,75,3,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We use a Rasch measurement model to identify thresholds of very low food security among households and among children in the TCS that are comparable to thresholds from the HFSSM. We also use the TCS to empirically investigate the determinants of food insecurity and of these specific food insecurity outcomes, estimating a multivariate behavioral Rasch model that is adapted to address longitudinal data. The estimation results indicate that participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program reduce food insecurity, while poverty and disability among caregivers increase it.

This makes it important to understand if and when agents are able to coordinate efficiently. Existing research on weakest-link games shows an overwhelming inability of people to coordinate on efficient equilibria, especially in larger groups. We show experimentally that freedom of neighbourhood choice overcomes the problem and leads to fully efficient coordination. This implies substantial welfare effects with achieved welfare being about 50% higher in games with neighbourhood choice than without it. We identify exclusion of low effort providers who in response start providing high effort as the simple but effective mechanism enforcing efficient coordination. A variety of other treatments show that the efficiency result as well as the identified mechanism are robust to changes in the information condition, payoff specification, and a substantial increase in group size. Moreover, we find that neighbourhood choice boosts efficiency even when exclusion does not materially affect the excluded agent. Our results are widely applicable on the societal and organizational level, e.g. containment of diseases, fight against terrorism, and co-authorship networks.","[Riedl, Arno; Rohde, Ingrid M.

Using unique data on federal procurement in US states and performing panel fixed-effects estimations, we find support for the model's prediction of a positive R&D effect of the technological content of government procurement.

Investigating the effect of preference strength and incentives on the incidence of Choice Blindness,JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Choice Blindness; Cognitive constraints; Discovered preferences; Chocolate,,"Choice Blindness occurs when individuals fail to notice a mismatch between their stated preference and the outcome of their choice. While it is prevalent in areas of considerable economic importance, such as consumer choice for non-durables, pension decisions, and risk preferences, little is known about the underlying cause of this apparent cognitive blind spot. We examine whether the CB effect is robust when the stimuli is a product for which participants display a strong overall preference, specifically children's preference for chocolate. First, we demonstrate that Choice Blindness for female faces is a general cognitive blind spot that is robust for a large sample of children aged 8-12. Second, we show that when the stimuli are chocolates, there is a substantial reduction in the incidence of Choice Blindness; only 10-20% of participants failed to notice the choice manipulation. Subjects who reported a greater affinity for chocolate were more likely to detect mismatches. However, we found that the strength of the relative preference ordering within the set of chocolates did not affect the incidence of Choice Blindness. Moreover, incentive compatibility did not increase detection rates; participants were just as likely to notice a mismatch regardless of whether or they actually received the chocolate they chose. We propose that this phenomenon can be viewed as an error resulting from the early stages preference development. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The countless applications of futures studies in various fields have been a major breakthrough for mankind. Undoubtedly, decision making is one of the most significant aspects of shaping the future and an integral part of any credible future research. Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) in general and Multiple Attribute Decision Making in particular (MADM), are among the most remarkable subparts of the decision making process. The most recent model developed using the MADM method is the Dynamic MADM. The model does not specifically concentrate on the future actions and approaches and remains to be fully explored. This research presents a new concept and a new approach in the MADM field which is called the Prospective Multiple Attribute Decision Making (PMADM). The PMADM model can very well cover the DMADM concept but instead chooses to focus on future topics. The study also introduces two new approaches. The first research aims to elaborate the basis of this model and then evolves to deal with the future limiters as they potentially pop up and change the course of future actions. The new model based on future limiters is separated and categorized into two sections; one of which is looked upon without the probabilities rate and the other one with the probabilities rate. This approach is deemed priceless due to its major applicability in the ranking of the MADM methods such as: TOPSIS, VIKOR, COPRAS, ARAS, WASPAS and etc. Finally, a case study with the various applications of PMADM model in WASPAS methodology is put forth and illustrated.","[Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz; Maknoon, Reza] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Tehran Polytech, Technol Foresight Grp, Dept Management Sci & Technol, POB 1585-4413, Tehran, Iran; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Res Inst Smart Bldg Technol, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Amirkabir University of Technology; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Maknoon, R (通讯作者)，Amirkabir Univ Technol, Tehran Polytech, Technol Foresight Grp, Dept Management Sci & Technol, POB 1585-4413, Tehran, Iran.",rmaknoon@yahoo.com,"Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani/AAA-9918-2021","Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X;",,,,,49,36,37,1,26,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

We argue that increased delays in public payments can affect private sector liquidity and profits and hence ultimately economic growth. We test this prediction empirically for European Union countries using two complementary approaches. First, we use annual panel data, including a newly constructed proxy for government arrears. Using panel data techniques, including methods that allow for endogeneity, we find that payment delays and to some extent estimated arrears lead to a higher likelihood of bankruptcy, lower profits and lower economic growth. While this approach allows a broad set of variables to be included, it restricts the number of time periods. We therefore complement it with a Bayesian VAR approach on quarterly data for selected countries faced with significant payment delays. With this second approach, we also find that the likelihood of bankruptcies rises when the governments increase the average payment period: (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

These trends have negatively affected the welfare of children, as they increase the proportion of poor, single-female-headed households. Using data on marriage markets defined by state, race and time, and the Choo-Siow marriage matching function, this review provides a quantitative assessment of these claims. We show that changes in earnings inequality had a qualitatively consistent but modest quantitative impact on marriage rates and positive assortative matching. Neither changes in the wage distributions nor educational attainments can explain the large decline in marriage rates over this period.","[Cornelson, Kirsten; Siow, Aloysius] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Cornelson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,,SSHRC,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"University of Toronto.

The present paper constructs a theoretical model to demonstrate that export products with higher productivity, or with larger market share, or of higher quality will experience a less complete pass-through. Using the six-digit harmonized system export data from the CEPII database over the period of 2000 to 2013, the present paper examines how product heterogeneity affects the exchange rate pass-through of Chinese exports. The empirical results show that the most competitive Chinese export products, or those least affected by exchange rate risks, are those of higher quality, with higher technological complexity and at the high end of the international value chain. Therefore, Chinese exporting firms should pay more attention to improving export quality and upgrading technology to better cope with exchange rate risks and to enjoy more bargaining power in the international market.","[Han, Jian; Shen, Yanzhi] Nanjing Univ, Sch Econ, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Shen, YZ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Sch Econ, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",hanj@nju.edu.cn; yanzhi@nju.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation [71103083],National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 71103083).,,31,0,0,2,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2016,24.0,2,,,,,48,67,,10.1111/cwe.12150,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DH7VH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373001400003,0

This results in a range of environmental impacts which should be taken into account in a benefit-cost analysis of such proposals. In this paper, we use choice modeling to investigate the relative gains and losses from siting new windfarms off the coast of Estonia, relative to the option of creating a new marine protected area. We find that, while respondents are generally opposed to converting marine shoals to conventional wind farms and prefer the establishment of marine protected areas instead, benefits from constructing 'environmentally-friendly' wind farms - an alternative program which is also considered by the government - are not statistically different with respect to consumers' welfare to those associated with creating a new marine protected area. Methodologically, the paper makes a contribution by showing the ability of the latent class mixed logit model to represent both within - and between-class preference heterogeneity, and thus its power to provide a more sophisticated representation of preference heterogeneity than stand-alone latent class or mixed logit approaches. The paper also presents the first use of the latent class mixed logit model in willingness-to-pay space for environmental goods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

But competition and market regulations are always in danger of being undermined and circumnavigated, giving way to monopolies that are very comfortable and highly profitable to monopolists and may spell great trouble for many people. In Smith's view, political economy-as an important, and perhaps even the most important, part of a kind of master political science, encompassing the science of the legislator-has the task to fight superstition and false beliefs in matters of economic policy, to debunk opinions that present individual interests as promoting the general good and to propose changing regulatory frameworks for markets and institutions that help to ward off threats to the security of society as a whole and provide incentives such that self-seeking behaviour has also socially beneficial effects.

We contribute to the literature by developing a CC matrix used for classifying various CC practices on the basis of firms' imperfect cognition processes and their attitude toward the stakeholders. Within the post-Keynesian theory of the firm, which has institutionalist origin, we show that transparent CC activities are a potentially powerful tool for the improvement of firms' performance.

Analyzing data from a laboratory experiment on coordination in networks, we tested 'what kind of noise' is supported by behavioral evidence. This empirical analysis complements a growing theoretical literature on 'how noise matters' for equilibrium selection. We find that the vast majority of decisions (96%) constitute myopic best responses, but deviations continue to occur with probabilities that are sensitive to their costs, that is, less frequent when implying larger payoff losses relative to the myopic best response. In addition, deviation rates vary with patterns of realized payoffs that are related to trial-and-error behavior. While there is little evidence that deviations are clustered in time or space, there is evidence of individual heterogeneity. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the early periods of the risk treatment there is perfect information about the lottery; in the ambiguity Treatment participants perfectly know the outcome space but not the associated probabilities; in the unawareness treatment participants have imperfect knowledge about both outcomes and probabilities. We observe strong treatment effects on behavior in periods 17-32. In particular, participants who have been exposed to an environment with very imperfect knowledge of the state space subsequently choose lotteries with high (low) variance less (more) often compared to other participants. Estimating individual risk attitudes from choices in periods 17-32 we find that the distribution of risk attitude parameters across our treatments can be ranked in terms of first order stochastic dominance.

Two senders have private information about their preferences and simultaneously send messages to a receiver in a one-dimensional space with a large number of states, actions, and messages. We find that equilibrium predictions fare poorly and that senders overcommunicate by consistently exaggerating their messages. Over time, exaggeration increases and, communication unravels. Our analysis suggests that exaggeration and unraveling can only be partially explained by bounded rationality models of iterated reasoning or belief learning.

Access to a car is considered essential to access vital services and, as such, automobile usage plays a crucial role in commoning. However, this is said to draw lines of inclusion and exclusion premised on financial status, which particularly excludes those in rural areas. Such issues are especially acute at a time when electric cars are being promoted as a sustainable transport, which actually contains the potential to further marginalize the less affluent, rendering matters of access questions of class. The paper concludes by suggesting that more attention need be given to alternatives from private car ownership, focusing on communal usages.","[Newman, Daniel] Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Pl Res Inst, 33 Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3BA, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Newman, D (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Pl Res Inst, 33 Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3BA, S Glam, Wales.",newmandc@cardiff.ac.uk,,,,,,,55,10,11,1,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

The attempts to reconcile facts and theory have led to the continuous introduction of specific and arguably ad hoc hypotheses, in contrast with the search for greater theoretical rigour claimed by the various streams of macroeconomic modelling subsequent to the neo-classical synthesis. In addition, the specific assumptions introduced in the models, or their implications, are in turn often contradicted or, at best, not confirmed by subsequent empirical research. It is suggested in the conclusions that the difficulty of keeping together in a simple and consistent framework theory and facts reflects the flawed theoretical foundations of mainstream theory.","[Stirati, Antonella] Univ Rome Tre, I-00145 Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Stirati, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rome Tre, Dipartimento Econ, Via Silvio DAmico 77, I-00145 Rome, Italy.",antonella.stirati@uniroma3.it,"STIRATI, Antonella/R-8669-2016","STIRATI, Antonella/0000-0002-4195-9416",,,,,64,10,10,3,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The standard mechanisms that make the price public are unsafe for the seller as the buyer may adopt non-trusting posterior beliefs.

FDI is a source of financing that allows businesses to grow. At the same time, FDI can be a source of innovation that promotes energy efficiency. Existing evidence on the impact of aggregate FDI inflows on energy consumption is scarce and inconclusive. In the current study, we disaggregate FDI inflows into mining, manufacturing, total services, and financial services components and examine the impact of these FDI flows on renewable - and non-renewable industrial energy - sources for 74 countries for the period 1985-2012. We employ a Blundell-Bond dynamic panel estimator to control for endogeneity and omitted variable biases in our panels. The results point broadly to an energy consumption-reducing effect with respect to non-renewable sources of energy and an energy consumption-augmenting effects with respect to renewable energy. We find that these effects vary in magnitude and significance by sectoral FDI. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The dominance of the US dollar in global oil markets is said to epitomize this phenomenon. We question this presumption with evidence for earlier periods showing that several national currencies have simultaneously played substantial roles in global oil markets. European oil import payments before and after World War II were split between the dollar and non-dollar currencies, mainly sterling. Differences in use of the dollar across countries were associated with trade linkages with the United States and the size of the importing country.

The phenomenon is characterized by the fact that individuals are more likely to recall information which is consistent with their initial preference, expectation, or belief. The model endogenizes the recall of information and ascribes utility functions to agents who must allocate scarce memory resources to pieces of information that are relevant to a future decision. While the biased recall of information was a detriment to groups in a group decision paradigm known as the hidden profile problem, this work shows that this is due to the discrepancy between the subjects' priors and the skewed information structure they were presented. A second model finds the optimal bias in information recall for a single decision maker who must use information from two distinct times to make a policy decision. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we investigate the existence and the extent of the motherhood wage penalty as a potential impediment to having (more) children in a unique institutional environment. This environment is characterized by: de jure family supportive labor laws but de facto no legal enforcement of these laws; publicly subsidized childcare; and low cultural support for maternal employment, combined with extensive involvement of grand-parents. Relying on the data from the Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey over the period from 1997 to 2007, we find that the overall motherhood wage penalty in Ukraine is much lower than in countries with similar de jure family policies and cultural norms. It constitutes approximately 19%, controlling for individual unobserved heterogeneity, a number of human capital characteristics, actual time in the labor force, and selection into employment. We also find that the motherhood wage penalty differs by education, age at birth of first child, and marital status. Journal of Comparative Economics 44 (1) (2016) 56-75.

We complement the discussion by bringing the model's constructive mechanisms or self-implementing technologies in play. By this, we mean the elements of the economic model that are aimed at 'implementing' it by envisaging the ways to change the reality in order to bring it more in line with the model. We are thus concerned mainly not with the ways to change the model to 'fit' the reality, but rather with the model's own armature that is supposed to transform the world along theoretical lines. The case we study is Arrow-Debreu-McKenzie general equilibrium model. In particular, we show the following: gradient methods and stability could be regarded as constructive mechanisms of general equilibrium modeling in the context of market socialism debates; the obsession of general equilibrium theorists with these concepts can be partly explained by the fact that they hoped not to be faithful to reality, but rather to adjust it to fit the theoretical model; mechanism design theory initiated by the stability theorist Leonid Hurwicz could be seen as a successor of this position. We conclude by showing the relevance of this analysis for epistemic culture of much of contemporary economics and hence, claim that it is an important complement to the traditional philosophy of economic modeling.","[Boldyrev, Ivan] Univ Witten Herdecke, Dept Econ, Witten, Germany; [Ushakov, Alexey] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Int Coll Econ & Finance, Moscow, Russia",Witten Herdecke University; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Boldyrev, I (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Moscow, Russia.",ivan.boldyrev@uni-wh.de,"Boldyrev, Ivan/I-9071-2016",,,,,,89,17,17,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

The findings from regression analyses suggest that eWOM is positively related to travel intention; eWOM is positively related to destination trust; and destination trust is positively related to travel intention. Additionally, the impact of eWOM on destination trust was significant for both genders but stronger for men, while the impact of destination trust on travel intention was stronger for women.

We first exposit that in the presence of Cobb-Douglas production functions and consumer preferences, there is a specific pattern of economic transmission whereby demand-side shocks propagate upstream (to input-supplying industries) and supply-side shocks propagate downstream (to customer industries) and that there is a tight relationship between the direct impact of a shock and the magnitudes of the downstream and the upstream indirect effects. We then investigate the short-run propagation of four different types of industry-level shocks: two demand-side ones (the exogenous component of the variation in industry imports from China and changes in federal spending) and two supply-side ones (TFP shocks and variation in knowledge/ideas coming from foreign patenting). In each case, we find substantial propagation of these shocks through the input-output network, with a pattern broadly consistent with theory. Quantitatively, the network-based propagation is larger than the direct effects of the shocks. We also show quantitatively large effects from the geographic network, capturing the fact that the local propagation of a shock to an industry will fall more heavily on other industries that tend to collocate with it across local markets. Our results suggest that the transmission of different types of shocks through economic networks and industry interlinkages could have first-order implications for the macroeconomy.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Acemoglu, Daron; Akcigit, Ufuk; Kerr, William] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Akcigit, Ufuk] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Kerr, William] Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Pennsylvania; Harvard University,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023; Akcigit, Ufuk/IXD-8968-2023",,,,,,54,137,153,20,96,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0889-3365,1537-2642,,NBER MACROECON ANNU,NBER Macroecon.

We propose a special type of process that ensures the convergence of the short-term interest rate spread to zero by a fixed moment in time, which we call the discrete-time Brownian bridge process. Using this process and the conventional pricing kernel framework, we derive double recursive formulas for computing the affine coefficients for the term structure of interest rate spread. The estimated model counterpart, which is based on the pre-EMU interest rate spread data for the interest rates of the German mark and Italian lira, fits the data reasonably well and captures the stylized empirical facts. Namely, spreads for all maturities have downward trends, and the longer the maturity is, the less spread there is.","[Aevskiy, V.] Econophys SIA, Model Validat Dept, Riga, Latvia; [Chetverikov, V.] Natl Res Univ, Dept Appl Math, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Aevskiy, V (通讯作者)，Econophys SIA, Model Validat Dept, Riga, Latvia.",ajevsky.vadim@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We prove that the former occurs when the agent taking loans is relatively poor and the future does not matter very much.

Some expect major changes in international taxation in the near future but no one yet knows what changes will be made or when, how, and how effectively they might be implemented. Instead of speculating about such matters, this paper considers the process by which countries are attempting to reform international taxation problems, essentially through complex technical and political negotiations intended to produce an improved set of soft law arrangements, adherence to which will, as in the present system, be essentially voluntary. The current process, although under the aegis of the OECD, is considerably more inclusive than earlier negotiations on international taxation, which were largely between developed countries that were predominantly capital exporters. Greater inclusivity may make negotiations more difficult to conclude successfully but it may also result in a system that will be more widely accepted as fair.

The current research neglects this aspect of migration in the Slovak context. However, it is argued here that insightful understandings of this issue are vital to a more holistic appreciation of migration. As such, this study fills the gap in our current knowledge, contributing by providing a piece of puzzle to the fascinating, but complex reality of human movement across borders. Specifically, the paper seeks to shed light on gains and risks stemming from this movement. This research employs the theory of tacit knowledge developed by Blacler, who identified 4 classes of knowledge: embrained, embodied, encultured and embedded. The paper uses qualitative thematic analysis of in-depth interviews. They illuminate how tacit knowledge gained by the experience of migration facilitates the decisions of migrants' to never return to their home country. This is because the fulfilment, both personal and professional, is firmly associated with the tacit knowledge and the country which provided the knowledge.","[Chrancokova, Martina] CSPV SAV, Prognost Inst, Sancova 56, Bratislava 81105, Slovakia",Slovak Academy of Sciences,"Chrancoková, M (通讯作者)，CSPV SAV, Prognost Inst, Sancova 56, Bratislava 81105, Slovakia.",martina.chrancokova@gmail.com,"Chrancokova, Martina/AAE-6429-2019","Chrancokova, Martina/0000-0002-2778-2175",,,,,33,1,1,0,1,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-210-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,258,266,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH8SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000403638200027,0

When one requires uniqueness of the rationalizable outcome maximization of consumers' surplus may involve a symmetric oligopoly with few firms. We interpret uniqueness of the rationalizable outcome as favoring a dampening of strategic 'coordination' uncertainty. An illustration to the merger between Delta Air Lines and Northwest shows that a reallocation of 1% of market share from a small carrier to a larger one has implied a lower production volatility over time, yielding a 1.5% decrease in the coefficient of variation of number of passengers.

These findings conform to the hypothesis that foreign owners facing an information disadvantage concerning the local conditions of their subsidiaries are more likely to favour short-term profit.

Since the inconsistency that results from that global markets are regulated by national institutions, and given the States resistance to cede sovereignty in the field of competition policy, we explore how an international body could be set for the detection and investigation of the only restrictive practice for which there is inter-jurisdictional consensus about its harmful effects on the economy: hard core cartels. Specifically, we propose the creation of an International Investigation Service and analyze how it would perform its task in practice.","[Garcia Hidalgo, Jose Luis; Palma Martos, Luis] Univ Seville, Catedra Polit Competencia, Seville, Spain; [Lopez-Escobar Anguiano, Alfonso] Agencia Def Competencia Andalucia, Andalucia, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Hidalgo, JLG (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Catedra Polit Competencia, Seville, Spain.",josebillano@gmail.com; Ipalma@us.es; alfonsoc.lopezescobar@juntadeandalucia.es,"Hidalgo, Jose Luis García/AAP-8838-2021",,,,,,28,0,0,0,4,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,2340-4264,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

In conditions of globalization the demand for high quality programs in the field of further professional business education, as well as competition between such programs, has increased significantly. Factors that contribute to the more intense competition in the Russian market for business education include internationalization of business practices and development of international management standards, which enhances the all activeness of foreign business schools for the Russian consumers of educational services. The results of research carried out at the Faculty of Economics of Lomonosov Moscow State University illustrate the dynamic changes in the factors that determine the competitiveness of business schools in the Russian market for business education. Successful business schools introduce new business models and use an increasing variety of strategies. The authors show that there are new features of strategic behavior for the providers of further professional business education in Russia: the emphasis on network cooperation such as joint development of educational products with business organizations and foreign business schools, expansion of product range through increased diversity of educational programs and new emphases in their content structure, with greater attention to management for international companies and networks, cross-cultural communication in business, interdisciplinary aspects and global trends in the innovative development. The authors' conclusions are based on questionnaires and interviews conducted in 2016 with MBA students, experts of the Russian Association of Business Education and managers of business schools operating in Russia.","[Gerasimenko, Valentina V.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Econ, Leninskie Gory 1-46,Room 710, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Molchanova, Olga P.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Econ, Leninskie Gory 1-46,Room 602, Moscow 119991, Russia",Lomonosov Moscow State University; Lomonosov Moscow State University,"Gerasimenko, VV (通讯作者)，Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Econ, Leninskie Gory 1-46,Room 710, Moscow 119991, Russia.;Molchanova, OP (通讯作者)，Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Econ, Leninskie Gory 1-46,Room 602, Moscow 119991, Russia.",vv_gerasimenko@mail.ru; opmolchanova@econ.msu.ru,"Gerasimenko, Valentina/AAU-4478-2020",,,,,,17,1,1,0,6,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,475,482,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800059,0

The studies led to the identification of the motives, needs, expectations, concerns and experiences of these companies and helped to develop criteria assessing the maturity of a smaller enterprise to conduct Lean Six Sigma projects. As one of the results of the study, a maturity indicator to LSS has been developed and presented in this paper. The index is a part of the original comprehensive methodology of the Lean Six Sigma implementation dedicated to the SME sector (LSS Plutus methodology).

As competition tightens, high-productivity producers gain market share at the cost of low-productivity ones, generating economic growth through increased aggregate productivity and capital accumulation, in line with what is observed empirically. Consequently, competition is not limited to reducing deadweight losses, and can play a greater role in economic growth and development than traditionally assumed. Economic growth spurs profits, which leads to entry and increased competition that generates growth, so competition provides a channel through which the economy generates growth internally. When strong enough, this channel can make the returns to scale in the inputs that the economy accumulates endogenously go from being decreasing to nondecreasing at the aggregate level, thus enabling endogenous growth. In fact, these returns to scale are determined endogenously in our model, and vary with the scale of production, the degree of producer heterogeneity, and the barriers to entry.","[Jensen, Christian] Univ S Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Jensen, C (通讯作者)，Univ S Carolina, Dept Econ, 1705 Coll St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",cjensen@alumni.cmu.edu,"Jensen, Christian/ABE-1188-2021","Jensen, Christian/0000-0002-0058-0848",,,,,55,2,2,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Broadly speaking, the wage response to permanent shocks is twice the size of the response to transitory shocks. Unlike previous findings, my results show that full insurance against transitory shocks is rejected.","[Katay, Gabor] Banque France, FR-75001 Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Kátay, G (通讯作者)，Banque France, FR-75001 Paris, France.",gabor.katay@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,32,2,3,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

Several of surveys show that OGB is rather popular for selling recreational activities and leisure services, such as restaurant coupons, cinema, spa, concert, flight tickets, museum visits, etc. Therefore, the paper aims to identify and estimate the influences that affect the customers to purchase the leisure services coupons on online group buying. Summarizing the significant findings in scientific literature, we identified six influences, namely price, trust, belonging to virtual community, system quality, information quality and service quality towards customers' intention to buy the leisure services coupons on group buying sites. The testing of these influences included two stages: focus groups interview and questionnaire. The data was collected from three focus groups and 81 customers - experts using OGB. Inconsistent with previous research results and our proposed hypotheses, the findings of research partly support the appropriateness of suggested influences for understanding customers' online group buying intentions. Results of the research show that price has the greatest impact on customers' intention to buy on group buying sites, while other influences have no significant effect. Besides, we identified positive relationships among customers' group buying experience (positive/negative), customers' purchase frequency in online group buying and intention to buy on group buying sites in the nearest future. Thus, customers on OGB are very oriented to price and use OGB for cost-saving reason.","[Langviniene, Neringa; Zemblyte, Jurgita; Sliziene, Gelmine] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Langviniene, N (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",neringa.langviniene@ktu.lt; jurgita.zemblyte@ktu.lt; gelmine.sliziene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,37,1,2,4,68,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The tests for cointegration detect the number of common stochastic trends determining the mortality indices, derived from the Lee-Carter model, for countries from a homogeneous cluster,. forecasts are generated by the vector error correction model. Based on out-of sample forecasts, this approach leads to estimates of life expectancy near those provided by the Lee Carter model.

We exploit a change in school choice that occurred in Oslo county in 1997, where school authorities altered policy from one based on catchment zones to an open enrollment policy that allowed pupils to apply to any high school. Our estimates show that parents substantially value better performing schools because the sensitivity of housing valuations to school performance falls significantly (by over 50 percent) following the school choice reform that made the move to open enrollment.","[Machin, Stephen] Univ London, London WC1H 0AX, England; [Salvanes, Kjell G.] Norwegian Sch Econ, NO-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Machin, Stephen] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England",University of London; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Machin, S (通讯作者)，Univ London, London WC1H 0AX, England.;Salvanes, KG (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, NO-5045 Bergen, Norway.",s.machin@ucl.ac.uk; kjell.salvanes@nhh.no,,,ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,29,24,32,2,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

For many years attitudes were understood as three-component constructs (cognitive, affective, and behavioral), with an assumption that the person has introspective access to his/her attitude, can verbalize it, and expresses it in a questionnaire. Since the 1980s scientists' attention has been drawn to the unconsciousness of attitudes and the automatic character of them. Introduced the concept of implicit attitude and the method of measuring them-the IAT, a computer-based method using reaction time (RT) as an indicator of attitude strength. At the beginning the IAT was used to study racial attitudes, self-concept, and self-esteem. Nowadays the IAT is used in many other areas, including consumer attitudes (toward brands or categories), both in academic research and in practical context. In this chapter are presented three empirical studies using IAT for researching consumer implicit attitudes: (a) implicit consumer ethnocentrism-implicit attitudes toward local vs. foreign brands (n = 92); (b) implicit attitudes toward smoking depending on smoking experience (n = 82); and (c) implicit attitudes toward erotic advertising-the difference between women's and men's reactions (n = 92).","[Maison, Dominika] Univ Warsaw, Robert B Zajonc Inst Social Studies, Dept Psychol, Ctr Psychol Res, Stawki 5-7, PL-00183 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Maison, D (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Robert B Zajonc Inst Social Studies, Dept Psychol, Ctr Psychol Res, Stawki 5-7, PL-00183 Warsaw, Poland.",dominika@psych.uw.edu.pl,,,,,,,51,2,3,1,24,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-28419-4; 978-3-319-28417-0,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,107,124,,10.1007/978-3-319-28419-4_8,0.0,,,18,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF9OA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385789700008,0

By providing physical and human resources of public institutions (and public schools), it is possible to implement new forms of organizing major events, one of which is the popularization symposium. The aim of this paper is to explore the organizational and infrastructural prerequisites of popularization symposium as a new organizational platform, as well as to analyze its measurable effects. An example where the indicated paradigm has been analyzed refers to popularization symposium of cultural and creative industries (CCI) - industries that are currently in the process of formal institutionalization. Establishment of the sector of cultural and creative industries is stimulating professional and scientific thinking about vital points that are important for the structure of the industries. Confrontation of theory and practice organized by public institutions, which is open to the general public, is an innovative approach to establish a dialogue of heterogeneous participants in those emerging sectors. Regarding the above mentioned, the Creative Treasury - popularization symposium on cultural and creative industries, has been organized at the Faculty of Economics in Osijek in 2015 and 2016 as a kind of an experiment, which brought together creative professionals, amateurs and scientists. By organizing major events, public institution ceases to be just an educational institution and becomes an active factor of experience economy. In addition to its role as the unifying platform, popularization symposium in this paper is being evaluated as a new kind of organizational platform for major events, which sets the main hypothesis that this type of platform can be used for interaction between exhibitors and visitors, but also as a platform for research studies of heterogeneous participants.","[Mijoc, Josipa; Horvat, Jasna; Zrnic, Ana] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Mijoc, J (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",jmijoc@efos.hr; jasna@efos.hr; ana.zrnic1@gmail.com,"Horvat, Jasna/AAC-5827-2022; Mijoč, Josipa/J-9969-2018","Horvat, Jasna/0000-0001-9665-1470;",,,,,7,4,4,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,255,266,,,,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600025,0

Moreover, the equalization capacity of transfer systems did not improve during the past decade. We also show that, in general, transfer systems in the region are distributed without consideration of fiscal capacity and explicit measures of expenditure needs, hampering their equalization potential.

It is emphasized that economic disequilibrium can be maintained indefinitely, sometimes for many decades. This indicates that non-equilibrium systems have a special internal self-organization forming a certain kind of economic order therein. The role of globalization in this order is analyzed. It is shown that the long-term disequilibrium with decreased sustainable development was observed in Russia throughout the Soviet and transition periods. It was manifested in growing structural imbalances and chaos, reduced management effectiveness, and regular economic crises afterwards. However, the similar negative phenomena of the transformation period were considerably less evident in Eastern Europe. The reasons for non-equilibrium trends were analyzed in the context of globalization effects. It is established that in Russia, where internationalization of the economy actually started only after the collapse of the Soviet Union, these reasons were low product competitiveness, mainly raw-exports role in the foreign trade, lack of investment, capital outflow. As for Eastern Europe, positive effects of globalization, such as facilitating economic cooperation between countries and increasing international division of labor, were more evident with regard to them. It is shown that this is significantly associated with the common European historical and cultural values, common territorial, economic and information space, which allowed mitigating the impact of negative aspects of globalization on the sustainable development in the context of economic disequilibrium. The purpose of the study is to identify the conditions and mechanisms of globalization impact on sustainability of development of economic systems. Methods of the study: historical and economic analysis method; abstract logic method; comparative analysis; elements of the method of nonlinear dynamics theory.","[Nikolaev, Mikhail] Kazan Fed Univ, Russian Univ Cooperat, Kazan Cooperat Inst Branch, Kremlyovskaya St 18, Kazan 420008, Russia; [Belyakin, Alexander] Kazan Natl Res Tech Univ KAI, Russian Univ Cooperat, Kazan Cooperat Inst Branch, K Marx St 10, Kazan 420111, Russia",Kazan Federal University; Kazan National Research Technical University - KAI,"Nikolaev, M (通讯作者)，Kazan Fed Univ, Russian Univ Cooperat, Kazan Cooperat Inst Branch, Kremlyovskaya St 18, Kazan 420008, Russia.",mnikolae@yandex.ru; anzag73@mail.ru,,,,,,,21,2,2,0,5,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1512,1520,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800187,0

A few key factors seem to be the major drivers of the globalization process. It deals with ITC (Information technology and Telecommunication), logistics, political borders and customs. Mainly the first two drivers ITC and logistics have obviously a crucial impact on the growing and ongoing process of globalization. This is combined with various effects not only on participating companies, but also on countries and their politics as well as on people and especially on employees and the comparability of production costs. Scientific literature about globalization is mainly split in two groups: explaining advantages for companies and making life easier for everybody and such explaining disadvantages for employees due to global comparability, reducing social standards, exploitation and labor unions are played against each other. Environmental protection and human rights belong to losers of globalization as well.

Most foreign visitors are boaters and tourists on cruise ships arriving to the easternmost part of Croatia on the Danube. Their interest opens new perspectives for the development of nautical tourism on rivers, and thus economic recovery of this part of Croatia. In order for Eastern Croatia to exploit this potential of river tourism, it is necessary to highlight important problems that slow down its development. Of 500 cruise ships sailing on the Danube annually, only half of them stop in Croatia. During their stay in Croatia, passengers on river cruise ships usually go sightseeing and/or on excursions to the surounding area. Passengers' consumption can be considered relatively modest in comparison with other destinations. Croatian river-bank and its interior are, for many river tourists, completely unknown and unexplored destinations. Along the banks of the Danube, Sava, and Drava, there are towns with historic cores and arachaeological sites, nature parks and great cultural offer. Arrival of river tourists offers excellent opportunities for development of small and medium-sized enterprises, tourist rural households, tourism on family farms, traditional and protected crafts, and new jobs. It is also necessary to ensure a sufficient number of tourist products. Pre-defined arrival and sizes of tourist groups provide excellent opportunities for development of small and medium-sized enterprises, tourist rural households, tourism on family farms, traditional and protected crafts. Fostering the construction of Croatian river cruise ships would contribute to the development of river tourism and economy in general, especially since there are no registered river cruise ships made in Croatia in the Croatian Register of Shipping. The state has still not recognised the potential of nautical tourism on rivers. None of the strategic development documents of the Republic of Croatia in the field of tourism, agriculture or river transport mention nautical and cruising tourism on rivers as an economic potential. The aim of the paper is to define the development potential of this tourism segment, set goals, identify problems and opportunities, analyse the existing situation and the environment, and consider possible scenarios for positive outcomes of the project of river cruising development.","[Ozbolt, Vesna Skare; Herak, Martina] Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia; [Herak, Ivan] DIU Libertas Int Univ Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Ozbolt, VS (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",vesna.skareozbolt@gmail.com; i.herak@yahoo.com; m.herak@yahoo.com,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,5,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,318,326,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600031,0

This is an original approach in economic literature as it is not based on the traditional Shift-Share analysis. This study is proposed between 2004 and 2013, the last decade in which data are available for exports and deflators. The obtained results distinguish a different profile between Eastern countries, the latest admissions, against Western countries, the most veteran ones within the Union. Thus it can be concluded that Eastern countries, especially Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, are highly competitive in the food foreign sector, mainly compared with Western countries. These countries have a strong agrifood sector, but they have other sectors whose competitiveness is more remarkable. Then the entry of Eastern countries in the European Union has meant an improvement in their agrifood economies and a path to the benefits of globalization.","[Ruiz Chico, Jose; Pena Sanchez, Antonio Rafael; Jimenez Garcia, Mercedes] Fac Ciencias Sociales & Comunicac, Ave Univ S-N, Jerez de la Frontera 11405, Spain",,"Chico, JR (通讯作者)，Fac Ciencias Sociales & Comunicac, Ave Univ S-N, Jerez de la Frontera 11405, Spain.",jose.ruizchico@uca.es; rafael.pena@uca.es; mercedes.jimenezgarcia@uca.es,"GARCÍA, MERCEDES MJG JIMÉNEZ/U-9879-2018; Chico, José Ruiz/AAP-3319-2020",,,,,,18,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,711,718,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800088,0

It focuses on financial globalization by examining how it gave rise to the crisis. Lessons have been drawn from the crisis and the flaws preceding the Great Recession. The thorough analysis of the policy measures taken to mitigate the serious effects of the crisis creates a basis for shaping the next stage of operating the single currency system. The complexity of the financial systems and profound changes since the 1970s called for reforms to make the global financial system more resilient to shocks. The deep financial integration increased the euro area's vulnerability to shocks and cross -border contagion. Without the bold use of unconventional central bank tools as a response to recession, the meltdown of the financial system might not have been avoided. Central banks implemented quantitative easing (QE) by purchasing financial assets simultaneously- increasing the money supply. The European Central Bank was the first major central bank to cut the interest rates below zero. The unconventional tools, however, have been ineffective in increasing inflation. Consequently, economies are likely to have to face a deflationary pressure. The paper aims to examine how monetary policy could better contribute to financial stability and how the tools of monetary and macroprudential policies can strengthen the resilience of the global fmancial system and reduce the vulnerability of EMU as the long -run stability of the euro area is vital for the future of Europe.","[Solt, Eszter] Dennis Gabor Coll, Mernok Utca 39, H-1119 Budapest, Hungary",,"Solt, E (通讯作者)，Dennis Gabor Coll, Mernok Utca 39, H-1119 Budapest, Hungary.",solt@gdf.hu,,,,,,,20,0,0,1,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2043,2051,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800254,0

Static and rolling correlations over a period of time were compared with the prescribed correlations for developed and developing economies and found to be significantly more conservative.","[Stoffberg, Hestia Jacomina; van Vuuren, Gary] North West Univ, Sch Econ, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Stoffberg, HJ (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Econ, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",hestia@live.co.za,"van Vuuren, Gary/B-5453-2019","van Vuuren, Gary/0000-0001-6811-0538",,,,,64,1,1,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The accounting policy of agricultural business subjects must be formed based on agency theory, which demands to satisfy the interests of users who employ such information, and signalling theory, which emphasizes the reliability of the information. Factors influencing the formation of accounting policy of agricultural business subjects are the following: chosen view towards the accounting policy; the specifics of activities of agricultural business subjects; possibilities to choose from accounting methods given in accounting regulations; the demands of investors in regards to the financial information in order the investors could make correct and timely management and investment decisions.

An uncontrolled growth of multinational companies, as well as the events on the financial markets, has pushed the capitalist system to its limits, which sadly showed that the system too often cared for the welfare of the certain influential circles only. Therefore, the public pressure and demands for the more transparent business operations of the multinational companies have grown significantly. The first conference on integrated reporting held in 2011 in Rotterdam, where in addition to the International Integrated Reporting Council, over 80 companies and 25 investors took part, indicated the need for developing the higher quality reporting systems. The Council was formed with the purpose of helping the stakeholders to make better corporate decisions based on the integrated financial and non-financial sets of reports. The mission of this Council is to create an internationally accepted framework that would inform the public on the strategy, management, results and goals of the company businesses in a clear, summarized and comparable way that should influence the quality of the corporate reporting. The rules of such form of reporting are currently being established within the Global Reporting Initiative. The aim of the Initiative is to create the rules of reporting that would inform the public about the managerial philosophy, promoted by the owners and the management, and their intention to create, in addition to financial, also a social capital. By disclosing non-financial information, the company is making an important step in informing all the stakeholders and making the management transparent and reliable. The Global Reporting Initiative offers a mature methodology that provides the preparation of the social accountability reports. The social accountability, particularly in the international business environment, is the key quality factor in business operations, not only in achieving profitability, but also in building the society as a whole.","[Svigir, Andreja] Altius Savjetovanje Doo, IB Mazuranic 24, Zagreb 10090, Croatia; [Sacer, Ivana Mamic] Fac Econ Zagreb, Trg JF Kennedya 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Svigir, A (通讯作者)，Altius Savjetovanje Doo, IB Mazuranic 24, Zagreb 10090, Croatia.",andreja.svigir@altius.hr; imamic@efzg.hr,"Mamic Sacer, Ivana/H-9069-2018","Mamic Sacer, Ivana/0000-0001-9125-8637",,,,,17,0,0,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,560,569,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600057,0

The pioneering business model in the field was built around the knowledge sharing (Wikipedia), but the business logic rapidly expanded in other industries resulting in the establishment of similar business models in tourism, mobility, employment, consumption and other industries. The underlining principle of the sharing economy is maximized use of resources leading to the improved efficiency and reduced waste. In addition, these business models allow customers to access requested goods at comparatively lower prices resulting in the improved customer satisfaction and hence, very profitable companies. However, these innovative business models are not fully integrated with existing market conditions since they are rarely aligned with the legislative framework and/or labor market policies. As a result, there are meaningful critics of these business models, where the most severe ones are related to the introduction of a non-fair competition and creating insecure job positions. The main aim of the paper is to examine the effects between innovative business models, that based on the principle of sharing economy and supported by ICTs, and their external environment, where the external environment is evaluated through well-established PEST tool. Research is undertaken through multiple-case study approach including 10 different innovative business models, allowing the author to make to-certain-extent general conclusions and recommendation. The paper results in the assessment of the integration degree of innovative business models within the external environment and the evaluation of positive and negative effects of implementation of these models for their environment. The major implication of the paper is the proven opinion that principle of sharing economy supported by ICT is a paradigm shift in the current economy that will have a power to influence the changing the legislative framework on the global scale.","[Umihanic, Umihana] Entrepreneurship Dev Ctr Tuzla, Trg Slobode Bb, Tuzla 75000, Bosnia & Herceg; [Omerovic, Mirela] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Univ 8, Tuzla 75000, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Umihanic, U (通讯作者)，Entrepreneurship Dev Ctr Tuzla, Trg Slobode Bb, Tuzla 75000, Bosnia & Herceg.",umihana.umihanic@hotmail.com; mirela.omerovic11@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,36,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,833,839,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600083,0

What differentiates GRAM from other state-of-the-art models in this field is that it does not use a matrix balancing technique, such as RAS, after the initial construction of the global intermediate coefficient and final demand matrices. Instead, it reproduces prescribed intermediate and final demand, and determines value added residually. This choice was made to alter the original data as little as possible and keep the calculations traceable. This simpler solution technique might, however, yield different results. This paper aims at identifying the difference between the current solution of GRAM and the solution of a RASed version of GRAM, thus contributing to the assessment of currently used methodologies in this research field. The short conclusion is that, even though some differences during the calculations are present, the calculated output (production) matrix does not differ substantially. The results show that larger differences are brought about by poor assumptions regarding missing or conflicting data rather than by applying or not applying a RAS procedure to the constructed global matrices.","[Wiebe, Kirsten S.] GWSmbH, Osnabruck, Germany; [Wiebe, Kirsten S.] UNU MERIT, Tc Maastricht, Netherlands; [Lenzen, Manfred] Univ Sydney, ISA, Sch Phys, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Maastricht University; University of Sydney,"Wiebe, KS (通讯作者)，GWSmbH, Osnabruck, Germany.;Wiebe, KS (通讯作者)，UNU MERIT, Tc Maastricht, Netherlands.",wiebe@gws-os.com,"Wiebe, Kirsten Svenja/I-4498-2019; Lenzen, Manfred/D-3161-2013","Wiebe, Kirsten Svenja/0000-0003-3105-4194; Lenzen, Manfred/0000-0002-0828-5288","German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); Australian Research Council (ARC) [DP0985522, DP130101293]",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council),"The work was supported by a fellowship within the Post-Doc Programme of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), and by the Australian Research Council (ARC) under its Discovery Projects DP0985522 and DP130101293.",,42,31,32,4,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

The VAT gap is an estimate of unpaid VAT in the economy calculated as the difference between the theoretical VAT liability and VAT actually paid into the state budget. It is often expressed in relative terms as a percentage of unpaid VAT from the theoretical VAT that would be collected if all taxpayers report and pay VAT in full. The high value of this indicator may imply problems with tax evasion and inefficiency within the tax system. The article summarises the existing studies quantifying the VAT gap and seeking to identify the relationship between the VAT gap or VAT revenues and various economic, tax and social factors present in individual countries. The panel regression and pooled regression models were used in this paper to identify the statistically significant variables that have an impact on the VAT gap. From 21 variables, only four factors proved to be statistically significant. The analysis revealed that the increase in the ratio of VAT revenues to GDP causes a reduction in the VAT gap. Further findings were that if the standard VAT rate and the difference between the standard and reduced VAT rate are increasing, the VAT gap grows. Finally, the control variable share of household consumption in GDP is increasing the VAT gap.","[Zidkova, Hana; Pavel, Jan] Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Publ Finance, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Zídková, H (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Publ Finance, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",hana.zidkova@vse.cz; pavelj@vse.cz,"Pavel, Jan/E-5003-2017; Zídková, Hana/D-8151-2015","Zídková, Hana/0000-0003-3661-6993; Pavel, Jan/0000-0001-7028-0640","University of Economics, Prague [IP100040]","University of Economics, Prague","This work was supported by the University of Economics, Prague under Grant IP100040.",,39,10,10,5,19,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

We provide empirical support for modelling the provision charge ratio dynamic by the quadratic function of the credit growth deviation from its optimal level. The operational framework consists of a simplified financial satellite with two equations representing credit growth and change in the provision charge ratio.

Such shocks have been linked to frictions in financial markets, because financial markets are instrumental in transforming consumption goods into installed capital. Yet we show that the importance of these investment shocks is greatly diminished when collateral constraints on firms are introduced into an estimated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. In the presence of binding collateral constraints, risk premium shocks take on a more prominent role as drivers of the business cycle. Modellers of business cycle fluctuations need to be mindful of the incompatibility of investment shocks and collateral constraints and of the difficulty in specifying 'structural' shocks that are robust to modest amendments to the frictions present in a model.

To estimate the persistence of the relative stock price, we employ an operational algorithm that is based on two statistical notions: the short memory in mean (SMM) and the short memory in distribution (SMD). Using MSCI stock price indices of the G7 countries, we obtain strong empirical evidence of convergence of national stock prices in France, Germany, and the UK vis- -vis the US index. Also, we obtain much faster convergence rates from our nonlinear models in comparison with those from linear alternatives. On the contrary, our results imply very limited evidence of convergence for Canada, Italy, and Japan. Similarly weak evidence of convergence was obtained from non-G7 developed countries. Our simulation exercise for portfolio switching strategies overall confirms the validity of empirical findings in the present paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Increasing wage inequality amongst graduates has been observed in a number of countries. This paper takes as an example the UK, where the increase in inequality has been amongst the highest, to investigate any potential link between these two phenomena of participation and inequality. Dividing graduates by subject of degree to provide more variation, we show that most of the increase in graduate wage inequality has occurred within subjects. We investigate two potential explanations, specifically the increase in the variance of childhood cognitive test scores amongst graduates in the same subject, and the widening variety of jobs performed by graduates with degrees in the same subject. The paper shows that both of these factors have played a role in explaining growing graduate wage inequality within subjects, though the largest is by far from the increased variance of test scores. The results also show that mean test scores are falling over time within every subject to a greater or lesser extent, suggesting that the widening variance of test scores is due to universities accepting individuals from lower in the ability distribution, as Higher Education participation has expanded.

Aiming at the staff in Landis Hotels & Resorts as the research subject, total 280 copies of questionnaires are distributed, and 176 valid copies are retrieved, with the retrieval rate 63%. The research findings show the significant correlations between 1. Organizational Support and Professional Commitment, 2. Professional Commitment and Employee Engagement, and 3.

I show that CSR approaches that dominate the academic discourse either instrumentalize the social, idealize the corporate, or separate the corporate from the social. Based on a critical political economy perspective I argue that it is necessary to consider mutual interrelations between profit goals and social goals. This perspective reveals an antagonism between the corporate and the social that points to the impossibility of CSR. Critical CSR research thus far has failed to draw the necessary conclusions from its own analysis: despite acknowledging the structural flaws of the concept of CSR, critics have hardly made any attempts to overcome it. I argue that despite its ideological character CSR contains a rational element. Realizing this rational kernel however requires going beyond CSR. I therefore suggest a new concept that turns CSR off its head and places it upon its feet.","[Sandoval, Marisol] City Univ London, Dept Culture & Creat Ind, London EC1V 0HB, England",City University London,"Sandoval, M (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Culture & Creat Ind, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",marisol.sandoval.l@city.ac.uk,,,DOC scholarship from the Austrian Academy of Sciences,DOC scholarship from the Austrian Academy of Sciences,"The author declared the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by a DOC scholarship from the Austrian Academy of Sciences.",,67,14,15,3,65,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

The threshold effect is robust across models having different structural orderings of shocks. Evidence shows that shocks associated with different financial stress regimes explain the asymmetric responses of the system. Shocks in the stressed regime usually have larger and longer effects than shocks in the normal regime. The inverse relationship between real interest rate and real oil price is conditioned on a number of factors, and is not robust across all manner of circumstances. The relationship between oil price and the US dollar is shock-dependent. A negative shock that depreciates the dollar may trigger an increase in oil price, yet a positive oil shock may lead to appreciation of the dollar. Finally, oil's ability to hedge against rising risk is limited to a market with normal stress conditions. It is the US dollar that generally serves as a safe haven when financial markets are enmeshed in considerable tension. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Patent families are a set of related patents filed in one or more foreign jurisdictions to protect the same invention. We find that by the turn of the century China emerged as major actor in terms of international patenting. Nonetheless, the share of Chinese patents which get filed abroad is still a fraction of patents filed at home; most patents abroad also only target one foreign country. Moreover, China's foreign patents are concentrated in a few technology fields and in a few firms, mostly the information technology sector. A shift is underway however to an increased proportion of filings abroad. The paper finds that the main drivers for this change are the desire to facilitate collaboration, to license IP, and to further the firm's reputation as true innovator. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This finding has important implications for small EU member states, including that smaller countries have to overcome their economies of scale constraint in order to attain and maintain international competitiveness.

With this Act, most of the exports from SSA can now enter the USA duty-free, and this is expected to boost the exporting and manufacturing sectors in SSA. Hopefully, this singular act of assistance from the USA will spur entrepreneurship in SSA, thereby creating jobs and jump starting meaningful economic growth in the region. Since trade is a major catalyst in economic development, AGOA is arguably the most meaningful intervention from a developed country to an under-developed region such as SSA in recent times. Has AGOA had any impact on US trade with SSA? This paper sheds some light on this issue by examining the flow and composition of trade between the USA and AGOA countries. The analysis uses trade data (US imports) for 36 countries over 12years. Empirical estimations based on the gravity model show that receiving AGOA status has a strong positive and significant impact on overall trade with the US. Interestingly, however, the analysis also shows a disproportionate impact of crude oil imports from the oil-producing countries of Angola, Gabon, and Nigeria, which is clearly not the intent of the Act.","[Didia, Dal; Yu, Geungu] Jackson State Univ, Dept Econ Finance & Gen Business, Jackson, MS 39217 USA; [Nica, Mihai] Univ Cent Oklahoma, Dept Econ & Int Business, Edmond, OK 73012 USA",Jackson State University; University of Central Oklahoma,"Didia, D (通讯作者)，Jackson State Univ, Dept Econ Finance & Gen Business, Jackson, MS 39217 USA.",dal.o.didia@jsums.edu,,,,,,,35,12,15,1,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

This paper considers economic factors of victimization using individual data. It tests the rational-choice-based hypothesis that the more attractive and poorly guarded targets are facing a higher risk of victimization. The used dataset also covers own criminal activities such that individual offending behavior can be studied as endogenous driver of victimization. Econometric results confirm that a criminal background is one of the major reasons of own victimization. In line with rational choice behavior of offenders, victimization is also associated with being a job holder and more schooling. Moreover, large peer groups increase the risk of victimization, whereas married and healthy people have a significantly lower risk of becoming a crime victim.","Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Entorf, H (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,59,3,3,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

In contrast to existing models which rely on a representative agent, we model a game among a regulated group of agents, possibly heterogeneous in their levels of a regulated activity, that compete through their compliance decisions to avoid being targeted for future audits. The empirical properties of the dynamic tournament are established using economics experiments. In particular, we test comparative statics, highlight the importance of inducing competition through comparisons with a (non-competitive) standards-based targeting mechanism, and demonstrate enforcement leverage through comparisons with simple random audits. The experiments suggest that the dynamic tournament induces incentives consistent with theory, and overall we find that (introducing) competition in the regulatory enforcement arena may have important advantages.

The large exchange rate depreciation that occurred during the crisis resulted in a decline in net worth for firms with foreign-currency denominated debt on their balance sheets. Small firms with more short-term foreign debt were more likely to declare bankruptcy. Conditional on surviving the crisis, small firms that had more short-term foreign debt experienced larger declines in sales.

Once the redistributive effect in each country is quantified, we try to explain the drivers of cross-country time-series differences.

We provide empirical evidence that the presence of agency problems mitigates the negative effects of environmental regulations on overall R&D activity, which leads to full compensation when the degree of agency problems is sufficiently high. Guiding our empirical analysis, we provide a general model consistent with the structure of existing ownership data. Specifically, we model ownership structure as a combination of two extreme corporate governance types. On the one extreme there are profit maximizers, and on the other extreme there are managers who are only concerned with their private benefits. The model leads to a simple country level ownership indicator and shows that if an economy is dominated by firms with higher agency problems, then pollution tax might even increase overall R&D, while reducing pollution. According to our estimations, such an outcome is possible only for out-of-sample values of the ownership indicator, where the degree of agency problems is extremely high. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Secondly, we construct a multiple assets financial market by incorporating two new types of agents, namely, zero-intelligence agents and less-intelligence agents, and conduct simulations for different evolution speeds, strategies, and intelligence levels to achieve the optimal models of Chinese and U.S. financial markets before and after the financial crisis. Based on the simulation results, we present a comprehensive analysis of the market microstructure for the two financial markets.","[Yang, Haijun; Sun, Gui Ping; Wang, Li] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Wang, Harry Jiannan] Univ Delaware, Alfred Lerner Coll Business & Econ, Newark, DE USA",Beihang University; University of Delaware,"Yang, HJ (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",navy@buaa.edu.cn; hjwang@udel.edu; sgping@163.com; Liwang@buaa.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71171010],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We would like to thank those anonymous reviewers who gave us much valuable advice to revise this manuscript.

Evidence from China,APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,political connections; bond spreads; China; bondholders,FIRM PERFORMANCE,"This article examines the association between political connections and the pricing of bonds in China. Political connections are associated with higher at-issue spreads on corporate bonds, implying that political connections do not ensure the alignment of interests between managers and bondholders. The adverse effects of political connections on borrowing costs are eliminated when the chairman and the CEO are politically connected. Evidence suggests that bondholders price new debt issuances by using the information about the political backgrounds of top managers. Moreover, the costs and benefits of political connections for bondholders vary with the extent of the connectedness of a firm.","[Ho, Po-Hsin] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan; [Wang, Yu-Chun] Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lin, Chih-Yung] Yuan Ze Univ, Coll Management & Innovat, Ctr Big Data & Digital Convergence, Taoyuan, Taiwan",National Taipei University; Ming Chuan University; Yuan Ze University,"Lin, CY (通讯作者)，Yuan Ze Univ, Coll Management & Innovat, Ctr Big Data & Digital Convergence, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",d95723009@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,15,3,3,1,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Until recently, this view was widely accepted by scholars, with cross-country regressions indicating that higher per capita incomes are indeed associated with higher levels of democracy. However, recent empirical work has shown that the positive effect of per capita income on democracy disappears with the inclusion of country fixed effects. Moreover, a heterogeneous effect of income on democracy has been found for countries that were colonized relative to those that were not. This article revisits the issue by examining whether the identity of the colonizer matters. Results reveal a negative association between income and democracy for former British colonies.

Most studies of prediction markets outside the lab are from public markets with large trading populations. Corporate prediction markets face additional issues, such as thinness, weak incentives, limited entry, and the potential for traders with biases or ulterior motives-raising questions about how well these markets will perform. We examine data from prediction markets run by Google, Ford Motor Company, and an anonymous basic materials conglomerate (Firm X). Despite theoretically adverse conditions, we find these markets are relatively efficient, and improve upon the forecasts of experts at all three firms by as much as a 25% reduction in mean-squared error. The most notable inefficiency is an optimism bias in the markets at Google. The inefficiencies that do exist generally become smaller over time. More experienced traders and those with higher past performance trade against the identified inefficiencies, suggesting that the markets' efficiency improves because traders gain experience and less skilled traders exit the market.","[Cowgill, Bo] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zitzewitz, Eric] CESifo & NBER, Dartmouth Coll, Cambridge, MA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Dartmouth College,"Cowgill, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"Cowgill, Bo/ABE-4537-2020","Cowgill, Bo/0000-0002-2525-2306",,,,,65,54,58,0,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Such measures, e.g. thin capitalization rules, have become increasingly widespread as governments have reacted to growing profit shifting activities of multinational companies. However, besides limiting profit shifting, such rules entail costs. As the regulations can only focus on the means to shift profits, not on profit shifting itself, they impose costs on all firms, no matter whether these firms shift profits abroad or not. In the model, these costs force some firms to exit the market. Thus, as the resulting lower competition makes the remaining firms more profitable, regulations to limit profit shifting may even increase the aggregate amount of profits shifted abroad. From a welfare point of view, it can be optimal not to limit profit shifting by such rules.","[Langenmayr, Dominika] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, D-80779 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Langenmayr, D (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Akad Str 1-2, D-80779 Munich, Germany.",dominika.langenmayr@econ.lmu.de,,"Langenmayr, Dominika/0000-0002-4228-5046",Bavarian Graduate Program in Economics,Bavarian Graduate Program in Economics,Financial support from the Bavarian Graduate Program in Economics is gratefully acknowledged.,,37,3,3,0,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

A temporary but persistent distribution shock causes the income share of capital owners to fluctuate in a procyclical manner, consistent with US data. The concentrated ownership model significantly magnifies the equity risk premium relative to a representative-agent model because the capital owners' consumption is more-strongly linked to volatile dividends from equity. With a steady-state risk aversion coefficient around 4, the model delivers an unlevered equity premium of 3.9 percent relative to short-term bonds and a premium of 1.2 percent relative to long-term bonds.","[Lansing, Kevin J.] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94120 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco,"Lansing, KJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, POB 7702, San Francisco, CA 94120 USA.",kevin.j.lansing@sf.frb.org,,,,,,,46,17,17,0,12,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7707,1945-7715,,AM ECON J-MACROECON,Am.

However, this paper argues that religious organizations need free-riders in a dynamic setting. If individuals' contributions to congregations increase as their exposure to religion increases, then allowing potential members to free-ride temporarily may increase future membership and contribution levels. Free-riders thus comprise a risky but necessary investment by the church. Strict churches screen out riskier investments yet still allow some free-riding, while ultra-strict churches screen out all but members children.

The Court rejected the contention of the US Internal Revenue Service that eligibility for the FTC should be governed by the legislative form of the tax rather than its economic substance. This decision could have far-reaching implications for the creditability of taxes that are not ordinarily thought to be income taxes, including various cash-flow business taxes that are key elements of several proposals recommending replacement of the income tax with a consumption-based tax. This article examines these issues, arguing that one and arguably both of the most common forms of cash-flow consumption-based taxes should be creditable; it also discusses questions that remain about the interpretation of key regulatory requirements that govern creditability.","[McLure, Charles E., Jr.] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mintz, Jack] Univ Calgary, Sch Publ Policy, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Zodrow, George R.] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Zodrow, George R.] Rice Univ, Baker Inst Publ Policy, Houston, TX USA; [Zodrow, George R.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford, England",Stanford University; University of Calgary; Rice University; Rice University; University of Oxford,"Zodrow, GR (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",zodrow@rice.edu,"Zodrow, George/JCP-2735-2023",,,,,,31,0,0,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Considering that the insufficiency of leisure spaces in blighted urban neighbourhoods gives rise to social and cultural problems in Tehran, this research aims to identify the best leisure space in a blighted urban site. The selection process uses the combination of a new hybrid MCDM model and GIS. The integration of GIS and MCDM makes a powerful tool for the selection of the best leisure space in a site because GIS provides efficient manipulation, analysis and presentation of spatial data while MCDM supplies consistent weight of sub-criteria and criteria. The results show the interrelations between dimensions and criteria, also influential priorities and the most important sequences of those.

What are the short-run and long-run effects of a change in the money supply? What is the social cost of inflation? I answer these questions using a microfounded model of monetary exchange that replaces the rational expectations assumption with an adaptive learning rule. First, I show that monetary exchange is a robust arrangement in the sense that agents are able to learn the stationary monetary equilibrium while the non-monetary equilibrium is unstable under learning. Second, an unanticipated monetary injection has real effects in the short-run because learning the value of money takes time. In the long run, agents successfully learn the value of money, hence money is neutral. Third, under a constant money growth policy, an increase in the growth rate of money increases output in the short-run producing a short-run Phillips curve. A ten percent increase in the money growth rate has a social cost of 0.41 percent of output per year. Alternatively, a ten percent decrease in the money growth rate has a social benefit of 037 percent of output per year. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Because banks' lending rate cannot be made contingent on aggregate shocks, and because banks face capital adequacy regulations, they require a capital buffer against loan losses. Capital adequacy regulations are modeled on the Basel-III rules, including a minimum capital adequacy ratio, an endogenous capital conservation buffer, and a countercyclical capital buffer.

This aim is motivated by the observation that while the study of moral choice behaviour has received much attention in Economics and Psychology, the explicit consideration of the moral dimension of decisions is rare in the Choice modelling field. I first review a number of classical theories and results concerning the nature of moral decision making, and how it is shaped by social processes. Based on this review, I discuss in what ways the discrete choice modelling approach can be used to gain new insights into moral decision making, and how ideas from the moral decision making literature may be used to enhance the behavioural realism of choice models. I will argue that these research endeavours hold the potential to further increase the appeal and applicability of discrete choice models in the broader social sciences.

Our results are as follows. First, both ethnic segregation and language segregation exhibit a strong and robust correlation with the incidence of conflict at any intensity level; that is, from civil wars to social disorder and protests. Conversely, religious segregation does not affect any type of conflict. Second, ethnic segregation and language segregation are related to the escalation and continuation of conflict but are unrelated to its onset. Regardless of the mechanism of segregation, its effect is unrelated to the outbreak of violence but it is related to the reinforcing of existing conflicts. Third, two channels of influence are trust and secession threats, in the sense that the measures associated with those channels are influenced by segregation and, at the same time, reduce the effect of the geographic group concentration on conflict.

We contend that entrepreneurial diagnosis is present in markets where consumers are unable to diagnose their own problems and, instead, rely on the entrepreneur to diagnose them. Although it is widely recognized that consumers face information asymmetries over price comparison and quality assessment, little attention has been given to information asymmetries regarding individual customers' needs. This has led to the economic contribution of the diagnostic entrepreneur being overlooked. Entrepreneurial diagnosis is a cognitive skill possessed by the entrepreneur. It is a subset of entrepreneurial judgment and can be modeled. The model shows that in order to exploit opportunities it is often necessary for entrepreneurs to invest in market-making activities, such as customer-focused diagnostic services, backed up by credible reputations for competence and integrity. While diagnostic entrepreneurship is particularly important in knowledge-intensive service industries (such as medicine) it is important in all industries whenever radical product innovation occurs (e.g. modern computers and phones). Successful commercialization of innovation often requires, not only new technology, but diagnostic entrepreneurship too.","[Godley, Andrew C.; Casson, Mark C.] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Godley, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading, Berks, England.",a.c.godley@henley.reading.ac.uk; m.c.casson@reading.ac.uk,"casson, mark/HOF-1580-2023","Godley, Andrew/0000-0002-3160-2499",,,,,29,21,21,0,23,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

As such, energy, the economy, and the environment should all be considered when evaluating energy efficiency. This paper constructs an energy inefficiency index and discusses sources of energy inefficiency, simultaneously considering the heterogeneity of production technology, non-radial slacks, and undesirable outputs. The paper presents three major findings from an empirical study across 209 Chinese cities. First, the energy inefficiency index established in this paper provides potential ways to reduce energy intensity. Energy inefficiency is negatively correlated with economic development; the efficiency improvement potential is approximately 30%. Second, technology gaps and managerial inefficiency are the two main sources of energy inefficiency, accounting for 58% and 42% of the inefficiency, respectively. Third, the production frontier of high income cities is closest to the best production frontier. The technology gap of energy inefficiency in middle income cities is significantly smaller than cities with different incomes. Based on the empirical findings, cities were divided into four different categories, facilitating strategic policy analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, we contrast a bivariate GARCH volatility model for cointegrated underlyings with the alternative of modeling the crack spread directly.

Research papers have analyzed the evolution of SWFs from stabilization funds to stand-alone wealth management funds; we both survey this research and show that more than 25 countries have launched or proposed new SWFs since January 2008. The most salient and controversial feature of SWFs is that they are state-owned; we survey the existing literature on state ownership and discuss what this predicts about the efficiency and beneficence of government control of SWF assets. We discuss the documented importance of SWF funding sources (oil sales revenues versus excess reserves from export earnings) and survey the normative literature describing how SWFs should allocate funds. We then summarize the empirical literature studying how SWFs actually do allocate fundsacross asset classes, geographically, and across industries. We document that most SWF equity investments in publicly traded firms involve cross-border purchases of sizeable minority stakes (median around 20%) in target firms, with a strong preference for investments in the financial sector. Next, we assess empirical studies examining the impact of SWF stock investments on target firm financial and operating performance, and find universal support for a positive announcement period stock price increase of 1-3%. This, however, is significantly lower than the 5% abnormal return documented for stock purchases by comparable privately owned financial investors in recent studies, indicating a sovereign wealth fund discount. We conclude by summarizing the lessons of SWF research and pointing out unresolved issues.","[Megginson, William L.] Univ Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Megginson, William L.] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Durban, South Africa; [Fotak, Veljko] SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Fotak, Veljko] Bocconi Univ, Sovereign Investment Lab, Baffi CAREFIN Ctr, Milan, Italy",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; Bocconi University,"Megginson, WL (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",wmegginson@ou.edu,,,,,,,106,57,58,2,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

This analysis permits us to determine if there was an inefficient use of information in the sense that the forecast revision has predictive power for the forecast error. Research on forecast smoothing suggests that we might find a positive relationship between the forecast error and the forecast revision. Although we do find for some variables and horizons the Fed's forecast errors are predictable from its forecast revisions, there is no evidence of forecast smoothing. Instead the revisions sometimes have a negative relationship with the forecast error, suggesting in these cases that the Fed may be over-responsive to new information. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The results from the study show that real interest rates are very persistent when such breaks are not taken into account. However, the findings also indicate low persistency in real interest rates for all countries when such breaks are allowed in the data-generating process.

This paper analyses the effect of generating companies' risk aversion on their medium-term (typically 1 year) hydroelectric resource planning, along with its possible inducement of system operation that deviates from the centralised (maximum social welfare) solution. Forward markets may play a key role by making hedging instruments available to risk-averse agents. A stylised mathematical model is used in this study to prove the equivalence of centralised planning and market equilibrium in the presence of such agents under the following assumptions: 1) both the spot and forward markets are perfectly competitive; 2) it has at least one risk-neutral consumer or arbitrageur; 3) all agents share the same beliefs about uncertain parameters; 4) only one price is in place in each trading period (which can be perfectly hedged with a forward contract); and 5) a solution for the resulting market equilibrium problem exists. The findings show that such equivalence vanishes when forward markets are missing or inaccessible (attributable in some electricity markets to the absence of demand-side participation). This article consequently suggests that requiring demand-side agents to sign forward contracts with generators might constitute an effective regulatory measure where no fully functional forward market is already in place.

Appreciations of the local currency expose domestic plants to more competition as export opportunities shrink and import competition intensifies. As a result, smaller less productive plants are forced from the market, which truncates the lower end of the productivity distribution, and surviving plants face a reduction in physical sales (unless they adjust their mark-up), which, in the presence of scale economies, can lower productivity.

The purpose of our article is to show that this emphasis emerged from two different re-conceptualisations of liberal democracy by Chicago economists during the post-war period The first was Frank H. Knight's enquiry into whether rational norms for intelligent democratic action provided the means to avoid the failures of liberalism that had become so apparent through the upheavals of the first several decades of the twentieth century. The second came from Aaron Director, who concluded instead that democratic action was inherently irrational and disputatious, and that the efficiency of actions undertaken with the context of the competitive order was to be preferred. Knight argued that an appreciation for competition must be accompanied by recognition of the equally fundamental roles of democratic discussion and ethics, whilst Director asserted the fundamental role of competition in the economic realm and its import for freedom.","[Van Horn, Robert] Univ Rhode Isl, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Emmett, Ross B.] Michigan State Univ, James Madison Coll, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of Rhode Island; Michigan State University,"Van Horn, R (通讯作者)，Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Econ, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",rvanhorn@mail.uri.edu,"Emmett, Ross/AAS-4217-2021","Emmett, Ross/0000-0002-2891-554X",,,,,34,8,8,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

As one of important methods, production-theoretical decomposition analysis (PDA) has been widely used to understand these driving factors. To avoid the infeasibility issue in solving the linear programming, this study proposed a modified PDA approach to decompose carbon dioxide emission changes into seven drivers. Using 2005-2010 data, the study found that economic development was the largest factor of increasing carbon dioxide emissions. The second factor was energy structure (reflecting potential carbon), and the third factor was low energy efficiency. Technological advances, energy intensity reductions, and carbon dioxide emission efficiency improvements were the negative driving factors reducing carbon dioxide emission growth rates. Carbon dioxide emissions and driving factors varied significantly across east, central and west China. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While other studies (for example, Commonwealth of Australia (2008a), Clarke and Waschik (2012)) model coal as a single aggregate sector, we disaggregate coal into black and brown coals. Brown coal is non-traded while most black coal is exported, and brown coal has a higher emission intensity than black coal. Coal is a differentiated product whose production is characterized by the existence of very large fixed costs and considerable differences in the ratio of capital expenditures to capacity between coal mines, so we use Balistreri and Rutherford (2012) and Melitz (2003) to incorporate increasing returns to scale production technology and heterogeneous productivities between monopolistically competitive coal firms. We find that while the aggregate effects of achieving a given level of abatement are largely unaffected by disaggregation of coal, the effects within the black and brown coal sectors are very different. The introduction of increasing returns to scale and heterogeneous firms does have important effects on the aggregate welfare costs of achieving a given level of abatement. When monopolistically competitive coal producers face more inelastic demand, welfare costs rise, firm exit falls, and the carbon price needed to achieve a given level of abatement falls.

A fixed effects (least squares dummy variable) model is developed that captures macroeconomic factors such as gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita income (PCI) in ratio form of home to host country. It also includes bilateral tax treaties as a determinant of FDI inflow. The results show that GDP is a major determinant that is demand driven and per capita income is a major determinant that is supply driven. FDI openness of the home countries and population are also significant determinants. The introduction of the treaty had a positive impact on FDI inflows into India. We get largely significant and positive results for the 'age of the treaty effect', especially, in the case of Germany, Switzerland and Japan. The main contribution of the paper is to show that both presence and 'age of treaty' are important determinants of FDI flows to India. Further, fundamentals like GDP and PCI are major variables that influence FDI inflows.","[Murthy, K. V.

A few studies have examined the effects of 'big box' stores on prices, food choices and obesity, but the present study extends empirical examination to all types of stores to determine if there are significant differences in their effects on obesity prevalence. Four types of retail food outlets are examined: supermarkets, supercentres and warehouse club stores (i.e. 'big box' stores), convenience stores and specialty stores. Counties with more retail food stores experience lower prevalence of adult obesity, but this inverse relationship appears to stem from greater numbers of supermarkets and specialty food stores. Obesity prevalence is positively associated with market shares of 'big box' and convenience stores.","Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Econ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Marlow, ML (通讯作者)，Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Econ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",mmarlow@calpoly.edu,,,,,,,10,7,9,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

If no FV-anchor is set, bubble-crash patterns emerge. Our results indicate that bubbles in laboratory environments are primarily sparked in the first period. If prices are initiated around the FV, they stay close to the FV over the entire trading horizon.

The underlying oligopoly structure is standard: using a constant return to scale technology, N firms produce homogeneous goods, which are sold in a market characterized by constant price elasticity. In this setup, we assume that a fraction affirms employs a quite rough rule of thumb, the so-called Local Monopolistic Approximation (LMA), whereas the complementary fraction plays Best Reply (BR), a more demanding strategy in terms of information and computation requirements. The model is first considered with exogenously fixed fractions of firms in the two complementary groups. Then it is generalized by considering an endogenous evolutionary switching process between the two behavioral strategies based on profit-driven replicator dynamics. The role of the number of firms, information costs and inertia (or anchoring attitude) in production decisions is analyzed, as well as the influence in the evolutionary process of random noise in the demand function and memory of past profits. Global properties of the oligopoly with evolutionary pressure between behavioral rules are discussed, with particular regard to cases in which the Nash equilibrium is unstable. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Multinational firms face the opportunity not to comply with environmental regulation and to escape towards countries with lax environmental regulation (i.e. the pollution haven hypothesis). However, the studies on how firms respond to environmental regulation fail to take into account the specific behaviour of multinational firms. Accordingly, I advance a conceptual framework based on the international business literature to guide future research agenda on how multinational firms respond to environmental regulation. In particular, by integrating the Porter hypothesis and the pollution haven hypothesis in an international business context, I suggest that multinational firms are attracted to countries with lax environmental regulation when they lack the capabilities to respond creatively to environmental regulation in advanced countries.","Univ Catania, Dept Polit & Social Sci, I-95131 Catania, Italy",University of Catania,"D'Agostino, LM (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Via Vittorio Emanuele 2,8, I-95131 Catania, Italy.",ldagosti@unict.it,"D'Agostino, Lorena/M-4505-2013; D'Agostino, Lorena/AAL-5498-2020","D'Agostino, Lorena/0000-0002-6361-6123; D'Agostino, Lorena/0000-0002-6361-6123",,,,,98,25,28,9,84,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

It accounts for multiple major categories of regulations and demand inducement as well as direct price effects. While concurring with prior studies that find ready-to-embalm regulations increase funeral costs and decrease the percentage of cremations, this study finds that several other state regulations are associated with significantly higher receipts per death. The regulation with the largest apparent effect on average funeral costs is the direct disposition license, which is associated with a $1250 reduction in receipts per death. Restrictive regulations affect the revenues of funeral homes and services to a much greater extent than they affect the revenues of cemeteries and crematories, and in some cases the regulations even increase funeral homes and services' share of industry revenues. Thus, it appears that funeral homes receive most of the benefits of regulation.","[Ellig, Jerry] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Ellig, J (通讯作者)，4711 Forest Dr,Suite 3 135, Columbia, SC 29206 USA.",jellig@yahoo.com,,,Association of Independent Cemeteries,Association of Independent Cemeteries,The author received research funding from the Association of Independent Cemeteries.

Our main finding is that simply eliminating the multipart tariff structure does not necessarily lead to better decisions. Rather it is multipart tariffs with included values in excess of monthly fees, thus entailing two-tier pricing structures with increasing marginal costs, which lead to the worst decisions.

Because of these positive externalities, policymakers across the world should be interested in attracting and retaining happy and life-satisfied migrants. This paper studies the link between life satisfaction and one's intentions to move abroad. Using survey data from 35 European and Central Asian countries, I find a U-shaped association between life satisfaction and emigration intentions: it is the most and the least life-satisfied people who are the most likely to express intentions to emigrate. This result is found in countries with different levels of economic development and institutional quality. The instrumental variable results suggest that higher levels of life satisfaction have a positive effect on the probability of reporting intentions to migrate.

We apply the volatility impulse response function proposed by Hafner and Herwartz (2006) to quantify the impact of financial crises on expected conditional volatility. We observe that financial crises have positive and large impacts on expected conditional variances, but the size and dynamics of the impact is largely market specific. We specifically find evidence in favour of increased market integration. Consequently, had a financial crisis occurred recently, the impact of it on expected conditional variance would have been significantly lower nowadays compared with the initial dates when the financial crisis occurred. Finally, we estimate the density of the VIRF at different forecast horizons. These fitted distributions are asymmetric and show that large increase in expected conditional volatilities are possible even if their probability is low. These features denote good efficiency and reaction to shocks from market participants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This research has examined the effects of the two modes of foreign bank entry, namely, minority ownership participation, and setting up branches and subsidiaries, on the performance of Chinese banks. Our results suggest that there is no systematically significant impact of the minority ownership participation on the performance indicators of Chinese banks. However, it appears that the physical presence of foreign banks has been a significant driver for domestic banks to improve profitability and efficiency.

A single, standardized contract that imposes full joint liability subject to a limited liability cap is optimal. Further, if gross returns to borrowing are moderately high, this contract results in perfectly efficient lending if groups are large enough. However, raising group size accomplishes nothing if there is no local borrower information. These results show that more is required for efficient lending than full within-group insurance, and highlight a complementarity between group size and social capital. Very similar results are shown in two different settings, ex ante and ex post moral hazard, though the type of social capital that complements group size varies across the settings. Taking a step toward modeling drawbacks of larger groups, it is shown that if information deteriorates sufficiently with group size, an intermediate group size does better than either extreme. Simulations suggest that most of the efficiency gains from larger groups are realized in group sizes below ten, and that outreach and efficiency can increase dramatically when a moderate group size threshold is crossed.

For this purpose, we develop a novel dynamic general equilibrium model with a focus on the interlinkages between migration, the labour market and education. The main innovation of the paper is the retrospective modelling in general equilibrium of the impact of an economic crisis to isolate the impact of migration on local unemployment. The impact of the crisis on education decision is captured through endogenous returns to education. The simultaneity of the crisis in Tunisia and its partners worsened the labour market situation mainly through the increase in labour supply. The main result of this study is that migration is indeed one of the main determinants of the unemployment increase and that remittances have a higher impact than the variation of emigration flows. The low skilled bear the highest costs in terms of unemployment and wage decline.","[David, Anda M.] Univ Paris 09, DIAL, UMR, PSL,LEDa,IRD, Paris, France; [Marouani, Mohamed Ali] Univ Paris 01, IEDES, DIAL, Paris, France; [Marouani, Mohamed Ali] ERF, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"David, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, DIAL, UMR, PSL,LEDa,IRD, Paris, France.",david@dial.prd.fr; Marouani@univ-paris1.fr,"Marouani, Mohamed Ali/AAV-5017-2020","Marouani, Mohamed Ali/0000-0002-9052-1517",,,,,35,7,7,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

This paper examines the effects of non-financial incentives on test performance. We conduct a randomized field experiment on more than a thousand sixth graders in Swedish primary schools. Extrinsic non-financial incentives play an important role in motivating highly skilled students to exert more effort. We find significant differences in test scores between the intrinsically motivated control group and three of four extrinsically motivated treatment groups. The only treatment not increasing test performance is criterion-based grading on an A-F scale, which is the typical grading method. Test performance is significantly higher if employing rank-based grading or giving students a symbolic reward. The motivational strengths of the non-financial incentives differ across the test score distribution, across the skill distribution, with peer familiarity, and with respect to gender. Boys are only motivated by rank-based incentives, while girls are also motivated by receiving a symbolic reward. Rank-based grading and symbolic rewards tend to crowd out intrinsic motivation for students with low skills, while girls also respond less to rank-based incentives if tested with less familiar peers.

The Swiss government, for example, paid out CHF 4.26 billion or 0.72% of the Swiss GDP for health insurance premium subsidies in 2011. Analyses of premium subsidies have often highlighted that the increased insurance demand due to premium subsidies increases the effects of moral hazard in the market. Other consequences of premium subsidies, however, have mostly been neglected by the literature. We show in our theoretical model that the wealth effects of premium subsidies decrease the sensitivity of the insured towards the monetary consequences of losses. This leads to less prevention efforts by the insured and thus increases moral hazard in the market. The effect is preserved if the subsidy is financed through proportional taxation. Using two alternative models, we show that providing state-dependent subsidies can either increase or reverse this effect, depending on which state subsidies are paid. We argue that whether demand effects or wealth effects of premium subsidies will dominate the insured's behavior depends on the market structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Polarized preferences over the conduct of fiscal policy emerge between those agents who participate in credit markets and those who do not. Exogenous shocks impact the two types of agent differently, and as a result, fiscal policy responses to these shocks produce minimal aggregate welfare effects as the gains of one agent are matched by the losses of another.

This paper builds on the framework of imperfect information in Lucas (1972) and Lorenzoni (2009) to show how government spending can stimulate consumption. Owners of firms targeted by an increase in government spending perceive an increase in their permanent income relative to their future tax liabilities, while owners of firms not targeted remain unaware of the implicit increase in future tax liabilities, causing aggregate consumption to increase. I show that a testable implication of this model namely that the value of firms should increase in response to government spending shocks, implying all else equal an increase in aggregate stock returns is consistent with empirical evidence.

Each firm includes 5,772 daily observations. Our sample involves a total of 3,936,504 observations to investigate how U.S. stock returns respond differently to oil price shocks prior to, during, and after a financial crisis. We provide evidence that U.S. stock returns in turn respond positively to the changes in oil prices during and after such a crisis. We use firm-level data to find that positive and negative oil price shocks have asymmetric effects on stock returns during the crisis and after the crisis. Then, we examine whether the effect of an oil price shock on stock returns varies across oil-intensive industries. Within the crisis and post-crisis, our results indicate that stock returns in response to oil price shocks across industries are heterogeneous, and the stock returns of some energy-intensive manufacturing industries respond more positively to oil price shocks compared with less energy-intensive manufacturing industries. We use total assets, total revenue, and the number of employees as proxy variables to measure each firm's size and then examine whether oil price shocks affect stock returns differently across firm sizes. We find that big firms are the most strongly and negatively influenced by an oil price shock prior to the crisis. On the other hand, our results indicate that an oil price shock in the post-financial crisis period is positively amplified in the case of medium-sized firms.

Second, by simulating a modified Solow-Swan economy we demonstrate that the convergence-speed of shocks in these systems significantly affects the long-run growth trajectory of output.

Therefore, preferences may not provide the most desirable yardstick to evaluate social states. The present paper proposes unconditional love as a candidate for such a yardstick. The concept of unconditional love, although lofty, is often hard to apply for practical policy recommendations. We propose an intermediary learning stage, where learning to unconditionally love is desirable, and policies that promote such learning are deemed to be good.

We employ the Internet platform to identify vacant rental apartments in different areas of the two largest Spanish cities, Madrid and Barcelona. We send emails showing interest in the apartments and signal the applicants' ethnicity by using native and foreign-sounding names. We find that, in line with previous studies, immigrants face a differential treatment when trying to rent an apartment. Our results also indicate that this negative treatment varies considerably with the share of immigrants in the area. In neighborhoods with a scarce presence of immigrants the response rate is 30 percentage points lower for immigrants than for natives, while this differential decays towards zero as the immigration share increases. This evidence indicates that discriminatory practices may perpetuate the spatial segregation of minority groups.","[Bosch, Mariano] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Angeles Carnero, M.] Univ Alicante, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Farre, Lidia] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Farre, Lidia] IAE CSIC, Barcelona, Spain",Inter-American Development Bank; Universitat d'Alacant; University of Barcelona; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Carnero, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",acarnero@ua.es,"Farre, Lidia/AAA-1991-2019; Carnero, M.

We make a distinction between broad-based profit sharing, share and stock option plans. The panel data allow us to take into account time-lag effects, as profit sharing is usually said to have short-term effects, while share plans and stock options and are intended to have longer term impact. Our results show that broad-based profit sharing and share plans and combinations of these plans are positively related with financial performance when compared with companies without such plans. However, the results are inconsistent for the associations between broad-based stock option plans and financial performance in the longer term. These findings extend the literature on financial participation plans by including different forms of broad-based financial participation and showing that the different forms affect companies' financial performance differently. Our results also support earlier reports in the literature, which suggest that there are important synergies between broad-based profit-sharing and share plans, in terms of a better combination of intrinsic ownership behaviors and extrinsic motivation of employees as well as a stronger focus on collective interest and performance when compared with single plans.","[Braam, Geert; Poutsma, Erik] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Nijmegen Sch Management, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Braam, G (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Nijmegen Sch Management, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",g.braam@fm.ru.nl,,,SNPI,SNPI,"The authors thank Hanne Meihuizen for her earlier work Meihuizen (2000) and for starting to develop the dataset, SNPI for financial support and Paul Moors for his research assistance.

Two modern econometric approaches, sharp transition and smooth transition, are employed to examine the dynamic processes of RIRP in the work. More specifically, the novel approaches which specify Carrion-i-Silvestre et al.'s (2005) model and the Fourier function are adopted to re-examine the RIM Some major findings are summarized as follows. Firstly, the empirical results are remarkably consistent, even when using distinct numeraire countries or/and using alternative definitions of the real interest rates. Moreover, we obtain results indicating RIRP fulfillment in most cases, whether we adopt the panel or univariate stationarity tests. However, we fail to obtain the strong evidence in favor of RIRP by the Narayan and Popp (2010) unit root test. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We show that multiple steady states may arise under these two policies, with club convergence occurring, and the initial condition being of relevance, if the tax rate of labor income for skilled labor is fairly high. Under a policy of child allowances, an increase in the tax rate is found to raise the quantity of children, but lower the quality of adults; however, under a policy of educational subsidies, with an increase in the tax rate, corresponding increases are found in both the quantity of children and the quality of adults. For developed countries, introducing child allowances may improve or hurt the welfare while introducing educational subsidies is welfare improving. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The new growth economics provided useful insights for policy-makers, some of which were partly heeded. Recently, as productivity growth has stalled, there has been a turn to 'soft' industrial policy and a fear that the future is one of secular stagnation. The former has made little difference and the latter is unlikely.","[Crafts, Nicholas] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Crafts, N (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",n.crafts@warwick.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,126,3,4,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Amazon's aggressive (low) pricing of e-books led to allegations that e-books were bankrupting brick and mortar book booksellers. Amazon's commanding position as a bookseller also raises concerns about monopoly power, and publishers are concerned about Amazon's power to displace them in the book value chain. I find little evidence that e-books are primarily responsible for the decline of independent booksellers. I also conclude that entry barriers are not sufficient to allow Amazon to set monopoly prices. Publishers are at risk from Amazon's monopsony (buyer) power and so sought agency pricing in an effort to raise the price of ebooks, promote retail competition, and reduce Amazon's influence as an e-retailer. (In the agency pricing model, the publisher specifies the retail price with a commission for the retailer. In a traditional, wholesale pricing model, publishers sell a book to retailers at a wholesale price and retailers set the retail price.) Although agency pricing was challenged by the Department of Justice, it may yet prevail in some form as an equilibrium pricing model for e-book sales.","Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Sch, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Gilbert, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Grad Sch, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rjgilbert@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,34,57,63,2,61,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

But existing relevant literature is silent about how agents' expectations become coordinated. This paper resolves the coordination problem in the use of a non-deferred electronic means of payment, which can be represented by a debit card. We focus on that because it is almost a perfect substitute for cash. The presence of exogenous shocks that have a fundamental impact on the cost of the technology makes agents coordinate their expectations in a particular way. We also show that a high inflation and a distortionary financing scheme for debit-card transactions cost disturb coordination in the use of debit cards.","[Huang, Pidong; Lee, Manjong] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University,"Lee, M (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",pidonghuang@korea.ac.kr; manjong@korea.ac.kr,,,Korea University [G1300026]; National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A3A2044238],Korea University; National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),We wish to thank the anonymous referees whose comments and suggestions were helpful in improving the quality of the paper.

In particular for France, the first country to experience this demographic transition in the European context, the reasons why some areas of the country had lower fertility than others are poorly understood. Using d,partement level data for the last quarter of the nineteenth century, this paper exploits the French regional variation to study the correlates of fertility, estimating various fixed-effects models. The findings confirm the importance of some of the forces suggested by standard fertility choice models. Education in general, female education in particular, for example, seems to be crucial. Results also highlight the relevance of non-economic factors (such as secularisation), for which I provide new measurements. The presence of spatial dependence also suggests that diffusion of fertility played a particular role.","[Murphy, Tommy E.] Univ Bocconi, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management PAM, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Murphy, Tommy E.] Univ Bocconi, Dondena Ctr Res Social Dynam & Publ Policy, I-20136 Milan, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Murphy, TE (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management PAM, Via Rontgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",,,,,,,,128,35,37,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

In analyzing the debate over the Speenhamland system, especially as Karl Polanyi ([1944] 2001) describes it in The Great Transformation, he offered an important criticism of a GI program that some contemporary Polanyian economists have been struggling to come to terms with in their writings. Instead of defending a GI policy by seeking to reject Polanyi's analysis of the problem, I suggest that we should consider embracing Polanyi's concern by proposing a comprehensive twin policy that would complement a basic income program with a Keynesian full employment commitment.","Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Seccareccia, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",,,,,,,,29,8,10,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Thus, what is the role of economic policy within the short/long run in amplifying or dampening shocks? Business cycle - economic growth relationship is rather ambiguous and has, thus, attracted controversy. In this sense the (dis)belief that there indeed exists a relationship between the economic growth and business cycle, and their long-run convergence brings us to three important hypotheses that: (1) the evaluation of cycle-growth bond is inconclusive, (2) empirical testing of cycle synchronization is exaggerated and (3) the hypothesis of coupling/decoupling is ambiguous and can be misleading. Economic growth is a complex process and cannot be attributed to a single factor of observance hence this essay is just a tool of theoretical reasoning with firm grip on empirical circumstances that lead us to consider some issues that dwell the growth economists these days.

We show that the distribution of the share of income earned by the wife exhibits a sharp drop to the right of 12, where the wife's income exceeds the husband's income. We argue that this pattern is best explained by gender identity norms, which induce an aversion to a situation where the wife earns more than her husband. We present evidence that this aversion also impacts marriage formation, the wife's labor force participation, the wife's income conditional on working, marriage satisfaction, likelihood of divorce, and the division of home production. Within marriage markets, when a randomly chosen woman becomes more likely to earn more than a randomly chosen man, marriage rates decline. In couples where the wife's potential income is likely to exceed the husband's, the wife is less likely to be in the labor force and earns less than her potential if she does work. In couples where the wife earns more than the husband, the wife spends more time on household chores; moreover, those couples are less satisfied with their marriage and are more likely to divorce. These patterns hold both cross-sectionally and within couples over time.","[Bertrand, Marianne] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore",University of Chicago; National University of Singapore,"Bertrand, M (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,"Pan, Jessica/AHA-4915-2022","Pan, Jessica/0000-0002-8640-9768","George J.

J,"Bianchi, M",,,,"Bianchi, Marina",,,Willingness to believe and betrayal aversion: the special role of trust in art exchanges,JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Trust; Transparency; Creative goods; Art markets,DISTRUST,"Lack of transparency is considered a major functional deficiency of art markets. The uniqueness of artworks, the subjectivity of the pleasure component in their appeal, the unequal access to verifiable information make information asymmetries, and their potential opportunistic use, one of the dominant characteristics of this market and one that is very difficult to remedy. Yet, art goods are not simply risk-intensive goods, as are financial assets. Their complexity and specificity have given ample room, not only for calls for greater transparency and more credible information, but also for building trust-based long-term relationships. Drawing on the distinction between decisions involving risk and decisions involving trust, the paper discusses how relational trust, based on confidentiality and reciprocity, has helped compensate for the lack of transparency to increase the overall trustworthiness of art markets. Yet, trust-based exchanges have a downside too, since trust, once gained, can also be used opportunistically to defend and exploit positions of privilege and power. This form of strategic trust can become an obstacle to the diffusion of information and the adoption of credible norms of transparency.","Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, Cassino, Italy",University of Cassino,"Bianchi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, Cassino, Italy.",marina.bianchi@unicas.it,,,Skate's Art Market Research; Sotheby's Institute of Art,Skate's Art Market Research; Sotheby's Institute of Art,"An earlier version of this paper was presented at the International Art Industry Forum Trust and Transparency in the Art Market.

The goal is to design an auction such that, whatever the underlying valuation distribution, its expected revenue is almost as large as that of an optimal auction tailored for that distribution. We propose the prior-independent Single Sample mechanism, which is essentially the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, supplemented with reserve prices chosen at random from participants' bids. We prove that under reasonably general assumptions, this mechanism simultaneously approximates all Bayesian-optimal mechanisms for all valuation distributions. Conceptually, our analysis shows that even a single sample from a distribution some bidder's valuation - is sufficient information to obtain near-optimal expected revenue. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

I find that the currency downside risk is strongly associated with the local inflation rate, real interest rate and net foreign asset position. Currencies of countries with high inflation and real interest rates and negative net foreign asset position (debtor countries) are more exposed to the downside risk whereas currencies of countries with low inflation and real interest rates and positive net foreign asset position (creditor countries) exhibit safe haven properties. The local real interest rate has the highest explanatory power in accounting for the cross-section of currency exposure to the downside risk. This suggests that the high currency exposure to the downside risk is a consequence of investments in high-yield risky countries and flight from them in hard times.","Natl Res Univ, HSE, Moscow 119049, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Dobrynskaya, V (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, HSE, 26 Shabolovka St, Moscow 119049, Russia.",vdobrynskaya@hse.ru,,"Dobrynskaya, Victoria/0000-0001-7602-7240",National Research University Higher School of Economics' Academic Fund Program [10-01-0069],National Research University Higher School of Economics' Academic Fund Program,"The author is very grateful to Christopher Polk, Andrea Vedolin, Irina Zviadadze, Lucio Sarno, seminar participants at London School of Economics, Gaidar Institute for Economic Policy, Annual Meeting of the Multinational Finance Society and World Finance Conference for their comments and suggestions.

We develop a model that examines the trade-off between these two actions and the consequences for infection rates. There exists a unique equilibrium: individuals who invest in protection choose to interact more relative to those who do not invest in protection. Changes in the contagiousness of the disease have non-monotonic effects: as a result interaction initially falls and then rises, while infection rates too may initial increase and then decline. We then consider a society with two communities that differ in their returns from interaction - High and Low. Individuals in isolated communities exhibit different behavior: the High community has a higher rate of protection and interaction, and a lower rate of infection. Integration amplifies these differences. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We first investigate the fluctuations in steady state unemployment, and then in current unemployment in order to take into account the unemployment deviations from equilibrium. Both data sets lead to quite similar results. Both rates contributed to unemployment fluctuations during the nineties (50:50 split), while in the last decade the job finding rate was more significant and explained around 65% of the French unemployment fluctuations. In particular, the last business cycle episode, including the last recession, exacerbated the role of the job finding rate. We then show that the predominant role of the job finding rate in the last decade holds when the economy is hit by aggregate business cycle shocks, moving unemployment and vacancies along the Beveridge curve.

On the demand side, exchange rate depreciation increases competitiveness and export growth, expanding output growth. On the supply side, depreciation increases the cost of imported inputs, increasing output capacity constraints and accelerating price inflation. The time-series evidence indicates that output expansion (contraction) and price deflation (inflation) predominate with anticipated currency appreciation (depreciation). The cross-country results show that exchange rate variability exacerbates the variability of economic activity across countries. Short-term fluctuations of the exchange rate may reflect the adverse effects of unanticipated currency fluctuations. Therefore, more flexibility towards aligning the real effective exchange rate with the underlying fundamentals could help mitigate the adverse effects of higher cost of imports and loss of competitiveness on real growth, and ease inflationary pressures.","IMF, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Kandil, M (通讯作者)，IMF, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",mkandil@imf.org,,,,,,,57,4,4,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

This hypothesized negative association between income inequality and the real exchange rate has robust empirical support from random- and fixed-effects models, dynamic panel estimations, and panel vector autoregressions. Thus, policies that improve a country's income distribution, by leading to a depreciation of the real exchange rate, may improve the competitiveness of its goods. However, this income inequality-real exchange rate relationship does not imply that dramatic redistributive policies will automatically bring about a real depreciation of the domestic currency.","[Min, Hong-Ghi] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Management Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Shin, Sang-Ook] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Finance, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [McDonald, Judith A.] Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, Bethlehem, PA USA",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Lehigh University,"Min, HG (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Management Sci, Seoul, South Korea.",hmin@kaist.ac.kr; sshin@mays.tamu.edu; djm0@lehigh.edu,"Min, Hong-Ghi/C-1763-2011",,,,,,17,3,4,1,12,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.
