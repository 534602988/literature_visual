Exchange rates' overshooting effects in the markets and consequential troubles are important causes of these political changes. The study aims at comparatively measuring the pass through impacts of exchange rates to the prices in Asia Pacific, Latin (South) America, and Turkey economies, which implement inflation targeting regime, but have the variable traits in dollarization and inflation experiences For calculating of pass-through effects from exchange rates to domestic prices, the model that is used in the study has five variable factors. Analysis of model is base of VAR approach. Due to cross section series are used in addition to time series, Panel VAR model has been used. Upon obtained findings, it can be said that pass-through effect in Asia Pacific economies is lower than pass-through effect in Latin America and Turkey.

While mostly positive effects for the farmers have been found for contracts and certifications, often these effects do not persist because contracts fail and certifications are not renewed. We suggest that individual firm behavior is crucial for the long-term success of farmeragro- business relationships. In this article, we use data of 386 smallholders in the pineapple export sector in Ghana, analyze them quantitatively and enrich it by a detailed case study of a large-scale agro-business in Ghana. The results show that, in an environment with weak contract enforcement, certification is an agent of change in farmer-agro-business relations and that building trust and aligning expectations of farmers and firms largely determine success. We conclude that individual firm behavior matters more than taken into account in previous research. Our case study shows that three 'R' - reliability, reputation and respect -constitute the basis for contract relationships that benefit all.","[Kleemann, Linda] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Kleemann, L (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",linda.kleemann@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,24,3,4,2,13,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Substituting labour with machines is a step forward, but most people lose their job and thus the dominant source of income. This article has to show, that the technological unemployment is not just a threat, but it can have also a positive effect for the dismissed workers consisting in making them partial owners of the new assets and thus rich people with passive incomes. Methodology/methods There are used secondary data to analyze the structure of incomes and expenses in czech households. Using the Spearman coefficient of rank correlation there is determined the connection between the gross domestic product per capita and the expenses for different goods and services. Subsequently, there is deduced, which expenses can be postponed and so which amount of money is available to save. Scientific aim The main aim of this article is to suggest a course of steps to keep the dismissed workers in the form of broadening the ownership structure after automation of production. So there is specified broadening capital ownership as a solution to technological unemployment. Findings There was found out that most kinds of expenses are firmly correlated with the gross domestic product. So these bought goods and services are not necessary and their consumption can be postponed. But the period, when the employees should save money to invest it, should be longer than ten years. Conclusions The suggested approach to broaden the ownership structure regards the actual standard of living, which is derived from the goods and services, whose consumption is not very firmed correlated with the gross domestic product. Furthermore, it is applicable for managers to determine, which part of wage should be saved periodically to keep the standard of living into the future.","[Konecny, Zdenek; Meluzin, Tomas] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Konecny, Z (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",konecnyz@fbm.vutbr.cz,,,Internal Grant Agency at Brno University of Technology [FP-S-15-2825],Internal Grant Agency at Brno University of Technology,This paper was supported by grant FP-S-15-2825 ''Research of Economic Factors and their Impact on the Competitiveness of the Company from the Internal Grant Agency at Brno University of Technology.,,26,1,1,0,6,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,32,39,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200003,0

Methodology World Bank database, materials of Ministry of Resettlement and Refugees of Georgia, IOM's assessment mission report Review in Georgia and data of Geostat were used in the study. Methods of statistical observation, grouping and analysis were used to determine the migrants' distribution from Georgia according to age and sex. Scientific aim Scientific aim of the paper is to throw light upon the migration process of women from Georgia in political, economic and social respects and identify the trends and advantages and disadvantages of this process. Findings Traditionally, mostly men made up the labor or study migration currents from Georgia. Since the 1990s, the picture has changed. As the statistics of 2014 suggest, 65 females area encountered for every 100 migrants. This ratio changes according to women's age groups. Conclusions Georgia, in respect of migration, is a country of origin, destination and transit. In economic respect, women's migration from Georgia is justified, as money sent by them is the means of living for their families and plays a role in overcoming property. For women migration meant not only hardships, but fostered a hope to see something new and adventures. Many women discovered themselves there. Recently, many young girls have left Georgia. Studies demonstrate that migration-prone attitude is quite strong among young people. Such a situation needs much consideration and contemplation by every citizen, whole society and government of the country, as Georgia is going to face severe demographic, social-economic, national security and other problems.","[Kurashvili, Guguli; Kinkladze, Rusudan] Georgian Tech Univ, 77 Kostava Str, GE-0175 Tbilisi, Georgia",Georgian Technical University,"Kurashvili, G (通讯作者)，Georgian Tech Univ, 77 Kostava Str, GE-0175 Tbilisi, Georgia.",guliko-kurashvili@mail.ru; rusudan1103@yahoo.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,308,313,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200038,0

Despite this, export is influenced by economic policy, macroeconomic, political and other factors which come from internal and external sources. For instance, Russian government announced an embargo on dairy products on 6 August 2014 and it had huge impact for Lithuanian exporters. As a result of these restrictions, the main aim of this paper is to analyze Lithuanian dairy industry export distribution by geographical areas and to calculate export concentration degrees according to Herfindahl - Hirschman indexes before and after limitations. Methodology/methods For the analysis we use data from the Lithuanian Department of Statistics (Statistics Lithuania) bases for the 2008-2015 years. We calculated export concentration degrees according to Herfindahl -Hirschman indexes. Scientific aim The main aim of this paper is to analyze Lithuanian dairy industry export distribution by geographical areas and to calculate export concentration degrees according to Herfindahl -Hirschman indexes before and after limitations. Findings The analysis showed that during 2008-2013 periods Lithuanian dairy industry's export was not diversified enough and concentration was considered as moderate or high. Lithuanian dairy industry export analysis in global markets revealed that approximately 56 percent of total export went to Russia and the countries economically related to it such as Latvia or Poland, also Sweden. This poses a threat to the development of export because changeable product demand is observed in Russia and various political decisions have a significant impact on export's performance. During 2015 year, situation slightly changed and dependence on interrelated markets declined. Also trade relations with United States of America, Kazakhstan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and Israel were strengthened. Thus, it can be posit that dairy industry could withstand external effects and to contribute to economic development. Conclusions The overall analysis of structural export changes for Lithuanian dairy industry revealed that market is moderately concentrated. However, strong export concentration to Russia decreased, orientation to other global markets such as Asia, North and South America was strengthened. Thus, it can be posit that demand fluctuations in any country are not so hazardous. In order to maintain and fortify this position it is necessary to diversify export by reconsidering strategies and policies.","[Laskiene, Daiva; Slatkeviciute, Deimante] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Laskiene, D (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",daiva.laskiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,6,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,356,363,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200044,0

Competition between modes of land transport derived from the principles of the Law on freedom of economic activity and the progressive liberalization of access to the transport market of the European Union countries. This gives rise to conflicts of service operators in the region.

The passenger has a wider choice in terms of routings and departure airports than twenty-five years ago and pays a lower price. In this paper we investigate in which parts of Europe airline and airport competition are most intense and how the competitive landscape has changed since the liberalisation of the intra-European market. Competition levels are modelled for all air transport markets available to consumers in each western-European municipality using a Multinomial Logit (MNL) model. This allows us to determine how competitive the air transport product available to consumers in each of those municipalities truly is and how competition levels have changed. As opposed to most other competition studies we take all viable direct and indirect flight alternatives into account, as well as competing alternatives from nearby (adjacent) airports. This makes it the most extensive analysis of competition in the European aviation industry performed to date. As expected the results show that airline competition, allowing for grouping of the airlines belonging to the same alliance together, has in general increased since the liberalisation of the intra-European market. This can mainly be ascribed to the rise of the low cost business model. The spatial analysis however shows an uneven outcome. Changes in airline competition are most pronounced in areas that were previously not well served, such as the more remote regions in the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy. In Germany airline competition is lagging behind due to the strong dominance of the STAR alliance. In large parts of Scandinavia, but also in parts of France and Spain, airline competition is considerably less. These areas are often served only by a handful of airports and/or airlines, limiting airline choice and therefore competition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The primary objective of the paper is to quantify the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced in beef cattle breeding (dairy and meat breeds), pig breeding and poultry breeding. A secondary objective of this paper is to compare greenhouse gas emission production volumes across individual sectors of livestock production and to evaluate the development of the emission volumes produced, including determination of the contribution of livestock production to the total amount of emissions produced in Czech agriculture. The data set is derived from publicly accessible databases provided by the Czech Statistical Office and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic. The methodology will be based on the conceptual model known as MITERRA-Europe, which is partly based on two models, namely the CAPRI (Common Agricultural Policy Regionalised Impact) model and the GAINS (Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies) model. Based on the above mentioned models, indicators of feed conversion are designed and the development trends of utility directions of concerned sectors are ascertained. Finally, the area load, as a measure of the degree of concentration, is determined, in order to take into consideration the different types of breeding, especially intensive and extensive methods. Based on the available database, the greenhouse gas emissions are quantified, taking into account specifications of individual breeds in the Czech Republic. The results allow comparison of greenhouse gas emission production volumes among different breeds in the main sectors of livestock production. At the same time, quantification of the share of greenhouse gas emissions of livestock production in the overall greenhouse gas emission volumes of the Czech agricultural sector is carried out. The results show certain degree of responsibility and resulting moral aspects in implementation of the environmental policy, as a necessary part of the EU Common Agricultural Policy adjustment, which is a future challenge of intelligent and sustainable food production. The results of the presented paper show the effects of the CAP implementation at the level of livestock production in the Czech Republic and associated production of negative public goods. The subsequent assessment is a precursor for modification of the future agricultural policy in the form of an environmentally responsible agricultural policy.","[Maly, Michal; Halova, Pavlina; Havlikova, Michaela; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova; Cechura, Lukas] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Managament, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Maly, M (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Managament, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",maly@pef.czu.cz,"Malý, Michal/H-6171-2018; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/AAO-8608-2021; Havlikova, Michaela/H-5272-2018; Halova, Pavlina/H-6831-2018; Cechura, Lukas/H-6694-2018","Malý, Michal/0000-0001-7382-1895; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/0000-0001-5834-3338; Havlikova, Michaela/0000-0002-2694-3862; Halova, Pavlina/0000-0003-2236-3227; Cechura, Lukas/0000-0003-2727-1874",,,,,9,0,0,0,10,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-4781,,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,192,199,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000024,0

In the context of high market volatility, high speculation and inappropriate regulation (e.g., as such was the case in the years prior to the 2008 subprime crisis), market agents adopt either a predator or prey position. By way of a neurobiological study, it is shown that market-agent-turned preys benefit from moderate stress when it enhances their level of vigilance; however, past a certain stress threshold, their efforts at wealth maximization are considerably reduced. This may explain some of the cognitive causes of failures found by various authors in their description of the market bubble phenomenon. The paper emphasizes the importance of setting up proper regulations aimed at preventing the emergence of predatory behaviors (such as those that prevailed with the establishment of predatory mortgages during the year 2000 in the United States) and better educating average investors.","[Mesly, Olivier] Mt Allison Univ, Sackville, NB, Canada; [Bouchard, Stephane] Univ Quebec, Ctr Integre St & Serv Sociaux Outaouais, Outaouais, PQ, Canada",Mount Allison University; University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais,"Mesly, O (通讯作者)，Mt Allison Univ, Dept Commerce, 62 York St, Sackville, NB E4L 1E2, Canada.",olivier.mesly@usherbrooke.ca,,"Bouchard, Stephane/0000-0002-5995-340X",,,,,70,0,0,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

As the result exchange rates determine macroeconomic development of the countries during the crisis period the way that seems to differ in comparison with the pre-crisis period. Considering the wide variety of effects that exchange rates transmit to the domestic economy from abroad in the paper we focus on the external price impulses and their impact on the domestic price indexes in the new EU member states.

This paper seeks to understand why TM is not so well-known and is less systematically implemented in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methodology/methods Individual interviews were conducted with 84 people to explore TM in public and private sector organisations in the UAE. 15-16 interviews were held in each of four case study organizations (total 63 interviews) and 21 interviews with a range of TM stakeholders, such as government officials and known TM opinion leaders. 30 of the transcripts were selected for open and selective coding. All of the 21 TM stakeholders were analyzed along with a further 9 transcripts selected from the four case studies. The transcripts were open coded by the first author using NVIVO 10. This paper reports an interpretation of the 455 open codes and research memos developed at what is an advanced stage of the open and selective coding phases. Scientific aim TM theories are predominantly concerned with how employees' talents can be deployed to the competitive advantage of the employing organization with positive outcomes for employees. This paper is concerned with broadening the debates on to other stakeholders in TM processes, especially, countries, governments, education, and families. Findings TM as it is conceptualized and practiced in the UAE is inextricably linked to issues of employment localization, often known in the UAE as nationalization or Emiratization. TM has been organized and implemented differently for two labour markets across all sectors of employment; the country's nationals and the expatriate workforce. Conclusions The extent that TM develops in the UAE similar to Western countries depends on how much the implementation of policies for Emiratization and expatriate workforce development are found to be compatible.","[Pinnington, Ashly; Alshamsi, Abdullah] British Univ Dubai, POB 345015, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Ozbilgin, Mustafa] Brunel Univ London, Brunel Business Sch, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Tatli, Ahu] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England; [Vassilopoulou, Joana] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England",Brunel University; University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Kent,"Pinnington, A (通讯作者)，British Univ Dubai, POB 345015, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",ashly.pinnington@buid.ac.ae,"Tatli, Ahu/B-7197-2008; Ozbilgin, Mustafa F/A-1343-2008; PINNINGTON, ASHLY/C-6454-2011","Ozbilgin, Mustafa F/0000-0002-8672-9534; PINNINGTON, ASHLY/0000-0002-4814-6960",UAE Federal Demographic Council,UAE Federal Demographic Council,"The authors are grateful for funding (February 2012 - June 2013) by the UAE Federal Demographic Council, project titled, The Movers and Shakers in Talent Management in the UAE and Challenges for the 21st Century.",,23,0,0,0,5,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,102,110,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200012,0

While some scholars argue that private enforcement mechanisms work sufficiently well in supporting cooperation, others cite the downfalls of private mechanisms so as to legitimize government enforcement. This paper focuses on the interplay between government and private enforcement mechanisms. Using an experimental approach, we demonstrate two results. First, we show that government enforcement, in the form of a centralized monetary punishment in our experiment, can be useful if aligned with and implemented after a private form of enforcement, namely peer disapproval. However, our second result suggests that the removal of government enforcement leads to a substantial decrease in overall cooperation levels-cooperation levels are higher under private enforcement when subjects had never experienced government enforcement compared to when they had been exposed to government enforcement. Specifically, the removal of government enforcement undermines the power of the remaining private enforcement mechanism to affect the behavior of free-riders.","[Romaniuc, Rustam] Lille Catholic Univ, Lab Expt Anthropol, Maison Chercheurs,60bis Rue Port, F-59016 Lille, France; [Romaniuc, Rustam; Farrow, Katherine; Marciano, Alain] Univ Montpellier, UMR 1135, LAMETA, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Romaniuc, Rustam] Univ Turin, IEL, I-10123 Turin, Italy; [Ibanez, Lisette] INRA, UMR 1135, LAMETA, F-34000 Montpellier, France",Universite de Montpellier; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Turin; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier,"Romaniuc, R (通讯作者)，Lille Catholic Univ, Lab Expt Anthropol, Maison Chercheurs,60bis Rue Port, F-59016 Lille, France.;Romaniuc, R (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier, UMR 1135, LAMETA, F-34000 Montpellier, France.;Romaniuc, R (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, IEL, I-10123 Turin, Italy.",rustam.romaniuc@gmail.com; kate.farrow@supagro.inra.fr; lisette.ibanez@supagro.inra.fr; alain.marciano@umontpellier.fr,,"Hassett, Katherine/0000-0002-4052-2247",French Agency for the Energy and Environmental Management (ADEME),French Agency for the Energy and Environmental Management (ADEME),"We thank Christoph Engel, Yuval Feldman, Remi Gaultier, Sven Hoeppner, David Masclet, David Rand and Jeroen van de Ven for their helpful comments at various stages of this work.

The estimates of the costs depend to a large extent on how long it will take the US to return to a more normal path of growth in economic activity. If growth returns to pre-crisis trends in 2015, the cost of the crisis in terms of lost output could be as little as $6 trillion, about 40% of annual US output. If the return to pre-crisis trends takes considerably longer, the cost of lost output could total $30 trillion, almost two years of human effort down the drain. Including estimates of the reduced opportunities and economic trauma faced by the generation of those impacted by the crisis, as well as the costs of monetary and fiscal policy extremes that were used to address the crisis, adds significantly to the burdens stemming from the crisis. Given the enormity of these costs, it is critically important that the policy errors that led to the Financial Crisis not be repeated.","[Rosenblum, H.] So Methodist Univ, Cox Sch Business, Financial Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA; [Rosenblum, H.] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Dallas, TX USA; [Rosenblum, H.] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Res, Dallas, TX USA; [Rosenblum, H.] Dallas Feds Globalizat & Monetary Policy Inst, Dallas, TX USA",Southern Methodist University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas,"Rosenblum, H (通讯作者)，So Methodist Univ, Cox Sch Business, Financial Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"PO BOX 128 FARRER RD, SINGAPORE 9128, SINGAPORE",2251-3442,,978-981-4651-25-7; 978-981-4651-24-0,WS-NOW PUBL SER BUS,,,2016,9.0,,,,,,33,46,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0DY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365888000002,0

Consistent with previous studies, we find that decentralization has been frustrated by overconcentration of power at the provincial level and large vertical fiscal imbalances, though we characterize these as functional elements in a system of redistributive policy-making that benefits a wide array of provincial and municipal actors. We seek to add a new dimension to the literature by arguing that micro-level incentives (conditions and circumstances particular to specific places) are more important determinants of municipal behavior than macro-level structures (those policy and institutional changes intended to make officials more responsive to local conditions federalism, local elections, intergovernmental transfers, and own-source revenues). We conclude that the theory of decentralization relies on a flawed conception of the causal mechanisms that are hypothesized to create responsiveness in local officials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using aggregate time series data to simulate the model, the study finds that from an individual policy perspective, expanding the national herd would produce the largest benefits for producers and consumers; producers would gain over 550 million shillings annually and consumers would gain about 35 shillings per capita. Comparing the other two interventions, consumers would benefit more from a better regulatory environment than from a reduction in cow prices, while producers would benefit more from a reduction in cow prices than from better regulations. If all policies are implemented simultaneously, even greater benefits would be realised; consumer surplus would increase by 85 shillings annually and producer surplus would increase by over one billion shillings in real terms. The results suggest that policy interventions outlined in the TLMI that address supply constraints are critical to developing the country's dairy industry.","[Twine, Edgar Edwin] Int Livestock Res Inst, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya",CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI),"Twine, EE (通讯作者)，Int Livestock Res Inst, POB 30709, Nairobi 00100, Kenya.",E.Twine@cgiar.org,,,,,,,32,4,5,0,8,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2016,55.0,1-2,,,,,81,102,,10.1080/03031853.2016.1159588,0.0,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,DN4OB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000377046000004,0

Using a gravity model of trade, the paper finds that the distance elasticity of trade significantly increases with the oil price. This suggests that high oil prices make trade less global, as they affect longer shipping routes more. The paper estimates that an increase in the oil price from $100 to $200 (in 2014 US$) would have similar trade effects as an import tariff around 17 percent for two countries 10,000 km away. This is akin to a 55 percent increase in shipping distance.

This paper presents an investigation of the economic activities of PWDs in the Philippines, where, among developing countries, disability-related legislation is relatively progressive. In 2008, a field survey was conducted in cooperation with Disability People's Organizations using a tailor-made questionnaire in Metro Manila. The explanatory variables of income of PWDs were examined using Mincer regression. The conclusions are as follows. (1) There is remarkable income disparity among PWDs, differing with education and sex. (2) After controlling for PWDs' characteristics, it was found that female PWDs are likely to earn less than male PWDs. Such a significant income gap between men and women among PWDs is remarkable in the Philippines, where gender difference in income is generally small. This finding suggests that female PWDs are doubly disadvantaged in earning income.","[Albert, Jose Ramon; Reyes, Celia; Tabuga, Aubrey D.] Philippine Inst Dev Studies, Manila, Philippines; [Mori, Soya; Yamagata, Tatsufumi] JETRO, Inst Econ Dev, Chiba, Chiba, Japan",,"Yamagata, T (通讯作者)，Japan External Trade Org, Inst Econ Dev, Mihama Ku, 3-2-2 Wakaba, Chiba, Chiba 2618545, Japan.",tatsufumi_yamagata@ide.go.jp,,"Yamagata, Tatsufumi/0000-0001-7510-4160",,,,,24,0,0,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

Framing effects in choice tasks seem to be less significant than corresponding framing effects in matching tasks and this result seems to be in line with the conclusions of previous studies. More interestingly, we also find that time framing effects are stronger for questions involving negative outcomes. We explain this experimental result by distinguishing between out-of-pocket costs incurred by delaying fines and opportunity costs from speeding up rewards with the latter costs being less disturbing than the former. In order to validate our theory, we also investigate borrowing and lending decisions of private households via a panel analysis across 54 countries empirically and show that household behavior is in line with our theory.

This paper fills the void by studying long-term performance following R&D reductions. We find that, contrary to conventional wisdom, large-R&D cuts are associated with positive future stock returns. This return drift cannot be explained by asset pricing factors, including R&D intensities and R&D increases. We explore two potential economic motives behind R&D reductions: R&D spillover and firm life cycle. We show that operating performance deteriorates immediately before R&D reductions but exhibits no abnormal pattern afterward. While firm growth falls substantially and variability in profitability reduces, firms with low or declining investment opportunities and mature firms outperform. These findings are inconsistent with the spillover hypothesis, but support the life cycle story that firms attempt to resolve overinvestment in R&D that arises over the course of firm life cycle.

The analysis proceeds in two steps. First, using comprehensive establishment-level datasets for the period 1991-2009, it provides a detailed portrait of the adjustment behaviour of establishments at the micro level. Second, it compares aggregate labour market dynamics during the global financial crisis with that observed during the 1997 crisis and decomposes the observed differences into components that can be attributed to changes in the micro-adjustment behaviour of Japanese establishments, changes in the incidence of non-standard work and changes in the distribution of shocks across establishments. It finds that the incidence of non-standard work has increased considerably, worker turnover is much higher among non-standard than standard workers and adjustments in working-time are less important for non-standard workers. Counterfactual simulations suggest that the employment response during the global crisis would have been smaller if the incidence of non-standard work remained at the level observed during the 1997 crisis. The relatively small employment response observed during the global financial crisis is therefore driven by factors other than the increase in the incidence of non-standard work.

The estimator is a convex combination of two realized kernels with different bandwidths. It converges to the true quadratic variation at the best parametric rate in the presence of a serially dependent noise. Its asymptotic distribution is correctly centered, thus facilitating the feasible inference of an estimate using the asymptotic approximation. By appropriately designing the weight function, the proposed estimator can achieve the parametric efficiency bound of the asymptotic variance. I also propose a finite sample correction to ensure that the transformed version is nonnegative. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator has good finite sample properties compared with several noise-robust estimators including the original realized kernel estimator.","[Ikeda, Shin S.] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Tokyo 1068677, Japan",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Ikeda, SS (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Dept Policy Anal, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan.",s-ikeda@grips.ac.jp,,,,,,,37,9,10,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

Our data set is a multilevel cross-section, which essentially allows controlling for all bank and firm characteristics through respective fixed effects, thus avoiding concerns regarding omitted variables. We find that banks with higher credit risk are associated with more risky firms, with lower profitability and market value. In turn, we find that banks with higher risk-weighted capital ratios lend to riskier firms with less market value. Our results are indicative of a strong adverse selection mechanism and highlight the need to monitor the risky banks more closely, especially as we consider large and influential syndicated loan deals.

Time variation is evident in both the coefficients and the variance covariance matrix. The standard deviations of the demand side structural shocks reached forty year peaks during the global financial crisis and have remained high since. In the real stock return equation the coefficient of global real economic activity has declined since the late 1990s and that of oil-market specific demand oil shock has been lower since the early 1990s than before. The structural oil shocks account for 25.7% of the long-run variation in real stock returns overall, with substantial change in levels and sources of contribution over time. The contribution of shocks to global real economic activity to real stock return variation rose sharply to 22% in 2009 (and remains 17% over 2009-2012). The contribution of oil-market specific demand price shocks rose unevenly from 5% in the mid-1970s to about 15% in 2007, with a subsequent decline. The contribution of oil supply shocks has trended downward from 17% to 5% over 1973-2012. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Our evidence shows that market preferences lean towards pessimism for some countries, in particular Greece. Those preferences do not remain stable over time as they shift further towards pessimism post the Greek bail out in spring 2010. As part of sensitivity analysis we apply a multivariate loss function to account for contagion effects in forming market preferences among different sovereign bonds.

The difference in the cumulative probability distributions of the Net Present Value (NPV) of the margin after interest and tax in the event of hail and in the event of no hail will provide a graphic indication of the financial impact of hail. To determine if the decision maker is willing to pay in order to remove the impact of hail on the enterprise, the utility weighted risk premium (UWRP) must be calculated with the use of stochastic efficiency with respect to a function (SERF) analysis. The calculated maximum benefit (or UWRP) that the decision maker will receive through the elimination of hail will set the upper limit for the cost of crop hail insurance. The results indicate that hail does have a negative impact on the financial position of the farms in North West and Mpumalanga. The effect of hail risk in Mpumalanga is, however, more severe. The calculated maximum benefit (UWRP) from the elimination of hail damage in two regions is R83.50/hectare in North West and R708.70/hectare in Mpumalanga. The conclusion can thus be made that decision makers in both regions will be willing to pay for crop hail insurance, but much more so in Mpumalanga than in North West.","[Mare, Frikkie; Grove, Bennie; Willemse, Johan] Univ Free State, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Maré, F (通讯作者)，Univ Free State, Dept Agr Econ, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa.",MareFA@ufs.ac.za; GroveB@ufs.ac.za; WillemseBJ@ufs.ac.za,"Maré, Frikkie A/H-5270-2018; Grove, Bennie/E-5395-2015","Maré, Frikkie A/0000-0001-9836-060X; Grove, Bennie/0000-0002-5325-2637",,,,,12,1,1,0,4,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,DEC,2015,54.0,4,,,,,28,44,,10.1080/03031853.2015.1116397,0.0,,,17,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,DG8ZH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372371600002,0

By comparison, the average labor share of OECD members is two times higher than that of Turkey. Is this because labor productivity is low, or is it because imperfect competition, which amplifies profits, is overwhelmingly high in Turkey? We estimate preferences, technology parameters, and price markup in a dynamic general equilibrium model to answer this question using GMM. To our surprise, the results suggest that the crucial factor suppressing the share of labor in Turkey is high price markup, and the role of low productivity of labor is negligible. The results are robust to the use of different instrumental variables.","[Unveren, Burak; Sunal, Seckin] Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Yildiz Technical University,"Ünveren, B (通讯作者)，Yildiz Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.",bunveren@yildiz.edu.tr,"Ünveren, Burak/HJZ-0688-2023","Unveren, Burak/0000-0002-4287-6663",Yildiz Technical University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Department [2012-02-01-KAP01],Yildiz Technical University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Department(Yildiz Technical University),This research has been supported by Yildiz Technical University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Department; the project number: 2012-02-01-KAP01.,,23,1,1,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

We identify a structural break occurred on the carbon spot price series in October 2008, which is mainly resulting from the financial and economic crisis. We find that the price of carbon does not matter for electricity prices in either countries before October 2008. Electricity producers in both countries were facing uncertainties regarding the future of the EU ETS and thus adopted a wait and see attitude until the end of 2008. The communication of national allocation plans (NAPs) in late October 2008, and the definitive adoption of the European Union climate and energy package by the European Parliament in December 2008 puts an end to these uncertainties. We find also that after October 2008, electricity producers in both countries were constrained to include the carbon price in their cost functions. During that period, French electricity producers were more constrained than their German counterparts, the elasticity of the electricity price relative to the price of carbon being higher in France than in Germany. By comparing the results with those in Kirat and Ahamada [2011] concerning the first phase of the EU ETS we conclude that the changes in the EU ETS introduced in phase II (banking and lower allowances in NAPs) have rendered the carbon market more efficient. Finally, we find a higher conditional correlation between wholesale electricity prices in France and Germany during the second phase of the EU ETS reflecting more integrated French and German electricity markets.","[Ahamada, Ibrahim] Univ Paris 01, Int Monetary Fund, Paris Sch Econ, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France; [Ahamada, Ibrahim] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France; [Kirat, Djamel] Univ Orleans, CNRS, UMR 7322, LEO, F-45067 Orleans, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics; Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Orleans,"Kirat, D (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, CNRS, UMR 7322, LEO, F-45067 Orleans, France.",IAhamada@imf.org; djamel.kirat@univ-orleans.fr,,,Labex VOLTAIRE [ANR-10-LABX-100-01],Labex VOLTAIRE,"We would like to thank Anna Creti, Valerie Mignon, Katrin Millock, Stef Proost, Natacha Raffin, Katheline Schubert, and two anonymous referees of this paper for their helpful discussions and comments.

Modelling financial crises within an asymmetric information environment is argued to be a difficult task since the measurement of adverse selection and/or moral hazard during a financial/debt crisis is difficult. The present paper focuses on the study of moral hazard within a macroeconomic framework in the context of international lending during a financial/debt crisis. Specifically, we analyse the creditor moral hazard effect due to the international financial support to Greece during the current sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone. We develop a novel testing procedure to evaluate the hypothesis of creditor moral hazard in a monetary union using data for Ireland and Portugal, two countries which received financial aid packages over the period 2009-2013 with Greece taken as the control country. The main results of our study shed light on the creditor moral hazard issue raised by the provision of multi-source international lending schemes which have been implemented to counteract the European debt crisis.

Using a setting of voluntary non-generally accepted accounting principles earnings per share (GAAP EPS) reporting, this study attempts to examine whether the first non-GAAP EPS reporting is less dominated by opportunistic incentives. Consistent with the predictions of this research, it reveals that the duration to the first adjusted EPS disclosure is not more sensitive to negative transitory items, and moreover investors' perception on the first non-GAAP EPS is more positive compared to subsequent ones. The less opportunistic behaviour on the first disclosure can be well explained by the management's awareness of intensified monitoring by outside stakeholders.","Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Business, Accounting Sect, Seoul, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Choi, YS (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Business, Accounting Sect, Seoul, South Korea.",sericys@skku.edu,,,"Faculty Research Fund, Sungkyunkwan University","Faculty Research Fund, Sungkyunkwan University","I am grateful for all of the helpful comments from the participants at the 2011 Annual Congress of the European Accounting Association in Rome, and at the 2013 KAIST-Korea University Joint Accounting Research Workshop.

For each large donor, the extent of cross-sector reallocation is identified that is occurring in the aftermath of large disasters whereby humanitarian aid increases but other types of aid may decrease. The evidence in this paper suggests that the expectation of large surges in post-disaster aid flows is not warranted given the past diversity of experience of global foreign post-disaster aid by donor and by event. No evidence is found, however, that donors reallocate aid between recipient countries (cross-recipient reallocation). These observations suggest that countries which are predicted to face increasing losses from natural disasters in the coming decades (and almost all are) should be devoting significant resources to prevention, insurance and mitigation, rather than expecting significant post-disaster aid inflows.","[Becerra, Oscar] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Cavallo, Eduardo] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Noy, Ilan] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Econ & Finance, Wellington, New Zealand",University of British Columbia; Inter-American Development Bank; Victoria University Wellington,"Becerra, O (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",orbecerra@gmail.com; cavalloe@iadb.org; ilan.noy@vuw.ac.nz,,"Becerra, Oscar/0000-0002-0365-9869; Noy, Ilan/0000-0003-3214-6568",,,,,21,15,15,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

An analysis of effects and responses is offered using a natural, financial, human and social capitals framework. Without consideration of how to manage the symptoms of the resource curse, oil and gas activity is likely to further disadvantage Indigenous populations already living on the margins of Canadian society.

We use a best-worst scaling experiment to evaluate the determinants of these decisions and gauge the influence of buyer attributes. Our latent-class cluster analysis reveals that producers have heterogeneous preferences for buyer attributes, which address classic smallholder constraints such as access to inputs, credit, and information. This heterogeneity can be somewhat explained by household characteristics and assets. The broad mass of our sample sought buyers whose attributes imply lower market risk for farmers.

In this paper we propose competition within the military as one of the mechanisms that can deter predation and consequently create commitment In our model, even if agents within the military could expropriate all output costlessly, it is attractive to protect producers from predating military units. This marginal defensive advantage and consequently defence is an effective way to potentially eliminate is because there is a other military units, reducing competition and leading to higher future payoffs. Our model predicts that greater internal competition within the military lowers the risk of expropriation and that this effect is strongest for countries with low institutional and economic development Testing this prediction empirically, we find a robust negative relationship between competition within the military and expropriation risk. In line with our model this effect is strongest for countries at lower stages of institutional and economic development, and it weakens as the latter improve. These results indicate that there may be a short-run component to property rights institutions that varies with the degree of competition among agents who control the means of coercion.

Characteristics of firms near the index cutoffs are similar, except that firms in the top of the Russell 2000 have discontinuously higher proportional institutional ownership than firms in the bottom of the Russell 1000 primarily due to indexing and benchmarking strategies. We find that higher institutional ownership is associated with greater management disclosure, analyst following, and liquidity, resulting in lower information asymmetry. Overall, indexing institutions' predilection for lower information asymmetries facilitates information production, which enhances monitoring and decreases trading costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using the fourth wave of the European Social Survey, we confirm a strong positive association between interpersonal trust and welfare state support (controlling for institutional trust). we also show that: i) this link is driven at least in part by the mechanism discussed above; ii) causality runs from interpersonal trust to welfare state support (using a sub-sample of second generation immigrants); and iii) the effect of interpersonal trust appears conditional on the perceived quality of a country's institutions.

Similar to earlier studies in the literature, we use the Type II To bit model to address the sample selection problem and we address the endogeneity problem in the tax variables, but we improve the identification of the tax elasticity by using an exclusion restriction: the presence of carryover loss. The preferred persistent elasticity estimate is -0.72 and is statistically significant and robust to a number of sensitivity tests. We also compare the results of our model to results from the original model applied to contemporary data, and estimate our model on sub-periods.

This research argues that takeover pressures before a repurchase announcement can be a credible signal of undervaluation. The empirical results indicate that repurchasing firms with a higher probability of takeover experience greater announcement effects, improvements in operating performance and long-run abnormal return, positive forecast revisions by financial analysts, and enhanced agreement between management and shareholders. These findings suggest that takeover probability and open-market share repurchases appear to constitute a double-signal for conveying stock undervaluation to the market. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The only significant source of local revenue is a tax on parcels of land.

It is also negatively related to the revenue a district receives under the state's school finance system.

In this article, we determine whether companies differ in their demand for property and terrorism insurance. Using a unique data set of insurance policies purchased by large U.S. firms, combined with financial information of the corporate clients and of the insurance provider, we apply a two-stage least squares approach to obtain consistent estimates of premium elasticity of corporate demand for property and terrorism coverage. Our findings suggest that both are rather price inelastic and that corporate demand for terrorism insurance is significantly more price inelastic than demand for property insurance. We further find a negative relation between the solvency ratios of both property and terrorism risk coverage, with a stronger effect on the latter, indicating that companies use their ability to self-insure as a substitute for market insurance.

Because bankers cannot commit to their promises and the composition of their assets is not publicly observable, a positive franchise value is required to induce the full convertibility of bank liabilities. Under perfect competition, a positive franchise value can be obtained only if the return on bank liabilities is sufficiently low, which imposes a cost on those who hold these liabilities for transaction purposes. If the banking system is monopolistic, then an efficient allocation is incentive feasible. In this case, the members of the banking system obtain a higher return on assets, making it feasible to pay a sufficiently high return on bank liabilities. Finally, we argue that the regulation of the banking system is required to obtain efficiency.","[Monnet, Cyril] Univ Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Monnet, Cyril] Study Ctr Gerzensee, Gerzensee, Switzerland; [Sanches, Daniel R.] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA",University of Bern; Study Center Gerzensee; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia,"Monnet, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",cyril.monnet@gmail.com; daniel.sanches@phil.frb.org,,"Monnet, Cyril/0000-0001-6376-4129",,,,,39,10,10,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Pollution is generated in the aid recipient as a by-product in the production of a 'dirty' good, which it consumes, as well as exports to the donor country. In contrast to the literature which typically treats aid as a monetary transfer, we assume that foreign aid consists of a transfer of environmental technology that lowers the cost of public clean-up. We also consider a border tax adjustment (BTA) as a secondary policy instrument used in order to internalize the residual transboundary externality. We study the environmental and welfare outcomes of the technology transfer and the BTA as well as the interaction between the two policy instruments. We derive conditions under which the additional presence of a BTA may lead to a lower transfer and less public pollution abatement in the recipient, with counter-productive consequences for both the environment and welfare. Contrary to intuition, we find that the green technology transfer and the border tax adjustment are not always complements.","[Nimubona, Alain-Desire; Rus, Horatiu A.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Rus, HA (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, 200 Univ Dr, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",animubon@uwaterloo.ca; hrus@uwaterloo.ca,,"Rus, Horatiu Alin/0000-0001-6101-6741",,,,,32,4,4,2,47,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

More precisely, we consider identical farmers who can use two water resources (groundwater and/or rainwater) and we study the symmetric and asymmetric feedback stationary Nash equilibria of the dynamic game. We show that a subsidy on the use of rainwater may increase the level of the aquifer at the symmetric equilibrium, whereas it decreases the level of the aquifer at the asymmetric equilibrium.

This paper presents a tractable business cycle model in which a decline in house prices reduces geographical mobility, creating distortions in the labor market. This happens because homeowners face declines in their home equity levels, which makes it more difficult to provide the downpayment required for a new mortgage loan. Therefore, unemployed homeowners more often turn down job offers that would require them to move. The model can account for joint cyclical patterns in housing and labor market aggregates, and predicts a breakdown of the Beveridge curve in 2009. Counterfactual experiments are used to quantify the macroeconomic importance of the mobility channel during the Great Recession. (C) 2015 The Author.

When road toll revenue is used to finance labor tax cuts, 35% of the optimal road tax in our numerical model does not reflect marginal external congestion costs, but rather functions as a Ramsey-Mirrlees tax, i.e. an efficiency enhancing mechanism allowing for an indirect spatial differentiation of the labor tax. This adds a quite different motivation to road pricing, since welfare gains can be produced even in absence of congestion. We find that the optimal road tax is non-monotonic across space, reflecting the different impacts of labor supply elasticity and marginal utility of income, which both vary over space. The relative efficiencies of some archetype second-best pricing schemes (cordon toll, flat kilometer tax) are high (84% and 70% respectively). When road toll revenue is recycled lump-sum, the optimal toll lies below its Pigouvian level. Extensions in a bimodal framework show that the optimality of using road toll revenue to subsidize public transport depends on the initial inefficiency in public transport pricing.

However, using quantile regression, we find a positive relation between board independence and financial sophistication for low levels of tax avoidance, but a negative relation for high levels of tax avoidance.

Novy-Marx (2013) concludes that it outperforms other measures of profitability such as bottom line net income, cash flows, and dividends. One potential explanation for the measure's predictive ability is that its numerator (gross profit) is a cleaner measure of economic profitability. An alternative explanation lies in the measure's deflator. We find that net income equals gross profit in predictive power when they have consistent deflators. Deflating profit by the book value of total assets results in a variable that is the product of profitability and the ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of total assets, which is priced. We then construct an alternative measure of profitability, operating profitability, which better matches current expenses with current revenue. This measure exhibits a far stronger link with expected returns than either net income or gross profit. It predicts returns as far as ten years ahead, seemingly inconsistent with irrational pricing explanations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover the link between contract farming and equity is ambiguous as the association between contract farming and farmer endowments is mixed. This case study of smallholders in the tobacco industry addresses these issues, and seems to be the first such econometric application in the Philippines. Based on a treatment effects regression, contract farming increases profitability, with participation biased toward smaller farm sizes, supporting the positive role of contract farming toward inclusive growth in rural areas.

Many nations maintain large registries of potential donors who have offered to donate stem cells if they are the best available match for a patient needing a transplant. An alternative source of stem cells, umbilical cord blood, is stored in banks. Everyone faces a small probability of needing a transplant which will increase their likelihood of survival. The registries and cord blood banks are thus an interesting example of a pure public good with widely dispersed benefits. This paper explores the gains in survival probability that arise from increased registry and bank sizes and uses value of statistical life methods to estimate benefits and compare them to costs. Our results suggest that for the United States and for the world as a whole, the sum of marginal benefits of an increase in either the adult registry or the cord blood bank exceeds marginal costs. However, marginal benefit-cost ratios for the adult registry are much greater than those for the cord blood banks, which suggests that to the extent that these two sources of life saving compete for public funds it may be preferable to prioritize expansion of the adult registry over cord blood banks.","[Sheehan-Connor, Damien] Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA; [Bergstrom, Theodore C.; Garratt, Rodney J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Garratt, Rodney J.] Fed Reserve Bank New York, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Wesleyan University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Sheehan-Connor, D (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",dsheehanconn@wesleyan.edu; tedb@econ.ucsb.edu; rodgarratt@gmail.com,"Bergstrom, Ted/AAG-3109-2019",,"NSF [SES-0851357, CNS-0619508]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors acknowledge support under NSF grant SES-0851357.

By combining the characteristics of both multiple assets and forward-start feature, this new type of derivative has many potential applications, for instance, to incorporate the reset provision in rainbow options for investors or hedgers or design more effective executive compensation plans. The main contribution of this paper is a novel martingale pricing technique for options whose payoffs are associated with multiple assets and time points. Equipped with this technique, the analytic pricing formula and the formulae of the delta and gamma of the FSRO are first derived. We conduct numerical experiments to verify these formulae and examine the characteristics of the FSRO's price and Greek letters. To demonstrate the importance and general applicability of the proposed technique, we also apply it to deriving the pricing formula for the discrete-sampling lookback rainbow options.","[Chen, Chun-Ying; Wang, Hsiao-Chuan] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Wang, Jr-Yan] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei 106, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University,"Wang, JY (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Int Business, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",cychen.phd@gmail.com; d00723003@ntu.edu.tw; jryanwang@ntu.edu.tw,"Chen, Chunying/AAA-2891-2021","Chen, Chunying/0000-0002-6027-0315",Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan,"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The authors thank the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan for the financial support.,,12,4,4,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

The Dynamics of Capitalist Accumulation in Shrimp Aquaculture in South China,JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,shrimp aquaculture; real subsumption; rural China; agrarian change; agribusiness,LAND; THAILAND,"The low rate of full-time agricultural employment in China has tempted scholars to believe that capitalization does not necessarily lead to the trenchant effects of proletarianization. In this paper, I refute this hypothesis by showing agri-capital's move from formal subsumption' to real subsumption' in shrimp aquaculture. Previously, due to natural and social barriers, capital had squeezed farmers' value by monopolizing the upstream and downstream sectors of the commodity chain. However, in recent years, after several disease outbreaks that have forced family farmers to abandon their business, agri-capital has finally accomplished real subsumption' by penetrating into the farming process. Following the rise of a nascent shrimp production base in Leizhou, Guangdong Province, I explore how it accomplishes land transfer, technological control and labour supervision to outcompete family farms by capturing the high price of off-season farming. This analysis helps us to understand the dynamics of class formation and the trajectory of proletarianization.","Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Anthropol, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Huang, Y (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Anthropol, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",huangyu@cuhk.edu.hk,"Huang, Yu/AAL-6331-2021","Huang, Yu/0000-0003-4378-387X",Wenner-Gren Foundation; CUHK,Wenner-Gren Foundation; CUHK(Chinese University of Hong Kong),I wish to thank Hsu Wenlu and Yan Hairong for helping me develop a political economy framework in analysing agrarian change.

However, an insurer with poor financial prudence might be myopic so that the optimal strategies are similar to those of the single-regime model.

We measure contagion in terms of tail dependence coefficients, following Fratzscher's (1999) definition of contagion as interdependence. Our results indicate that these countries are divided into two blocks. The first block consists of Brazil, Colombia, Chile, and Mexico, whose exchange rates exhibit the largest dependence coefficients, and the second block consists of Argentina and Peru, whose exchange rate dependence coefficients with other Latin American countries are low. We also found that most of the Latin American exchange rate pairs exhibit asymmetric behaviors characterized by nonsignificant upper tail dependence and significant lower tail dependence. These results imply that there exists contagion in Latin American exchange rates in periods of large appreciations, whereas there is no evidence of contagion during periods of currency depreciation. This empirical regularity may reflect the fear of appreciation in emerging economies identified by Levy-Yeyati, Sturzenegger, and Gluzmann (2013).

These visions aren't antagonistic, just different. The mixed economy vision associated with Ludwig von Mises and Sanford Ikeda treats politics as intervening into markets. The entangled political economy vision treats politics and markets as overlapping subsystems within a society. Entangled political economy thus descends from a theory of society and social processes. Similarly to quantum entanglement where the state of a particle cannot be described independently of that of other particles, entanglement in political economy means that rational market action cannot be defined independently of rational political action. The focal point of entangled political economy, moreover, is on individual actors and their search for gain within different action environments. Interaction among individuals across those environments generates societal tectonics, thereby adding insights from Vilfredo Pareto about social theory to those of Mises and Ikeda about interventionism.","[Patrick, Meg; Wagner, Richard E.] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Wagner, RE (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, 3G4, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",mpatric5@gmu.edu; rwagner@gmu.edu,,,,,,,47,16,18,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2015,164.0,1-2,,,,,103,116,,10.1007/s11127-015-0273-8,0.0,,,14,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CN9DH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358746200007,0

We analyze how the equilibrium changes when preferences are country specific (developed vs. developing countries). Finally, we show that whatever the market configuration at equilibrium, there can be a pollution damage reduction compared to the standard case without relative preferences.

Our baseline results show that the consumption of migrants is 16-20% lower than that of local urban residents. We further find evidence suggesting that, caused by Hukou restrictions, migrants save more for precautionary purposes, have lower expectation of permanent income, and consume much less durable goods because of high mobility. Moreover, we have found no evidence that the consumption heterogeneity can be explained by migration effects, culture, or other forms of household heterogeneity. As both the number and income level of migrants are rising quickly, the constraining effects of Hukou on household consumption is increasing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It uses data on inter-city journeys between Australia and Asia to identify a hierarchy of gateway cities, and then shows how the connections between them has changed over the 2000-2013 period. Results show that secondary, and smaller, gateways in both Australia and Asia have played more important roles in passenger movements over this time. In Melbourne in particular, stronger growth in the demand for international travel in that city along with more use made of the smaller long-haul aircraft by airlines, has strengthened its role as a gateway city relative to Sydney. These results confirm that the geography of inter-continental air networks are changing which may have important implications for the air transport roles of some cities in the immediate future.

We follow over 157,000 individuals who leave paid employment and become business owners during the period 1992-2007. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we analyze both entry and exit, identifying and characterizing different profiles of individuals leaving paid employment to become business owners, and distinguishing exits by dissolution from exits by ownership transfer. Second, we provide new evidence on how particular experiences in the labor market and entry modes shape the post-entry dynamics of nascent business owners. By differentiating between different entry and exit routes, this paper provides new evidence on different human capital patterns among nascent business owners and on key determinants of entrepreneurial survival. Our results suggest that different exit modes can be predicted by business owners' entry route. Furthermore, different exit modes exhibit different duration dependence patterns according to the entry mode. Additionally, the paper shows that businesses started after a displacement episode are not necessarily less successful. Those individuals entering entrepreneurship after being displaced due to previous employer closure are found to persist longer.","[Rocha, Vera] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Innovat & Org Econ INO, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Rocha, Vera; Carneiro, Anabela] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, CEF UP, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Rocha, Vera] CIPES Ctr Res Higher Educ Policies, P-4450227 Matosinhos, Portugal; [Varum, Celeste Amorim] Univ Aveiro, Dept Econ Management & Ind Engn, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Varum, Celeste Amorim] Univ Aveiro, GOVCOPP, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",Copenhagen Business School; Universidade do Porto; Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade de Aveiro,"Carneiro, A (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, CEF UP, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal.",vr.ino@cbs.dk; anacar@fep.up.pt; camorim@ua.pt,"Carneiro, Anabela Jesus Moreira/B-7326-2009; Varum, Celeste/B-5853-2009","Carneiro, Anabela Jesus Moreira/0000-0001-5053-0876; Varum, Celeste/0000-0002-9356-0087; Rocha, Vera/0000-0003-0227-7129","FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia) [SFRH/BD/71556/2010, PEst-OE/EGE/UI4105/2014]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/71556/2010] Funding Source: FCT",FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),We acknowledge GEE-MEE (Gabinete de Estrategia e Estudos-Ministerio da Economia e do Emprego) for allowing the use of Quadros de Pessoal dataset.

The value-added compared to the existing body of literature is that we employ variation in autonomy within the same country and within the same school type in order to reduce the omitted variable problem. To fully capture the informational advantage of local actors, we define autonomy as the operational empowerment of the school's direction and teachers. The Flemish secondary school system in Belgium is analysed because it displays unique within-school-type variation in school staff autonomy. This variation originates from autonomously operating school governing bodies that can group multiple schools and are free to delegate responsibilities to the school staff. This variation is likely exogenous because it is mainly driven by approximately random variation in characteristics and composition of the school boards. Combining detailed school-level and pupil-level data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2006 study with a semi-parametric hierarchical model, we find a strong positive effect of school staff autonomy on educational performance. The result is shown to be robust to problems of reverse causality and simultaneity.","[Verschelde, Marijn] Katholieke Univ Leuven, CES, Louvain, Belgium; [Verschelde, Marijn; Rayp, Glenn] Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Hindriks, Jean] Catholic Univ Louvain, Econ Sch Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium; [Schoors, Koen] Univ Ghent, CERISE, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",KU Leuven; Ghent University; Universite Catholique Louvain; Ghent University,"Verschelde, M (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, CES, Louvain, Belgium.",marijn.verschelde@kuleuven-kulak.be; jean.hindriks@uclouvain.be; glenn.rayp@ugent.be; koen.schoors@ugent.be,"Rayp, Glenn/AAF-8330-2020; Schoors, Koen/N-7059-2019","Schoors, Koen/0000-0002-4159-8083; Verschelde, Marijn/0000-0003-3792-8809",Fund for Scientific Research Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen); ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Fund for Scientific Research Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen)(FWO); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We sincerely thank the participants of the Workshop 'Educational Systems and Human Capital' in Trondheim (March 2011), Bart Cockx, Gerdie Everaert, Meryem Fethi, Kristiaan Kerstens, Dirk Van de gaer, Sietse Bracke, Klaas Mulier and Joost Vandenbossche for their helpful suggestions and insightful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.

Our work challenges the conclusions of the author. First, the author's result depends on the rise of only one of the components of capital, namely housing capital, and due to housing prices. In fact, housing prices have risen faster than rent and income in many countries. It is worth noting that productive capital, excluding housing, has only risen weakly relative to income over the last few decades. Over the longer run, the productive capital/income ratio has not increased at all. Second, rent, not housing prices, should matter for the dynamics of wealth inequality, because rent represents both the actual income of housing capital for landlords and the dwelling costs saved by owner-occupiers (people living in their own houses). This does not mean that housing prices do not contribute to other forms of inequality.","[Bonnet, Odran] Sci Po, Dept Econ, Paris, France; LIEPP, Paris, France",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Bonnet, O (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Dept Econ, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,47,0,0,1,16,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We hypothesize that the percentage of female directors on a BD, the presence of female directors on the Nomination and Compensation Committee, the presence of well-qualified independent women directors on BD, the sector, and the geographical region, have an effect on the gender wage gap. The results show that the percentage of female directors on a BD and the geographical region have no effect on the gender wage gap. On the other hand, the finding reports that women's presence on the Nomination and Compensation Committee increases the gender gap in pay, and it is reduced when there are independent female directors who have gained a degree on the BD, and when the company operates in the finance and real estate services sector. In addition, the results also demonstrate that the seniority of the female directors decreases the gender gap in pay, while there is a rise when the companies are bigger and the size of the BD and the return on assets increase.

Researchers have proposed and applied a number of commuting benchmarks and excess commuting indices that aim to evaluate the commuting efficiency and jobs-housing balance of cities. A comprehensive review and comparative evaluation of the proposed metrics in terms of their ability to capture the intended phenomena, while controlling for the other general characteristics of cities, has yet to be performed. This article attempts to fill this gap by examining four commuting benchmarks (minimum commute, maximum commute, random commute, and proportionally matched commute) and five excess commuting indices (excess commute, commuting potential utilized, commuting economy, normalized commuting economy, and effort). Our conceptual analysis of the indices is complemented with a comparative empirical analysis of commuting in thirty Canadian cities. We explore relationships between the indices and point out the strengths and limitations of each. The findings suggest that no single index can adequately capture the commuting performance of an urban area, while each index can be employed to address a specific policy question. Used together, the indices can provide a reasonably good understanding of urban form and commuting behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Interestingly, an informationally equivalent change in private signal strength across actions and advice alters strategic default willingness, but not the moral stance of borrowers, which demonstrates the complexity of this life-altering financially and emotionally impactful decision.","William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",,"Seiler, MJ (通讯作者)，William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",Michael.Seiler@mason.wm.edu,,"Seiler, Michael/0000-0001-7071-2474",,,,,47,27,29,0,16,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

Depleted dictators give considerably less than nondepleted dictators and hence exhibit strong preferences for selfish allocation. In contrast to earlier studies, participants were explicitly paid for completing the ego-depletion task (with either a flat rate or strictly performance-based payment). We studied the dynamics of decisions by repeating the dictator game 12 times (anonymously). Depleted dictators start with much lower offers than nondepleted ones, but, strikingly, offers decrease in time for both groups, and more rapidly so for nondepleted dictators. We conclude that, whereas depleted dictators neglect fairness motives from the very first decision on, nondepleted dictators initially resist the tendency to act selfishly, but eventually become depleted or learn to act selfishly. Hence, pro-social behavior may be short-lived, and ego depletion uncovers the default tendencies for selfishness earlier.","[Achtziger, Anja] Zeppelin Univ Friedrichshafen, Dept Social Sci, Friedrichshafen, Germany; [Alos-Ferrer, Carlos; Wagner, Alexander K.] Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Cologne, Germany",Zeppelin University; University of Cologne,"Achtziger, A (通讯作者)，Zeppelin Univ, Dept Social Sci, Seemooser Horn 20, D-88045 Friedrichshafen, Germany.",anja.achtziger@zu.de,"Alos-Ferrer, Carlos/GQO-9340-2022","Alos-Ferrer, Carlos/0000-0002-1668-9784; Wagner, Alexander K./0000-0002-2124-7550",,,,,60,81,90,12,77,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

The key novelty is to parsimoniously capture the impact of news on all interest rates using a simple no-arbitrage model. The different types of news are analyzed in a common framework by recognizing their heterogeneity, which allows for a systematic comparison of their effects. This approach leads to novel empirical findings. First, monetary policy causes a substantial amount of volatility in both short-term and long-term interest rates. Second, macroeconomic data surprises have small and mostly insignificant effects on the long end of the term structure. Third, the term-structure response to macroeconomic news is consistent with considerable interest-rate smoothing by the Federal Reserve. Fourth, monetary policy surprises are multidimensional while macroeconomic surprises are one-dimensional.","Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco,"Bauer, MD (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",michael.bauer@sf.frb.org,"Bauer, Michael/A-6573-2019","Bauer, Michael/0000-0002-2711-816X",,,,,45,9,10,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

This study widens the perspective from a firm's absolute attributes to its relative positioning within its competitive environment. The hypotheses for the empirical analysis are derived from game theoretic models with either vertical or horizontal product differentiation. In each of the two theoretical models two incumbents initially choose very different quality and variety levels, respectively, and move closer to the center when faced by entry of a competitor. From the vertical differentiation model we predict a stronger price reduction by high-quality firms. In our empirical analysis we are using a novel dataset of the high-quality restaurant market in Germany to test the theoretical findings.

We confirm the results appearing separately in the literature on optimal resource management and tradable permits, that both tradable water permits and non-tradable quotas provide the basic mechanism for sustainable water use and yield substantial economic benefits and that allowing trading of water permits improves efficiency. In order to derive the above results we develop a discrete time model to realistically describe farmer's myopic behavior, while using a continuous time model to describe optimal management. We also incorporate into the analysis the economic effect of sea water intrusion in the aquifer and we estimate the cost of water overexploitation under myopic behavior. The empirical part of the paper is based on simulations using data from an agricultural region in Northern Greece. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of heterogeneity in crops' production and market characteristics. We show that the more diverse are the crops, in technology and market prices, and the stricter is the water constraint, the higher are the benefits from using a tradable water permit system.","[Latinopoulos, Dionisios] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Spatial Planning & Dev, GR-54006 Thessaloniki, Greece; [Sartzetakis, Eftichios S.] Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; University of Macedonia,"Sartzetakis, ES (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, 156 Egnatia Str, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece.",dlatinop@plandevel.auth.gr; esartz@uom.gr,"Sartzetakis, Eftichios Sofokles/J-1938-2016","Sartzetakis, Eftichios Sofokles/0000-0001-7997-7575; Latinopoulos, DIONYSIS/0000-0003-2184-9268",Research Funding Program: Thalis-Athens University of Economics and Business-Optimal Management of Dynamical Systems of the Economy and the Environment: The Use of Complex Adaptive Systems; European Union (European Social Fund-ESF); Greek national funds; Greek National Scholarships Foundation,Research Funding Program: Thalis-Athens University of Economics and Business-Optimal Management of Dynamical Systems of the Economy and the Environment: The Use of Complex Adaptive Systems; European Union (European Social Fund-ESF)(European Union (EU)European Social Fund (ESF)); Greek national funds(Greek Ministry of Development-GSRT); Greek National Scholarships Foundation,"The authors would like to thank the associate editor and four reviewers of this journal for their very valuable comments and suggestions that led to the significant improvement of the paper, as well as the participants of the EAERE 2011 conference.

Finally, diversity seems to increase tolerance, despite its negative effect on other social capital variables such as trust, perceived safety, and participation to community activities, and voting in elections.

It utilizes international data to evaluate the linkages among bilateral trade in goods, bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI) flows and BC co-movements. The paper contributes to the current literature by examining the relationship using the latest available data (sample range: 1998-2011), and thus taking into account the European sovereign debt crisis period. It also examines the role of FDI, which though increasingly important in the flows of international production factors, is currently neglected by the literature.

The government of President Joko Widodo (widely known as Jokowi) has set an agenda of reform, including simpler, faster investment licensing, historic cuts to fuel subsidies to generate fiscal savings, and increased spending on infrastructure. On the political side, Jokowi has had to deal with several political issues coming not only from parties in opposition but also from parties supporting his government, including during the formation of the new cabinet. We examine the consequences so far of the government's policy initiatives and of the policymaking process. While some initiatives have been implemented with success, some seem to have been launched without enough preparation, consultation, or empirical evidence, and many have been poorly communicated. Although inflation accelerated after the November fuel-price rise, efforts have been made to contain inflationary expectations and to mitigate the effects on poverty through social-assistance programs. The government took steps to cushion the impending impacts of higher fuel prices on vulnerable households by giving cash handouts of Rp 200,000 per month to 15.5 million disadvantaged families who receive the lowest level of welfare, and by promoting publicly funded education and health care. The partial removal of gasoline subsidies and the introduction of a fixed-subsidy policy for diesel in the revised 2015 budget reduce uncertainty about the fiscal position, although increases in government spending in infrastructure development were announced at the same time. The revised budget for 2015 increases spending on infrastructure development by 63% from the 2014 budget, mostly on projects to improve connectivity on land and at sea-such as the development of toll roads, railways, and ports-and to increase the performance of the agricultural sector. However, the recent drop in international oil prices forced the government to increase its target for tax revenue by 30% on last year's target, raising concerns about the effect of falling oil prices on the economy. Trade and investment policy reform is important in unlocking Indonesia's growth potential and improving the country's current external balance. Jokowi's administration, however, has been sending mixed signals about its position towards more open policies. The country has yet to recommence several trade negotiations that were postponed in 2014 and is still struggling to meet its commitments under the ASEAN Economic Community. Although improvement in investment procedures and licensing is currently underway, Indonesia needs to adopt a more positive attitude if it is to attract more investment.","[Damuri, Yose R.] Ctr Strateg & Int Studies, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Day, Creina] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Damuri, YR (通讯作者)，Ctr Strateg & Int Studies, Jakarta, Indonesia.",,,,,,,,40,12,12,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

However, are such perceptions also capable of explaining actual trading and risk-taking behavior? To answer this question, we combine monthly survey data with matching brokerage records to construct a panel dataset allowing us to simultaneously examine investor perceptions and behavior. We find that investor perceptions and changes therein are important drivers of actual trading and risk-taking behavior: Investors with higher levels of and upward revisions of return expectations are more likely to trade, have higher turnover, trade larger amounts per transaction, and use derivatives. Investors with higher levels of and upward revisions in risk tolerance are more likely to trade, have higher buy-sell ratios, use limit orders more frequently, and hold riskier portfolios. Investors with higher levels of risk perception are more likely to trade, have higher turnover, have lower buy-sell ratios, and hold riskier portfolios.","[Hoffmann, Arvid O.

With the emergence of Islamic banking and finance, an Islamically compatible CSR list of activities has been outlined recently. The Islamic Social Corporate Responsibility (i-CSR) general practice framework consists of non-exhaustive list of possible activities that an organization can carry out under its CSR initiative and are grouped into four thematic areas community, workplace, marketplace and environment. The aim of this research is to rank the CSR activities listed under the thematic area of workplace. The purpose of the ranking is to build a model that can measure and compare the contributions made by Islamic organizations through their CSR activities. In this research work, the CSR activities are ranked using analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The AHP produces pair wise comparison type questionnaire and with 45 CSR activities identified under the workplace segment, 220 pair-wise questions under five sub-areas are generated. The analysis showed that the activities that are highly ranked in each sub-areas are 'fardhu ain tazkirah session', 'medical benefit for immediate family members, fringe benefit, like entitlement to comprehensive medical benefit or takaful protection', 'entitlement to special leave to visit the elderly, parents or attending own children's school activities' and free biannual medical check-ups'.

On the theoretical side, we study the effect of exogenous first- and second-moment shocks to producer-level productivity in a two-country DSGE model with heterogeneous producers and an endogenous dynamic export participation decision. First-moment shocks cause endogenous fluctuations in producer-level dispersion by reallocating production internationally, while second-moment shocks lead to increases in trade relative to GDP in recessions. Empirically, using detailed product-level data in the motor vehicle industry and industry-level data of U.S. manufacturers, we find evidence that international reallocation is indeed important for understanding cross-industry variation in cyclical patterns of measured dispersion.

The nutritional status of the nutritionally vulnerable in Malawian communities should improve in consequence. However, there is little evidence from Malawi or elsewhere to confirm whether irrigation improves nutritional status at household level. Using data from the Third Malawi Integrated Household Survey of 2010/11, this article presents a basic assessment of whether increased use of irrigated farming by smallholders in Malawi might result in better nutritional outcomes for children in Malawian farm households and more diverse diets in these households. The association between the use of irrigation by farm households and the growth performance of their children aged six months to five years was positive but weak and not significant (P>0.05). The positive association between irrigated farming and the diversity in the foods consumed by farm households was somewhat stronger and significant (P<0.05). In particular, irrigation is shown to be an important component in reducing seasonality in household dietary diversity.","[Benson, Todd] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategy & Governance Div, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Benson, T (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategy & Governance Div, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",t.benson@cgiar.org,,,,,,,19,5,7,0,6,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2015,54.0,3,,,,,62,86,,10.1080/03031853.2015.1084940,0.0,,,25,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,DA5MZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367848500004,0

Competition can amplify the run-up by inducing buyers to purchase assets at a loss to prevent competitors from purchasing at lower prices and releasing bad news about inventories.

To assess market timing, the financial literature has proposed return-based and holdings-based measures. Our objective is to analyze the performance of these measures in relation to interim trading bias. This bias is due to managers trading between the observation dates used to measure timing. As managers' timing decisions are not observable we run the empirical analysis over a data set of simulated portfolios. This paper shows how holdings-based measures may lead to biased results if the timing estimation window does not match the managers' timing decision window. Evidence is found that holdings-based measures are unable to detect daily timing ability. Also, these measures are not unbiased to measure monthly timing if estimation and decision windows do not coincide on the same days; in consequence, there is an underestimation of the actual timing parameter and its significance.

We demonstrate that the omission of market risk is conceptually unjustified. We propose a modified WRS model that is empirically supported, but also contributes to the broad discussion on the holding period dependence of real estate risk. We also show that the Case-Shiller weighting method is likely to be mis-specified in nine of the ten cities where the Case-Shiller metro indices are tradable with housing options and futures contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Using a large sample of repeat sales from the Washington DC area, the original repeat sales method of Bailey, Muth, and Nourse (1963) and the Case-Shiller method are compared against the modified WRS.

The vast literature on the subject matter was a considerable help for me, the study of the great economists (both theorists and practitioners) like Keynes, Smith, Krugman, Soros, Llewellyn, Hayek, Greenspan, Asser, Mises, Roubini ruling in favor of one or the other variants. Because it is a matter of present interest, the regulation problem came not only to my attention, but the crisis pushed the authorities of the developed countries to react and seek to apply drastic measures to regulate the financial market. I concluded that the benefits of regulatory standards are recognized by countries that do not make it a priority. Financial stability is called by economists a global public good, so all countries benefit from it, whether or not they contribute to it. These interdependencies are strong incentives for bank regulators mechanisms that they ensure the adherence of all countries to a set of common standards. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This paper investigates the empirical link between total factor productivity (TFP) growth and HGFs, defined in terms of sales growth, in the United Kingdom over the period 2001-2010, by examining two related research questions. Firstly, does higher TFP growth lead to HGF status and secondly, does HGF experience help firms achieve faster TFP growth? Our findings reveal that firms in both the manufacturing and services sectors are more likely to become HGFs when they exhibit higher TFP growth. In addition, firms that have had HGF experience tend to enjoy faster TFP growth following the high-growth episodes. Policy implications are drawn based on the self-reinforcing process of the high-growth phenomenon that is revealed by our results.","[Du, Jun; Temouri, Yama] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Du, Jun; Temouri, Yama] Enterprise Res Ctr, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",Aston University,"Du, J (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Econ & Strategy Grp, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",j.du@aston.ac.uk; y.temouri1@aston.ac.uk,,"Temouri, Yama/0000-0003-3014-258X; Du, Jun/0000-0002-0449-4437",ESRC [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,98,65,71,2,58,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Although these countries are at different stages of development and integration with European Union, there are not highlighted differences on trade openness. Trade policies of them have been oriented towards regional trade cooperation and also integrating into the global economy. The empirical analysis of this study consists on 16- year panel data of 10 SEE countries over the period 1996 to 2012. The system GMM is used as the most appropriate estimation method that addresses various econometric challenges, including endogeneity problems. The growth rate of the sample countries is modelled as dependent on trade openness and a set of control variables such as: initial level of income per capita, human capital, gross fix capital formation, FDI, labour force and a number of interaction variables with trade openness. The estimation results indicate that the positive effects of trade openness on economic growth are conditioned by the initial income per capita and other explanatory variables, otherwise there is not robust evidence between these two variables. Moreover, the trade openness is more beneficial to countries with higher level of initial income per capita, as well as trade openness favours countries with higher level of FDI and with higher gross fixed capital formation.

These aspects of social behaviour that we have discovered have significations which go well beyond the abortion issue, and reveal fundamental characteristics of human behaviour. We are especially interested in finding connections between different views on abortion and our social behaviour. We have found out that the abortion issue highlights many essential human characteristics, therefore it has the potential of revealing clues about many social aspects. We analyse such issues concerning abortion, as we try to find the sources of misunderstandings and to offer solutions. Overall, it seems that abortion would not be such a severe problem if people showed tolerance and respect towards other people. We conclude that, no matter how hard it is to surpass problems concerning abortion, we can find solutions and economic resources, in order to develop educational systems which are able to make people more responsible and more willing to tolerate different views on abortion.","Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Frant, AE (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",ancuta.frant@uaic.ro,"Franț, Ancuța Elena/JQW-7466-2023",,,,,,8,0,0,0,14,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-142-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,818,825,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD6RH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362516600080,0

The reaction to a difficult economic situation is just an effort to reduce overhead costs. Potential way of reducing overheads costs becomes the application of the outsourcing principles. This paper is focused on the detailed specification of costs associated with the use of outsourcing. Outsourcing priority task, in addition to the cost savings, is the transfer of risk to the service provider, with the ensuring and increasing the quality level of carried out activities. Practice has confirmed that the vision at a cost saving are often greater than it actually is. The problem seems to be that it is quite difficult to determine and know the extent of its costs for the implementation of outsourced processes and there is often forgotten to the level of additional costs for manage the outsourcing relationship.

Because Islamic banking has recent history, not all of their instruments are still fully created and one such model is tawarruq; model known as reverse or commodity Murabahah that operates by borrowing cash based on two separate transactions. There are two basic types; the first type implies that an individual buys commodity from a bank, deferred, which later sold to another person or a bank for money in order to obtain the necessary liquidity. Another type is organized tawarruq that involves a transaction in which an individual buys commodity from Islamic bank on credit. It is a kind of standardized types such as metal or wheat. The bank purchased commodity sells to the client at a higher price with the term of payment in the future. The client hires the bank as its agent who sells commodity for cash. The result of this transactions means that the client gets the cash and bank owes funded amount plus the anticipated return. Many Islamic experts and economists express reservation under this model, considering that it achieves what Islamic banking seeks to avoid and it is the interest generated by activities of conventional banks. Although the model is acceptable from a legal point of Islamic economics, essentially in a spiritual way it isn't, since it opens the possibility of creating a multitude of transactions without creating real value and the possibility of creating interest. The aim of this paper is to introduce the basics of tawarruq model and its functioning, to examine its acceptability in terms of Islamic economics, and thereby contribute to further discussion on the admissibility and the purpose of its use.","[Hadzic, Fikret] Univ Sarajevo, Sarajevo Sch Econ & Business, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Hanic, Aida] Inst Econ Sci, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Sarajevo; Institute of Economic Sciences,"Hadzic, F (通讯作者)，Univ Sarajevo, Sarajevo Sch Econ & Business, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",fikret.hadzic@efsa.unsa.ba; aida.hanic@ien.bg.ac.rs,"Hanić, Aida/AAP-3247-2021","Hanić, Aida/0000-0003-4378-7002",,,,,16,1,1,0,1,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,123,139,,,,,,17,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700007,0

How to stabilize or to ensure local economic growth, international and interregional competitiveness as well as the labour market insertion? Confronted with these challenges, the traditional sectoral approaches prove to be onerous and ineffective and, consequently, new forms of governance acquire importance. Among them, integrated urban governance - a new concept - (i)mplies a change in the administrative situation and the way of thinking of decision-makers in formulating and implementing territorial development policies. Integrated urban governance, having both a vertical dimension and a horizontal dimension beyond the administrative borders of the cities, requires that the identification of the actors should be based on these dimensions. And the solution is not to plan and to implement projects involving possible stakeholders. It requires selecting and analysing the actors who could provide a real support. As integrated urban governance is, in fact, a managerial approach to interdisciplinary problems during the formulation of policies beyond the limits of the established political areas.

Results indicate that the elements influencing a measurable negative export revenue effect due to disease-including risk perceptions and whether the disease is zoonotic-differ from the elements that influence the length of revenue recovery, such as product affordability. In addition, overall global economic health and growing meat demand are elements that matter at the time an event occurs.

Social networks can also partially duplicate the internal communication between employees within the office of the public administration. It is possible to comment directly the existing problems and to make some reminders to the problem. It is possible to inform the residents about their activities and to be closer to residents. The internet is a virtual world so we have to remember also on feedback and evaluation of the effectiveness. It is necessary to make the first detailed analysis of the instruments which we are using. The paper deals with comparing of free available applications usable for social network analysis. Suitable applications were selected as well as suitable metrics for analyzing of social network for the purpose of the work. The aim of this work is to select the best application for analyzing and visualization of the social networks based on criteria defined by authors. To compare each application, the method of paired comparison - Saaty method- is used.","[Jonasova, Hana; Panus, Jan; Pelinka, Ondrej] Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Ustav Syst Inzenyfrstvi & Informat, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Panus, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fak Ekon Spravni, Ustav Syst Inzenyfrstvi & Informat, Studentska 84, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",Hana.Jonasova@upce.cz; Jan.Panus@upce.cz; st28875@student.upce.cz,"Panus, Jan/GRF-0682-2022",,,,,,13,1,1,0,13,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-145-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,274,282,,,,,,9,Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BE3SC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371199400036,0

We construct from daily data on return and volatility the covariance of return and volatility at monthly frequency. The measures of daily volatility are realized-volatility at high frequency (normalized squared return), conditional-volatility recovered from a stochastic volatility model, and implied-volatility deduced from options prices. Positive shocks to aggregate demand and to oil-market specific demand are associated with negative effects on the covariance of return and volatility. Oil supply disruptions are associated with positive effects on the covariance of return and volatility. The spillover index between the structural oil price shocks and covariance of stock return and volatility is large and highly statistically significant. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical methodology captures a financial globalization regime with a nonlinear, structural vector autoregression (SVAR) and a regime-switching contemporaneous interest-rate block. The responses of longer term interest-rate spreads in Canada to changes in U.S. long-term nominal interest rates are found to have increased by about one-third in the globalization regime since the late 1990s, consistent with recent research on the effects of international long-term yields on those in small open economies. There is also some evidence of a weaker response of the longer term spreads, a measure of the stance of policy in Canada, to the monetary policy rate in the globalization regime. However, the evidence does not support an important decoupling of short- and long-term interest rates that has made the monetary transmission mechanism less effective for controlling economic activity and inflation. In fact, monetary policy appears to have become even more effective in the globalization regime as result explicit inflation targeting. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In order to compare observed and predicted policy behavior, the chapter estimates Actual and Perceived regime switching Taylor Rules for the ECB. The former is based on the refi rate set by the Governing Council while the latter relies on the professional point forecasts of the refi rate performed by a large investment bank before the upcoming policy rate decision. The empirical evidence shows that the Central Bank's main policy rate has switched between two regimes: in the first one the Taylor Principle is satisfied and the ECB stabilizes the economic outlook, while in the second regime the Central Bank cuts rates more aggressively and puts a higher emphasis on stabilizing real output growth expectations. Second, the results point out that the professional forecasters have broadly well predicted the actual policy regimes. The estimation results are also robust to using consensus forecasts of inflation and real output growth. The empirical evidence from the augmented Taylor Rules shows that the Central Bank has most likely not responded to the growth rates of M3 and the nominal effective exchange rate and the estimated regimes are robust to including these additional variables in the regressions. Finally, after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers the policy rate has switched to a crisis regime as the ECB has focused on preventing a further decline in economic activity and on securing the stability of the financial system.","Pictet Asset Management, CH-1211 Geneva 73, Switzerland",,"Markov, N (通讯作者)，Pictet Asset Management, Route Acacias 60, CH-1211 Geneva 73, Switzerland.",nmarkov@pictet.com,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78441-779-6; 978-1-78441-780-2,INT SYMP EC,,,2015,24.0,,,,,,267,337,,10.1108/S1571-038620150000024020,0.0,,,71,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358537900009,0

The quality of life may be assessed based on several macroeconomic indicators, such as: GD per capita, population incomes or expenses, population consumption, indicators that are the foundation of the analyses that may help taking decisions regarding the social and economic policies aimed to the increase of the standard of living. Although Eurostat data show that, despite appearances, the economic well-being of the Romanian population has increased during the period of economic crisis, it is in fact related to the social polarisation.

ANOVA and MANOVA models are used to highlight farm behaviors within SFSCs about sustainability. The analysis identified the complex nature of the relationships between farms involved in various short food supply chain schemes regarding the sustainability. While the social dimension is highly important in the case of farmers' markets and multi-chain farms, the environmental dimension is more significant for solidarity purchasing groups and farms selling directly. The economic dimension has a key role in each of the different types. Apart from these considerations, SFSCs have a fundamental place in promoting and achieving sustainability at local level.","[Mastronardi, Luigi; Marino, Davide; Cavallo, Aurora; Giannelli, Agostino] Univ Molise, Dept Biosci & Terr, I-86090 Pesche, IS, Italy",University of Molise,"Cavallo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Molise, Dept Biosci & Terr, I-86090 Pesche, IS, Italy.",nardi@unimol.it; dmarino@unimol.it; auroracavallo@libero.it; giannelliagostino3@gmail.com,"Mastronardi, Luigi/AAS-3332-2020; Mastronardi, Luigi/JPY-0265-2023; CAVALLO, Aurora/GXH-1765-2022; MARINO, DAVIDE/AAS-7246-2020; Cavallo, Aurora/AAA-3506-2020","MARINO, DAVIDE/0000-0003-2471-6612;",,,,,41,41,44,0,40,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The aim of the paper is to evaluate the profitability and efficiency of Czech dairy farms on a regional bases and with respect to the policy measurement changes. The evaluation will be addressed using two main methods, namely stochastic frontier estimation and Spearman correlation coefficient computation. The calculations and estimation are based on unbalanced panel data of Czech dairy farms-local entities drawn from the Registr32 database and the State Agricultural Intervention Fund database. The data set covers the period from 2004 to 2013. The results show that producers in all analysed regions extensively exploited their production possibilities. However, the profitability tendency was not the same in the analysed regions. The worst situation was in the Kralovehradecky region where the decrease of profitability was caused by the decrease of output and by the loss of market power. Whereas the profitability increased the most in the Moravskoslezky region and it was especially due to technical change.","[Maxova, Jana; Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Maxová, J (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",jana.a.maxova@gmail.com; kroupovaz@pef.czu.cz,"Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/AAO-8608-2021","Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/0000-0001-5834-3338",,,,,11,0,0,0,7,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,273,281,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600030,0

This paper considers the situation wherein the separation between ownership and management exists in both the public firm and the private firm. In particular, we focus on a new type of managerial delegation contract in the public firm that is a weighted sum of social welfare and the difference between consumer surplus and producer surplus (sum of each firm's absolute profit). On the other hand, in this paper, the classical sales delegation contract is employed in the private firm. In the above setting, we show that similar to the case wherein both the public firm and the private firm simultaneously use their sales delegation contracts, there does not exist any equilibrium market structure under the class of pure strategies of both the firms. Thus, even if the government as the owner of the public firm provides to her/his manager a strategic delegation contract such that it is easier to manipulate social welfare, we find that it is likely that the indeterminacy in the equilibrium market structure(s) under the class of pure strategies cannot be resolved. Therefore, in this paper, we conclude that the government must devise another style of managerial delegation contract of the public firm in order to assure the equilibrium market structure under the pure strategy class.

Previous studies have found a significant coefficient parameter in exchange rate variable, which is only indicative of short-run pricing-to-market for multiple export destinations rather than long-run pricing behavior. This paper examines a long-run pricing-to-market for U.S. broiler meat export markets, using between panel specification. Findings indicate that the U.S. pricing-to-market behavior of exporters is both transient and persistently long. These results clearly imply that the implementation of a long-run pricing-to-market strategy in the U.S. broiler meat exports mitigates the rising imbalance between the domestic production and consumption via incomplete exchange rate pass-through.","[No, Sung C.] Southern Univ & A&M Coll, Finance & Econ, Coll Business, Baton Rouge, LA 70813 USA; [Davis, Christopher G.] USDA, Markets & Trade Econ Div, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20024 USA; [Harvey, David] USDA, Markets & Trade Econ Div, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC USA",Southern University System; Southern University & A&M College; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"No, SC (通讯作者)，Southern Univ & A&M Coll, Finance & Econ, Coll Business, Baton Rouge, LA 70813 USA.",sung_no@subr.edu; chrisdavis@ers.usda.gov; djharvey@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,20,3,3,1,1,INT FOOD & AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW,COLLEGE STATION,"333 BLOCKER BUILDING, 2124 TAMU, COLLEGE STATION, TX 77843-2124 USA",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

So far, this debate was between Liberals and Neo-Marxist, whose argument was that trade promotes peace, for the former, and that asymmetric trade creates either conflictual relations or more cooperation, according to the balance of power. This paper is built on the theoretical basis of Realism and more specifically, on Gilpin's approach of international political economy. By developing a new analytical framework, which consists of determinants such as the geographic specificity and worthiness of the disputed area, meaning the added value the conflictual area gives to the state's influence and therefore to its power, we examine the case of conflict between India and Pakistan, arguing that trade, commercial relations and economic interdependence, in general, does not deter conflict or militarized disputes, because states dominant objective is not the economic growth and prosperity but the access to areas which provide them with more possibilities of exercising their influence, through economic or other means. We conclude, that economic interdependence does not promote peaceful relations between adversaries, since conflict is not eliminated, and for that reason, a potential reduce of conflict levels or militarized disputes provides a sense of virtual national security.

Indeed, the renewal of air in a closed environment without using an air conditioning system with mechanical elements can lead to energy savings and, in addition, provide air quality. The wind tunnel tests were carried out by varying the positioning of six ventilation modules in the facade system configuration. The modules were positioned below the window-sill (ventilated window-sill) as well as separately above and below the facade. The wind speed measurements were taken inside and outside the model for the different facades configurations to evaluate the best performance in relation to natural ventilation.

Quality is now seen as an economic category, which can be measured. The paper is focused on the comparison of two models that monitor quality cost - the model PAF (prevention, appraisal a failure) and the process cost model in the selected woodworking company in Slovakia. There were evaluated advantages and disadvantages of these models, solutions and appropriate steps for improvement of management in the area of quality cost were proposed. The importance of this paper can be considered mainly from the point of view to pay attention to the monitoring the quality cost in practical conditions of enterprises. It can be concluded that both models have a great economic benefit for the business. Thanks to them, there were discovered gaps in the area of quality management of the woodworking company which defence the success of the company on the timber market of Slovakia. These gaps can be eliminated through setting the administrative measures and solutions in the investigated area. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Trading strategies are set regarding different technical indicators based on moving averages and volatility of the value and returns on stock indices. Simple trading rules are generated using two moving averages a long period and a short period moving average, and Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI). Selected technical indicators are used as features in defining predictive model based on Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs). A LS-SVM classifier has been used in order to predict trend of the stock indices' value whereby the obtained outputs of the LS-SVM model are binary signals that can be used for defining the trading strategy. Comparing the results obtained from traditional statistical methods for predicting the trend of financial series and proposed LS-SVM model, it can be concluded that machine learning techniques capture the non-linear models which are dominant in the financial markets in more adequate way. Outperforming the results of Buy & Hold strategy and technical trading strategies, application of LS-SVM in decision making process on investing on the financial market significantly can contribute to maximization of profitability on investment.

This study extends this literature by examining the impact of government expenditure on agriculture, on Nigeria's economy from 1970 to 2006. General-to-specific methodology of time series econometrics was utilised to arrive at the preferred error correction model that was used to determine the impact of government spending on agriculture and on economic growth. In consonance with economic theory, the results showed that the total expenditure on agriculture had a positive significant effect on Nigeria's economic growth in the long run with elasticity of 0.32 during the period under review. The results also showed that economic growth was independent of recurrent expenditure, but dependent (positively) on capital expenditure in the long run with elasticity of 0.36. The implication is that agriculture should be given priority in budgetary allocation and capital spending to promote economic growth in Nigeria.","[Tijani, Akeem A.; Oluwasola, Olumemino; Baruwa, Olayinka I.] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Ife, Nigeria",Obafemi Awolowo University,"Tijani, AA (通讯作者)，Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Ife, Nigeria.",aatijani@uniswa.sz,,"Baruwa, Olayinka/0000-0002-8981-083X",,,,,29,11,11,3,12,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2015,54.0,2,,,,,76,92,,10.1080/03031853.2015.1073000,0.0,,,17,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,CV4FI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000364221900005,0

Especially in rural areas opinion leaders are held in high esteem by those who accept their opinions. However, usually is very difficult to identify them and even more difficult to explore the behavioural dimensions of their leadership. In this paper an attempt has been made to segment farmers in distinguishable clusters with similar traits according to the degree of their leadership ability. Besides, this paper aims a) to recognize the real rural influentials, b) to determine their importance and role in rural communities and c) to explore their socio-economic characteristics insofar those affecting their leadership. For this reason a survey was employed in a large sample of 450 farmers in a typical rural region in northern Greece. Using Two-Step Cluster analysis and other multivariate statistical techniques the sample was stratified in five general distinct clusters according to the generalizations of the related theories. In particular, it was found that the majority of participants are opinion laggards or farmers who consider themselves as opinion leaders although they really are not while a smaller percentage are the farmers who believe that they have only some leadership traits and few of them are the real opinion leaders or influentials. This segmentation is very important in offering the knowledge to apply specialized policies based on the particular characteristics of each cluster. Moreover, considering that the application of individualized policy is easier and less costly we can use this methodology as a guide of identification of the opinion leaders, so that they can be potentially used as intermediates of agricultural policies and as tools of influence over the rest of the farmers and mainly over the opinion laggards.

Energy conservation and environmental protection, the coal market and the electricity market have become three major challenges in thermal power plant. Power generation cost is dominated by coal, so coal management is an important subject. A large coal-fired power plant has seized the favorable opportunity to take the initiative to deal with the situation. The plant hired an outside management consulting company to perfect the management systems, and to develop energy-saving emission reduction strategy. Especially in the fuel management, they carried out benchmarking and lean management in the whole process of production, and the employees were mobilized to upgrade equipments and systems. After five years the company has achieved remarkable results. This paper mainly introduces upgrading of coal handling system, the optimized setting of management departments, improvement of field measurement equipments, coal blending and construction of information management platform. These make the whole process of power generation more efficient, and can be used for reference of similar power company, in order to improve the management level.","SDIC Qinzhou Elect Power Co Ltd, Qinzhou 535008, Peoples R China",,"Xia, JT (通讯作者)，SDIC Qinzhou Elect Power Co Ltd, Qinzhou 535008, Peoples R China.",xjtgtqz@163.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-62520-68-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2015,8.0,,,,,,487,491,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD7OC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363373700095,0

The risk spillover from oil to precious metals and Euro/Dollar foreign exchange rates is moderate. For instance, the oil market uncertainty spills 11.0%, 11.1% and 8.9% to gold, silver and Euro/Dollar exchange rate respectively. The volatility crossover from all of these markets to oil is tiny, implying that oil is the main driver of its association with these markets.

I find evidence that foreign capital flows are significantly and negatively related to 30-year mortgage interest rates. The evidence on the extent of the responsiveness of the interest rates to the foreign capital inflows depends on the type and magnitude of the capital inflows. Official capital flows to the Treasury and agency bonds do appear to have a significant influence on the mortgage interest rates in the VAR model specifications. Private capital inflows to the US agency bonds have significant impact on the long term mortgage rates. Private capital inflows to agency bonds do not significantly and consistently affect mortgage interest rates and Treasury yields. The relatively weaker importance of the private inflows in influencing the rates may be due to its smaller size compared with the official inflows. The results are robust for alternative model specifications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Time series models are based on a sample of 30 long-lived firms with 55 years of continuous data from 1955 through to 2009. The cross-section models show a decreasing magnitude in the elasticity of market value with respect to earnings over time relative to book value, suggesting a decline in value relevance of earnings. This finding is explained by an increasing incidence of reported losses. We find no direct evidence that the increased incidence of losses is due to poor earning quality or earnings management.

In contrast, nonproductive forms of entrepreneurship are negatively related to distributive justice but positively related to corruption. Unexpectedly, the findings also show that corruption mediates the relationship between distributive justice and legal entrepreneurial behavior while distributive justice mediates the relationship between corruption and illegal entrepreneurial behavior.

We look at a price mechanism, specifically a Pigouvian subsidy, and four non-price interventions. The non-price policies are information alone, information with a normative message, communication alone, and normative messages with communication allowed. In all experiment sessions, no intervention occurs in the first seven and last seven rounds, allowing us to examine the effects of introducing and taking away a policy. The subsidy leads to near-efficient extraction, but surprisingly leads groups that were not over-extracting to also reduce extraction. This over-compliance decreases efficiency, although on net the subsidy is the most efficiency-enhancing intervention. Information provision, communication, normative appeals, and normative appeals combined with communication all reduce over-extraction (though by less than the subsidy) without exacerbating over-compliance; however, the effects of information alone and communication alone are small and not robust. The non-price policies cause a decline in over-extraction of from 0.549 (information) to 11.441 % (normative appeals with communication). These effects are of the same order of magnitude as the effects seen in major field studies of conservation messaging. The subsidy has the worst persistence properties (after the intervention ceases), while normative messages with communication have the best.","[Delaney, Jason] Georgia Gwinnett Coll, Sch Business, 1000 Univ Ctr Lane, Lawrenceville, GA 30043 USA; [Jacobson, Sarah] Williams Coll, Dept Econ, 24 Hopkins Hall Dr, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Gwinnett College; Williams College,"Jacobson, S (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Dept Econ, 24 Hopkins Hall Dr, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",jdelaney@ggc.edu; sarah.a.jacobson@williams.edu,,,Georgia State University; Williams College,Georgia State University; Williams College,"We thank James Cox, Cary Deck, Ragan Petrie, Vjollca Sadiraj, Christian Vossler, two anonymous referees, and colleagues and seminar participants for comments and suggestions.

Although nowadays many of them are converted in greenways, this paper supports that disused railway lines could also operate as non-motorised transport axes related to daily activities, organising their surrounding territory. In this regard, it is necessary to measure the potential of the line, studying the relations created between the disused line and its surrounding environment by means of non-motorised accessibility analyses. The presented methodology analyses accessibility around a linear system with a multilevel approach: regional, interurban and urban. Each approach provides results of different scales, but in turn provides results of the whole line areas, enabling the comprehension of the potentiality of the infrastructure as a non-motorised axis and the connection with its urban and rural environment. The proposed methodology has been applied in a case study, demonstrating the capability of non-motorised routes to structure the territory and attend several activities, giving rise to more sustainable transport.

Surprisingly, despite its relevance in the political debate, this topic has not been investigated empirically in the literature. In order to fill this gap, we develop a model of the decision to migrate focusing in particular on the role played by cultural traits. More specifically, we focus on radical Islam as a deterrent for migration. Following Berman (2003), we define radical Islam as a set of ideologies, also referred to as Political Islam, holding that Islam should guide not only personal life, but also social and political life. In our model, more radical values imply a higher psychological cost of migrating. This cost derives from the fact that connections with socio-religious friends and neighbors are generally not maintained after migration, thus deterring individuals from migrating (Mayers, 2000). We then test empirically the predictions of the model, using individual-level data from the second (2010-11) and third (2012-14) waves of the Arab Barometer. Our results suggest that, ceteris paribus, more radical individuals are less willing to migrate. This finding is robust to alternative specifications of the model and to the use of Instrumental Variables and Propensity Score Matching aimed at addressing the potential endogeneity of radical Islam. The result is also qualitatively unchanged when using aggregate data on actual outflows of migrants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that moral hazard leads to lower contributions to a rainy day fund with a fiscal union present, and further that the higher the fiscal transfer, the lower will be the contributions to the rainy-day fund. The optimal size of the fiscal union trades-off the ex-post insurance provided by the union and the moral hazard which reduces national ex-ante preparation for stabilization policies. Optimally, the insurance provided by the fiscal union should be lower (1) the more effective is own-fiscal policy; (2) the more the presence of the fiscal union reduces rainy-day fund savings; (3) the lower is the relative probability of recession; and (4) the lower is the utility gain of redistribution in the union.

Policy implications are drawn from these findings.","[Hahn, Chin Hee] Gachon Univ, Dept Econ, Seongnam, South Korea; [Hayakawa, Kazunobu; Ito, Tadashi] Inst Econ Dev, Interdisciplinary Studies Ctr, Tokyo, Japan",Gachon University,"Hayakawa, K (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Dev, Interdisciplinary Studies Ctr, Tokyo, Japan.",chhahn@gachon.ac.kr; kazunobu_hayakawa@ide-gsm.org; tadashi_ito@ide.go.jp,"Hayakawa, Kazunobu/HZM-4324-2023; Hayakawa, Kazunobu/T-9427-2019","Hayakawa, Kazunobu/0000-0003-0032-9060;",JSPS KAKENHI [26285058]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26285058] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",We thank two anonymous referees and the participants at the Japan Society of International Economics KANTO in 2013 for their valuable comments.

This study investigated personal and household characteristics affecting trip making of older adults (65 years and older) using data from the 2010 Household Travel Survey in Seoul. It was tested if the effects of characteristics were the same for the 65+ and the under 65 groups, and if the effects for older adults were the same for the 65-74 and the 75+ groups. Trips were also classified into mandatory and discretionary trips and models estimated for the 65+ group for those two trip purposes. The investigation was done with a heteroskedastic ordered logit model to account for age differences in unobserved variance. The analysis showed that the effects of personal and household characteristics on trip making varied significantly between the under 65 and 65+ groups, and between those 65-74 and those 75+. This further confirms the risk of viewing all older adults as similar to each other or to younger individuals. The study found heteroskedasticity due to age for the youngest (under 41) and the oldest (75+) groups but not for those 41-64-years-Old. Specific results showed that men 65 or older have a lower probability of making more trips than women, especially mandatory trips, suggesting transportation policy needs to consider the genders differently. Having a driver's license and an automobile was linked to more trips for those 65-74 and for mandatory trips but not for those 75+ and not for discretionary trips of those 65+. Higher income was linked to more trips for older adults, especially mandatory trips. The results show the development of transport policies needs to consider the variance among the aged, such as gender, income, driving licensure and automobile ownership. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

An exogenous financial supply shock reveals that our index also captures financial constraints in terms of the volume of credit. Our index outperforms existing indices in capturing financial constraints of unquoted SMEs.

Drawing from the intrastate war literature, this study considers several factors that prospectively mediate the relationship between oil wealth and terrorism: state weakness; rentier state authoritarianism; corruption of government officials; income inequality; human rights violations; foreign military intervention; and heightened separatist activity. Based on structural equation modeling on a sample of 130 non-OECD countries for the period 1970-2012, the paper produces two main empirical findings. First, while onshore oil production increases terrorist attacks in countries, on- and offshore production and oil revenues from exports do not increase such attacks. Second, the impact of oil on terrorism is mediated through increased human rights abuses. Exploitation of oil is found to be associated with a worsening of physical integrity rights abuses that, in turn, lead to popular grievances that help to fuel terrorist campaigns.","[Piazza, James A.] Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 330 Pond Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Piazza, JA (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 330 Pond Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jap45@psu.edu,,,U.S. Army Research Laboratory; U.

We investigated if individual differences in greed relate to financial behavior. Greed is an important motive for economic behavior and refers to the tendency to never be satisfied and to always want more. We developed a short version of the Dispositional Greed Scale (Seuntjens, Zeelenberg, Van de Ven, & Breugelmans, 2015), which we then used in a large survey with adolescents (N = 3899). Dispositional greed is associated with them having more income, spending more, saving less often, and having debt more often. Identifying what personality characteristics influence financial behavior at a young age is important, as the financial habits that people learn during adolescence persist in adulthood. We find that greed has both positive effects (having a higher income), but also negative effects with the greedy being less likely to save and being more likely to have a debt. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, does bicycle level of traffic stress explain bicycle behavior enough to warrant its use given the limitations? Bicycle level of traffic stress is a new system of bicycle infrastructure classification for cities that cannot afford existing alternatives such as bicycle level of service which is more data-intensive. The LTS criteria lacks many of the input variables found significant in predicting both route choice and mode choice, including several that are required for its more expensive alternatives. The authors select the Salem-Keizer metropolitan area, a case study representative of the kinds of small and medium-sized communities that may prefer to use the LTS to evaluate cycling infrastructure given its lower input costs. The results validate LTS on travel behavior data from the Oregon Household Activity Survey (OHAS), but not mode choice data from the American Community Survey (ACS). These results suggest the LTS criteria may not be useful for cities looking to prioritize infrastructure improvements for specifically increasing commuter cycling. That said, results suggest the system provides a valid measure of a household's propensity to cycle. Further research on a broader cross-section of communities can clarify these mixed results.

We examine this question With the case of China, which has the world's most extensive levels of rural to urban migration. Using OLS, Logit and Probit models and data from a survey of 1,780 households from 18 provinces, we find that migration has a statistically significant adverse effect on collective irrigation controlling for a large number of theoretically relevant variables. The effects of migration on collective action in the commons are possibly mediated by a number of factors frequently identified in the literature, including leadership, social capital, sense of community, economic heterogeneity, and dependence on resources. We speculate that massive out migration partly explains the significant drop in the use of collective canal irrigation and exacerbated the significant increase in groundwater irrigation since the start of reforms in 1980s. These findings have important policy implications for commons governance in China given that massive rural to urban migration will continue in the next decade. Because of the increasing rural to urban migration worldwide especially in developing countries, the findings could also partly explain the deteriorating state of rural village infrastructure, natural common pool resources and ecological systems in many developing countries.

Using a difference-in-differences approach, in each of two data sets statistically and economically significant employment impacts are observed. Most of the evidence suggests that the 2-2.4 weeks of increased employment resulted from an aggregate reduction in those not in the labour force, with at most a modest change in the unemployment rate. Many estimated effects are larger for men than for women. Notably, strong evidence of displacement (substitution away from slightly older non-subsidized workers) is not observed.

In addition to providing accurate measures of loss probabilities and credit risk, our models can also be used to analyze and compare risk management practices and the drivers of delinquency across banks. We find substantial heterogeneity in risk factors, sensitivities, and predictability of delinquency across banks, implying that no single model applies to all six institutions. We measure the efficacy of a bank's risk management process by the percentage of delinquent accounts that a bank manages effectively, and find that efficacy also varies widely across institutions. These results suggest the need for a more customized approached to the supervision and regulation of financial institutions, in which capital ratios, loss reserves, and other parameters are specified individually for each institution according to its credit risk model exposures and forecasts.

These firms also issued more long-term debt during the MEP and expanded employment and investment. There is also evidence of reach for yield behavior, as the demand for riskier corporate debt also increased.

The irony of our times is that as our economies become more and more service driven, we are producing, transporting, and consuming more resource-and energy-intensive material goods than ever before in ever more innovative ways. And herein lies the motivation for policy. Innovation can increase welfare, but only within socio-political environments that can respond creatively to its dual nature. Innovating is usually very hard to do, but sustaining human welfare through innovation is always even harder. Thus, for policy makers, the point is not just to increase the incidence of innovation but also to use it to leverage positive social outcomes. I propose that deploying innovation as a strategy for mitigating threats to the environment will demand that we get to grips with it from this perspective. Democracy is a public conversation about innovation, and in the Canadian case, achieving sustainability goals will be impossible unless public institutions are rehabilitated as agents of innovation.","[Hawkins, Richard] Univ Calgary, Dept Commun Media & Film, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of Calgary,"Hawkins, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Commun Media & Film, Calgary, AB, Canada.",,,,,,,,58,1,1,0,6,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

The author builds a model in which heterogeneous firms choose different locations to produce output, while employ local or send home managers from headquarters to provide post-production services. The model shows that the equilibrium decision of a firm depends on its own productivity level and the mobility of transferring home managers across borders. Using Korean firm- and affiliate-level data, empirical results show that firms choose production locations based on their productivity levels and transport costs, while firms' choice of service managers depend on informal trade barriers across borders. These findings are consistent with the theoretical implications.","[Lee, Seungrae] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, 80 Daehak Ro, Daegu 41566, South Korea",Kyungpook National University,"Lee, S (通讯作者)，Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, 80 Daehak Ro, Daegu 41566, South Korea.",srlee_eco@knu.ac.kr,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

In particular, the localities of Suzhou, Wenzhou, and Dongguan each achieved dramatic economic growth during the first three decades of reform, earning them national reputations as developmental models for other cities in China to recognize and emulate. However, the local states of Suzhou, Wenzhou, and Dongguan responded differentially to changing conditions in the broader domestic and global economy; and the global financial crisis at the end of the 2000s affected the three localities with varying levels of severity. This article thus seeks to explain why previously well-performing developmental models diverged in their performance and capacity to recover from a major economic shock. Drawing on national economic census data, in-depth field interviews, and relevant secondary literature, we argue that variation in the institutional adaptability of Suzhou, Wenzhou, and Dongguan throughout the course of their developmental experiences had a defining effect on how these cities fared during the financial crisis. The process-tracing case studies reveal that a locality's ability to adjust to changing market conditions may be conditioned by structural endowments, but ultimately hinges on agent-centric factors, including motivated and capable local leadership, openness to new policy ideas, and state capacity for policy implementation. Ultimately, our analysis makes the broader observation that in a dynamic environment, factors that promote economic success at one point can become barriers later on. Hence, exploring a region's institutional adaptability and identifying the factors that facilitate or impede such adaptability in local economic governance provides a more nuanced means for understanding a locality's evolving developmental patterns and performance-during normal times, as well as more challenging periods.

Hofstede has demonstrated in his research the importance of culture in determining human relations in the workplace. People can comply with both organizational rules and cultural norms, but truly give priority to the latter. Differences between organizational rules may appear depending on the organizations' activity or depending on the employees' professions. These differences between industries and professions remain little explored in literature. As a result, the article presents Hofstede's model of the first five dimensions of national culture in the Romanian service industry (individualism/collectivism, power distance, long/short term orientation, masculinity/femininity and uncertainty avoidance), by comparing the results obtained in two different domains: the hotel industry and the consultancy services industry. The findings are interesting, as they reflect employees' work values in two sectors of the service industry. Furthermore, the article discusses whether the national culture has a direct impact on the culture developed in a specific activity sector. Also, the article debates if the organizational culture is more powerful than the national culture by comparing the values obtained at national level and the values obtained at organizational level through Hofstede's model. Another objective of the research is to point out the differences in cultural dimensions between the workers from the hotel industry and workers from the consultancy services industry. The implications of the conclusions are discussed, considering the limitations of the empirical study presented and the future research directions.","[Vranceanu, Carmen Andreea; Iorgulescu, Maria-Cristina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Iorgulescu, MC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",cristina.iorgulescu@com.ase.ro,"Iorgulescu, Maria-Cristina/L-7737-2015","Iorgulescu, Maria-Cristina/0000-0003-4957-3590",,,,,19,8,8,0,18,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2016,18.0,,,,10,,875,884,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ED1SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388624700011,0

Recently, clustering of stations has emerged as a strategy to encourage consumers to purchase AFVs by building a critical mass of stations. Clustering approaches, however, have focused on serving demands represented as nodes or arcs rather than origin destination (O-D) trips. This study proposes a Threshold Coverage extension to the original Flow Refueling Location Model that focuses on the percentage of a zone's O-D trips that can be successfully completed given a typical driving range and location of stations. It is motivated by the idea that drivers in an area will not purchase an AFV unless a critical mass of the trips they regularly make can be completed. Therefore, the new model optimally locates p refueling stations on a network to maximize the sum of weighted demand of covered origin zones, where covered means that the zone exceeds a specified threshold percentage of their total outbound round trips that are refuelable. The model is tested on networks for Orlando and the state of Florida, As the threshold percentage is raised, fewer zones can surpass the threshold. Covered nodes increasingly cluster together, as do stations for serving their O-D flows. The model's policy implementation will provide managerial insights for some key concerns of the industry, such as geographic equity vs. critical mass, from a new perspective. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Overall, these results are consistent with higher firing costs crowding out financial leverage via increasing financial distress costs.","[Serfling, Matthew] Univ Tennessee, Dept Finance, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Serfling, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Dept Finance, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",,,,,,,,74,223,255,21,166,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

EVIDENCE FROM NIGERIA,DEVELOPING ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Mother's education; Child health; Quality of education; Threshold,HEIGHT,"The literature on mother's education and child health casually observes some nonlinearities and also a threshold in the relationship. Even though this nonlinearity or threshold has significant bearing on policy matters such as quality of education, any rigorous attempt to address this issue is missing in the literature. With height for age z-score as a proxy for long-run child health capital, regression results reveal that there are significant effects of mother's education on child health if mothers do not continue past primary school. Rather, poor quality of education at the primary level, especially literacy, is argued to have given rise to this threshold. It indicates that greater public investment in improving quality of education at the primary level is essential for maximizing the nonmarket outcomes of girls' education in developing countries.","[Ahmed, Meherun] Asian Univ Women, Dept Polit Philosophy & Econ, Chittagong, Bangladesh; [Iqbal, Kazi] Bangladesh Inst Dev Studies, E-17 Agargaon, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh",Asian University for Women; Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS),"Iqbal, K (通讯作者)，Bangladesh Inst Dev Studies, E-17 Agargaon, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh.",kiqbal@bids.org.bd,"Iqbal, Kazi/ABB-9409-2020","Iqbal, Kazi/0000-0001-8161-4079",,,,,17,3,4,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

We sought to develop a mechanistic account of how men and women differ in their decision-making strategies. We examined gender differences in performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; Experiment 1) as well as the Soochow Gambling Task (SGT; Experiment 2). Expectancy valence and prospect valence learning computational models were fit to the data for both tasks to assess specific strategies that men and women utilized during the decision-making process. Our results replicated the behavioral gender difference finding on the IGT. Women selected the disadvantageous Deck B more than did men. We extended these findings to the SGT. Modeling results revealed that women's data were best fit by higher recency, or learning rate, parameter values than were men's data in the IGT and SGT. This suggests that women gave greater weight to recent events than did men and that they tended to ignore large, infrequent losses in both experiments. Overall, our results suggest that the mechanism accounting for how men and women differ in reward-based decision-making is that women tend to focus on the relative frequency of gains and losses and attend to recent reward outcomes, whereas men focus more on the extreme gains and losses associated with each alternative and attend to long-term decision outcomes. Implications for these gender differences in reward-based decision-making strategies are discussed.","[Byrne, Kaileigh A.; Worthy, Darrell A.] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Worthy, DA (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Psychol, Inst Neurosci, 4235 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77845 USA.",worthyda@tamu.edu,,"Worthy, Darrell/0000-0001-5134-9745",,,,,30,22,25,3,15,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

The results show that both individual and institutional investors trade more overconfidently in high market return regimes than in low, which corresponds to the finding that the return volatility is also higher in high market return regimes compared to low regimes. Conditional on the market state, market volatility, and market liquidity, it is believed that both individual and institutional investors exhibit more pronounced overconfident trading behavior when the market is up, less volatile, and more liquid across market return regimes. Finally, we obtain consistent evidence that individual investors trade with more overconfidence than institutional investors in these market conditions during high market return regimes, indicating that individual investors are more overconfident traders than institutional investors.

Second, we show that a non-financial firm-owned bank's risk appetite also increases as its number of family business group-owned borrowing partners increases. Finally, we show that a bank is more likely to reduce its risk appetite and improve its operational cost efficiency as its foreign ownership ratio increases, regardless of the bank's lending partner.

This paper investigates the significance of the mix of monetary and fiscal policies for financial stability through counterfactual simulations of three key historical episodes, using the Bank's main policy model, ToTEM (Terms-of-Trade Economic Model). The paper finds that there is an intimate relationship between the monetary/fiscal policy mix and the dynamics of both private sector and public sector debt accumulation. No attempt is made to develop criteria for policy mix optimization, since it is clear from the model simulations that the appropriate policy mix is highly state-dependent. This finding points to the need for a coherent framework for weighing the relative financial and macroeconomic consequences of accumulating public sector versus private sector debt. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that there are potential benefits to ex ante monetary/fiscal policy coordination, and that Canada's policy framework where the monetary and fiscal authorities jointly agree on an inflation target while enshrining central bank operational independence represents an elegant coordinating mechanism.","[Poloz, Stephen S.] Banque Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada",,"Poloz, SS (通讯作者)，Banque Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,11,0,0,1,7,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

The predictability in returns is inversely related to interest rate risk but positively related to default risk. The return predictability is more sensitive to fluctuations in the economic business cycle rather than changes in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Returns on portfolios of Treasury bonds are more predictable during the restrictive monetary policy regime, whereas returns on both Treasury bonds and corporate bonds exhibit much better predictability during the economic expansions rather than recessions. The predictability of returns in various segments of the U.S. bond market has declined over time. Findings for the predictability in the highly liquid bond exchange-traded funds are largely in line with the original results of the predictability in bond portfolio returns. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, while corruption is said to obstruct the implementation of conservation policies, for instance as bribery may enable poaching in protected reserves, it is an underexplored area of research. This study investigates the effect of corruption, others' compliance behavior, and support for regulations on rule-violating intentions. In a between-subjects experiment, a sample of resource users active in South African small-scale fisheries (N = 201) answered questions about rule-violating intentions after reading one of four scenarios, each depicting a different situation of corruption among officials that enforce regulations and compliance behavior of other resource users. The results show that resource users are more likely to state rule-violating intentions when corruption among inspectors is widespread. Moreover, the study provides further theoretical insights into the process in which corruption perceptions deter the willingness to follow rules: there is an interaction effect with support for conservation regulations, suggesting that the effect of corruption is stronger among individuals who are less supportive of such rules. These findings lend further support for the proposition that to improve the effectiveness of conservation policy, more effort is needed to reduce bribery among government officials, such as rangers and inspectors that enforce natural resource regulations.","[Sundstrom, Aksel] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Sundström, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.",,"Sundström, Aksel/AAE-8047-2021",,,,,,96,17,19,0,55,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0305-750X,,,WORLD DEV,World Dev.,SEP,2016,85.0,,,,,,73,83,,10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.04.011,0.0,,,11,Development Studies; Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Development Studies; Business & Economics,DP7FT,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378665300006,0

Risk tolerant savers act as intermediaries between risk averse depositors and impatient borrowers. Both borrowers and intermediaries can default. The government provides both mortgage guarantees and deposit insurance. Underpriced government mortgage guarantees lead to more and riskier mortgage originations and higher financial sector leverage. Mortgage crises occasionally turn into financial crises and government bailouts due to the fragility of the intermediaries' balance sheets. Foreclosure crises beget fiscal uncertainty, further disrupting the optimal allocation of risk in the economy. Increasing the price of the mortgage guarantee crowds in the private sector, reduces financial fragility, leads to fewer but safer mortgages, lowers house prices, and raises mortgage and risk-free interest rates. Due to a more robust financial sector and less fiscal uncertainty, consumption smoothing improves and foreclosure rates fall. While borrowers are nearly indifferent to a world with or without mortgage guarantees, savers are substantially better off. While aggregate welfare increases, so does wealth inequality.

Theory offers competing hypotheses on how listing-related frictions affect investment decisions. We use detailed data on 74,670 individual projects in the U.S. natural gas industry to show that private firms respond less than public firms to changes in investment opportunities. Private firms adjust drilling activity for low capital-intensity investments. However, they do not increase drilling in response to new capital-intensive growth opportunities. Instead, they sell these projects to public firms.

The article uses an Implicit Association Test (IAT) and Likert scales to gauge implicit and explicit attitudes towards sustainable consumption in a real consumer sample, and measures demographic characteristics of participants. Results indicate that level of education is a key predictor of an aggregate measure of sustainable consumption, with a small part of this influence mediated by level of explicit environmental concern for climate change. Econometric modelling shows that explicit and implicit attitudes influence consumer decisions differently in specific food categories. Results, obtained with real consumer data, call into question the accepted sociodemographic profile of the green consumer and help identify conditions under which pro-environmental attitudes predict sustainable consumption.

This paper assesses the ex-post performance of two popular targeting mechanisms, Proxy Means Testing (PMT) and Community-Based Targeting (CBT), in a pilot cash transfer program in Cameroon. Several indicators and metrics to measure each method's performance in terms of inclusion of poor households and exclusion of non-poor households are employed. Results consistently show that CBT performs poorly in terms of selecting households with low per capita consumption when compared to PMT. CBT appears to select households with low physical and human capital, regardless of actual consumption level. However, CBT also shows more variability in the selection decision than PMT even when alternative poverty definitions are used as robustness tests. The PMT method used in the pilot slightly outperforms other targeting methods (hybrid, alternative PMT, and universal targeting with equal budget), but errors remain high when selecting 35% of the population for program participation. The results suggest caution is needed in employing CBT methods to select households with low per capita consumption in an environment where poverty levels are high and administrative capacities are limited. CBT performance may be improved through more uniform and consistent guidance on program selection criteria and process, including explicit criteria that enable CBT monitoring, as well as a better integration between PMT and CBT.

This has also been highlighted in previous literatures. In contrary, our previous study found no association between weather and transit ridership while investigating the underlying temporal influences behind variation in daily ridership across the sub-tropical city of Brisbane, Australia. This contraindication led to the primary focus of this research. This research acknowledged that Inclusion of weather variables in conjunction with other relatively strong independent variables might result in washout of the weather effects on ridership. Variables such as rainfall do not recur on a daily basis throughout the year. Thus, generalising their effect on ridership with other independent variables that consistently influence ridership may create a similar problem. Hence, weather variables were converted into their normalised factors and combined with other independent variables while formulated the optimised the daily ridership rate estimation model. Several models were developed concerning various combinations of weather variables and through rigorous analysis it was identified that only the rain variable has noticeable effect on daily ridership. Evidently, this study functions as an update of our former study by directing towards a new approach to the analysis of the relationship between weather and transit ridership. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although there have been many studies conducted that have measured access levels to public transport stops/stations, there has been limited research on measuring accessibility that integrates population density within geographical areas. This study develops a new measure that considers public transport service frequency and population density as an important distributional indicator. A public transport accessibility index (PTAI) is formulated for quantifying accessibility within local areas in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. A public transport network model is applied to identify the service coverage of public transport modes using a Geographical Information System (GIS). A consistent method is introduced for evaluating public transport accessibility for different levels of analysis, from single elements, including public mode stops to network analysis. The Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel and Activity (VISTA) is used to evaluate the index and examine the association between commuting trips undertaken by public transport and the level of accessibility within the Melbourne metropolitan region. Furthermore, the new index is compared with two existing approaches using the VISTA dataset. Key findings indicate that the PTAI had a stronger association whilst showing more use of public transport in areas with higher values of the PTAI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Various studies have examined charter schools' impacts on test scores, and a few have begun to examine longer-term outcomes including graduation and college attendance. This paper is the first to estimate charter schools' effects on earnings in adulthood, alongside effects on educational attainment. Using data from Florida, we first confirm previous research (Booker etal., ) that students attending charter high schools are more likely to graduate from high school and enroll in college. We then examine two longer-term outcomes not previously studied in research on charter schoolscollege persistence and earnings. We find that students attending charter high schools are more likely to persist in college, and that in their mid-20s they experience higher earnings.","[Sass, Tim R.] Georgia State Univ, 14 Marietta St NW, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Zimmer, Ron W.] Vanderbilt Univ, Publ Policy & Educ, 230 Appleton Pl, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Gill, Brian P.] Math Policy Res, 955 Massachusetts Ave,Suite 801, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Booker, T.

In this paper, we take 1 of the most popular of such mechanisms, the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) procedure, and study the nature of the dependence of the valuations obtained using the BDM procedure on the distribution of prices presented to subjects when the method is implemented. In a within-subject design with products with a high market value, we show that this effect of price distribution occurs quite frequently, significantly impacts reported valuations, and is unlikely to be caused by misconceptions about the BDM procedure. This effect is largest when pricing distributions show a large peak close to an individual's average valuation of the good. A simple nonincentive-compatible subjective rating of the desirability of goods can be used to predict the likelihood that pricing distributions will influence BDM valuations; valuations for goods that subjects report to most want to purchase are most likely to be influenced by distributional structure. Our results challenge some of the dominant theoretical models of how BDM-like valuation procedures relate to standard notions of utility and shed light on how to interpret the data obtained using the BDM method.","[Tymula, Agnieszka] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Room 370,Merewether Bldg H04, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Woelbert, Eva] Maastricht Univ, Dept Cognit Neurosci, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Woelbert, Eva] Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Glimcher, Paul] NYU, Ctr Neuroecon, New York, NY 10003 USA",University of Sydney; Maastricht University; Maastricht University; New York University,"Tymula, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Room 370,Merewether Bldg H04, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",agnieszka.tymula@sydney.edu.au,,"Glimcher, Paul/0000-0001-7872-3856; Tymula, Agnieszka/0000-0002-0521-8477",AXA Research Fund,AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund),Agnieszka Tymula gratefully acknowledges financial support from the AXA Research Fund.,,26,6,7,1,16,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

Some commuters show unusual commuting behaviours, so-called extreme commuting, which is defined as spending more than 100 min commuting a day. This paper aims to explain these commuting patterns from the point of view of the extreme commuters themselves. Based on a qualitative survey conducted in three European regions - Lyon, Brussels and Geneva - among individuals that spend at least two hours a day commuting, this study shows that extreme commuting is determined by complex interplay between the individual's working and private life and issues related to travel. Among our sample, the choice of public transportation modes assisted long-duration commuting. Our results also highlight the paradox that rapid transportation networks are used intensively to allow people to remain rooted both residentially and socially. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing inspiration from an ancient critique of neoclassicism by Veblen (Q J Econ 12(4):373-397, 1898), this paper attributes the difficulty to the tension between normative accounts of decision making (as in mainstream theory) and ideas of causation that are standard in the sciences. Normative theories naturally privilege the conjectured future over the experienced past in the quest for explanatory factors. Evolutionary theories elucidate instead the mechanisms of cumulative causation (Veblen) that perpetually produce the present from the past. Entrepreneurship of the innovative (Schumpeterian) kind seizes opportunities that emerge in complex, evolving contexts of technological and institutional change. A theory that gives due weight to cumulative causation sheds greater light on these processes than prevailing mainstream theory can, and that is a key advantage of an evolutionary theory.","[Winter, Sidney G.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Management, 2000 SH DH,3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Winter, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Management, 2000 SH DH,3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",winter@wharton.upenn.edu,"Winter, Sidney/GXG-2470-2022",,"Mack Institute for Innovation Management at The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania","Mack Institute for Innovation Management at The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania","I have benefitted from the helpful comments of Ashish Arora, Richard Nelson, Paul Nightingale, Alice Rivlin, Alex Rosenberg, strategy seminar participants at Duke University, and the editor.

This paper provides a simple identifying restriction, based on inventory dynamics, that tightly pins down this contribution. Structural models predict that finished-good inventories should fall when there is an increase in consumption and investment induced by news shocks. A structural VAR with these sign restrictions indicates that news shocks account for at most 20 percent of output volatility.

In doing so, we utilize the asymmetric cointegration methods proposed by Breitung (2001, 2002) and Enders and Siklos (2001). Furthermore, we tend to explore two additional dimensions in this literature. First, whether asymmetries (if any) are persistent over-time in the credit demand model. Second, whether the Great recession contributed to any asymmetric impacts on the credit demand. Our results revealed that the long-run relationship of consumer credit (credit, income, wealth and interest rate on personal loans) is asymmetric. While it is difficult to identify the direct sources of this asymmetric result, our intuition is that it is linked to the structural breaks in the rate of personal loans encountered in the early 1980s. Moreover, we find no strong evidence that much of the asymmetric impacts in consumer credit were experienced in the Great recession. Neither have we attained evidence that asymmetric impacts on credit demand are persistent over-time.","[Kumar, Saten] Auckland Univ Technol, Auckland, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,"Kumar, S (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Auckland, New Zealand.",,,,,,,,82,0,0,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

This paper analyzes banking entrepreneurship financing to micro-enterprises (less than 10 employees) in Spain during the period 2003-2012, but only Mutual Guarantee Institution guaranteed enterprises, to determinate if financing products have changed. The analysis concludes that the financial products distribution has changed during the crisis (2008-2012), it has increased the weight of the products designed to liquidity, and the crisis effects are higher for smaller and older companies.

The paper asks if a new paradigm for development cooperation is emerging, and argues that we must move beyond the simplistic narratives of either South-South collaboration or neo-imperial expansion of rising powers to look at the dynamic and contested politics of engagement, as new forms of capital and technology enter African contexts. Historical experiences in Brazil and China, as well as domestic political and economic debates, affect how interventions are framed, and by whom, and so influence what technologies are chosen, which investments are funded, and who gets trained. There are both political and economic drivers at the heart of these choices, but these are not uniform or uncontested, either in Brazil and China or in Africa. The Special Section argues for a focus on the encounters on the ground, moving beyond the broader rhetoric and generic policy statements. A key feature of Brazilian and Chinese engagements in African agriculture is the role of state business relations in shaping and steering development, suggesting new forms of developmental ism. The paper concludes that there is a growing opportunity for learning from the Brazilian and Chinese experience, as this will be a long-run feature of African agricultural development.

It presents a theoretical framework and literature review focused on the question of food sovereignty, the state and agrarian political economy. The case study of Ecuador, one of a handful of countries that has attempted to institutionalize food sovereignty in state policy, examines the political processes that led to the institutionalization of food sovereignty and the rural development and agricultural policies of the post-neoliberal' government of Rafael Correa. The analysis of the Ecuadorian case concludes that the implementation of public policies reflecting food sovereignty principles has largely proven elusive, with the exception of some institutional changes and developments at the local levels of the state.","[Clark, Patrick] Carleton Univ, Polit Sci, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Clark, Patrick] Fac Latinoamer Ciencias Socials FLACSO Ecuador De, Quito 171106362, Pichincha, Ecuador",Carleton University,"Clark, P (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Polit Sci, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.;Clark, P (通讯作者)，Fac Latinoamer Ciencias Socials FLACSO Ecuador De, Quito 171106362, Pichincha, Ecuador.",patrick_clark@carleton.ca,,,,,,,92,39,46,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We test this hypothesis against an alternative that bonuses enable a useful contractual revision in compensation contracts when takeovers generate small synergies. When target CEOs get a merger bonus, acquirers pay lower premiums, but they also typically get less in the form of low synergies. Moreover, both stock and accounting returns to the acquirers are lower on average in deals with target CEO bonuses. These results support the contractual revision alternative. Nevertheless, wealth transfer occurs when merger bonuses are present in deals where targets exhibit high pre-takeover abnormal accruals or are subject to SEC enforcement actions.

Against the influential theory of Robert Brenner, it is argued that the period c.1200-c.1400 cannot really be categorized as feudal' according to Brenner's definition; and agrarian capitalism' does not adequately describe the socio-economic system that obtained by the end of the sixteenth century. A genuine transition to capitalism is only evident from after c.1750, and can be found in Germany as well as in England; it is predicated both on ideological shifts and on the evolution of the rural proletariat, which is only found in large numbers by or after c.1800.","[Ghosh, Shami] Pontifical Inst Mediaeval Studies, 59 Queens Pk Crescent East, Toronto, ON M5S 2C4, Canada",University of Toronto,"Ghosh, S (通讯作者)，Pontifical Inst Mediaeval Studies, 59 Queens Pk Crescent East, Toronto, ON M5S 2C4, Canada.",shami.ghosh@utoronto.ca,,"Ghosh, Shami/0000-0002-7609-6139","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (Government of Canada); University of Leicester; Magdalen College, Oxford","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (Government of Canada)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); University of Leicester; Magdalen College, Oxford","I am grateful to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (Government of Canada), the University of Leicester, and Magdalen College, Oxford, for supporting the postdoctoral fellowships that enabled me to produce the present paper.

These options exhibit sensitivity to the volatility of the underlying assets, as well as to their correlations. The call versus call is a product commonly used to trade correlation within the inter-dealer broker markets. The buyer of correlation buys a European call on the equally weighted basket option and sells a weighted average of European calls on each asset. In this case, the following important question arises: Is the information provided by equally weighted basket options enough to price other European multi-asset exotic derivatives such as worst-of or outperformance options? This article investigates this issue under a stochastic correlation framework. Importantly, this article shows that, when pricing multi-asset exotic derivatives, matching the prices of European equally weighted basket options, quoted in the market, does not guaranty the absence of model risk even in the case where the exotic payoff is observed only at maturity.","[Marabel Romo, Jacinto] BBVA, Calle Sauceda 28, Madrid 28050, Spain",,"Romo, JM (通讯作者)，BBVA, Calle Sauceda 28, Madrid 28050, Spain.",jacinto.marabel@bbva.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

The reduction of India's trading partners' 'implicit beyond the border' constraints such as weak infrastructure and institutions significantly contributed toward India's exports of EG, especially during the period 2005-2010.","[Van Son Nguyen] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business & Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Kalirajan, Kaliappa] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Monash University; Australian National University,"Nguyen, VS (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business & Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia.;Kalirajan, K (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",son.nguyen@monash.edu; kaliappa.kalirajan@anu.edu.au,"Kalirajan, Kaliappa/X-5293-2019",,,,,,31,9,9,2,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

However, most are reluctant to relinquish monetary policy autonomy, so they end up operating through both interest rate and foreign exchange interventions. But the use of multiple policy instruments does not necessarily equip monetary authorities with better tools to achieve their targets. On the contrary, their effects can potentially offset each other. Using daily data from the Central Bank of Colombia during the period of 1999-2012, I study the effects of simultaneous policies by first deriving new measures of monetary shocks and then determining their impact on economic activity. The main findings indicate that (a) while interest rate interventions have a significant impact on real and nominal variables, foreign exchange interventions tend to have limited effects; and (b) empirical anomalies, such as the positive relationship between output growth, inflation, and the policy rate are eliminated when properly accounting for the systematic responses of policy.

We hypothesize that as variations in marginal productivity in an industry falls, the relative importance of input factor price variations on unit production costs increases. For maturing commodity industries, price trends will go from productivity driven to input-factor price driven. Our empirical results indicate that the correlation between salmon price and feed input-factor prices (fishmeal, soybean meal and wheat) has increased in recent years. Consistent with a period of increased importance of feed costs to developments in salmon production costs, we find evidence of an emergent protein cointegration relationship between salmon, fishmeal and soybean prices.

The results show that where the financial accelerator exists, capital inflow in response to a foreign interest rate shock ultimately results in intersectoral resource transfer that is favorable to the nontradable sector under different monetary policies; the magnitude of the expansion in the nontradable sector being greater under a higher degree of financial openness. The study also finds that, in comparison to CPI inflation targeting, nontradable inflation targeting is better at mitigating resource transfers toward production of nontradables, and at reducing and stabilizing both nontradable inflation and CPI inflation. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the financial accelerator mechanism matters for the effectiveness of monetary policy in addressing dynamics pertinent to the Dutch disease phenomenon, such that CPI inflation targeting is only effective in such a scenario where the financial accelerator is non-existent, and that nontradable inflation targeting operates more effectively in the absence of the financial accelerator as well.

It has been argued that, in contrast to collectivism, individualism will promote economic development directly by sharpening individual incentives to invest, innovate and accumulate wealth. In this article, I argue that the individualist collectivist dimension can also affect development through its impact on the quality of government. The in-group favoritism inherent to collectivist societies is likely to engender corruption, nepotism and clientelism in the public sphere. In individualist societies, the relative weakness of in-group pressures and an emphasis on personal achievement and worth will contribute towards a more meritocratic and efficient public sector to the benefit of long-run growth.

However, we find evidence that tax lien sales fail to produce a behavioral response under adverse housing market conditions.","[Miller, Joshua J.] Dept Housing & Urban Dev, Off Policy Dev & Res, Washington, DC USA; [Nikaj, Silda] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA",Texas Christian University,"Miller, JJ (通讯作者)，Dept Housing & Urban Dev, Off Policy Dev & Res, Washington, DC USA.;Nikaj, S (通讯作者)，Texas Christian Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA.",joshua.j.miller@hud.gov; s.nikaj@tcu.edu,,"Miller, Joshua/0000-0002-3308-7777",,,,,38,3,5,1,4,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

We thus resort to a novel time-frequency approach, namely the continuous wavelet transform, and we analyze the co-movements of the stock index returns at different frequency-scales. We also test the influence of different macroeconomic factors on stock markets co-movements at different time-frequencies. The wavelet analysis results show that, in the short-run, the correlation level is high only during financial distress episodes, while in the long-run, the co-movements are present for the entire analyzed horizon. In addition, at low-frequency levels, the PIIGS stock markets are more correlated with Germany than with the UK An opposite result is obtained at high-frequency decomposition levels. We also discover that the stock markets' correlation does not increase after all crisis events and depends on the wavelet decomposition levels.

Using a survey of 4,795 household-plots in rural Ethiopia, the study demonstrates the inappropriateness of pooling different forms of land conservation investments in preference studies. The results suggest that poverty drives farm-households towards conservation measures which are more short term and which entail the expenditure of less skill. While tenure security has a mixed effect on such preferences, market access seems not to matter for preference decisions. Further, farm-households consider the characteristics of the plot in their preference, which also vary across villages. This study shows that a farm-household's preference is a complex decision. Major changes in conservation investments on the part of farm-households will require attention to many factors, since no single factor exerts enough control to be used solitarily as a major policy leverage instrument.","[Bekele, Worku Genanew] Univ Dubai, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Schneider, Friedrich Georg] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Dept Econ, Linz, Austria",University of Dubai; Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Bekele, WG (通讯作者)，Univ Dubai, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, POB 14143, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",gbekele@ud.ac.ae; friedrich.schneider@jku.at,,,,,,,24,0,1,1,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

More developed countries exhibit greater transparency, past episodes of high financial instability have a negative effect on transparency and the legal origin matters, too.

We utilize individual-level data from the 2012 Flash Eurobarometer survey collected in 21 countries (total N = 13,963 individuals) and culture-level data from the GLOBE project. Our results from multi-level regression analyses show similar curvilinear lifespan patterns in both desirability and feasibility beliefs, with a peak in young adulthood and a strong decline toward late adulthood. This general pattern of age differences in these motivational factors, however, differs significantly across cultural dimensions of uncertainty avoidance, institutional collectivism and performance orientation. Notwithstanding the limitations of cross-sectional data, the present results indicate that individual factors motivating self-employment are systematically intertwined with, and embedded in, both age and culture.

Main results highlight the increase of trans-Maghreb maritime connectivity but this occurs mostly at the periphery of the system based on transit flows.

This paper evaluates empirically Japan's two large-scale capital injections in 1998 and 1999. We begin by extracting the treatment effects of the public injections from bank-level panel data. Using a difference-in-difference estimator in two-way fixed-effects regression models, we find that the public injections significantly reduced the financial risks faced by the capital-injected banks but did not stimulate their lending or profitability. Next, we investigate what factors impeded bank lending after the public injections. using a matched sample of Japanese banks and their borrowers. By employing three-way fixed-effects regression models corresponding to the matched sample, we provide evidence that the deterioration of borrowers' creditworthiness inhibited not only the injected banks but also the noninjected banks from lending more.

The so-called Arab Springs have generally been motivated by the growing gap between young adults' aspirations to climb up the social ladder and the dearth of socioeconomic opportunities consecutive to the slow pace of structural change featured by the economies of the region. The present paper argues that this slow pace of structural change, measured by export sophistication and diversification, may well be the consequence of the authoritarian-redistributive social contracts that were established after the Independence and were subsequently only marginally reformed. MENA social contracts are generally described as political bargains by which socioeconomic security, based on high levels of redistribution and state control of the economy, were traded against the absence of political freedom. We show in this paper that although redistribution and political authoritarianism have an impact on structural change, by their own, their combination certainly explains the deficit of structural transformation of MENA economies. More specifically, we provide cross-sectional and dynamic-panel evidence that the positive impact of redistribution on structural change, measured by export diversification and sophistication, vanishes for the very high levels of authoritarianism characterizing the MENA region. Our results hold for different specifications of the estimated equations and of the social contract variable, as well as when endogeneity issues are addressed. The paper finally describes the political economy that sustained, over the last three decades, this combination of political authoritarianism and slow productive diversification and sophistication throughout the region, before explaining how these features could well have inhibited the political capacities and willingness of most MENA incumbent regimes to reform the social contract in a radical and timely manner.

The general context of KIBS is being presented through a literature research, including the KIBS framework in the sectors of energy efficiency, energy audit, energy management and related areas. As being top actual, this specific topic was sofar not researched yet, the article covers the identified gap in literature. The methodology used is a qualitative research focused on KIBS in the context of the changing German energy system - several experts were interviewed including academic and industry experts preparing for the German Energy Efficiency Summit (managed by the first author). Their feedback was further analyzed using the causal correlation model. Based on the key finding that KIBS could belong to the winning sectors, the first author is in process of creating a new innovative business model for KIBS in the sector of energy services.","[Weber, Gregor; Mateescu, Ruxandra Maria; Lange, Steffen; Rauch, Manfred] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Weber, Gregor] Renervis Consulting, Kaiserslautern, Germany",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Weber, G (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.;Weber, G (通讯作者)，Renervis Consulting, Kaiserslautern, Germany.",weber@renervis.com,,,,,,,36,5,5,0,15,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2016,18.0,41,,,,,89,103,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DF9WN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371713100007,0

Design/methodology/approach - A model was developed and tested using survey methodology based on three well-validated research instruments. Data were analyzed using the partial least square approach. Findings - The results showed that different marketing practice were coupled with different frame of reference, as well as different BS. These forces were found to be inter related, and internally coherent, resulting in viable configurational profiles. Research limitations/implications - The research is unique and exploratory, and was conducted in three Arabic countries with a small sample size. For these reasons, generalizability is somewhat constrained. Practical implications - The findings would help managers to carefully examine the internal logic of their marketing-related profiling; it can be used as an assessment tool, where performance should be enhanced if the variables are coherent. Originality/value - To author's knowledge this is the first study that inspect three variables that had been associated with decision making, but not integrated together in a holistic framework to explain marketing diversity. Additionally it identified four viable types of marketing practices with its corresponding frame of reference and BS. Therefore, the paper reports a work in an area not previously researched.","[Abu Farha, Allam] Qatar Univ, Doha, Qatar",Qatar University,"Abu Farha, A (通讯作者)，Qatar Univ, Doha, Qatar.",afarha@qu.edu.qa,,"Abu Farha, Allam/0000-0002-0093-5338",,,,,53,4,6,0,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

This paper investigates the effect of remittances on the use of formal and informal financial services using Mexican household data and finds positive and statistically significant effects of remittances on the ownership of savings accounts, the existence of debts, and on recent borrowing. The fact that the effect of remittances on borrowing is driven by informal finance rather than by traditional bank loans points to deficiencies of the formal financial sector in addressing the financial needs of remittance-receiving households. We address methodological concerns of selection bias and reverse causality through household fixed effects and an instrumental strategy that exploits distance to train lines and labor market conditions in the US as exogenous determinants of remittances.

Methodology/methods A questionnaire was sent to 2590 Spanish firms related to exporting. Responses were analyzed through a dimensionality reduction procedure (from a list of individual obstacles) to yield seven composite factors: knowledge barriers, exogenous barriers, cultural barriers, private support and logistics barriers, customs barriers, resources-based barriers, and market adaptation barriers. Scientific aim Since there is neither a homogeneous number of existing barriers and types nor a uniform criterion of relative importance, typology and scales to embrace them, we contribute to shed light on the relative importance attributed to the different export barriers and how they vary as a function of the company's export destination, proposing a new scale. Findings The proposed model was finally accepted and interesting findings were achieved regarding the differences in the export barriers faced by firms in the different destination territories. Findings such as transportation costs being the lowest perceived trade barrier in Latin America or tariff barriers scoring similar in Latin America than in Europe (while being a European Custom Union) create a ground for new studies and discussions on international trade. Conclusions This study helps understand some aspects which have been insufficiently covered in the literature on export barriers and makes some findings which compliment the existing literature and sets new paths for future researchs. For example, the validity and relevance of the new scale, as well as the different obstacles perceived, based on the export's final market.","[Arteaga-Ortiz, Jesus; Jose Miranda-Martel, Maria] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Campus Tafira,Edificio Empresariales C-3-11, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio] Granada Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Campus Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; University of Granada,"Arteaga-Ortiz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Campus Tafira,Edificio Empresariales C-3-11, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",jesus.arteaga@ulpgc.es,"Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/N-2217-2017","Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/0000-0003-3801-9906",,,,,48,0,0,1,4,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,586,594,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200073,0

Methodology/methods Concept of an integrated economy, which the author deals with, consists of two dimensions - value dimension and interdisciplinary dimensions (qualitative). The contribution will be a description - outline the methodology of quantitative values dimension integrated economies. The main tool, enabling integration is the input output analysis. The result of the aggregation process are the economic aggregates at the internal, enterprise level, mezzoeconomics, and macroeconomic. A precondition for the creation of the first-level integration is functionality of the internal accounting system which ensures the feasibility of integration phases. For the sub-sectoral national accounts division of the delivery, depending on which industry were delivered for the manufacturing, for the sub-sectoral national accounts are broken down accordingly, from which the fields were delivered supplies for the manufacturing, for the sub-regional national accounts are broken down accordingly, from which regions were delivered supplies for the production consumption. The left side of sub-national accounts have to be in this form: a) Suitably divided productive consumption according to its origin, ie. Where it was delivered (from different sectors and from different disciplines and from different regions); b) Components production and primary distribution sub GDP and Net Product. In the next phase of the left parties so divided sub-national accounts using a special method of aggregation obtained partial right side of the national accounts. Those special method additionally brings clarity to the entire system mezzoeconomics and allows multiple control of the data obtained. Mezzoeconomics comprehensive system of information can serve as aggregation, and evaluation purposes. The only real reality across the economy as companies and their activities. The system of corporations is too large to allow it to be studied in great detail, every business has while their homelands goals and objectives. What is the hope for the fulfillment of these goals and objectives can help determine precisely the area mezzoeconomics. Most businesses are not able to determine whether the industry sector and region in which they operate is economically a perspective. Scientific aim The research on which is reported in this paper, is aimed at the development of methods to automatically integrate structural models for the lower units into an aggregate model for the whole national economy, with a feedback procedure for adapting the partial models to changes emerging from the use of the aggregate model as a tool for economic planning. For easy reference, the type of partial structural models for which the requirement of integration into an aggregated model is fulfilled, is identified here as aggregative partial model. Findings The findings can be summarized as can be expressed in the knowledge that the decisive prerequisite for integration is a customized data base in enterprises. Conclusions This paper describes the path of long-term research in the field of mezzo-economics in relation to the corporate balance - to the corporate accounting. It is part of an entire discipline, which is original and has the characteristics of interdisciplinary research extending into sociology, history of economic theories, ethics and theology.

The objective of this study is to analyze the influence of the type of employment contract, employer's status and employment conditions on the stability of employment of rural youth aged 15-19 and 20-24 years. The information base of this study is the results of the Comprehensive monitoring of the living conditions of the population of Russia conducted by Rosstat in 2014 (Comprehensive monitoring of living conditions 2014). For the purposes of our study we made a subsample consisting of 1 017 young rural people. The study is carried out by analyzing the multivariate distributions of respondents' answers with the use of the software package SPSS 17.0. It is shown that men are more likely to be employed on the basis of fixed-term employment contracts or without official registration than women. Indefinite-term employment contracts are more often preferred by employers with the status of legal entities. Employers - individuals more often provide employment under fixed-term employment contracts or without any official registration. Our findings suggest that fixed-term employment contracts, and especially employment without official registration, cause higher shares of those who are employed not as hired workers working for payment, but rather as apprentices, trainees or interns. In addition, it is shown that young people working under fixed-term contracts or without official registration are far more often employed overtime (working more than 41 hours a week and also on official holidays and weekends). We also find that the degree of mismatch between the working duties and the specialty acquired is high, especially in the 20-24 age group. Our study empirically proves the existence of some elements of instability (vulnerability) of rural youth employment depending on the type of employment contract. Our findings indicate that the influence of the type of employment contract on the employment of rural youth is different for the age groups 15-19 and 20-24 years.","[Blinova, Tatiana; Vyalshina, Anna] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Agr Problems, Saratov 410030, Russia; [Rusanovskiy, Viktor] Russian Econ Univ, Saratov Social Econ Inst, Moscow, Russia",Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Agrarian Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Plekhanov Russian University of Economics,"Blinova, T (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Inst Agr Problems, Saratov 410030, Russia.",ruandre@mail.ru; anvyal@mail.ru,"Vyalshina, Anna/V-5999-2018",,Russian Science Foundation [14-18-02801] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),,,14,1,1,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,51,58,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000006,0

Despite the ambiguity of its definition, it has become a goal of numerous political documents. Economic policies in many countries are devoted to raise their overall competitiveness. But an unclear definition of relations between different components of national competitiveness represents an obstacle to formulate effective political measures. The aim of this paper is to clarify the relation between the competitiveness of the Czech Republic and its export performance which is considered as one of ways to improve overall competitiveness. The contribution of external competitiveness to the export performance of the Czech Republic in European Union is quantified using an econometric version of Constant Market Shares analysis. The results suggest that the external competitiveness of the Czech Republic has significantly positive effects on its export performance. Moreover we conclude that the positive spillover effect from external to aggregate competitiveness could be reach via increasing productivity.","[Cekmeova, Petra] Masarykova Univ Brno, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Cekmeová, P (通讯作者)，Masarykova Univ Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.",441117@mail.muni.cz,"Chovancová, Petra/JGM-3243-2023",,,,,,43,5,5,2,11,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

This paper investigates the impact of selected labour market institutions and their interactions on the total factor productivity growth in 19 EU member states. As basis for the empirical analysis, an endogenous growth model extended by institutions is derived. As analytical tool, panel data model is applied. The analysis covers the period from 1995 to 2013. Data for total factor productivity growths were calculated using growth accounting method. The results suggest that labour market institutions really matter, in the sense that they are statistically significant in explaining the European total factor productivity growth in the analysed period.","[Cekmeova, Petra] Masaryk Univ, Dept Econ, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Cekmeová, P (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Econ, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",441117@mail.muni.cz,"Chovancová, Petra/JGM-3243-2023",,,,,,37,2,2,0,1,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Our study focus on mergers that occurred in European markets between 1997 and 2007 and our results show that the existence of these vertical cross-sectorial mergers increases, on average, the final price of electricity for household consumers on markets where it occurs. There's evidence that any household consumer in Germany pays a price for their electricity 1.8% higher after the merger between EOn and Ruhrgas. Even in Finland, where the merger was not controversial, because it involved state-owned firms, the effect on prices was equally detrimental to consumers.

We analyse in the paper, concerning the theoretical background of the foreign scientific studies on the influence of the integration processes in Europe on the realization of the cross-border mergers and acquisitions, the influence of the selected predictors on the cross-border mergers and acquisitions realized in 16 source countries and 25 target countries in the European territory from 1998 to 2012 (database data created by the authors) through the generalized linear model. Empirical results of several foreign studies (e.g. Bjortvan, 2004, Neary, 2007, Brouwer, Paap, Viaene, 2008, Coeurdacier, De Santos, Aviat, 2009 etc.) indicate that European integration had a positive impact on the development of cross-border mergers and acquisitions especially in manufacturing sector. We came to the same conclusion based on our analyses, while the integration into the EU has a critical influence, which is significantly higher in manufacturing sector. The influence of the integration into the EMU can be regarded as additional and it is identical for manufacturing sector and service. sector. We can claim definitely that the institutional changes, such as the unified market of the European Union and the European Monetary Union were releasing factors of capital reallocation all over the world. The European Monetary Union encouraged the capital reallocation through the effects of unilateral financial liberalization (a decrease of marginal and fixed costs for execution of reallocation transactions) and thus facilitated the implementation of cross-border mergers and acquisitions in the European area.","[Heckova, Jaroslava; Chapcakova, Alexandra; Litavcova, Eva] Presovska Univ, Presove, Slovakia",University of Presov,"Hecková, J; Chapcáková, A; Litavcová, E (通讯作者)，Presovska Univ, Presove, Slovakia.",jheckova@yahoo.com; chapcakova@yahoo.com; eva.litavcova@unipo.sk,"Litavcova, Eva/Q-3792-2018; Litavcova, Eva/JAN-6178-2023; Heckova, Jaroslava/C-9742-2018","Litavcova, Eva/0000-0002-5323-4359; Heckova, Jaroslava/0000-0002-4390-2448",,,,,36,5,5,1,18,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Based on a firm-level panel data for the period 2000-2008, the empirical results show that foreign-owned enterprises (FOEs) experience higher productivity than do their domestic counterparts, whereas private firms (POEs) are not expected to outperform state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in productivity.

There are many scientific papers devoted to the experience of liberalization process in a number of countries in different industries. Nevertheless, the lack of conceptualization of the theoretical framework from standpoint of entrepreneurship has been revealed. The main goal of the paper was to provide evidence that in-depth exploration of the entrepreneurial activities in public service industries as previous stated-owned can contribute to the comprehension of the entrepreneurship core dimensions. In order to achieve the goal there have been three tasks to be done. First one has been to provide clarification of the public service entrepreneurship notion, second - to treat the practicability of its positioning as a scientific subdomain of entrepreneurship. The third task has been to distinguish appropriate entrepreneurial dimensions of its investigation. The discovering of the nexus between state approach to the economic transformation and entrepreneurial opportunities that occur could provide both theoretical and practical value in order to deepen the understanding of the nature of internal barriers and governmental constraints inherent to public services industries as well as its impact on the type and properties of opportunities.","[Iliashenko, Iuliia] Univ Insubria, Via Ravasi 2, Varese, Italy",University of Insubria,"Iliashenko, I (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, Via Ravasi 2, Varese, Italy.",juliya-ilyashenko@yandex.ua,"Ilyashenko, Oksana Yurevna Y./K-7470-2015",,,,,,28,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,898,908,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300074,0

Many school districts have begun to adopt these methods and have released results publicly. In this paper, we use the unique public release of value-added data in Los Angeles to identify how this measure of school quality is capitalized into housing prices. Via difference-in-differences, we find no evidence of a response to either school or teacher value-added rank, even though school-zone boundary fixed-effects estimates indicate that test score levels are capitalized into home prices. Given ample evidence that this information was new to residents, widely dispersed, and easily available, our results suggest that people did not significantly value it on the margin. This has implications for the effectiveness of providing value-added information as a tool to help parents choose schools. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

With regard to the character of surveyed subjects nonrepresentative sampling in the form of a snowball method was used. Scientific aim Description of ontological components of the business model of personal trainers and the revelation of the existence of the relationships between them and the innovativeness issues of the business in the fitness sector. Findings Fragmentary descriptions of the conditions of running business in the fitness sector existing in the literature are reflected in explanation of the ontological components of business models in the cases examined. Whereas in the opinion of the respondents the key relationships exist between such ontological components of business model as: customer value, target group of customers, forms of service and the following issues of innovativeness: current form of the offer, forms of the conducted marketing activity, process of offer improvement, value of profit margin. Conclusions The results of the study indicate that even among homogeneous group of personal trainers there might be differences in the declared description of ontological components of business model. These differences can be seen as the result of innovations. Innovations, however, are conditioned by the terms of Polish fitness sector, by the price sensitivity of Polish customers in particular.","[Komanda, Marcin] Univ Econ Katowice, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40827 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Komanda, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, 1 Maja 50 St, PL-40827 Katowice, Poland.",marcin.komanda@ue.katowice.pl,"Komanda, Marcin/G-6488-2012","Komanda, Marcin/0000-0003-1695-2949",,,,,13,0,0,0,7,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,557,563,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200069,0

The stated problems were projected into several strategic initiatives that define policies of the European Union in concrete spheres. The starting point is Strategy Europe 2020 that is a basic strategic development document of the European Union. For the sphere of small and medium enterprises, there is a key initiative Small Business Act for Europe (SBA). Implementing SBA represents the key appeal for the European Union and its member countries within the support of small and medium entrepreneurial activity.

Does this observation reflect the explicit state guarantee for too-big-to-fail (TBTF) banks? In that case, investors have an incentive to hold stocks of systemically important banks because they provide insurance against disaster risk through the state guarantee. Indeed, recent studies reveal a TBTF discount in large US banks' stock returns. Does this finding pertain to German (representing continental European) banks too? The main results of this paper suggest that it does. Risk-adjusted returns on a German bank stock index were negative in the period from 1973 to 2014. The key driver of this finding is an unanticipated, adverse shock to the German banking sector at the beginning of the global financial crisis. This shock increased the probability of a bank default and thus the insurance value of government support.","[Nitschka, Thomas] Swiss Natl Bank, Monetary Policy Anal, Boersenstr 15, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss National Bank (SNB),"Nitschka, T (通讯作者)，Swiss Natl Bank, Monetary Policy Anal, Boersenstr 15, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",thomas.nitschka@snb.ch,"Nitschka, Thomas/AAF-5954-2020","Nitschka, Thomas/0000-0001-7522-4955",,,,,22,1,1,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

This more flexible approach makes it possible to distinguish four different response patterns to changes in the drivers of water use, including different price elasticities. These results should be of particular interest to regulators who would like to tailor water demand management policy to heterogeneous users.

In addition, the Czech Republic might challenge an impact of Industry 4.0. As a consequence, it is to expect that more people will stay at home in order to spend there more time either as elderly, jobless or pensioners. Thus, more fire risk which might impact on public spending on fire protection might emerge. The paper deals with an impact of population aging and Industry 4.0 on the national capacity for fire protection in the Czech Republic. Methodology/methods The authors made an attempt to know if more or less fire protection units will be needed as ongoing population aging and Industry 4.0 implementation will continue. Therefore, they construct a dynamic model in simulation software Stella. System Dynamics is an useful and effective method for the investigation of complex social systems. As an input, demographic data provided by Czech Statistical Office and fire statistics provided by the Fire and Rescue Service of the Czech Republic have been used. Scientific aim The initial Stella model will be developed into more complex model further because simulation proved that there should be an impact of demographic aging and the fourth industrial revolution on need of fire protection capacity. More fire protection units should be needed; however, number of fire protection units has been decreasing in the Czech Republic since 1986. Most of them are run by municipalities and operated by volunteers, hence, the fire protection is inexpensive and substitution volunteer fire protection units by Fire and Rescue Service of the Czech Republic might cause an increase of public spending. Findings Aging population and unemployment affects the number of interventions FRS. Reducing the number of members of the FRS in the future could cause problems. Conclusions (limits, implications etc) A simple model confirmed possible problems, but the question merits a deeper analysis.","[Pernica, Bohuslav] Inst Reg & Secur Sci, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic; [Tomaskova, Hana] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Hradec Kralove 50004, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice; University of Hradec Kralove,"Tomásková, H (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Hradec Kralove 50004, Czech Republic.",bohuslav.pernica@upce.cz; hana.tomaskova@uhk.cz,"Pernica, Bohuslav/W-6030-2019; Tomášková, Hana/D-2020-2010","Pernica, Bohuslav/0000-0002-1087-6888; Tomášková, Hana/0000-0003-1744-5826",Czech Science Foundation GACR [14-02424S],Czech Science Foundation GACR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),The support of Czech Science Foundation GACR #14-02424S and the Student specific grant project is gratefully acknowledged.,,18,0,0,1,11,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,723,728,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200089,0

What local conditions determine success of such state efforts? What effect do these efforts have? Drawing on controlled comparisons between three districts in Indonesia and an original survey of 92 water user groups, I demonstrate that local political contexts condition the effectiveness of participatory irrigation policies. When irrigation is politically salient, local politicians pressure bureaucrats to better engage with farmers. The data also show that training programs are not as effective at increasing water user organization activity as frequent contact between bureaucrats and farmers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

They translate into a stable position of Poland on the peripheries of the core of the EU.

The regions are heterogeneous in various aspects, such as in their climate policies and resource extraction costs.

In order to assess the welfare and climate consequences of unilateral policy changes, we calibrate the model to real world parameter values. We find that forming a 'climate coalition' and introducing carbon taxation even in the absence of real climate concerns is the best course of action for the largest fossil fuel-using regions.","[Ryszka, Karolina; Withagen, Cees] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Ryszka, K (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",k.a.ryszka@vu.nl,,,FP7-IDEAS-ERC Grant [269788]; European Research Council (ERC) [269788] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),FP7-IDEAS-ERC Grant(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),We gratefully acknowledge financial support from FP7-IDEAS-ERC Grant No. 269788.,,22,9,9,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This fact leads sometimes to very sharp exchange of views between the Member States representatives and the Commission when examinations of new Commission ' s proposals are taking place. In these situations, it is very important how well-founded arguments are presented by experts from each Member State at such meetings and how consistent, cooperative and well acquainted with the problem they are to disprove Commission ' s arguments and maintain the balance and control over the Commission ' s competence to exercise delegated power.

Plagued by rising costs, intense competition from private, public, vocational, and online institutions, declining support from the state, and a view that education is a commodity much like any product, universities are turning to strategic planning to anticipate and ward off these threats to grow and survive. In the European Union, the issue of strategic planning has been slow in development as part of planning and policy making for institutions of higher education. This has been due, in part, to the particular nuances that prevail in the EU as oppose to the US, such as the expanse of institutions across borders and the emphasis on state control. Moreover, as a collective body, the EU has focused on initiating policies that support standardization across its educational landscape to remain competitive on a world stage. The Bologna Declaration was initiated to bring about greater compatibility of degrees and diplomas and to eliminate impediments to mobility between countries, increase employability of its workforce and increase competitiveness in a globalized educational market. For Romania, strategic planning has been ineffectual given the strong hand of the state and the limited management experience among administrators (Nicolae & Vitelar, 2013). As a part of the EU, Romania has been involved in some training in strategic planning; however, emerging from a communist regime, has hampered its ability to integrate this tool successfully to realize each institution's full potential and position it for its future success and survival. According to Voorhees (2008) strategic plans fail more often than they succeed in its implementation because of the failure to connect the dreams and aspirations that arise in strategic planning with specific actions. Moreover, failure of a plan results from leadership's inability to follow a shared governance model in developing the strategic plan that brings the organization onboard in fulfilling the goals and strategies outlined in the plan. Hence, this paper describes strategic planning and outlines the process for successful integration and implementation.","[Seitz, Victoria A.] Calif State Univ San Bernardino, 5500 Univ Pkwy, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA; [Mihai, Olesia] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, 11 Carol I Blvd, Iasi 700506, Romania",California State University System; California State University San Bernardino; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Seitz, VA (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ San Bernardino, 5500 Univ Pkwy, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA.",vseitz@csusb.edu; olesiamihai@yahoo.com,"Mihai, Olesia/W-1721-2019",,,,,,18,0,0,0,6,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,407,416,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300033,0

It accounts for the rebound effect - the extent to which energy efficiency savings are re-spent on energy consumption - since this can significantly alter the interpretation of the data on measured energy efficiency. Conventional stochastic frontier analysis does not allow for autoregressive errors in estimation and the measured efficiency scores can be seriously biased in the presence of error terms that are not identically and independently distributed. Therefore we allow for autoregressive errors by extending the generalized least squares estimator to include an error components model of stochastic frontier analysis. (C) 2016 The Authors.

As a result, the air and water have been polluted, soil porosity has been broken. Thus, the Ukrainian agribusiness requires changes that will take into account the environmental specifications and will reduce the ecological destruction impact on environment. The experience of developed European countries shows that instead of intensive agricultural production the environmentally friendly technology comes.

We compare two different monetary policy regimes: a currency board regime (in the CFA zone) and an inflation targeting policy regime (Ghana and South Africa) when central banks respond to demand, supply, and fiscal shocks. We extend the usual forecasting and policy analysis system models to replicate the economic features of these economies during the period 2002-12 and to evaluate the impact of several policies in response to these shocks. We find that both policies are inappropriate in helping the economies escape from the effects of negative demand shocks, both are essential when negative shocks to primary balance occur, while inflation targeting dominates the currency board regime as a strategy to cope with positive shocks to inflation.","[Al Hajj, Fadia; Dufrenot, Gilles] Aix Marseille Univ, F-13290 Chateau Lafarge, France; [Al Hajj, Fadia; Dufrenot, Gilles] Aix Marseille Sch Econ, GREQAM, Chateau Lafarge, France; [Al Hajj, Fadia; Dufrenot, Gilles] Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Chateau Lafarge, France; [Al Hajj, Fadia; Dufrenot, Gilles] Aix Marseille Sch Econ, EHESS, Chateau Lafarge, France; [Dufrenot, Gilles; Wolf, Romain] Banque France, Paris, France; [Dufrenot, Gilles] French Res Ctr Int Econ CEPII, Paris, France; [Sugimoto, Kimiko] Konan Univ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); European Central Bank; Bank of France; Konan University,"Dufrénot, G (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Route Milles, F-13290 Chateau Lafarge, France.",gilles.dufrenot@univ-amu.fr,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25380415] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,31,0,0,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

These distributional concerns are valid and, to be fair, policy can accommodate some transitional measures to soften the impact of sudden policy changes. However, the carbon pricing policy recently instituted in Quebec, in partnership with California under the Western Climate Initiative, is relatively modest in price targets, gradual in implementation, and has the capacity to spend revenues on transitional and impact-mediating programs for the labour market and households. We analyze the expected short-run impacts of the policy, focusing on equity in two domains: the household income distribution and labour in different industrial sectors. Our analysis focuses on the short-term effects, before capital is significantly reallocated, and before most substitution toward lower-carbon or imported goods has happened. For reasonable prices and pass-through levels, and modelling direct and indirect emissions, we bracket these impacts, finding modest effects in all cases. Generous permit handouts to incumbents are likely to result in some windfall profits. Quebec would benefit from greater transparency in the intended allocation of the Green Fund revenues. Overall, the policy appears tuned to provide a balance of price predictability, steady decarbonisation, and manageable transition costs, but could likely be more aggressive.","[Barrington-Leigh, Christopher] McGill Univ, Sch Environm, Inst Hlth & Social Policy, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Barrington-Leigh, Christopher] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Tucker, Bronwen] McGill Univ, Sch Environm, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Lara, Joaquin Kritz] Numera Analyt, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University; McGill University; McGill University,"Barrington-Leigh, C (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Sch Environm, Inst Hlth & Social Policy, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",,,"Barrington-Leigh, Christopher Paul/0000-0002-3929-5390",,,,,23,4,4,0,16,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

The bank requires risk-management approval for loans that are considered risky based on hard information, using a sharp threshold that changes during the sample period. Using a regression discontinuity design and a difference-in-differences estimator, I am able to show that risk-management involvement reduces loan default rates by more than 50%.

Using the tick-by-tick bid and ask quotes from the Electronic Broking Services (EBS), we find that Japanese official intervention affects the relative contributions of bid and ask quotes to price discovery of the USD-JPY exchange rate. The empirical results show that bid quotes usually respond to information more promptly than ask quotes, as measured by information share on a daily basis. The asymmetry in price-discovery efficacy of bid and ask quotes, however, declines in magnitude on days in which Japanese monetary authorities intervene in the USD-JPY market. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

To avoid false impressions of relative success at tests for zero mean pricing errors, we develop a notion of comparative p-values and suggest comparing these instead of the raw p-values. This comparison gives more precisely estimated models a fairer chance or, equivalently, quantifies how much easier it is for imprecisely estimated models, by comparison, to pass the test.

This finding stands in stark contrast to corporate bond markets. Third, traders charge higher premiums as a price for liquidity provision, not as compensation for asymmetric information.

On the price side, we also look at changes in long-term government bond yields and the appreciation of the effective exchange rate conditional on risk shocks.

Some economists (e.g. Paul Krugman) worry primarily about possible deflation caused by a secular stagnation. In contrast, others (e.g. John Taylor) worry about excessively high inflation caused by quantitative easing and monetization of fiscal imbalances. The paper shows that these two seemingly contradictory threats may in fact be mutually consistent. Our analysis demonstrates that some countries may experience both - deflation in the short term and high inflation in the long term - whereas some countries are likely to experience neither. This is done in a game theoretic framework with dynamic leadership; stochastic revisions of policy actions. Such framework enables us to examine strategic monetary-fiscal interactions, the policies' institutional features, as well as uncertainty about business cycle conditions (as present during the 2010-2015 period). Our empirical section then quantifies indices of monetary and fiscal leadership for high-income countries to put them in the Monetary-dominance, Fiscal-dominance and Regime-switching regions derived in the theoretic analysis, and thus assess their deflationary/inflationary prospects. It is shown that such undesirable departures from price stability are much more likely in the United States and Japan than in Australia or New Zealand. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, the institutional features that affect banks' ability to adjust costs and in particular personnel expenses, which comprise a significant part of banks' non-interest cost structure, have not been adequately studied. This paper investigates the effect of labour market institutions and regulations on bank performance in 15 European countries over the period 2005-2010, using the Fraser index for labour regulation and its disaggregated sub-components. We propose a novel methodology to measure performance, based on the seminal work of Kumbhakar and Tsionas (2005), which allows the estimation of technical and allocative efficiency and the examination of the effect of labour market regulations in a single stage. Results indicate the existence of a positive relationship between the liberalisation of EU labour markets and allocative efficiency, while the effect on technical efficiency appears to be negative, although not statistically significant. When looking at the disaggregated components of the labour index, we further confirm that different forces are at play. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Some of these proposed regulations would effectively eliminate certain loans with riskier borrower characteristics from the market. Such prescriptive approaches fail to recognize alternatives that permit riskier loans to be made, but require postorigination practices designed to offset elevated default risk by improving the capability of individual borrowers to make timely payments. This study provides evidence of one such approach. Through a randomized field experiment, we test the impact of goal setting and external monitoring on mortgage delinquency. First-time homebuyers who completed a financial planning module and received quarterly contact from a financial coach are less likely to become delinquent or default on their mortgages. These results suggest that relatively low cost procedures embedded into loan servicing may increase adherence to timely repayments, thereby reducing the probability of delinquency while still permitting riskier borrowers to participate in credit markets.

The results show that banks with weaker structural liquidity and higher leverage in the pre-crisis period were more likely to fail afterward. The likelihood of bank failure also increases with pre-crisis bank risk-taking. In the cross-section, the smaller domestically oriented banks were relatively more vulnerable to liquidity risk, while the large cross-border (Global) banks were more vulnerable to solvency risk due to excessive leverage. In fact, a 3.5 percentage point increase in the pre-crisis capital buffers of Global banks would have caused a 48 percentage point in their probability of failure during the crisis. The results support the proposed Basel III regulations on structural liquidity and leverage, but suggest that emphasis should be placed on the latter, particularly for the systemically-important institutions.

Understanding this link is important in view of the growing relevance of remittances as a source of external finance and of the beneficial impact that financial intermediation is likely to have on economic growth. Our contribution is twofold. First, we present a theoretical model of bank credit in a hypothetical remittances-receiving country where: (1) the banking sector is imperfectly competitive; and (2) bank rates change infrequently because of the presence of adjustment costs. We show that in equilibrium, the relationship between remittances and bank-credit is likely to be non-linear. Second, we look at the evidence using a panel data set for a large group of developing and emerging economies over the period 1970-2009. We find that at initially low levels of remittances, an increase in remittances reduces the volume of credit extended by banks. However, at sufficiently high levels of remittances, the effect becomes positive. The turning point of the relationship occurs at a level of remittances of about 2.5% of GDP, which would imply that approximately 50% of our sample lies to each side of this threshold.","[Brown, Richard P.

It failed to capture the contribution of systemic risk, which is considered to be the risk that is the outcome of collective behaviour of financial institutions that have significant effects on the real economy. This paper investigates whether the increased presence of foreign banks which are listed on a national stock market has contributed to the increase in the systemic risk, in particular, after the financial crisis of 2007-2009. We examine the extent to which the distress of foreign banks contributes to systemic risk for the US. In addition using relevant data for the UK we investigate the extent to which distress within different sub-segments of the financial system, namely, the banking, insurance and other financial services industries contribute to systemic risk. We conduct our analysis with the CoVaR measure of systemic risk recently developed by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011) using daily data for the period 2 January 2000 to 31 December 2012. Furthermore, we complement our analysis with the application of two tests, the significanceand dominance tests, to provide a formal comparison of the relative contribution of either the domestic or foreign banks and/or each individual financial sector. Our main results provide evidence that in the US, the non-US banks contribute to the systemic risk although most of the contribution comes from the US banks. In the case of the UK we show that the banking industry contributes relatively more to systemic risk in periods of distress than the insurance industry or the other financial services industry. Furthermore, when we examine the estimated Delta CoVaR measures, we observe that for all sectors the contribution to systemic risk has increased since 2008. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The southern firm is a public one whose objective is a weighted sum of the South's social welfare and its own profit, whereas the northern firm is a pure profit maximizer. The North provides a quid pro quo in exchange for the strengthening of the enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in the South. We show that when the northern and southern firms engage in quantity competition in the southern market, the southern government's optimal choice is either complete protection or complete violation. We show this to depend on the southern government's valuation of the quid pro quo. Moreover, strengthening IPR protection will deepen the privatization process in the South, though it brings about a social welfare loss to the South.","[Xu, Xiaohui; Lu, Jing] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Li, Jie] Jinan Univ, Inst Ind Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Jinan University,"Lu, J (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",gracelj@zju.edu.cn,"Li, Jie/AAE-6389-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333007]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15BJL087, 14AZD056, 12BJY117]; Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation [2014A030313395]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [15JNYH001]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"Financial support from the key project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71333007), the project of the National Social Science Foundation of China (15BJL087, 14AZD056, 12BJY117), the project of Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation (2014A030313395), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (15JNYH001) are acknowledged.",,37,2,2,0,32,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Using state variation in labor protections, we find that acquirers with strong labor rights experience lower announcement returns. Combined acquirer and target announcement returns are also lower in the presence of strong labor rights. Our findings remain statistically and economically significant after we control for a range of deal, firm, industry and state characteristics and explore various channels for the labor rights effect. Overall, the evidence indicates that employee-shareholder conflicts of interest reduce shareholder gains from acquisitions.

Both the availability of equipment and waiting time to see medical professionals substantially influences enrollment. Focus-groups raise concerns about providers favoring uninsured households.

We assess this transformation here, focusing on small tomato farmers in West Java and the determinants of their market-channel choices (as well as the technology correlates of those choices). These farmers sell to traditional village traders, urban and modern wholesalers, and supermarkets, and they have all invested heavily in irrigation and rely on external inputs. We find differences among farmers selling to different market channels. To wit, non-land assetsespecially irrigationare important to farmers participating in the supermarket, or modern, channel, but farm size affects modern-channel participation only in high-level commercial zones (zones dense in infrastructure and near highways). We also find that modern-channel farmers earn more profit than farmers in other channels but do not necessarily use chemicals more intensively. Yet hardly any farmers sell graded tomatoes; the main capture of rents' goes to specialised and modernising wholesalers.","[Hernandez, Ricardo] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Reardon, Thomas] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Reardon, Thomas] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Natawidjaja, Ronnie] Padjadjaran State Univ, Bandung, Indonesia; [Shetty, Shobha] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Michigan State University; University of Adelaide; Universitas Padjadjaran; The World Bank,"Hernández, R (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",,"Natawidjaja, Ronnie Susman/GPT-3866-2022","Natawidjaja, Ronnie Susman/0000-0002-4504-7166",,,,,22,13,16,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Unlike previous models, more valuation is associated with lower market prices and so greater returns to valuation. This strategic complementarity in the capacity to do valuation generates multiple equilibria. With multiple equilibria, the equilibrium without valuation is most efficient despite funding some unprofitable investments. Switches to valuation equilibria, valuation runs, look like credit crunches.

Including these two components of the demand for redistribution, we propose in this article a mechanism of cultural transmission of the concern for fairness. Consistently with the process of socialization, preferences of the young are partially shaped through observation and imitation of other's choices. More specifically, observing during childhood how adults have collectively failed to implement fair redistributive policies lowers the concern for fairness or the moral cost of not supporting a fair taxation. Based on this mechanism, the model exhibits a multiplicity of history-dependent steady states that may account for the huge and persistent difference of redistribution observed between Europe and the United States.","[Le Garrec, Gilles] OFCE Sci Po, F-75340 Paris 07, France",,"Le Garrec, G (通讯作者)，OFCE Sci Po, 69 Quai Orsay, F-75340 Paris 07, France.",gilles.legarrec@sciencespo.fr,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,10,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Once we account for stock market literacy, sociability is no longer significant for participation; what matters is literacy rather than sociability. Further, we observe that economic shocks and future expectations are key behavioral characteristics that explain a household's decision to invest in stocks.

The puzzle is why all agricultural land is not sold in small parcels. Small parcels tend to be close to residential areas and close to quality roads. The small parcel premium lessens as parcels are more distant from urban areas. This suggests that much of the small parcel premium is due to parcels being purchased based on nonagricultural use values. Thus, an explanation of the small parcel premium puzzle is that land with low nonagricultural use values may not have a small parcel premium. (JEL Q15, R14)","[Brorsen, B.

Enabling environments for collective action combined with bolstered state capacity to respond to citizen voice are more promising.

Production of the good generates a transboundary externality related to climate change; if this externality is priced improperly, the application of a feed-in tariff or border tax adjustment can provide an indirect policy instrument. We analyze the application of such a measure in a stark model where the importing country cares about climate-related damages while the exporting country does not; this can be viewed as reflecting a scenario where the (developed) importing country is more concerned about climate change than is the (transitioning) exporting economy. Because climate change will occur over a long time frame, the problem is dynamic.

The existing validation tests determine whether these subjective measures have a positive correlation with objective measures of well-being, such as suicide rates and frequency of smiling. We propose an alternative test consisting of three steps: using regression analysis to infer preferences from subjective well-being data; using those estimated parameters to predict how a rational utility-maximizer individual should have acted; and comparing predicted behavior with actual behavior. This validation test can be compelling for economists, because it compares decision utility (i.e., preferences inferred from behavior) to reported utility (i.e., preferences inferred from self-reported well-being). We provide an application of this test based on a model of food consumption, estimated with one of the most widely used measures of subjective well-being: life satisfaction. We find that, across individuals, a one percentage point increase in the actual expenditure share is associated with a 0.76 (SE 0.196) increase in the share predicted by life satisfaction. Additionally, life satisfaction performs significantly better than other objective and subjective measures of well-being (e.g., income, satisfaction with income). The evidence suggests that life satisfaction offers some useful information about experienced utility. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper develops a theoretically consistent model that is able to describe the greenhouse firms' behaviour regarding energy use and investments in energy technology. The behaviour of the firm is modelled using a combination of a dynamic cost function and a static profit function framework. The optimal quantity of energy is derived from the link between these two functions. The model is applied to a panel of 97 Dutch greenhouse firms over the period 2001-2008. The results show that most Dutch greenhouse firms shift from being net electricity users to net electricity producers in the long term. Investing in energy capital contributes to reducing net energy use, however it increases the quantity of carbon dioxide emissions due to an increase in electricity production.

As employer-provided defined benefit pensions are replaced by voluntary contribution plans, employees' understanding of the link between their annual contributions and their post-retirement wealth is becoming increasingly important. We examine the extent to which wage-earners in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) correctly report their inclusion in tax-deferred contribution plans and, conditional on inclusion, their annual contributions. We use three samples representing different cohorts in three different periods: the original HRS cohort interviewed in 1992 at ages 51-56, the War Babies cohort interviewed in 1998 at ages 51-56, and the Early Baby Boomer cohort interviewed in 2004 at the same ages. Our findings indicate that while respondents interviewed in 1998 and 2004 were more likely to correctly report whether they were included in defined contribution plans, they were no more accurate when reporting whether they had contributed to their plans than respondents interviewed in 1992. Contributors in the three cohorts, moreover, overstated their annual contributions and thus would be likely to realize lower than expected account balances at retirement. The magnitude of this error is not negligible. In all three cohorts, the mean reporting error (the absolute difference between respondent-reported and Social Security earnings record contributions) was approximately 1.5 times larger than the mean contribution in the W-2 earnings record.","[Dushi, Irena] Social Secur Adm, Off Retirement & Disabil Policy, Off Res Evaluat & Stat, Washington, DC 20254 USA; [Honig, Marjorie] CUNY Hunter Coll, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Honig, Marjorie] CUNY, Grad Sch, New York, NY 10065 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Dushi, I (通讯作者)，Social Secur Adm, Off Retirement & Disabil Policy, Off Res Evaluat & Stat, 500 E St SW, Washington, DC 20254 USA.",Irena.Dushi@ssa.gov,,,U.S. Social Security Administration through the Michigan Retirement Research Center,U.S. Social Security Administration through the Michigan Retirement Research Center,"The research reported herein was supported by a grant from the U.S. Social Security Administration through the Michigan Retirement Research Center.

However, the official poverty measure (OPM) does not account for the effect of near-cash transfers on the financial resources available to families, an important omission since such transfers have become an increasingly important part of government antipoverty policy. Applying the historical SPM, which does count such transfers, we find that trends in poverty have been more favorable than the OPM suggests and that government policies have played an important and growing role in reducing povertya role that is not evident when the OPM is used to assess poverty.

Using quarterly data for the Greenspan period we find that: (i) risk in the inflation outlook and in financial markets are a more powerful driver of monetary policy regime changes than variables typically suggested in the literature, such as the level of inflation and the output gap; (ii) estimation of regime switching models shows that the response of the US Fed to the inflation outlook is invariant across policy regimes; (iii) however, in periods of high economic risk monetary policy tends to respond more aggressively to the output gap and the degree of inertia tends to be lower than in normal circumstances; and (iv) the US Fed is estimated to have responded aggressively to the output gap in the late 1980s and beginning of the 1990s, and in the late 1990s and early 2000s. These results are consistent with Mishkin (2008)'s view that in periods of high economic risk monetary authorities should respond aggressively to changes in macroeconomic conditions while the degree of inertia should be lower than in normal circumstances.

In addition, we study how wage premium relates to using a social network in finding a job, exploring the inequality that can arise using a different job search method. Our results show that neighborhood affects the individual's job search method and that referred workers earn less at the bottom of the wage distribution with respect to non-referred workers.

However, we prove that the spatio-temporal correlation function is robust to temporal aggregations schemes when the covariance of traffic in different locations is separable in space and time.

While the presence of excess control rights is associated with lower profitability, higher earnings volatility and higher default risk before the crisis (2002-2006) but also at the later stage of the financial crisis (2009-2010), conversely, it improves profitability, lowers earnings volatility and no longer affects default risk during the 2007-2008 financial crisis years. Further evidence shows that, regardless of the period, the effect of excess control rights on profitability and risk is accentuated in family-controlled banks and in countries with relatively weak shareholder protection rights and that such an effect is mainly effective at intermediate and high levels of excess control rights. Overall, our findings contribute to the literature examining the corporate governance determinants of banks' performance during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis and have several policy implications.

This paper provides evidence to suggest that a way in which multinational firms economize on costly information transfers is by using skilled foreign workers, since local talent can substitute for knowledge inputs from the headquarters. Combining U.S. data on headquarter service exports with information on communication costs and skill endowments by country, I find that while communication costs decrease the export of headquarter services to foreign affiliates, the effect becomes weaker in the average educational attainment of foreign workers. The sensitivity of headquarter service exports to communication barriers at low levels of skill endowment has important implications for the geography of multinational production, as well as for policies aimed at improving communication infrastructure.","Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of Oregon,"Cristea, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, 1285 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",cristea@uoregon.edu,,,,,,,36,10,11,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We argue that the ex-ante process of information acquisition may affect the strategies used to create syndicates. For large loans, the restrictions on lending impose a natural reason for syndication. We study medium-sized loans instead, where there is some room for competition since each financial institution has the ability to take the loan in full by itself. In this case, syndication would be the optimal choice only if their screening costs are similar. Otherwise, lenders would be compelled to compete, since a lower screening cost can create a comparative advantage in interest rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The estimation of the model indicates that large firms are more likely to invest in STI activities and firms' size increases the probability of producing technological inovation (TI) and non-technological innovation (NTI). STI firms' investment intensity and public financial support have also helped manufacturing firms to increase the probability of producing TI outcomes. Further, such support may have increased firms' investment on STI activities. The innovation effects on TFP, however, were statistically not clear or robust. Thus, whereas investment intensity did increase firms' TPF in low-tech manufacturing firms, this is not the case for high-tech firms. For this group of firms, relatively high capital-labor ratio and the availability of a high level of human capital seem to promote higher levels of TFP.","Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Econ, Lima 32, Peru",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Tello, MD (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Econ, Ave Univ 1801, Lima 32, Peru.",mtello@pucp.edu.pe,"tello, mario/GWU-9430-2022",,IADB; CINVE; IDRC,IADB; CINVE; IDRC(International Development Research Centre - IDRC),"This paper is a modified and shortened version of the paper presented at the 18th DEGIT conference held in Lima, Peru, in September of 2013 and was finished when the author was a visiting CAF fellow of the Latin American Centre at the University of Oxford.

Travel time from a survey could include reporting errors and respondents might not be representative of the areas they reside; and the derived optimal commute at an aggregate areal level is also subject to the zonal effect. Both may bias the estimate of excess commuting. Based on the 2006-2010 Census for Transportation Planning Package (CTPP) data in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, this research uses a Monte Carlo approach to simulate individual resident workers and individual jobs within census tracts, estimate commute distance and time from journey-to-work trips, and define the optimal commute based on simulated individual locations.

Our results indicate that greater uncertainty has a negative impact on growth of employment, and the effects are primarily felt by the relatively smaller businesses; the impact on Large Businesses are generally non-existent or weaker.

This conflict of interest may result in trading to support securities prices. Tests of this hypothesis in the Spanish mutual fund industry indicate that bank-affiliated mutual funds systematically increase their holdings in the controlling bank stock around seasoned equity issues, at the time of bad news about the controlling bank, before anticipated price drops, and after non-anticipated price drops. The results seem mainly driven by bank managers' incentives. Ownership of asset management companies thus matters and can distort capital allocation and asset prices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Toxic assets generate an adverse selection problem and, consequently, the interbank asset market provides insufficient liquidity. Investment is inefficiently low because acquiring funding requires banks to sell high-quality assets for less than their fair value. Equity injections reduce liquidity and may be counterproductive as a policy for increasing investment. Paradoxically, if it is directed to firms with the greatest liquidity needs, an equity injection will reduce investment further. Asset purchase programs, like the Public-Private Investment Program, often have favorable impacts on liquidity, investment and welfare. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, when control rights exceed cash flow rights, instead of issuing equity, banks downsize by reducing lending. Such a finding is mostly prevalent in countries with weak shareholder protection or for family-controlled banks. Other factors also explain the extent to which such banks reduce lending.

After confirming the average returns over 20 years against the market benchmark of equity only funds, this paper reports significant reductions due to fees. The publicly reported performance of substantial returns to investors is whittled away to a small return once the different fees charged by funds are factored in. Another significant finding is that the evidence in prior research in support of market timing ability of funds disappears once the econometric problems of the methodology in prior research are addressed by using panel regression method. We believe that these two findings add new insights on the impact of different fees on returns to investors and further help to highlight the need to address methodological problems in mutual fund studies.

Shale gas resources are potentially overestimated and it is uncertain to what extent they can be economically produced. The adverse environmental effects of ever more wells being drilled may lead to a fall in public acceptance and the strengthening of U.S. regulation. The objective of this paper is twofold: first, to provide a critical look, at current U.S. shale gas projections and, in a second step, investigate the implications of a less optimistic development by means of numerical simulation. In a world of declining U.S. shale gas production after 2015, natural gas consumption outside the U.S.A. is reduced from its reference path by at least as much as U.S. consumption. Trade flows are redirected, and the recent U.S. debate on allowing exports of Liquefied Natural Gas is moot.","German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Richter, PM (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",prichter@diw.de,,,German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF),German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This work was carried out within the research project RESOURCES: International Energy Resource Markets under Climate Constraints-Strategic Behavior and Carbon Leakage in Coal, Oil, and Natural Gas Markets, funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

Do LDCs therefore consume less energy per capita than rich countries in the past? And is their economic growth associated with a lower growth in energy consumption? Can they leapfrog to a lower-carbon economy? I use data on energy consumption, prices, and gross domestic product for 76 countries to estimate the energy intensity of income growth for both current LDCs and industrialized countries in the past. I find that, despite dramatic improvements in energy efficiency, economic growth in LDCs is not less energy-intensive than past growth in industrialized countries. Energy savings from access to more efficient technologies have been offset by other trends, including a shift toward more energy-intensive consumption bundles and compositional changes in industry such as outsourcing. This can have serious implications for energy consumption projections.","[van Benthem, Arthur A.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Business Econ & Publ Policy, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [van Benthem, Arthur A.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"van Benthem, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Business Econ & Publ Policy, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",arthurv@wharton.upenn.edu,,"van Benthem, Arthur/0000-0002-1028-9464",,,,,57,61,64,1,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

This article explores some determinants of the frequency of long-distance business travel. It focuses on the influence of two parameters that have been little studied: the individual's socio-occupational group and the workplace location. The data used were provided by the 2008 French National Transport and Travel Survey. Following a review of the literature, a Poisson regression is performed on the frequency of long-distance business trips. The most significant determinants are socio-occupational category, income, gender and the urban or rural nature and size in terms of the number of inhabitants of the area of location. In particular long-distance business trip frequency is lower in the Paris urban area than in all the categories of urban areas as well as rural areas because of the highly centralised organisation of economic activity and the transport network in France.

The empirical results identified a host of socio-economic and household-level factors including remittances parents expect from investing in education, parents perception of a child's desirable professions, cost of schooling and discount rate as significant determinants of parental school enrolment decision. When gender of the child and remittances are taken into account, we show male parents are more likely to invest in education of boys than girls because they expect significantly higher returns from their investment in boys. Female parents do not show such gender preference. The proportion of children enrolled in school is positively related to average cost of schooling for male parents Gender of parent plays a significant role in school enrolment decision making.","[Ahiakpor, Ferdinand] Univ Cape Coast, Dept Econ, Cape Coast, Ghana; [Ahiakpor, Ferdinand; Swaray, Raymond] Univ Hull, Sch Business, Econ Subject Grp, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",University of Cape Coast; University of Hull,"Ahiakpor, F (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Sch Business, Econ Subject Grp, Cottingham Rd, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.",fahiakpor@ucc.edu.gh,"Swaray, Raymond/AAC-3283-2019","Swaray, Raymond/0000-0002-6687-4101",,,,,27,6,7,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In accordance with this objective motivational factors, status in the society, relationship to the state, level of the corruption, approach to loan financing, and business optimism in the business environment have been examined. In details, there have been quantified the differences between the trading companies and the others, between the companies over 10 years old and the others, and between the micro-enterprises and the others. There were compared the opinions of entrepreneurs who stated that their main motivation to start a business was money to the opinions of other entrepreneurs. Our research has produced interesting findings. It was found out that money is an important motive for starting a business, although there are some regional differences in this area. Entrepreneurs negatively perceive the relationship between surroundings and their activities, the relationship of the state to the business and corruption that they encounter while performing their business activities. The businessmen rather criticized the banks' approach of banks to fund their needs and at the same time they expressed a great deal of business optimism.","[Belas, Jaroslav] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Bilan, Yuriy] Univ Szczecin, PL-70453 Szczecin, Poland; [Demjan, Valer] Banking Inst Prague, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Sipko, Juraj] Paneuropean Univ Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia",Tomas Bata University Zlin; University of Szczecin; Pan-European University,"Belás, J (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic.",belas111@gmail.com,"Belas, Jaroslav/AGS-6813-2022; Bilan, Yuriy/ABC-6948-2021; Bilan, Yuriy/B-3119-2012","Belas, Jaroslav/0000-0002-5900-997X; Bilan, Yuriy/0000-0003-0268-009X",Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU [005/IGA/FaME/2014]; Project Current trends in the area of business risks of small and medium-sized enterprises in selected regions of the Czech Republic and Slovakia [FaME/2013/MSPRISK],Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU; Project Current trends in the area of business risks of small and medium-sized enterprises in selected regions of the Czech Republic and Slovakia,"Authors are thankful to the Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU No.005/IGA/FaME/2014: Optimization of parameters of the financial performance of the commercial banks, for financial support to carry out this research.

We show these accounts to be inconsistent with the historical facts. We show that despite the existence of basic aircraft patents, aircraft manufacturers faced no patent barriers in the market dominated by government demand. We show that the notion of the aircraft patent hold-up is a myth created by government officials and used to persuade the Congress to authorize eminent domain condemnation of basic aircraft patents. Government officials used the threat of condemnation to impose a depressed royalty structure on aircraft patents and induce key patent owners to enter a cross-licensing patent pool. We show that this cross-licensing agreement was not an archetypical private patent pool, but had been structured to suit the preferences of the government as monopsonist; it imposed on private suppliers to the government a nearly costless technology transfer.","[Katznelson, Ron D.] Bilevel Technol, Encinitas, CA 92024 USA; [Howells, John] Aarhus Univ, Sch Business & Social Sci, Dept Business Adm, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Katznelson, RD (通讯作者)，Bilevel Technol, Encinitas, CA 92024 USA.",ron@bileveltech.com; joh@asb.dk,,"Howells, John/0000-0001-6814-2345",,,,,75,12,12,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Where effects of planting trees have been used to estimate the impacts on consumption of fuel wood from public land, actual estimates of the size of fuel wood consumption changes have been lacking. Using data from a survey of 324 households in the Chongwe district of Zambia, we tested the hypothesis that households embracing improved fallows use less fuel wood from public land since the technology provides wood as a by-product. Estimates from ordered probit and matching strategies showed that the technology had a significant causal effect of reducing the consumption of fuel wood from public land. Therefore, in addition to promoting it for soil fertility improvement, the extension messages should explicitly reflect the technology's potential to provide on-farm environmental quality.","[Kuntashula, Elias; Mungatana, Eric] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Kuntashula, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",ekuntashula@unza.zm; eric.mungatana@up.ac.za,,,Collaborative Masters in Applied Agricultural Economics (CMAAE) PhD Fellowship programme; Centre for Environmental Economics Policy in Africa (CEEPA),Collaborative Masters in Applied Agricultural Economics (CMAAE) PhD Fellowship programme; Centre for Environmental Economics Policy in Africa (CEEPA),"Resources for this research were provided by the Collaborative Masters in Applied Agricultural Economics (CMAAE) PhD Fellowship programme.

The second claim requires that the estimated system to be not unnecessarily volatile. To test this issue was chosen long time series of selected tax revenues of Denmark.

They result from the indisputable role of this economic indicator (and its monitoring) on both the microeconomic and macroeconomic level, and also in relation to its impact on performance, competitiveness, etc. Labour is defined in classical theory as one of the primary factors of production, together with land and capital. The increasing importance of secondary factors has been highlighted by some authors, including information, technology, and the results of science and research. However, it is only labour which can be considered as the factor which connects all the other factors and exploits them -it would not be functional without it. Labour productivity (LP) is indeed one of the partial indicators of overall productivity, but it still stands at the forefront in both theory and practice. Regarding Czech agriculture, from the analysis (using the current method of LP monitoring) it was clearly shown that productivity of Czech agriculture has considerable reserves. It is alarming to see the low value of the Gross Value Added (GVA), suggesting considerably higher cost inputs. Furthermore, according to Eurostat data, over the period of nine years, GVA has increased in the prices of agricultural producers by only 5% (2012/2004), and the GVA in current prices even decreased by 15% (2012/2004). The result is the low level of labour productivity in comparison with economically developed EU countries (45.2% of labour productivity achieved in Austria -2012).","[Bohackova, Ivana; Mach, Jiri] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Bohácková, I (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",bohackiv@pef.czu.cz,"Mach, Jiri/H-4657-2018","Mach, Jiri/0000-0002-0526-4246",,,,,11,2,2,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,64,72,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600006,0

This may affect domestic bank market structures and macroeconomic stability in the longer term. In this study, I theoretically and empirically analyze how different modes of cross-border banking impact bank concentration and market power. I use a two-country general equilibrium model with heterogeneous banks developed by DeBlas and Russ (2010a) to grasp the effect of cross-border lending and foreign direct investment in the banking sector on bank market structures. The model suggests that both cross-border lending and bank FDI mitigate concentration. Empirical evidence from a panel dataset of 18 OECD countries supports the theoretical predictions: higher volumes or bank FDI and of cross-border lending coincide with lower Herfindahl-indexes in bank credit markets.

In terms of foreign knowledge capital, import spillover channel has a significantly positive impact on TFP while the influence of FDI spillover channel is significantly negative. Closing the technology gap between following economy and leading economy is conducive to improve technology level of these economies.

Each database corresponds with a city with distinctive differences defined. The compiled and modified database can be statistically tested using linear parametric and non-parametric models. The findings indicate existence of price differences across the individual periods of construction, and facilitate a formulation of a functional (graphic) expression of the dependence for individual cities as well as an aggregate for the entire Czech market, i.e. a global curve.

We apply our methodology to publicly available data from Las Vegas, Nevada. We find that, during the market collapse in that city, the price impact from REO transactions was greater than other distressed sales, but the difference narrowed over time.

The solution to this situation seems to be the employment of foreigners, which, however, brings about the confrontation of cultures, religions, laws and standards.

The classical valuation theory which is based on the law of one price assumes implicitly that market participants can trade freely in both directions at the same price. In the absence of perfect liquidity the law of one price should be replaced by a two price theory where the terms of trade depend on the direction of the trade. A static as well as a continuous time theory for two price economies is discussed. The two prices are termed bid and ask or lower and upper price but they should not be confused with the vast literature relating bid-ask spreads to transaction costs or other frictions involved in modeling financial markets. The bid price arises as the infimum of test valuations given by certain market scenarios whereas the ask price is the supremum of such valuations. The two prices correspond to nonlinear expectation operators. Specific dynamic models which are driven by purely discontinuous Levy processes are considered.

Since joining European Union, Republic of Croatia needed to implement several different new Customs procedures and procedures for monitoring foreign trade between Croatia and other countries within EU and outside of EU. Terminology of foreign trade has changed from moment when Croatia joined EU. Therefore when there is goods transaction between member states terms of sending and receiving are used while when the goods are going to other countries terms of export and import are being used. In order to be able to monitor transaction between member states of EU it is necessary to have Intrastat implemented. Intrastat is basically system of acquiring statistical data of trade between member states. This procedure is of extreme importance for looking upon trade balance between Croatia and other EU member states. Therefore Republic of Croatia started with implementation of Intrastat through project approach a year before it joined EU and project was finished and started working from June 1, 2013. Paper investigates project methodology in dealing with important goals - Intrastat implementation and is trying to show importance of project management in company's business activities and in this case in government as well. In the first part of paper Intrastat will be introduced, second part will deal with project approach of Intrastat implementation in Croatia. In the last part importance of Intrastat for foreign trade information in Republic of Croatia will be shown and recommendations for further research on this matter will be given.","[Erceg, Aleksandar] JJ Strossmajer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia; [Erceg, Aleksandar] Kandit Doo, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Erceg, A (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmajer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",aleksandar.erceg@kandit.hr,"Erceg, Aleksandar/I-8071-2019","Erceg, Aleksandar/0000-0002-1141-1919",,,,,6,2,2,0,0,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,809,822,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700051,0

According to some authors, price decreases caused by increasing competitiveness stop when there are 6-8 participating competitors and they describe this point as fully competitive procurement. When full competitiveness is reached, subsequent additional competitors have only a minimal or no impact on the final procurement price. The aim of our paper is to summarize and calculate competitiveness in Slovak and Czech public procurement between 2008 and 2014, and to evaluate the impact of the level of competition in public procurement on the final price, using regression analysis and weighted summary statistics. In the final part of our paper we compare our findings to those of the above noted experts.","[Grega, Matus; Nemec, Juraj] Univ Matej Bel, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia; [Nemec, Juraj] Masaryk Univ, Dept Publ Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Matej Bel University; Masaryk University Brno,"Grega, M (通讯作者)，Univ Matej Bel, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",matus.grega@umb.sk; juraj.nemec@umb.sk,"Nemec, Juraj/M-5467-2013",,,,,,16,4,5,0,3,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,143,150,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200020,0

It is the most important part of the government, whose primary function is to finance public goods. Taxes are the essential part of state budget incomes and a value-added tax (VAT) makes up most of the revenue from taxes in Slovak republic. Because of this fact, the main goal of the paper is to analyze VAT impact on the state budgets expenditures and incomes in Slovak republic. Since the establishment of the Slovak republic, there were occurred many changes in VAT rates and those changes affected the prices of goods and services. This fact influenced the amount of state budget revenues from VAT. Because of that, the goal of the article is to analyze the development of standard and reduced VAT rates in years 1993 - 2015. The paper quantified the costs related to the management and control of taxation and then evaluated the effectiveness of VAT in relation to the state budget. From the results of the analysis of the revenue to the state budget, we can conclude that despite the gradual increase of tax revenues to the state budget, the share of VAT on tax total revenues, after the increase in the VAT rate by one percentage point, did not increase. In assessing the effectiveness of VAT, we concluded that the expenditures for tax and duties collection are several times lower than the tax revenues to the state budget and collection of tax and duties can be considered as effective.

Ratio of private debt (non-financial corporations, households and non-profit institutions serving households) to GDP was steadily increasing till 2009 with a decrease in the following years. After the decomposition of the private sector debt several facts stand out. Highly indebted, on the average, are households in Denmark and The Netherlands. Postsocialist countries have still low indebtedness, but are catching up. In panel regressions (fixed effects) the dependent variable is overlapping two-and free-year forward looking averages. The control variables are those usually used in growth equations a la R. Barro. We have utilised also instrumental variables (Pooled IV Two-stage EGLS) and 3 years averages for all variables to capture medium-run impacts.

The main objective functions expressed in the literature of the TSPTW consist of the following: (1) to minimize total distance travelled (or to minimize total travel time spent on the arcs), (2) to minimize total cost of traveling on the arcs and cost of waiting before services, or (3) to minimize total time passed from depot to depot (tour duration). When the unit cost of traveling and unit cost of waiting appear equal, then one may solve the problem just minimizing tour duration. According to our best knowledge, only one formulation with nonlinear constraints considers the aim of minimizing tour duration for symmetric case. However, for just minimizing tour duration, we haven't seen any linear formulation for symmetric and any general formulation for asymmetric TSPTW. In this paper, for minimizing tour duration, we propose polynomial size integer linear programming formulation for symmetric and asymmetric TSPTW separately. The performances of our proposed formulations are tested on well-known benchmark instances used to minimize total travel time spent on the arcs. For symmetric TSPTW, our proposed formulation sufficiently and capably finds optimal solutions for all instances (the biggest are with 400 customers) in an extremely short time with CPLEX 12.4. For asymmetric TSPTW, we used instances generated from a real life problem which were used for minimizing total arc cost. We used these instances for minimizing tour duration and observe that, optimal solutions of the most of the instances up to 232 nodes are obtained within seconds. In addition, the proposed formulation for asymmetric case obtained 7 new best known solutions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The focus on energy efficiency and sustainability makes it even more important to reduce such deficiencies. The managing of building design phases might be one of the most challenging forms of management in the AEC industry, i.e. it involves managing both outputs as drawings and creativity as minds. There must be enough room for creativity so that a building project can evolve to serve clients' needs. There are pooled, sequential, reciprocal and intensive interdependencies in building design that need to be handled or coordinated differently. A particular building design phase most likely consists of all the four types, yet dominance shifts between them through sub-phases. The logic of creative processes is difficult to understand and, therefore, to manage properly. In this paper, these four interdependencies and their coordination are described based on the literature review. The key findings indicate that the reliance on the same management approach to handle both reflective and sequential dependencies might be contra productive. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This brings long-term equilibrium and ensures that no one can persistently beat the market. However, as it is mentioned, this is the state of things in the long-term horizon, which, as numerous evidence suggest, may not hold for short-term horizon. Additionally, violation of any one of the fundamentals, such as presence of investors' herding behavior or information asymmetry makes the movement of stock prices to deviate from random walk pattern, thus providing a room for short-term outperformance. Up to date no absolutely efficient markets are known for world academic and investment community. The best know long-term approximation is represented by mature capital markets. As for emerging markets, so there is a long-term debate about their efficiency. Generally, emerging markets due to underdeveloped local economies, loose securities regulation, poor investors' rights protection, political instability and high exposure to external shocks are considered as inefficient. In this context the role of capital markets of the Central and Eastern Europe is quite ambiguous: on one hand having among themselves high-income economies with stable political systems and being closely located to developed economies they are considered as remote types of mature capital markets with corresponding high-level efficiency, while, on the other hand, having among themselves middle-income economies, some of which are even not members of the European Union, thus being characterized as less developed economies with low level of political stability and low quality governance, they are characterized as emerging capital markets with corresponding low-level efficiency. In the light of stated above the paper aims to test market efficiency of the emerging capital markets in 11 high-and middle-income economies from the Central and Easter Europe (here and after CEE) for the time span from 2000 to 2015. Following established practice a set of standardized efficiency test will be employed and data from Bloomberg terminal will be used.","[Lemeshko, Oleksandra] Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Lemeshko, O (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",lemeshko@mail.muni.cz,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,470,479,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000052,0

This is understood as European citizens acting accordingly to a set of rules, social standards, values that are agreed by social consensus and institutionalized by Treaties and other measures. It is considered that formal institutions are indispensable for this approach, as there could be no fluid without a recipient to contain it. But the informal ones are important as well because appropriate economic and social (ecological as well) proper behaviours cannot be sustained without an assumed set of values that follow an agreed sense. The paper aims to explore the possibilities that can shape the European behaviour as it concerns Romanians. In the first place this is important as an outside manifestation of an act of individual decision according to an inner values system. In the second place, the ways of adapting behaviour to a system of rules, norms, laws and social customs are overviewed. The need for solidarity, appreciation, knowledge, social recognition of values, a chance to decent living, requires institutional support both formally and informally. It is considered that only the existence of a conditional preference for conformity in combination with the confidence that others will comply may cause congruence between normative beliefs and behaviour. In order to analyse that there is a link between the awareness of a common goal and the economic, social, ecological or cultural behaviour the study base its arguments on recently conducted interviews and on a survey. As for the Romanians, the author believes that there is a verifiable need for the mass awareness of European project in order to support integration through appropriate behaviours.

During the procedure of regulating and controlling, it's necessary to consider the hazard in the financial markets. This paper started with the current risk conditions of Chinese financial markets, discussing the main hazards represented by the fund structure of banks and leverage, including nonstandard financing business and high rate of credits. Then, the article was presented with the current supervision system and some of the rules, mainly presenting from the angle of capital adequacy ratio and the balance of risk and profits with supporting of data and documents. Concerning the current supervision system and combined with the performances of the government and the market, the essay analyses the next step of the supervision, including the demand of capital adequacy ratio, the information disclosure towards public and the government, the standardization of financing business and facing the widely existing informal finance in China. In this paper, it's considered that as the hazard in the financial markets being focused, analyzed and supervised, the supervision itself has its uncertainty. It can turn risks into disasters if it's taken not properly and that is where the article breaking fresh grounds. The essay states the opinions that there are difficulties to take these measures because the financial institutions may refused to disclosure information in details and there are risks that the capital with high leverage may be unstable under the supervision, together with the large scale of the informal finance. There're some solutions to these problems, including raise the awareness of risk management in inner and mutual supervision, culture construction and the evaluation of performances. Also, we can optimize the procedure of investigation and annunciation of performances of the supervision department to avoid dramatic reaction from the market. It is also important that the government should keep supporting small and medium-sized enterprises about their financing issues so that there will be an improvement in the problem of the informal finance. To keep the sustainable development of economics, we have to face the hazards. Neither letting it go nor ruling it too hard is fine to the markets. It's going to be a key point of the government, the trade and the institutions' work that how to supervise the financial risk.","[Li Huiyao] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Li, HY (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",lhywki@163.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,11,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-614-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,14,24,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376410500002,0

This article draws on participatory and social science methods of research in articulating farmers' perspectives on issues critical to this policy and to urban agriculture in the city. The fieldwork forms part of a social science and action research project, Izindaba Zokudla, that aims to build the capacity of a farmers' organisation in Johannesburg, and to develop programmes for implementation. Farmers, through a series of facilitated participatory workshops, have developed a strategy for organisational development that identified Land and Water (soil), External Stakeholders, Training, Tools and Technology, Marketing, Organisational Development, Permaculture and Security as themes relevant for the development of the organisation and urban agriculture. The ways farmers articulate these priorities afford us a perspective on urban agricultural development in Johannesburg that is crucial for the implementation of policy. The article discusses these themes in the context of the newly formulated policy and explains their significance vis-a-vis the broader assessment of urban agriculture and smallholder agriculture in the literature. The article concludes with comprehensive recommendations for the implementation of urban agriculture programmes in Johannesburg.","Univ Johannesburg, Dept Anthropol & Dev Studies, Dev Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Malan, N (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Anthropol & Dev Studies, Dev Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa.",nmalan@uj.ac.za,,"Malan, Naude/0000-0002-6529-1983",University of Johannesburg's Humanities Research Committee; UJ Teaching and Innovation Fund; Thuthuka Programme of the National Research Foundation [TTK 13061919443],University of Johannesburg's Humanities Research Committee; UJ Teaching and Innovation Fund; Thuthuka Programme of the National Research Foundation,"This paper would not have been possible without the support of the University of Johannesburg's Humanities Research Committee, the UJ Teaching and Innovation Fund and a generous grant (TTK 13061919443) received from the Thuthuka Programme of the National Research Foundation.

If these bubbles are eliminated in advance, it will have a positive impact not only for investors but also for the whole economy of some countries.","[Novotny, Josef] Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Novotny, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",josef.novotny@upce.cz,"Novotný, Josef/E-5011-2015",,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-550-9,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2015,5.0,,5,,,,55,62,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BK1YZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000432426600007,0

The main aim of the paper is to identify the typical consumer of life and non-life insurance in Slovakia through personal, demographic and financial characteristics of individuals. We use the method of classification trees, which allows us to identify the key characteristics of insurance consumers. We point to the fact that there are differences in the characteristics that indicate interest of individuals in insurance protection.

This paper considers the transition challenge from the perspective of dynamic theories on lock-in effects and lock-out options. Within this framework, a successful transition requires a twofold equilibrium: the economic sustainability equilibrium and a corresponding political equilibrium providing the corresponding transition policies. Based on the positive analysis of both current bioeconomy policies and policy demand by bioeconomy actors in Germany, this paper develops recommendations on how a political equilibrium may be achieved which favors a sustainabilityoriented transformation to a bioeconomy. One means of doing so, for example, is to combine a gradual development of existing policies with efforts to identify and support innovative niche products and processes.","[Pannicke, Nadine; Gawel, Erik; Hagemann, Nina; Purkus, Alexandra; Strunz, Sebastian] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Leipzig, Germany; [Gawel, Erik] Univ Leipzig, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Leipzig University,"Pannicke, N (通讯作者)，UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Econ, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",nadine.pannicke@ufz.de,"Strunz, Sebastian/N-3555-2015; Purkus, Alexandra/D-6301-2015","Purkus, Alexandra/0000-0002-5278-261X",,,,,136,33,34,0,37,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The adoption of IFRS adds a new dimension to the deliberations, whether to link tax profits to accounting income or not. The debate on usefulness of IFRS for corporate taxation emerged especially in countries with strong link between accounting and taxation. If the tight form of book-tax conformity is applied, a potential shift to IFRS for taxation purposes may substantially extend or contract the base, which is subject to taxation. High book-tax conformity may be thus an obstacle to incorporate IFRS-based results in calculation of taxable profit.

The paper is based on underlying data of the Research Institute of Agricultural and Food Economics of the Slovak Republic. The aim of the article is to calculate the acreage of small farm, which will be self-sufficient for one average Slovak farm family. Average farm family represents four members. The model of small family farm consists from plant and also from animal production. The paper specifies farm size, which is the minimum area of agricultural land required for existing one farm respectively for one farm family. The paper is based on national Slovak statistics and EUROSTAT data. Data related to Slovak agriculture and farm development are analyzed through the set of basic statistical methods and also through the linear regression. Calculation in the article is in the theoretical way. On this model is possible to solve issue of minimum area with respect to farm specialization. The model in this paper is based on the assumption that the farmer is engaged in the production of all basic commodities of plant production and animal production. This model is very hard realized in practice but on other side there are small farmers who usually specialize in certain special commodities. In the calculation of agricultural land area are calculated total household expenditures per year without food expenditure because the food will be produced on farm and will be consumed by the members of family. The Slovak average family expenditures are in amount 25 872.91 Euro per year and they have to be covered by farming activities. They need to have 88.66 hectares of arable land for covering family expenditures. In this amount of area is not included area of agricultural land required for the production of basic essential commodities - crops needed for human nutrition, calculated on the basis of average consumption per person per year. Area of agricultural land needed for planting and livestock consumption for family food production is in the size of 0.845 hectares. The result size of agricultural land required for the farm family life with 4 members is 89.503 ha.","[Rovny, Patrik; Dobak, Dusan; Cierna, Zuzana] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Trieda A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Rovny, P (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Trieda A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",patrik.rovny@uniag.sk; dusan.dobak@uniag.sk; zuzana.cierna@uniag.sk,,,,,,,9,2,2,0,1,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,354,362,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600040,0

Regional multipliers and social capital are the crucial factors of equilibrium and as a sequence of local development. Interaction between the two local governmental units determines crucially the cooperative implementation of an investment project.

In view of improving of the social-economical position of the regional communities and removing of the negative effects of the border, the local communities are more and more involved in the regional collaboration. The present paper aims to define a baseline for a strategy concerning a potential multi-urban development pole, as specific case Suceava-Cernivtsi. It starts by establishing the actual general framework from economic, behavioural, geopolitical and administrative point of view in terms of the potential that can rise from a crossborder area. Further it gathers few field research conclusions from two field studies, one made on Romania-Ukraine-Republic of Moldova crossborder area and second one on a smaller geographic part, in the Romania-Ukraine crossborder area. Both, the general grounds rising from scientific literature and field research results, are contributing to a part of the SWOT analysis for Suceava-Cernivtsi crossborder area, in terms of opportunities and threats. Also, for this area we fix some reference points relevant for a strategy we will work on a wider research in order to capitalize the potential, as a future step.

In the introductory chapter we address the current knowledge about modeling product innovations diffusion, with an emphasis on the Bass model, its extensions and parameters as diffusion factors. We analyze a normative mechanism by using cultural dimension of individualism/collectivism. This approach is based on our own previous research outcomes, but also on other current researches and their conclusions. We justify it by using correlation and regression analysis to identify relations between this cultural dimension and individual households' consumption by purpose. To quantify individualism and its variability across the European markets we use our own modifications, extension and integration of well-known approaches. Similar approach is used also for identification and variability quantification of informational mechanism factor, based mostly on the equivalency with Uncertainty Avoidance. The separate analysis of these two diffusion factors is followed by the correlation analysis, identifying the relation between them. Subsequently we use these two factors combination and distribution as the main segmentation basis for the European markets.","[Stetka, Peter] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dept Business Adm, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Stetka, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dept Business Adm, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",peter.stetka@euba.sk,"Stetka, Peter/IWE-0211-2023","Stetka, Peter/0000-0001-8444-3332",,,,,56,1,1,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-145-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,779,791,,,,,,13,Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BE3SC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371199400102,0

With the improvement of renewable energy technologies and changes of the financial support systems, the further development of the renewable energy business strongly relies on innovation, in terms of technology and business models. The present article aims at assessing the innovation characteristics of companies that have broadened their domain of activity by investing in renewable energy, as well as to identify which organizational support factors would influence these characteristics the most. The analysis is based on a study of 30 companies that have invested in renewable energy following a corporate entrepreneurship strategy. Results suggest that management support for corporate entrepreneurship and work autonomy are the organizational factors that would support innovation in these diversifying companies the most.

The services sector is one of the main branches of social production, designed to be responsive to the needs and demands of the population. Modern operating conditions of the services sector are marked with a significant level of volatility, which means that the pace of market changes is significantly ahead of the rate at which the subjects of the services sector can provide a response to the changes that have taken place. It is essential for every organization to analyze the environment in which it has to operate, in order to be able to identify the favorable prospects and opportunities at hand and avoid any unwanted effects of negative external factors influencing the situation. Based on this analysis, the optimal strategy for the organization is selected. This is equally true for both the sphere of production and the services sector.

In the expectation that public demand for these apps will increase as both road traffic and smartphone ownership rise, these tools invite consideration alongside other traffic management tools. Traffic app-specific considerations include increased motorist interactivity, consumer technology diffusion, and institutional factors affecting the rollout of e-government initiatives. This article uses the introduction of the MMDA Traffic Navigator a Manila-based, publicly developed traffic app to illustrate these considerations. Additionally, app usage among residents of nearby cities constituting Manila's extended metropolitan region is considered. These considerations are subsequently classified using a 4E framework under economy, effectiveness, efficiency, and equity to inform other authorities' efforts to either incorporate traffic apps into overall transport planning or even take the initiative in developing them.

We analyse these three indicators, as well as the synthetic index of SE, for Romania, over 1999-2012. The synthetic index of shadow economy is further introduced into an econometric model in order to assess its impact on the Romania's economic growth.

Results reported indicate that terrorist incidents can trigger social dynamics that affect trust attitudes; however, these effects are short-lived and dissipate rapidly.","[Arvanitidis, Paschalis; Economou, Athina; Kollias, Christos] Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, 43 Korai St, Volos 38333, Greece",University of Thessaly,"Kollias, C (通讯作者)，Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, 43 Korai St, Volos 38333, Greece.",kollias@uth.gr,"Economou, Athina/ABD-5812-2020; Arvanitidis, Paschalis/AAE-5553-2022","Economou, Athina/0000-0001-5195-8380; Arvanitidis, Paschalis/0000-0003-3799-4101",,,,,93,33,37,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,DEC,2016,169.0,3-4,,,,,231,250,,10.1007/s11127-016-0370-3,0.0,,,20,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,EA3ML,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386506800005,0

In our model contagion risk arises as a result of the individual idiosyncratic failure of each bank in the banking system. Following Guerrero-Gomez and Lopez-Gallo (2004), we use a sequential default algorithm that is useful for tracing the path of contagion from a trigger bank to other banks during several contagion rounds. We test different types of limits on inter-SIB (systematically important banks) exposures, SIB to non-SIB exposures, and non-SIB to all other banks; and we study three different assumptions about banks' behavioural responses under a stricter regulatory lending regime. We also stress test all banks within the banking system and extend the analysis on the benefits of using tighter limits in a fragile banking system. Calibrating the model to Mexican banking sector data, this network model shows that tighter limits for inter-SIB exposures are a useful tool for reducing contagion risk. Moreover, we find that tighter limits may lead to an increase in contagion risk under specific allocation assumptions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The paper then investigates the relative effectiveness of the different media in reducing mortality econometrically. The government adopted awareness generation as an adaptation strategy for heat waves in the year 2003 and intensified the use of public media from 2007 when multiple newspapers and radio and television channels were used for dissemination. I analyze the district-level daily death occurrences due to heat stroke using both linear and non-linear econometric models. Media used on the same day or on previous days are represented in the models by grouping them as either print, audio or video media. The data used is a daily panel data set consisting of only summer days (15th March-20th June) for the years 2005-12 for each of the 30 districts of the state. The estimated models account for the gap in data and the multidimensional nature of the panel, (days, months, years). The results show the repeated use of video media to be the most effective in reducing deaths followed by newspapers and radio. The paper's novel contribution is the use of secondary data to evaluate media and compare media effect of public health communication strategies in a developing country. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We assume that the government cannot commit to the level of a policy instrument before R&D occurs but sets the level to be socially optimal after the results of R&D are realized. The equivalence of price and quantity instruments in inducing innovation that is seen in end-of-pipe abatement models does not hold. When the marginal cost of the dirty technology is constant, then a quota can induce R&D, but a tax is completely ineffective. However, if the marginal cost function of the dirty technology is steep enough, then both a tax and a quotawith tradable permits can induce R&D, and the tax will do so in a wider range of circumstances. Furthermore, in this case, an R&D subsidy may induce R&D and raise welfare whether a tax or a quota regime is in place.","[Datta, Ashokankur] Shiv Nadar Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Econ, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Somanathan, E.] Indian Stat Inst, Econ & Planning Unit, Delhi, India; [Somanathan, E.] South Asian Network Dev & Environm Econ, Kathmandu, Nepal",Shiv Nadar University; Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Delhi,"Datta, A (通讯作者)，Shiv Nadar Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Econ, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India.",ashokankur.datta@snu.edu.in; som@isid.ac.in,,,,,,,18,4,5,0,8,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

The Support Vector Machines Democracy Index (SVMDI) is continuous on the [0,1] interval and enables very detailed and sensitive measurement of democracy for 185 countries in the period between 1981 and 2011. Application of the SVMDI yields results which highlight a robust positive relationship between democracy and economic growth. We argue that the ambiguity in recent studies mainly originates from the lack of sensitivity of traditional democracy indicators. Analyzing transmission channels through which democracy exerts its influence on growth, we conclude that democratic countries feature better educated populations, higher investment shares, and lower fertility rates, but not necessarily higher levels of redistribution.

The federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) was established to help mitigate distress in hard-hit areas by funding the rehabilitation or demolition of troubled properties. This paper analyzes housing market changes in areas that received investments during the second round of NSP funding, focusing on seven large urban counties. Grantees used NSP to invest in census tracts with high rates of distressed and vacant properties, and tracts that had previously received other housing subsidies. The median NSP tract received quite sparse investment, relative to the overall housing stock and the initial levels of distress. Analysis of housing market outcomes indicates the recovery has been uneven across counties and neighborhoods. In a few counties, there is some evidence that NSP2 activity is correlated with improved housing outcomes, primarily increased sales volume.

Using data from the 2010 wave of China Family Panel Studies and administrative records, we apply the internationally comparable method of National Transfer Accounts to estimate incidences and patterns of public transfers by gender. Our results show that, while public health care and pension transfers are remarkably biased against women at old ages, public education transfers are essentially gender-neutral even at the tertiary education level. Gender inequality among older cohorts is largely a legacy of past occupational and earning privileges for males, and the fragmented design of China's health insurance and pension programs. With increasing female advantage in education and a gradual unification of China's social security system, gender gaps in public transfers in China are likely to narrow, though by no means disappear, in the coming years.

Persistent shocks and regional recoveries,JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Regional adjustment; Labor mobility; Job creation; Migration,INTERNAL MIGRATION; MARKET; MODELS,"Although a large body of literature has documented the role of household out-migration in the recovery from regional downturns, the role that firms play in the recovery process has remained a neglected topic of research. Firms may choose to locate new jobs in depressed regions, thereby reducing unemployment through the job creation channel. We present a new empirical model of regional adjustment that permits us to decompose recoveries into both household and firm responses to local economic conditions. The model features a set of auxiliary serial dependence parameters that are used to filter out persistency in the identified labor market shocks, so that changes in employment obtained from the fitted model only reflect the endogenous firm response of interest, and not the ongoing exogenous job destruction from the original downturn. We find that the labor demand response is two to three times larger than the labor supply response, meaning that local job creation and not household out-migration is the main driver of recoveries in the US. This result is robust to a variety of model specifications, identification strategies, and estimation methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Kelly, R; McCann, F",,,,"Kelly, Robert; McCann, Fergal",,,Some defaults are deeper than others: Understanding long-term mortgage arrears,JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Mortgages; Default; Days past due; Affordability,DETERMINANTS,"The 2007-2008 financial crisis yielded a significant number of delinquent mortgage loans, which ordinarily would have faced foreclosure and repossession. However, given the negative externalities of repossession, policy response has shifted towards forbearance and mortgage modification, which has led to longer spells in default for delinquent mortgage holders. It is therefore imperative to move beyond binary models of default towards an understanding of the factors that drive the depth of default spells. Exploiting a highly detailed dataset on financially distressed households in Ireland in 2012 and 2013, we are able to identify the impact of a range of current household-level factors, generally not available in loan-level studies of mortgage default, on the probability of entering early and deep states of mortgage default. Our results suggest that high loan-to-value ratios, consumer credit growth, shocks to mortgage affordability and unemployment should all trigger serious concerns among policy makers regarding subsequent stability in the mortgage market, with these measures all shown to have differentially large impacts on entry to deep, relative to early-stage arrears.

In this article we examine how two well-documented, relatively successful and longstanding initiatives, the Orangi Pilot Project and an Alliance of Indian partners, met these challenges. They were met through social innovation, but also through the choice and development of sanitation technologies (simplified sewers for OPP and community toilet blocks for the Indian Alliance) that provided traction for the social innovations. We also explore more recent efforts by civil society partnerships in four African cities, demonstrating some of the difficulties they have faced in trying to overcome these challenges. No equivalent models have emerged, though there has been considerable progress against particular challenges in particular places. These findings confirm the importance of the challenges, and indicate that these are not just challenges for social organization, but also for technology design and choice. For example, the problem with household pit latrines is not that they cannot physically be improved to sufficiently, but that they are not well-suited to the social, economic and political challenges of sanitary improvement at scale. The findings also indicate that a low economic status and a tendency to treat sanitation as a private good not suitable for public support also makes the sanitation challenges difficult to overcome.

This distribution, which we refer to as the multivariate moments expansion (MME), admits any non-Gaussian (multivariate) distribution as its basis because it is specified. directly in terms of the basis density's moments. To obtain the expansion of the Gaussian density, the MME is a reformulation of the multivariate Gram-Charlier (MGC), but the MME is much simpler and tractable than the MGC when positive transformations are used to produce well-defined densities. As an empirical application, we extend the dynamic conditional equicorrelation (DECO) model to an SNP framework using the MME. The resulting model is parameterized in a feasible manner to admit two-stage consistent estimation and it represents the DECO as well as the salient non-Gaussian features of portfolio return distributions. The in- and out-of-sample performance of a MME-DECO model of a portfolio of 10 assets demonstrate that it can be a useful tool for risk management purposes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We present a DSGE model with financial intermediation as in Celtics and Kaladi (2011). The estimation of shocks and of the structural parameters shows that time-variation should be crucial in any attempted empirical analysis. Since DSGE modelling usually fails to take into account inherent nonlinearities of the economy, we propose a novel time-varying parameter (TVP) state-space estimation method for VAR processes both for homoskedastic and heteroskedastic error structures. We conduct an exhaustive empirical exercise to compare the out of-sample predictive performance of the estimated DSGE model with that of standard ARs, VARs, Bayesian VARs and TVP-VARs. We find that the TVP-VAR provides the best forecasting performance for the series of GDP and net worth of financial intermediaries for all steps-ahead, while the DSGE model outperforms the other specifications in forecasting inflation and the federal funds rate at shorter horizons.

We do this by means of a simulation experiment. We use an estimated DSGE model to simulate all the macroeconomic data needed to assess the CABB according to the official EC methodology. Additionally, the model contains an expenditure fiscal rule that accounts for non-automatic variation in the budget, which allows us to observe the true discretionary measures of fiscal policy. Our results indicate that the EC methodology frequently fails to identify the true fiscal policy stance and also frequently fails to correctly signal potential violations of the SGP limit on structural deficit. In the latter case triggering corrective fiscal contractions to comply with the SGP results in increased macroeconomic instability. In addition, we show that allowing for a bigger role for stability-oriented discretionary policy and thus relaxing the SGP limit on structural deficit could enhance the stabilization efficiency of fiscal policy without reducing the degree of compliance with the Maastricht Treaty. These conclusions apply to small countries in a monetary union as well as large countries with independent monetary policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Congress instructs regulators to consider factors that result in lower levels of historic default in defining a QRM. We analyze non-agency loans and find credit scores and loan-to-value ratios are among the most significant predictors of default, even when controlling for risky loan products and loose underwriting standards. Importantly, credit scores and loan-to-value ratios better tradeoff the benefit of reduced default risk with the cost of limiting access to capital than most factors, yet are absent from the final QRM definition.

There is also a positive seigniorage effect when part of the revenue goes to entrepreneurs, acting as a subsidy to R&D. When the government retains a larger share of the revenue, the government crowding-out effect dominates, and inflation retards growth. When entrepreneurs get the larger share, the seignior age effect dominates, and inflation increases growth. Both OLS (ordinary least squares) and IV (instrumental variable) regressions using time-series data during 1979-2014 in China show that differenced inflation (to ensure stationarity) has a significantly positive effect on growth. When we use the level of inflation, we find that a 1 percentage point increase in annual inflation would bring a 0.53 percentage point increase in annual growth of per worker real GDP.

The study critically considers case studies and conceptual approaches in REDD+ and Climate Smart Landscapes projects and their commitment to landscape, or territory, as the spatial governance unit. The review highlights some promising partial steps toward territorialization as a good practice, but finds that most do not follow up the implications for governance. The paper asserts that landscape as an analytical understanding of forest peoples' space contains serious-defects it does not set up the essential architecture and mechanisms for social owning and holistic management of designated (forest) space as territory, it does not address the contestations around whose territory?, and a landscape discourse can obfuscate the actual practice of REDD+ programs. Territorialization would involve situating legitimate land users' rights at the core of REDD+ spatial planning and implementation. Forest landscapes as territories would legitimize the entitlements of forest peoples to govern their own lands, with the responsibilities and rewards of their experience of effective management. The community and its social territorial space would become the definitive spatial unit for operationalizing REDD+, rather than the ecological unit or watershed, by prioritizing upwardly institutionalized territory over bio-physical spatializations of landscape. A territorial perspective should shift some power away from global and national policy-setters to local actors (not only registered landowners), as central in REDD+ governance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that for the entire population, around 44 per cent of total medical spending is paid by private insurance, but there is a substantial difference by age in terms of financing medical care: for working-age adults (25 to 64 years old), private insurance covers around 57 per cent of total medical spending, whereas for the elderly (aged 65 or over), the largest payer is the government, which covers 65 per cent of the total. Inpatient hospital care accounts for a third of aggregate medical expenditures. Medical spending is highly concentrated: the top 5 per cent of spenders account for more than half of the total. An even higher concentration is observed with hospital spending, where the top 5 per cent of spenders contribute around 80 per cent. The concentration in medical spending decreases with age: the Gini coefficient of total medical spending is 0.75 for people between ages 25 and 64 and 0.63 for people aged 65 or over. We find that the average medical spending of people in the bottom income quintile is higher than that of people in the top income quintile for all age groups. In terms of persistence of medical spending, we find that the correlation of medical expenditure in two consecutive years is 0.36. When persistence is measured by quintile of the medical spending distribution, the medical spending of people in the bottom and top quintiles has higher persistence than that of other groups.","[Pashchenko, Svetlana] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Porapakkarm, Ponpoje] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Pashchenko, S (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",svetlana@uga.edu; p-porapakkarm@grips.ac.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [15K03505]; GRIPS's Policy Research Center; ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03505] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); GRIPS's Policy Research Center; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors thank Eric French, two anonymous referees and all seminar participants at the 'Medical Spending across the Developed World' workshop at the Institute for Fiscal Studies for their comments and suggestions.

The IFSB, while endorsing the Basel III accord, modified the criteria to calculate the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) to cater for the unique aspects of the Islamic banking industry. In this paper, we calculated the modified NSFR of 136 Islamic banks from 30 jurisdictions between 2000 and 2013 and explored the potential impact the requirements of this ratio has on the financial stability of Islamic banks after controlling for bank, country, and market-specific variables. The empirical findings suggest that the modified NSFR has a positive impact on the financial stability of Islamic banks during the sample period. However, the marginal impact of the NSFR on stability diminishes as the size of the bank increases. The results remained robust after applying an alternative measure of stability and using an alternative estimation model based on an instrumental variable approach. These results validate the use of the IFSB's modified NSFR for Islamic banks as a regulatory measure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A broad discussion in the media emerged, provoking civil society as well as politics to get involved in a debate over fair prices for farmers. During the milk strike, consumers in Germany were to a large extent sympathetic with the farmers, while food retailers were seen as the main cause of the problem. However, the question what fairness and a fair revenue distribution in food production meant remained unanswered. Hence, this study aims to analyze consumer perceptions of what a fair revenue distribution is in food chains and to determine what factors contribute to fairness perceptions of the farmers' share. Through an online survey conducted in November 2012, German consumers were asked to estimate the distribution of the food dollar among different supply chain partners and to indicate what a fair distribution should look like. This paper contributes to the literature of the perceived unfair compensation of farmers and provides empirical examples of the concepts of distributive, procedural and interactional fairness. The findings of the survey showed that farmers are mainly perceived as being treated unfairly in supply chains and should get more compensation from a consumer's point of view. Food retailing should mainly lose shares in this context. A fair distribution of revenues is influenced by distributive considerations, process control and interactional fairness, revealing that non-monetary aspects are also influencing fairness perceptions of revenue distribution in food chains.

To accomplish this, we estimate the annualized expected loss on each fund's portfolio. We also calculate by Monte Carlo the cost of insuring a fund against losses amounting to over 50 basis points. We find that credit risk of prime MMFs, though small, doubled from 12 basis points in June 2011 to 23 basis points in December 2011 before receding in 2012. Contrary to common perceptions, this did not primarily reflect funds' credit exposure to eurozone banks because funds took measures to reduce this exposure. Instead, credit risk in prime MMFs rose because of the deteriorating credit outlook of banks in the Asia/Pacific region. We conclude that the increase in the credit risk of prime MMFs in the second half of 2011 reflected contagion in the worldwide banking system coupled with slowing global economic growth, not actions taken by MMFs.

Field experiments were conducted with 207 participants in two U.S. states in fall 2014 to address these questions. Consumers' perceptions and WTP varied significantly by retail outlet, with farmers markets and fresh format stores receiving the most favorable evaluations and supercenters the least. With FSMA information, safety perceptions fell significantly for the favored outlets and mostly increased for supercenters. Participants' felt no producers should be exempt from the FSMA and viewed farmers markets vendors as most likely to be exempt. Unexpectedly though, these changes seldom translated into changes in WTP. Further, in treatments with added tomato safety information, supercenters saw no safety rating benefit.

Each region was examined individually and then across region comparisons were made to try to understand the impacts of major climate variables: average temperature, temperature range, and seasonal rainfall. Using both linear regression and panel data regression models, the major findings are that HYVs for both Aman and Boro rice varieties have less capacity to cope with changing climate conditions in contrast to TVs. Therefore, government should help to promote research and development aimed at developing more climate tolerant varieties, particularly temperature tolerant HYVs which have the potential to solidify the country's food security situation at least in terms of food availability.","[Hasan, M.

Investigation in this paper contributes to the literature by covering the non-linear and dynamic relationship to know whether external debt affects the real economic sector of selected CESEE countries. The results of the Generalized Method of Moments based on a dynamic panel data indicate that the impact of external debt on gross domestic product was negative and significant in mentioned countries.

The ownership of the technology allows the creation of a market system that can solve the free-rider problem. I show that if the producing consortium has the bargaining power, the technology can always be developed and fully adopted and all gains from cooperation can be realized. If the bargaining power is shared between the consortiums, the aggregate welfare greatly improves and the technology can almost be fully adopted when the gains are sufficiently large.","[Zavaleta, Armando] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Tippie Coll Business, W338 PBB, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Iowa,"Zavaleta, A (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Tippie Coll Business, W338 PBB, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",armando-zavaleta@uiowa.edu,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Dependence modeling using vine copulas offers a greater flexibility and permits the modeling of complex dependency patterns for high-dimensional distributions. Using a sample of more than 10 years of daily return observations of the WTI crude oil, the Dow Jones Industrial average stock index and the trade weighted US dollar index returns, we find evidence of a significant and symmetric relationship between these variables. Considering different sample periods show that the dynamic of the relationship between returns is not constant over time. Our results indicate also that the dependence structure is highly affected by the financial crisis and Great Recession, over 2007-2009. Finally, there is evidence to suggest that the application of the vine copula model improves the accuracy of VaR estimates, compared to traditional approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It uses the ideas in that essay to construct a general argument about the ways in which capitalism dominates household producers. The first section summarizes the arguments of Bernstein's essay and relates them to key passages of A.V. Chayanov's work. The second section builds a model of how commercial capitalism worked in the produce trades of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The third section proposes a wider taxonomy, where the differences between commercial and industrial capital and their respective forms of domination of the countryside are laid out. The key category here is vertical integration as a form/strategy of accumulation chiefly characteristic of the latter. The fourth section suggests that we need to take merchant capitalism more seriously as a historical category as well as one of theory, rejecting the idea that merchant's capital exclusively inhabits the circulation sphere'.","[Banaji, Jairus] Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Dev Studies, Thornhaugh St, London WC1X 0XG, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Banaji, J (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Dev Studies, Thornhaugh St, London WC1X 0XG, England.",jb67@soas.ac.uk,,,,,,,101,43,46,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

However, the counterparty exposures are small, especially among banks that face diversification regulations, and do not typically cause a cascade of failures.

Persistent budget deficits and over-optimistic budget forecasts have been observed in many countries in the past, especially in the euro area. To prevent such developments from happening in the future, fiscal rules have been revised or implemented with the aim to strengthen both preventive (ex-ante) and corrective (ex-post) elements of fiscal rules frameworks. Do such ex-ante and ex-post rules differ in their effects? In an attempt to answer this question, we build a two-period model and distinguish between ex-ante rules that apply to budget forecasts and ex-post rules that apply to realized budget deficits. Our model indicates that effectively enforced ex-post rules are more effective than ex-ante rules at reducing budget deficits. Interestingly, ex-ante rules differ from ex-post rules in their effects on forecasting biases. Only ex-post sanctions reduce forecasting biases, while ex-ante rules have no impact on such biases. In addition, we show that political stability and the size of government increase the effectiveness of fiscal rules. If, however, financial markets have a disciplining effect on governments, the effectiveness of fiscal rules is reduced. Our results imply that if fiscal policy rules cannot be effectively enforced, reforming other areas such as electoral rules or financial market regulations might be a more promising approach to ensuring sound public finances than fiscal policy rules.","[Baldi, Guido] Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Bern, Switzerland; [Baldi, Guido] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany",University of Bern; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Baldi, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Bern, Switzerland.;Baldi, G (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",guido.baldi@vwi.unibe.ch,,,,,,,18,6,6,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Explicit indexing and closet indexing by active funds are associated with countries' regulatory and financial market environments. We find that actively managed funds are more active and charge lower fees when they face more competitive pressure from low-cost explicitly indexed funds. A quasi-natural experiment using the exogenous variation in indexed funds generated by the passage of pension laws supports a causal interpretation of the results. Moreover, the average alpha generated by active management is higher in countries with more explicit indexing and lower in countries with more closet indexing.

While economists dispute the extent of the decline, few now question that a decline has taken place or that excess saving has played a causal role. A key implication of this narrative is a decline in yields of all assets, including but not restricted to government bond yields. Yet, since the turn of the century, yields on global equity have risen. A complementary explanation is that there has been an increase in the global equity risk premium (ERP), which has simultaneously pushed risk-free yield curves lower and equity yields higher. Applying a sign restrictions approach, I find that excess savings shocks were the predominant force affecting global real bond yields between the mid-1980s and 2000 but that risk premium' shocks have accounted for more of the decline in real bond yields since 2000.","[Daly, Kevin] Goldman Sachs Int, New York, NY USA",,"Daly, K (通讯作者)，Goldman Sachs, Peterborough Court, 133 Fleet St, London EC4A 2BB, England.",kevin.daly@gs.com,,,,,,,27,3,4,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

The analysis of over one thousand country-year observations for 93 countries during the 1999-2010 period reveals that a country's debt level is likely to increase with higher ratings, confirming the existence of pro-cyclicality and path dependence of ratings. In addition, the study finds no evidence to support the theory of Political Business Cycle, which implies that political ambitions may lead to fiscal worsening following a rating upgrade. The study findings further demonstrate that institutional quality is an important factor in the ratings-fiscal discipline nexus.

Results indicate that U.S. consumers are more likely to tip occupations for which (i) workers' performances can be more easily evaluated by consumers than by managers, (ii) workers provide customized service, (iii) workers' income, skill and needed judgment are low, and (iv) workers are less happy than customers during the service encounter. Occupations with greater frequency of customer patronage and/or greater likelihood of encountering the same service provider on multiple service occasions are not more likely than other occupations to be tipped. These findings support some and disconfirm other expectations derived from a theory that occupational differences in tipping are attributable to occupation characteristics that more strongly/consistently evoke motives for tipping. They also identify types of services for which counter-normative tipping policies are more or less likely to be successful and suggest sources of resistance that must be overcome if those policies are to succeed.

We find stronger evidence for the model's predictive power at the individual level than what the existing literature suggests. This finding is robust to stakes. However, the model's predictive power is highly reduced if subjects can reciprocate others' actions. This suggests that parameter estimates obtained in an environment that allows for reciprocal responses yield a bias in the parameter estimates. In particular, previous estimates (especially of the disutility of disadvantageous inequity aversion) may overestimate the importance of inequity aversion. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The preferred estimates indicate that climate change will increase electricity demand by 6.7% with 4% p.a. GDP growth and 8.5% with 6% p.a. GDP growth in 2030 over the reference scenario of no climate change. This reflects the fact that the estimated marginal effect of a hotter climate is greater when income is higher.

A model-based scenario general equilibrium analysis,ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SUSTAINABILITY IMPACT ASSESSMENT; CDM PROJECTS; DELIVER,"Since 2000, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol has included southern countries in the fight against climate change by encouraging northern countries to make environmentally friendly direct investments at the lowest cost in these developing nations. Although CDM investments have enjoyed great success, the question of the contribution of these investments to the development of the host countries remains insufficiently explored. This paper offers a computable general equilibrium model-based scenario, describing the potential economic and environmental impacts of CDM investments for Mexico. As modelled in this study, these investments should generate both additional demand for activities that produce the fixed capital goods required for their implementation and environmentally friendly technological changes in the production process for the electricity sector. The numerical simulations reveal the growth potential and important fund of development represented by the CDM for Mexico; however, they show that the environmental impact also appears broadly mixed and dependent on both the nature of the sectors it affects and the intensity of the technological change it generates.","[Montaud, Jean-Marc; Pecastaing, Nicolas] Univ Pau & Pays Adour, Ctr Theoret Anal & Handling Econ Data, Ave Doyen Poplawski,BP 1633, F-64016 Pau, France",Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour,"Montaud, JM; Pecastaing, N (通讯作者)，Univ Pau & Pays Adour, Ctr Theoret Anal & Handling Econ Data, Ave Doyen Poplawski,BP 1633, F-64016 Pau, France.",jean-marc.montaud@univ-pau.fr; nicolas.pecastaing@univ-pau.fr,,"pecastaing, nicolas/0000-0003-0274-3441",,,,,42,0,0,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

We concentrate on the central bank's marginal lending and deposit facilities. Since interbank trades are usually over-the-counter transactions, we use a bilateral bargaining model and apply the Nash bargaining solution. We determine the threat points and the bargaining frontier of debtor banks and creditor banks in the interbank markets. We show that a decrease in the central bank's marginal lending rate always reduces the probability for reaching a bargaining solution. In contrast, the chances that the banks agree on an interbank loan can both decrease or increase following a reduction in the deposit rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We study asymmetric volatility for daily S&P 500 index returns and VIX index changes, thereby examining the relation between extreme changes in risk-neutral volatility expectations, i.e. market stress, and aggregate asset prices. To this aim, we model market returns, implied VIX market volatility and volatility of volatility, showing that the latter is asymmetric in that past positive volatility shocks drive positive shocks to volatility of volatility. Our main result documents the existence of a significant extreme asymmetric volatility effect as we find contemporaneous volatility-return tail dependence for crashes but not for booms. We then outline aggregate market price implications of extreme asymmetric volatility, indicating that under volatility feedback a one-in-a-hundred trading day innovation to average VIX implied volatility, for example, relates to an expected market drop of more than 4 percent.

The test can be viewed as a variation of Kendall's tau conditional on the state and has an asymptotic chi(2)-distribution. A refined version of the test is derived based on the Markov chain theory of regenerative cycles which substantially improves finite sample size and power properties. I show that the test has power against local alternatives, which is nonetheless compromised due to a finite sample convergence bound put on the implied local alternative data generating process. I evaluate the new test against traditional correlation-based measures and demonstrate power attrition of a state-free tail dependence test as parameter values are varied. Broad market-based ETFs and international indices are studied and in most cases there is no compelling evidence for asymmetric comovement across states.

Using seasoned equity offering announcement returns, we estimate through linear prediction and propensity-score matching the share price drop that stock acquirers experience due to the financing choice. Net of this effect, stock-financed acquisitions are not value destructive, and the method of payment generally has no further explanatory power in the cross-section of acquirer returns.

We find that RI combined with a preference for early resolution of uncertainty could lead to a significant drop in the share of portfolios held in risky assets, even when the departure from the standard expected utility setting with full-information rational expectations is small. In addition, we show that the equilibrium equity premium increases with the degree of inattention because inattentive investors with recursive utility face greater long-run risk and thus require higher compensation in equilibrium.","[Luo, Yulei] Univ Hong Kong, Econ, Fac Business & Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Young, Eric R.] Univ Virginia, Econ, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Hong Kong; University of Virginia,"Luo, YL (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Econ, Fac Business & Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Young, ER (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Econ, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",yulei.luo@gmail.com; ey2d@virginia.edu,"Luo, Yulei/A-4398-2010","Luo, Yulei/0000-0001-9467-4097",Hong Kong General Research Fund (GRF) [HKU791913]; HKU seed funding program for basic research,Hong Kong General Research Fund (GRF); HKU seed funding program for basic research(University of Hong Kong),"We thank Pok-sang Lam (the Editor) and two anonymous referees for many constructive comments and suggestions.

In addition to comparing overall wage levels, we examine the differences in the wage structures, specifically, the relative wages by gender, age, education, and region. The size of the public sector wage premium depends crucially on the size of the private companies chosen as the comparison group. Wage gaps by gender and educational attainment are smaller in the public sector than they are in private companies. The public sector's age wage profile is steeper than that of the private sector. Public sector wages are more compressed. In other words, the wages are relatively higher at the lower end of the wage distribution and relatively lower at the higher end. The regional wage differentials are smaller in the public sector. Here, the wage levels of public sector workers are relatively higher in rural regions and relatively lower in large metropolitan regions. To ensure the efficient provision of public services, it is inappropriate to compare only mean wages. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Capital alone, as a small cash loan or grant, is not sufficient to grow women-owned subsistence-level firms. However, it can work if it is delivered in-kind to more successful women microentrepreneurs, and it should boost the performance of women's larger-sized SMEs. Very poor women need a more intensive package of services than do less poor women to break out of subsistence production and grow their businesses. What works for young women does not necessarily work for adult women. Skills training, job search assistance, internships, and wage subsidies increase the employment levels of adult women but do not raise wages. However, similar interventions increase young women's employability and earnings if social restrictions are not binding. Women who run subsistence-level firms face additional social constraints when compared to similar men, thus explaining the differences in the outcomes of some loans, grants, and training interventions that favor men. Social constraints may also play a role in explaining women's outcome gains that are short-lasting or emerge with a delay. The good news is that many of the additional constraints that women face can be overcome by simple, inexpensive adjustments in program design that lessen family and social pressures. These include providing capital in-kind or transacted through the privacy of a mobile phone and providing secure savings accounts to nudge women to keep the money in the business rather than to divert it to non-business uses.","[Buvinic, Mayra; Furst-Nichols, Rebecca] United Nations Fdn, Washington, DC 20006 USA",,"Buvinic, M (通讯作者)，United Nations Fdn, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",mayra.buvinic@gmail.com; rfurst.nichols@gmail.com,,,ExxonMobil Foundation,ExxonMobil Foundation(Exxon Mobil Corporation),"Mayra Buvinic (corresponding author) is Senior Fellow at the United Nations Foundation; email address: mayra.buvinic@gmail.com.

Using Chinese provincial-level panel data, we find that a higher ratio of new members in the standing committee of the local Communist Party is correlated with a higher housing sales/gross domestic product (GDP) ratio. Moreover, more new members in the standing committee are also associated with a lower level of GDP per capita and a lower manufacturing output growth rate. The results on the size of the real estate sector are robust to dealing with the endogeneity of the ratio of new standing committee members.

These banks are affected by the European regulation on variable pay, but, to our knowledge, their usage of stock options has not been examined in previous studies. Paying bankers with stock options can generate two types of managerial incentives, namely, incentives to improve performance and incentives to take risk. Controlling for incentives to improve performance, we find that banks' total risk and insolvency risk increase with the risk-taking incentives induced by stock options.

Transshipment enables traffic consolidation and the related scale economies in ship size, rationalization of shipping routes and adjustment of ship capacity to traffic density, and expanding the number of ports covered by the shipping network. This paper provides an assessment of the current state of transshipment with a particular reference to the potential impacts of the expansion of the Panama Canal on this activity in the Caribbean basin. While US East Coast ports are expecting an increase in the size of ships deployed on the through-Panama services following the Canal expansion from the current Panamax to post-Panamax ships, it is argued that substituting direct calling by feedering and expanded transshipment activities in Caribbean hubs is more likely. This transformation in service pattern will be gradual, however. In the first period after the expansion the present direct calling is expected to continue, since post-Panamax ships initially deployed on through-Panama services will not differ much than those on through-Suez services already calling the US.

Introduced by the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union (EU) in 2008, the abolishment of restrictions on the planting of new vineyards is still a subject of controversial discussions regarding possible effects on the sector's structure and the quantity of wine production. For a simulation of these effects, this study uses partial equilibrium modeling and Markov chain projection. The results reveal that the effects of abolishment of planting rights depend on the assumed wine must prices. Relatively high market prices for wine must would lead to increases in the production of both standard and basic quality wine must and in the number of more cost-effective wine farms in the region. If low prices for wine must are assumed, the reform might result only in minor impacts.","[Bogonos, Mariia; Engler, Barbara; Dabbert, Stephan] Univ Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany; [Oberhofer, Juergen; Dressler, Marc] Dienstleistungszentrum Landlicher Raum Rheinpfalz, Neustadt, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Bogonos, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Farm Management 410a, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",mbogonos@yahoo.com,"Dressler, Marc/X-3775-2019","Dressler, Marc/0000-0003-2362-0993","Ministerium Umwelt, Landwirtschaft, Ernahrung, Weinbau und Forsten in Rheinland-Pfalz","Ministerium Umwelt, Landwirtschaft, Ernahrung, Weinbau und Forsten in Rheinland-Pfalz","The authors thank the Ministerium Umwelt, Landwirtschaft, Ernahrung, Weinbau und Forsten in Rheinland-Pfalz for financial support for this project and the Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz for providing the data.

Initially, we explore the determinants of the saving behaviour of children aged 11-15. Our findings suggest that parental allowances/pocket money (earnings from part-time work) lower (increase) the probability that a child saves. There is also evidence that the financial expectations of the head of household have an influence on their offspring's saving behaviour, where children of optimistic parents have a lower probability of saving by approximately 2 percentage points. However, there is no evidence of an intergenerational correlation in savings behaviour: the saving behaviour of parents appears to have no bearing on the saving decisions of their offspring. We then go on to explore the implications of the saving behaviour of children for their savings decisions in later life, specifically when observed in early adulthood. We find that having saved as a child has a large positive influence both on the probability of saving on a monthly basis and on the amount saved as an adult. This finding is robust to alternative empirical strategies including IV analysis where the most conservative estimates show that having saved as a child increases the probability of saving during adulthood by 12 percentage points.

Input (labor, capital and energy) use efficiency may be defined as the ratio of input use to gross domestic product. However, this ratio or measurement is not a good indicator of input use efficiency. Improvements in input use refer to a reduction in input used for a given output or GDP, then they indicate input use efficiency. Hence, either deterministic (DEA) or non-deterministic (stochastic frontier approach) approaches within the framework of production theory have been used to measure input use efficiency. This paper also aims to make some policy implications on input use efficiency. (C) 2016 The Authors.

This paper examines how the cash flow rights of the banks' controlling owners are associated with the need for special connections with banks, which is a proxy measure of connected lending. Using data from more than 2,600 firms across 25 countries, this study finds that the cash flow rights increase the need for special connections, but the increase becomes smaller as the cash flow rights increase. No evidence is found that the cash flow rights result in a decrease in the need for special connections. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Using nonparametric regressions, we find a robust U-shaped relationship between the U.S. current account and the GDP cycle. When output is above (below) its trend the current account and detrended output are positively (negatively) correlated.

While labor productivity grew rapidly, there was only moderate growth in milk per cow and no improvement in milk output per unit of feed.

Intrepid researchers have estimated individual components of the US crisis' costs that range from lost GDP, depleted wealth, outlays and subsidies expended to rescue troubled financial and commercial firms, increased post-crisis regulation and supervision, and damage done to the social fabric by higher unemployment, escalating bankruptcies and foreclosures, greater income and wealth inequality, reduced access to medical services, lower fertility, skyrocketing student debt, and growing political alienation. Yet there is no comprehensive discussion of the full panoply of the costs that the United States has endured. This chapter seeks to fill this gap by surveying and critiquing estimates of many individual components of the crisis' costs. In doing so, it argues that, on the one hand, estimates of lost GDP exaggerate the cost when they compare recession values to pre-crisis trend GDP. Pre-crisis trends have been seriously overstated by failing to notice that growth in labor, capital services, and productivity was already declining before the crisis hit. On the other hand, official estimates of the cost of assisting troubled firms with equity capital, loans, and guarantees seriously underestimate the true costs of this particular response to the crisis.","[Garcia, Gillian G.

The program provides compensation for loss of income due to environmentally-friendly production. Also presented brief information on the implementation of this program at national level. In this study we omitted the analysis of soil, water and environmental indicators. Author analysed the impact of environmental payments on income and economics of the surveyed farms. Data and methods: Author performed research of large-scale farms (> 100 ha UAA) and used the statistical analysis and ratio analysis in the field of economic and production situation of these farms. The technical efficiency of these farms was estimated by using the parametric method (Stochastic Frontier Analysis). Then its determinants were indicated by using the panel models. Results: The greatest amount of realized agri-environment payments was observed in Zachodnio-pomorskie, Wielkopolskie and Warminsko-mazurskie voivodeships (Polish name of regional units). In those provinces of Poland are the biggest farms. There is an area of the NATURA 2000, too. Farms with the largest area and the biggest scale of production can more easily overcome administrative barriers associated with obtaining environmental subsidies. In the rest of the country the program didn't use widely instrument of the CAP due to a number of formal requirements and transaction costs. The largest farms participated in many programs of support and the farmers wanted to maximize the amount of the subsidy. The average value of the subsidy was over 800 thousands zlotys. The amount of subsidies were so high that determined the economic results of the farms (liquidity, profitability or efficiency). Conclusions: The main theoretical basis for environmental analysis is welfare economics, which is a subdiscipline within the framework of neoclassical economics. The main objective of agri-environmental program is to improve the natural environment and rural areas by reducing the negative impact of agricultural production. The biggest areas where agri-environmental program was implemented are mainly in the northern Poland. Beneficiaries of the program were mainly the biggest farms. This instrument of CAP had significant impact on economic indicators.","[Goral, Justyna] IAFE NRI, Math Applicat Agr Econ Dept, Swietokrzyska 20, PL-00002 Warsaw, Poland",,"Góral, J (通讯作者)，IAFE NRI, Math Applicat Agr Econ Dept, Swietokrzyska 20, PL-00002 Warsaw, Poland.",justyna.goral@ierigz.waw.pl,,,,,,,37,2,2,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,113,124,,,,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000014,0

In this article, the authors illustrate this challenge and conduct a quantitative assessment of the impact of changes in oil prices in a small open economy in which oil represents an important fraction of its exports. They build a monetary, three-sector, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model and estimate it for the Colombian economy. They model the oil sector as an optimal resource extracting problem and show that in oil-exporting economies the macroeconomic effects vary according to the degree of persistence of oil price shocks. The main channels through which these shocks pass to the economy come from the real exchange rate, the country risk premium, and sluggish price adjustments. Inflation-targeting central banks in such economies face a policy dilemma: raise the policy rate to fight increased inflation coming from the exchange rate passthrough or lower it to stimulate a slowing economy.","[Hamann, Franz; Bejarano, Jesus; Rodriguez, Diego] Macroecon Modeling Div, Banco, Colombia; [Restrepo-Echavarria, Paulina] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Hamann, F (通讯作者)，Macroecon Modeling Div, Banco, Colombia.",,"; Bejarano, Jesus/A-2573-2019; Restrepo-Echavarria, Paulina/I-5751-2016","Hamann, Franz/0000-0002-4394-4680; Bejarano, Jesus/0000-0002-8375-5753; Restrepo-Echavarria, Paulina/0000-0002-1481-051X",,,,,17,2,3,0,12,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

The collaborative economy represents a new way of thinking about business, exchange, value and community. While its definitions are varied and parameters continue to evolve, activities and models within the collaborative economy enable access instead of ownership, encourage decentralized networks over centralized institutions, provide new models to unlock wealth and often do so to a wider group of stakeholders. They make use of idle assets and create new marketplaces. The burgeoning peer-to-peer economy has also disrupted traditional business models and is extending to new and different types of markets and as such provides plenty of opportunities for entrepreneurial activity across different industries and fields. In the new realm, companies can explore how to provide value by enabling peer-to-peer sharing or company-enabled platforms for sharing. First-mover companies can benefit from the collaborative economy trend instead of seeing it as a threat to their existing business. Existing enterprises have clear assets, such as established brands, channels and financial muscles with which they can become the leaders in the collaborative economy if they only manage to rethink their business logic. Brands are understood as communicative objects that the brand manager wants consumers to buy into a symbolic universe as defined, in part, by the brand identity. Consumers view brands as a key part of a product as they hold and convey meaning well beyond a product's physical characteristics. Brands are a key element of the company's relationships with its customers. This paper will provide an extensive literature and example review of current examples of established brand businesses operating in the sharing economy. The examples will showcase how existing brands can be extended with elements of the collaborative economy. Another result of the paper is to highlight practical examples for existing businesses and brands on how they can start their involvement in the collaborative sphere and what kind of competitive advantage lies therein. We demonstrate that when established brands enter the collaborative consumption space, they can achieve a distinct competitive advantage that is extremely difficult to copy and thus sustains better leading to improved corporate performance and strengthened brand value.","[Harmaala, Minna-Maari] Haaga Helia Univ Appl Sci, 13 Ratapihantie St, FI-00520 Helsinki, Finland",Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences,"Harmaala, MM (通讯作者)，Haaga Helia Univ Appl Sci, 13 Ratapihantie St, FI-00520 Helsinki, Finland.",minna-maari.harmaala@haaga-helia.fi,,,,,,,63,0,0,2,22,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,219,233,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300017,0

This article focuses on the key aspects in development of CSDP and on EU relations with its main partner in security sphere, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).","[Kana, Radomir; Mynarzova, Monika] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Kana, R (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",radomir.kana@vsb.cz; monika.mynarzova@vsb.cz,"Kaňa, Radomír/J-3437-2018; Mynarzova, Monika/F-1328-2018","Kaňa, Radomír/0000-0001-8186-0536; Mynarzova, Monika/0000-0002-5982-6363",,,,,21,2,2,1,17,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Our analysis shows that banks, in general, that have complied with Basel II have not apparently reduced the growth of corporate loans.

The purpose of the article is a review of existing indicators of teamwork effectiveness and to determine the used of the teamwork measures and to test if these indicators are correlated with the applied assessment of organizational performance. Methodology/methods The study was conducted using a paper and pencil questionnaire. The final sample consisted of 161 Polish companies from the public and private sectors. The survey was conducted in 2014. Senior executives were approached to respond to a survey. Scientific aim The main aim is to carry out an evaluation in terms of use the teamwork measures in the practice of the enterprises and to determine the relation between the dimensions of team effectiveness: member behavior, team attitudes, team productivity and organizational performance like output measures and competitiveness. Findings The research results indicate the use of teamwork measures and the existence of relations between the dimensions of measuring teamwork effectiveness. In addition, the relations between the measurement of the dimensions and the measurement of organizational results are also significant, but analysis does not indicate any links between the used indicators of team effectiveness and the measures of competitive position. Conclusions The research results indicate the direction of improving the existing indiactors for team measurement, which should not be unnecessarily extended with many measures, but should focus on the most important indicators for the organization like output measures.

This paper deals with the issue whether or not the Maastricht criteria are good indicators for deciding to join the eurozone, namely for a small open economy, as the Czech Republic. In particular, this analysis addresses the issue of price competition, which can be measured by the real effective exchange rate. In fact, the Maastricht criteria do not reflect the competitiveness of a country. Thus the arguments concerning the advantages/disadvantages of the adoption of a common currency should not be based only on the Maastricht criteria, but at first on the philosophy of the real effective exchange rate. We define a basis for setting new criteria to decideing on joining the monetary union. To sum up, if depreciation/devaluation of the real exchange rate is not a competitive advantage for both Czech exports and the Czech economy (especially in the long term), then the main economic argument against joining the EMU disappears.","[Michl, Ales] Vysoka Skola Ekon, Fak Financi & Ucetnictvi, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Michl, A (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon, Fak Financi & Ucetnictvi, Prague, Czech Republic.",ales.michl@gmail.com,,,,,,,36,2,2,1,9,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

We find strong econometric evidence for causality running from gold prices to gold production costs. The results are supported theoretically by the small amount of annual gold production relative to the total stock and the real options embedded in gold mines. The low flow to stock ratio of gold implies low market power of gold mining firms and thus an inability to significantly influence gold prices. The real options enable gold mining firms to adjust production costs conditional on the gold price; production costs thus follow gold prices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, we compare the patterns of gold reserves in the central banks of G7 with the determinants of their central banks' total reserves, and also with non-gold international reserves. We find that the factors that affect gold reserves are utterly different from other two models. Secondly, we show that an increase in G-7 countries' GDP, and also in their exports of goods and services, have positive and significant effects on gold reserves, while Population, Net FDI Liabilities, and Current Account Balance have negative effects on it.

In addition, the article provides tentative comparisons to Britain and the Nordic countries since they show similar attitudes to supranational institutions. The article concludes that Denmark's majoritarian democracy provides political cultures incompatible with the EU's constitutional democracy and this can explain why Denmark is so reserved when it comes to EU cooperation.","[Petersen, Jeppe Juul] Ctr Study Europe, Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Int Business Commun, Howitzvej 60, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Petersen, JJ (通讯作者)，Ctr Study Europe, Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Int Business Commun, Howitzvej 60, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",jjp.ibc@cbs.dk,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

This tendency, which is commonly referred to in the finance literature as home bias (HB), has puzzled economists for many decades. This research develops and presents experiments designed to test the behavioral factors related to HB discussed in the literature. In particular, these experiments test whether the factors of familiarity and fluency (ease of pronunciation) affect HB. In addition, using a method of controlled experiments, we examine the willingness to take risk as a basic source of HB. We also examine HB under three different market conditions (normal, bear and bull markets). Results indicate that subjects tended to take less risk with foreign, unfamiliar and nonfluent (difficult to pronounce) assets compared with local, familiar and fluent assets. This tendency increased significantly when the three factors were present together (foreign, unfamiliar and nonfluent assets) compared with when only one of the three factors was present. The results also revealed that HB increased during bear market periods.","[Riff, Sivan; Yagil, Yossi] Univ Haifa, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Yagil, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Dept Business Adm, Finance, IL-31905 Haifa, Israel.",yagil@gsb.haifa.ac.il,"Riff, sivan/AGY-2606-2022",,,,,,36,16,17,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

However, the link between economic growth and human development seems to be more complex. According to Ranis et al. (2000) the relationship is two-sided and mutually reinforcing, so in the long run the countries usually end up either in the vicious circle of bad economic growth and human development performance, or in the virtuous circle of positive results in both areas. The authors also suggest that the emphasis on economic growth does not lead to desired human development outcomes. Our work builds on their research and improves the methodology: we have introduced two new classifications based on countries' outcomes in areas of human development and economic growth that allow us to obtain better and more precise results. We have investigated data for 71 developing countries in three periods of time within 1980-2012. Our main findings are in some respects in line with Ranis et al. (2000) and suggest that countries with high pace of human development appear to achieve and retain high economic growth in the future, thus heading towards the virtuous circle of fast economic growth and human development. On the other hand, countries with low pace of human development tend to fall into vicious circle of slow economic growth and human development.","[Schlossarek, Martin; Harmacek, Jaromir; Pavlik, Petr] Univ Palackeho Olomouci, Olomouc, Czech Republic",Palacky University Olomouc,"Schlossarek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Palackeho Olomouci, Olomouc, Czech Republic.",martin.schlossarek@upol.cz; jaromir.harmacek@upol.cz; petr.pavlik@upol.cz,"HARMÁČEK, Jaromír/IWV-3110-2023","HARMÁČEK, Jaromír/0000-0002-3711-0663; Pavlik, Petr/0000-0001-9154-0296",,,,,34,0,0,1,17,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the implementation of these pension schemes has developed domestic capital markets, as established by structural reforms. For this purpose, regression data panels were constructed using indicators of depth and liquidity of stock and bond markets as well as variables representing pension systems and other indicators of development of financial markets in the period 1990-2014. The regressions also considered the detected linkages between pension systems, using a methodology based on clustering analysis and hierarchical tree statistical tools, following representative statistical information of their performance. The results showed that the seniority of the systems was relevant to explain the associations between them, but not the mandatory or voluntary nature of systems nor their geographical location. There were important sources of heterogeneity of the impact of pension funds on capital markets. The analysis revealed that individual capitalization pension schemes have meant a stimulus to stock market depth. Membership to a cluster determined significant impacts of pension systems on capital market development indicators. Stock markets depth and liquidity indicators received the positive impacts of greater magnitude from those systems included in the intermediate gradual maturation cluster. Pension schemes belonging to the low gradual and incipient maturation cluster exerted significant incentive on public bond markets depth. The high gradual maturation cluster was associated with substantial increases in stock depth as well as public bond depth. On the other hand, the advanced maturation cluster showed a positive impact on private bond depth, as well as systems with an incipient maturation. A negative causality with stock market liquidity was also evidenced for the incipient maturation cluster, which was linked to the long-term profile of pension portfolio management that privileges funding strategies to trading strategies.","[Seijas Gimenes, Maria Nela; Brida Ogrizek, Juan Gabriel] Univ Republica, 1926 Gonzalo Ramirez St, Montevideo, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Gimenes, MNS (通讯作者)，Univ Republica, 1926 Gonzalo Ramirez St, Montevideo, Uruguay.",mseijas@ccea.com.uy; juangabriel.brida@unibz.it,"Brida, Juan Gabriel/H-3727-2015","Brida, Juan Gabriel/0000-0002-2319-5790",,,,,28,0,0,0,6,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,192,204,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300015,0

The aim of the article is solely to analyze the linkages between FDIs and host suppliers and the potential for their engagement in the FDIs value chain. Methodology/methods Within the study it is developed a model that identifies the factors that influence the output of intermediary suppliers in automotive industry in Macedonian economy. Despite the FDIs, the model also include some other factors like human and technology and how they influence on the output of the host intermediary suppliers. The study is based on an analysis of the input-output tables showing the dependency and flows between different sectors of production within the economy. Using the regression analysis it is identified contribution of FDIs inflow in automotive industry to the output of intermediary suppliers from the separate sectors engaged in the production process of FDIs. Scientific aim The paper reveals whether the Macedonian businesses have achieved in establishing and servicing the supplying linkages with FDIs as a crucial precondition for spillover process to arise. Findings The results suggest on an increased output of the host intermediary suppliers and the usage of local content in the production. Conclusions The paper implies that the inflow of FDIs should be seen as a factor that contribute in increasing the competitiveness of the host suppliers and as a way of upgrading the capabilities of local SMEs.","[Sekuloska, Jovanka Damoska] Univ Informat Sci & Technol St Paul Apostle, Partizanska Bb 6000, Ohrid, North Macedonia",,"Sekuloska, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Informat Sci & Technol St Paul Apostle, Partizanska Bb 6000, Ohrid, North Macedonia.",jovanka.damoska@uist.edu.mk,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,2,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,394,402,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200049,0

Rural women diversify their livelihood strategies beyond agriculture despite its centrality to the rural economy. This study used the proportion of non- agricultural incomes to total household income as a measure of the degree of women's diversification away from agriculture in Msinga rural areas of KwaZulu-Natal. The Tobit regression model was used for investigating the dimensions of empowerment that influence women's decision to diversify away from agricultural- based livelihoods. It was found that women with higher levels of human and physical capital forms of empowerment, vocational and farm financial management skills were more likely to diversify away from agricultural-based livelihood activities. On the other hand, women with higher levels of social capital and legal resource empowerment were less likely to participate in non-farm activities. Socio-economic factors including being married and involvement in dry-land agriculture increased the likelihood of women to rely on non-agricultural incomes while higher husband's incomes and involvement in irrigation agriculture reduced the chances of women to diversify away from agriculture. It was concluded that certain dimensions of rural women's empowerment influence the extent to which they diversify livelihoods away from agriculture. Hence, this study suggests that policymakers need to consider using empowerment interventions such as human and physical capital forms of empowerment, vocational and farm financial management skills to increase women's diversification and reduce their household dependence on agriculture.","[Sharaunga, Stanley; Mudhara, Maxwell] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Discipline Agr Econ, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Sharaunga, S (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Discipline Agr Econ, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",sharaunga2000@yahoo.com; mudhara@ukzn.ac.za,,,Water Research Commission (South Africa) [K5/2176],Water Research Commission (South Africa),"The authors would like to acknowledge the Water Research Commission (South Africa) for initiating, managing and funding this paper which was part of their project (K5/2176) entitled, Empowerment of women in rural areas through water use security and agricultural skills training for gender equity and poverty reduction in KwaZulu-Natal and North West Province.",,61,7,7,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2016,55.0,1-2,,,,,103,132,,10.1080/03031853.2016.1159586,0.0,,,30,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,DN4OB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000377046000005,0

Individually, investors base their acquisition decisions on past performances of funds and have the tendency to invest in funds that had previously very good performances. A large number of studies, most of them conducted in the US illustrate that mutual fund flows depend on the previous performance of funds and that a common behavior of investors is to rather invest asymmetrically in highly performing funds than to give up the funds that perform poorly. This paper studies the flows of mutual funds in Hungary by looking at inflows and outflows of capital for the period 2007-2014. The main purpose is to characterize the behavior of the investors in the emerging Hungarian capital market, mainly in terms of their investment choice. The paper also envisages recognizing if and how the financial crisis, as part of the studied period, did affect the behavior of Hungarian investors. The main findings of the research illustrate that there are a number of factors that have a say in the way investors make their decisions. Among those fund flows in the previous month is the factor that influences the most the current flows, illustrating that Hungarians invest only in funds that attracted previously more new money. Other factors with a significant influence on the investors' behavior are the size of the fund (measured through the net assets) and the risk (measured through the standard deviations of returns. The factor that surprisingly seems to have less influence on Hungarian investors' decisions is the performance either measured as the evolution of the fund category or the rank and the square rank of the fund in its category. Another important finding was that data proved that the financial crisis had an impact on the capital market in Hungary, as investments decreased in that particular period and performances were lower.","[Tudorache, Florentin Gabriel; Nicolescu, Luminita] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana,Sect 1, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Tudorache, FG (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana,Sect 1, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",gabriel_tud@yahoo.com; luminicolescu@yahoo.com,"Tudorache, Gabriel Florentin/AAF-4627-2020; Nicolescu, Luminita/G-9427-2018","Nicolescu, Luminita/0000-0001-8029-9054",,,,,11,2,2,0,2,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,174,191,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300014,0

Gender responsive budgeting is to strengthen the equality perspective at all stages of the budget process to approaching gender equality in public institutions and organizations, or to reduce inequalities. Gender responsive budgeting, is reflected in the male-female equality instead of a separate budget for women. As stated in the 5018 Public Financial Management and Control Law, public institutions and organizations made strategic plans and the budget of institutions must be prepared depending on strategic plans. If expenditure is not in the strategic plan, an allocation in the budget is impossible. It is important that the preparation of the strategic plan is the basis for gender responsive budgeting. Allocations have been increasing day by day at modern societies that value to positive discrimination. This study has been investigated the gender equality approach in 39 districts in Istanbul. Data were obtained from TUIK's data population of 2014. To clarify the distinction created by the gender equality approach has benefited from the cluster analysis. Thus, the district has been determined whether the rates are close together in the same group. The hierarchical method was used in 39 districts because clustering number of sets wanted to predetermine. Ward's (variance) method depending on hierarchical clustering method is adopted. The results were visualized by Dendrogram. The Euclidean distance measure has been applied for determining the distance between criteria. Consequently, it is analysed in detail how the budgets of districts in Istanbul organized by gender equality approach. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The goal is to assess current technological developments and their effect on low skilled labour with earnings that fall in the lowest decile of earnings in the Czech economy in the period 1998 - 2013. Methodology/methods The cliometric method is used and it is based on time series analysis and on the statistical significance of the long term and short term relationships between various variables using the bivariate vector error correction procedure. Scientific aim The process of technological change in the Czech Republic in the analyzed period was characterized by a massive inflow of foreign direct investment, new technologies and the introduction of market innovations. New technologies changed the structure of the economy and led to the structural unemployment and introduction of the institute of minimum wage. This paper tries to find connections between long term unemployment and the minimum wage. Findings The detailed investigation into the rate of unemployment among groups at risk of being substituted by technology and the ratio of the minimum wage to decile wage, that the influence of the minimum wage fully manifested itself. Over the examined period, for every percentage point increase in the ratio of the minimum wage to the decile wage, the rate of unemployment amongst women and long-term unemployed men and women increased substantially. Conclusions Employing new technologies can be cheaper and results suggest that they already are cheaper than labour costs for the minimum wage low qualified worker. The risk of being unemployed is going to be due to artificial intelligence even higher; however, more links have to be found between the unskilled labour and new technologies.","[Vokoun, Marek; Strakova, Jarmila] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Vokoun, M (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic.",marekvokoun@gmail.com,"Straková, Jarmila/ABE-8222-2020; Vokoun, Marek/AAI-3302-2020","Vokoun, Marek/0000-0001-5659-3085",,,,,19,1,1,0,9,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,157,164,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200018,0

The decrease in uncertainty leads elites to accept a larger share of the tax burden, which governments then collect using progressive tax types more intensively. To illustrate this claim, I provide evidence from a comparative analysis of the Peruvian and the Colombian tax history between 1970 and 2010.","[von Schiller, Armin] German Dev Inst DIE, Deutsch Inst Entwicklungspolit, Tulpenfeld 6, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [von Schiller, Armin] Hertie Sch Governance, Berlin, Germany",Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); Hertie School,"von Schiller, A (通讯作者)，German Dev Inst DIE, Deutsch Inst Entwicklungspolit, Tulpenfeld 6, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",armin.schiller@die-gdi.de,"von Schiller, Armin/ABI-1529-2020","von Schiller, Armin/0000-0001-5172-8227",German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),"This article has been written with financial support from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).

This paper quantifies the effect of the government-controlled appreciation of the Chinese renminbi vis-a-vis the USD from 2005 to 2008 on the prices charged by U.S. domestic producers. In a panel spanning the period from 1994 to 2010 and including up to 519 manufacturing sectors, import price changes of Chinese goods pass into U.S. producer prices at an average rate of 0.7, while import price changes that can be traced back to exchange rate movements of other trade partners only have mild effects on U.S. prices.

Functional coefficient representation relaxes the strict assumptions regarding the structure of betas and alpha by combining the predictors into an index. Appropriate index variables are selected by applying the smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty. In such a way, estimation and variable selection can be done simultaneously. Based on the empirical studies, the proposed model performs better than the alternatives in explaining asset returns and we find no strong evidence to reject the conditional CAPM.

The private costs and benefits of drilling are realized immediately, but the external costs are not. This means that by the time external costs are well understood, producers may no longer exist or may not have sufficient resources to finance necessary cleanups or to compensate those who have been adversely affected. Because producers do not face the total cost of potential external damages, they may take too many risks. This article discusses alternative regulatory approaches for mitigating moral hazard in U.S. natural gas production. Particular emphasis is given to bonding requirements, which have tended to receive less attention from policy makers than other approaches but have a long history. Although the use of bonding has important limitations, this approach is quite well suited to addressing many of the environmental risks in this market.

This result could be explained by a differentiated impact of investor sentiment on specific types of stocks, as opposed to a wide horizon of stocks.

We also find that statistically significant results reported in many surveyed papers become questionable, if Bayesian method or revised standards for evidence were instead used.

ICAPM country portfolio weights are computed relative to world market capitalization. Bayesian model allows for various degrees of mis-trust in the ICAPM and multi-prior model's investors' ambiguity aversion. Mean-variance computes optimal weights by sample estimates of mean and covariance matrix of sample return and Bayes-Stein improves precision associated with estimating the expected return of each asset. The paper finds that for few countries, there is not much change in home bias measures using various models. Foreign listing, idiosyncratic risk, beta, natural resources rents, size, global financial crisis and institutional quality have significant impact on home bias. There are policy implications associated with home bias. (C) 2015 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Using these holdings, we measure funds' exposures to socially sensitive stocks in order to answer two questions. What explains cross-sectional variation in mutual funds' exposure to controversial companies? Does exposure to controversial stocks drive fund returns? We find that exposures to socially sensitive stocks are weaker for funds that aim to attract socially conscious and institutional investor clientele, and they relate to local political and religious factors. The financial payoff associated with greater sin stock exposure is positive and statistically significant, but becomes non-significant with broader definitions of socially sensitive investments. Despite the positive relation between mutual fund return and sin stock exposure, the annualized risk-adjusted return spread between a portfolio of funds with highest sin stock exposure and its lowest-ranked counterpart is statistically not significant. The results suggest that fund managers do not tilt heavily towards controversial stocks because of social considerations and practical constraints. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The nature of propagation of such contagion is determined by the underlying connections between firms, which can adversely affect the tail risks of firm value, hence the securities issued by the firm. This paper combines the insights gained from the existing firm-value models and historical events into a structural model for flow of contagion among firms using a network-based approach. Rather than using stylized networks, we develop a data-driven approach for network construction where we define and calibrate several contagion variables to model the spread of contagion. This framework is applied for assessing firm-level risk under downside risk measures. Using actual data, our model illustrates how connections between firms can lead to heavy-tailed default distributions and default clustering observed in practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Banks have a higher and more stable propensity to pay dividends and resist cutting dividends as the 2007-2008 financial crisis begins.

In addition, we conduct a theoretical analysis to cope with the price limit constraint in TXO. Robust hedging refers to minimal model dependence on a risky asset price. Two hedging categories, including Model-Free and Volatility-Model-Free, are investigated, and nonparametric methods for volatility estimation are considered in our empirical study. In particular, instantaneous volatility is estimated by a proposed nonlinear correction scheme of the Fourier transform method (Malliavin & Mancino, 2009), justified by a simulation study for a local volatility model. We found an asymmetric phenomenon in hedging performance. Hedging portfolios constructed from the Volatility-Model-Free category were found to induce much higher Sharpe ratios than those from the Model-Free category on SPX, while they were found to perform comparably on TXO. Motivated from the price limit regulation in Taiwan, we further develop a time-scale change method to explain this phenomenon. Asymptotic moment estimates of differences in some hedging portfolios are consistent with our empirical findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The objective aimed at was to show the progress made by Romanian SMEs in adopting the open innovation principles. In order to reach this objective, the authors analysed the available statistical data for the period 2002-2012 concerning the trend of the SMEs' weight in the total innovation businesses compared to the weight of the large companies, the trend of the number of innovation projects started but unfinished or abandoned, and the trend of the ratio between the weight of the expenses on internal innovation activities and the expenses on external innovation activities for these businesses. The performed study highlighted the fact that within the analysed period, the weight of innovative SMEs in the total SMEs doubled. Within the same period of time the number of Romanian SMEs that initiated research-development-innovation projects unfinished and/or abandoned went up significantly, which proves that the initiatives of these businesses in developing ever more complex and riskier research projects multiplied. Under these circumstances, the authors' opinion is that focus is needed on external innovation sources that are typical to open innovation, with an important role in enhancing the performance of the innovation process.","[Olaru, Marieta; Dinu, Vasile; Keppler, Timo; Mateiu, Alexandra] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Mocan, Bogdan] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Technical University of Cluj Napoca,"Olaru, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",olaru.marieta@gmail.com,"Olaru, Marieta/A-2032-2017; Olaru, Marieta/AAL-1550-2020; Mocan, Bogdan/AAE-1127-2020; Dinu, Vasile/L-5051-2017","Mocan, Bogdan/0000-0002-2488-7254; Dinu, Vasile/0000-0003-3606-2548",Integrated Management System of Innovation in SMEs [PN-II-PT-PCCA-2013-4-1319],Integrated Management System of Innovation in SMEs,Support within the project PN-II-PT-PCCA-2013-4-1319 (Integrated Management System of Innovation in SMEs) is acknowledged with gratitude.,,30,18,19,3,44,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2015,17.0,,,,9,,1129,1141,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365318300002,0

During the boom, inflows from real estate investors tripled, far outpacing other segments such as first-time homebuyers. During the bust, a collapse in inflows keyed the debt decline, while an expansion of outflows due to defaults played a more minor role. Inflow declines partly reflect a dramatic falloff in first-time homebuying, especially for low credit score individuals.

We focus on the fraction of the institution's portfolio represented by the firm. In the context of acquisitions, we hypothesize that institutional monitoring will be greatest when the target firm represents a significant allocation of funds in the institution's portfolio. We show that this measure is important in reconciling mixed findings for total institutional ownership in the prior literature. The results indicate that our measure of institutional holdings leads to greater bid completion rates, higher premiums, and lower acquirer returns.

We illustrate a serious supervisory problem by demonstrating that large European banks' reported regulatory capital measures often far exceeded their loss-absorbing capacity during 1997-2011. The cumulative value of government guarantees thereby extended to the largest 25 European banks over that period amounts to nearly 1.4 trillion, corresponding to an average of 28.5% of the banks' equity market values. We show that early regulatory attention to declining equity value can substantially reduce the social cost of dealing with bank losses.

While there has been much attention paid to the implications of the greater role for financial actors in the food system, there has been relatively less attention paid to the ways in which these actors have historically interacted with it; in particular, in relation to the role of the state in mediating agricultural finance. This paper examines the long association between agriculture, finance and the state. Historically, private capital has been reluctant to invest in agriculture without assurances and support from the state, and states have practiced varying degrees of regulation on private financiers in the sector. These trends have shaped the practices of contemporary financialization. Although we recognize the systematic political project to reduce the role of the state in agriculture since the 1970s, these patterns persist and we ultimately argue that to understand the financialization of agriculture, it is important to understand how the state has been a long-standing coupler between finance and agriculture.","[Martin, Sarah J.] Univ Waterloo, Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, Waterloo, ON N2L 6C2, Canada; [Clapp, Jennifer] Univ Waterloo, Global Food Secur & Sustainabil, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Martin, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, 67 Erb St W, Waterloo, ON N2L 6C2, Canada.",s29marti@uwaterloo.ca; jclapp@uwaterloo.ca,"Clapp, Jennifer/GRO-3628-2022; Chekalin, Vyacheslav/S-6391-2017","Clapp, Jennifer/0000-0002-1871-8067; Martin, Sarah J./0000-0002-9954-4213",,,,,63,55,61,10,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The inclusion of financial distress costs is able to explain the low debt/zero debt puzzle and to clarify the relation between earnings and financial leverage. With standard parameter values, this model generates more realistic estimates of leverage ratios, credit spreads and recovery rates relative to a standard model of direct costs of bankruptcy. It clarifies the relation between optimal leverage and debt capacity and addresses different structural model problems such as underestimating (overestimating) spreads on safe (risky) bonds and relying on unrealistic high estimates for direct costs of bankruptcy.

The impact of R-2 is strongest among smaller companies, suggesting an elevated role for analysts in disseminating information when prices may be less informed.

The innovating firm invests in R&D to improve the quality of a new product, which raises the size of the market and the cost savings from producing in the South. We demonstrate that a new product is initially produced in the North and its production location is shifted to the South when its quality is sufficiently improved.

Executive compensation, other salaries, and perks do not respond significantly to cash flow shocks.

Also, they raise more funds relative to their sales, leave less money on the table for investors, and incur lower direct flotation costs. Among returning firms, those which raise higher proceeds relative to sales experience poorer long-run stock performance and lower Tobin's q post issuance. Our results offer a new perspective on cross-listing, which we term 'dressing-up-for-premium'.

Third, it reports the growing engagement of select health regulators in reform, at a time when temporary workers constitute three-quarters of skilled migrants, and the question increasingly asked is whether regulatory bodies have the agility to facilitate twenty-first century labour migration flows.

In particular, it explores the relationship between Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) and rail-based accessibility in a metropolitan area. The following overarching questions are addressed: Does a TOD-informed urban spatial structure correlate with high rail based accessibility? Which features of TOD are correlated to rail-based accessibility? These questions are answered through a comparative analysis of six metropolitan areas in Europe. The TOD degree, operationalized as the extent to which urban development is concentrated along rail corridors and stations, is correlated with a cumulative opportunity measure of rail-based accessibility to jobs and inhabitants. The comparison demonstrates that rail-based accessibility is higher in urban areas where inhabitants and jobs are more concentrated around the railway network and in lesser measure in urban areas with higher values of network connectivity. No correlation is found between rail-based accessibility and average densities of inhabitants and jobs.

Identifying sources of variation in intervention effects can suggest means to improve efficiency. One potential source of such variation is the genome. We conducted a genetic analysis of the Fast Track randomized control trial, a 10-year-long intervention to prevent high-risk kindergarteners from developing adult externalizing problems including substance abuse and antisocial behavior. We tested whether variants of the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1 were associated with differences in response to the Fast Track intervention. We found that in European-American children, a variant of NR3C1 identified by the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs10482672 was associated with increased risk for externalizing psychopathology in control group children and decreased risk for externalizing psychopathology in intervention group children. Variation in NR3C1 measured in this study was not associated with differential intervention response in African-American children. We discuss implications for efforts to prevent externalizing problems in high-risk children and for public policy in the genomic era.","[Albert, Dustin; Crowley, D.

We find that banks that were more reliant on wholesale funding curtailed their credit significantly more than retail-funded banks. We also exploit the discrete fall in the liquidity of loans above the jumbo cutoff and show that this effect is significantly more pronounced for less liquid loans in line with a liquidity channel.

In many environments with salient fairness considerations such endowments are known to inflate subjects' other-regarding behavior, thereby creating a so-called house money effect. This suggests that laboratory experiments might also overestimate reciprocal behavior. In this study we identify two reasons why the source of endowment might matter for negative reciprocity: (1) Using earned as opposed to windfall money - might increase the costs of negative reciprocity due to this money being in a different mental account and therefore lead to less retaliation. (2) Appropriating some of the decision-maker's endowment consisting of earned money might be considered a stronger violation of property rights and lead to more retaliation. While we find experimental support for the latter conjecture, we also observe that subjects actually retaliate more with their earned money than with windfall money as long as at least a part of their endowment is earned. However, conditional on earning a part of their endowment, subjects do not seem to distinguish between situations when they retaliate using earned money versus using windfall, suggesting that their main motivation is the violation of property rights established by performing a real-effort task. Our results thus point out that endowing subjects with windfall funds, absent of clearly established property rights, diminishes their negatively reciprocal responses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our results show that executive stock option holdings and stock option deltas are associated with lower dividend payments in our sample of European countries, where we do not observe any presence of dividend protection for executive stock options. We find that this relationship is mainly driven by exercisable stock options and by options that are in the money. Additionally, we observe that executive stock option holdings and stock option deltas have a negative impact on total payout, suggesting that executives do not substitute share repurchases for dividends. Furthermore, the fraction of share repurchases in total payout increases as executive stock option holdings and stock option deltas increase. Finally, our results show that executive share ownership and stock-based pay-performance sensitivity may mitigate agency conflicts by significantly increasing the level of total payout.

However, the relationship between the composition of government spending and entrepreneurship has been woefully under-researched. We fill this gap by empirically exploring the relationship between government spending in social and public goods and entrepreneurial activity under the assumption of credit market imperfections. By combining macroeconomic government spending data with individual-level entrepreneurship data we find a positive relationship between increasing the share of social and public goods at the cost of private subsidies and entrepreneurship while confirming a negative relationship between total government consumption and entrepreneurial activity.

Predominantly, metrological elements have been specified to explain variability in ridership volume. However, the outcome of this research points to flew direction to explain ridership fluctuation in Brisbane. It explored the relationship between daily bus ridership, seasonality and weather variables for a one-year period, 2012. Rather than segregating the entire year's ridership into the four calendar seasons (summer, autumn, spring, and winter), this analysis distributed the yearly ridership into nine complex seasonality blocks. These represent calendar season, school/university (academic) period and their corresponding holidays, as well as other observant holidays such as Christmas. The dominance of complex seasonality over typical calendar season was established through analysis and using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). This research identified a very strong association between complex seasonality and bus ridership. Furthermore, an expectation that Brisbane's subtropical summer is unfavourable to transit usage was not supported by the findings of this study. A nil association of precipitation and temperature was observed in this region. Finally, this research developed a ridership estimation model, capable of predicting daily ridership within very limited error range. Following the application of this developed model, the estimated annual time series data of each suburb was analysed using Fourier Transformation to appreciate whether any cyclical effects remained, compared with the original data.

In the framework of the mobility biographies approach, several studies have been undertaken to improve understanding of travel behaviour change in the last decade. This paper critically and systematically reviews emerging results from mobility biographies research, focusing on key events which potentially induce contextual and travel behaviour changes. The first step was to identify 25 of the most important studies for this approach and their related concepts. Next, notions other than key events in the literature are discussed and a theoretical framework for the longitudinal interaction of four dimensions of key events and other factors for travel behaviour change are identified: (i) life events in private and professional careers, (ii) adaptation of long-term mobility decisions, (iii) exogenous interventions, and (iv) other long-term processes which are not key events (e.g. socialisation). Furthermore, the understanding of key events, methodological challenges and further research gaps are critically discussed in this review. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper links local-level policy packaging with national authorities' environmental strategies. Applying a multilevel-governance perspective, it examines how state engagement influences the integration of car-use reduction strategies in local policy packages. Two policy packages are empirically compared, one from the larger Norwegian city of Trondheim and one from the mid-sized city of Bodo. While both policy packages reveal ambivalence in whether to facilitate or restrict car usage, the strategies employed in Trondheim to mitigate the effects of road building are stronger than those used in Bodo. In Trondheim, more resources are used for climate-friendly transport and stronger regulation is applied to integrate land-use and transport policy. In explaining this, different levels of state engagement are emphasised. The study reveals how, both financially and in the building of institutional capacity, the approach of national authorities prioritises the larger city. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper employs a political economy framework to examine the demise of democracy. It illustrates that war was a means of redistribution, benefiting the majority of poorer Athenians at the expense of the rich elite, who bore a disproportionate burden of its cost. A model of conflict is set up to study the incentives of the poor majority to go to war. After analyzing a dynamic setting it also investigates the circumstances when after defeating Athens her enemy chooses to impose oligarchy that disenfranchises the poor. As victory at war is probabilistic it is concluded that the fall of the democracy was neither unavoidable nor inevitable. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It allows robust inference on the estimates of the initial per capita output (intercepts) and the respective growth rates (slopes). The results of the application of unit root tests without structural breaks show the absence of stochastic convergence. However, by incorporating the presence of endogenous breaks, the results are reversed for all regions. In the case of -convergence, the results of the robust test W-RQF show that all regions have a structural break at some point during the period 1970-2010. We find different behavior for different regions. There is a catching-up process and a lagging-behind process for different groups of regions towards more negative or more positive paths.","[Delgado, Augusto; Rodriguez, Gabriel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Econ, Lima 32, Peru",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Rodríguez, G (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Econ, Ave Univ 1801, Lima 32, Peru.",gabriel.rodriguez@pucp.edu.pe,"Rodríguez, Gabriel/F-3230-2012","Rodríguez, Gabriel/0000-0003-1174-9642; Delgado Narro, Augusto Ricardo/0000-0003-3462-9758",,,,,45,2,2,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Five image profiles were generated using cluster analysis, each representing a different perspective on the stock market. These profiles were found to reflect personal and subjective characteristics of investors, including financial knowledge and investing experience. Understanding stock market image is important because it influences investing behaviors, expectations, and experiences, including the decision to participate in or avoid equities markets.

It does so using panel data for over 100 countries between 1975 and 2005, wherever possible, and compares the effects obtained with several different measures of both the importance of oil and experience in the industry and of the interactions between them. Most importantly, instead of simply examining the effect of oil and experience in the industry on the contemporary levels of these various institutions, this study focuses on the effects on changes in the various institutional indicators from one decade to another. While not surprisingly our results reveal considerable sensitivity in the effects of oil resources, oil experience, and interactions across different specifications, they also suggest a number of important findings. The most robust of these are the significant negative effects of oil rents on bureaucratic quality and on socioeconomic conditions. We also find that the number of years since peak oil discovery has a positive effect on government stability, but a negative one on bureaucratic quality. When interactions are allowed for, still more negative effects on institutions are identified, at least partially re-enforcing several of the institutional links in the oil curse hypothesis.","[Blanco, Luisa R.] Pepperdine Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Malibu, CA 90263 USA; [Nugent, Jeffrey B.; O'Connor, Kelsey J.] Univ So Calif, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",Pepperdine University; University of Southern California,"Blanco, LR (通讯作者)，Pepperdine Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Malibu, CA 90263 USA.",lblanco@pepperdine.edu; nugent@usc.edu; kelseyoc@usc.edu,"O'Connor, Kelsey J./AAF-1575-2020","O'Connor, Kelsey J./0000-0002-1413-3619",,,,,48,10,11,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

Initial analysis suggests that cross-border investments are exited more quickly than domestic investments, and this difference is driven by the cross-border investments in North America. We explore whether the difference between domestic and cross-border exits can be explained by regional variations in economic/market activity and legal systems. We find it is important to allow for the impact of these macro variables on the time to VC exit to vary across regions. This is crucial not just to capture the full impact of the macro factors, but also to explain the differences in time to exit between domestic and cross-border investments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, due to the relatively recent adoption of BSS, there is very little research exploring how people consider these systems within existing transportation options. Given recent BSS growth around the world, there is substantial interest in identifying contributing factors that encourage individuals to use these systems. The current study contributes to this growing literature by examining BSS behavior at the trip level to analyze bicyclists' destination preferences. Specifically, we study the decision process involved in identifying destination locations after picking up a bicycle at a BSS station, using a random utility maximization approach in the form of a multinomial logit model (MNL). The quantitative frameworks developed have been estimated using 2013 data from the Chicago's Divvy system. In our modeling effort, we distinguish between BSS users with annual membership and short-term customers with daily passes. The developed model should allow bicycle-sharing system operators to plan services more effectively by examining the impact of travel distance, land use, built environment, and access to public transportation infrastructure on users' destination preferences. Using the estimated model, we generated utility profiles as a function of distance and various other attributes, allowing us to represent visually the trade-offs that individuals make in the decision process. To illustrate further the applicability of the proposed framework for planning purposes, destination station-choice probability prediction is undertaken. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The first leaders of the Virginia School were ambivalent about both axiomatic social choice and the first-generation political implications drawn from it. Buchanan (J Polit Econ 62: 334-43, 1954) queried whether collective choice was simply a category mistake. Tullock (Public Choice 37:189-202, 1981a) asked Why so much stability?aEuroan excellent question to which several answers are now available. Their joint Calculus of Consent argued that a free society required unanimous consent to a constitutional contract but did not explore how such a contract might be agreed. The key academic entrepreneur was the third President of the Society: W. H. Riker. His arbitrage brought together social choice and public choice. His historical work has been much criticized, but parts of it remain important and unchallenged. He used both the impossibility and the existence results of social choice to illuminate the question left unsolved by Buchanan and Tullock: how may a constitutional contract be drafted (e.g., 1787-1790) and changed (e.g., 1850-1868)? Riker, like Duncan Black whose career he salvaged, made original contributions to the history of social choice. In a brief review we consider whether its obscurity over centuries has been deserved.","Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England",University of Oxford,"McLean, I (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England.",iain.mclean@nuffield.ox.ac.uk,,,"Leverhulme Trust; Nuffield Foundation; British Council; Economic and Social Research Council (UK); US/UK Fulbright scheme, University College, Oxford; Australian National University; Stanford University","Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Nuffield Foundation; British Council(The British Council in India); Economic and Social Research Council (UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); US/UK Fulbright scheme, University College, Oxford; Australian National University(Australian National University); Stanford University(Stanford University)","Grateful thanks to fellow panelists, discussants and colleagues for comments on that version: in particular to Christian List, Nicholas R.

The pricing, maturity, amount, and covenants are all significantly modified during each renegotiation, whose timing is governed by the financial health of the contracting parties and uncertainty regarding the borrowers' credit quality. The relative importance of these factors depends on the duration of the lending relationship.

The new recruits can generate an additional stream of output production in all future periods, and the firm's labor demand is thus characterized by the forward-looking property. Therefore, the firm is motivated to hire more new recruits in advance in response to good news about future productivity. Once the increase in labor demand is greater than the decrease in labor supply caused by the income effect, the coincident rise in consumption and employment can be driven by the news shock. When such a channel is paired with investment adjustment costs and the endogenous capacity utilization rate, this paper provides a plausible explanation for simultaneous booms in current consumption, investment, output, and employment to match the empirical evidence under the news shock.","[Chen, Kuan-Jen; Lai, Ching-Chong] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lai, Ching-Chong] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lai, Ching-Chong] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Econ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Lai, Ching-Chong] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, Taichung, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Chengchi University; National Sun Yat Sen University; Feng Chia University,"Chen, KJ (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",kjenchen@gmail.com; cclai@econ.sinica.edu.tw,,,,,,,44,1,1,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

A direct gaze can be used to focus observer's attention on a face, whereas an averted gaze can be used to direct observer's attention to an object or a point in space. Several studies in neuroscience and psychology demonstrate the role of gaze direction not only in orienting observer's attention but also in modulating his cognitive process. The detection of an averted gaze induces a shift of visual attention by means of reflexive gaze-following behavior. In marketing, little is known about gaze direction effect on ads' content processing. This research presents recent findings on neural correlates of the processing of gaze direction and its influence on orienting observer's visual attention. Then, using a folder test procedure, it investigates the influence of perceived gaze direction of a character in a print ad on product and brand memorization. Comparing 2 conditions-ads presenting a face with averted gaze toward the advertised product or direct gaze toward the observer-our results show that ad with gaze toward the product increases product and brand memorization. As these results were obtained by reproducing real-life conditions of ad processing-a folder magazine-we believe that they are of particular interest for managers, especially in an environmental context increasingly cluttered with advertising that marketers have to face nowadays. Further researches are needed to explore other effects of gaze direction in ads, such as for example the effects on advertising evaluation.","[Droulers, Olivier; Adil, Safaa] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR 6211, CREM,Grad Sch Management IGR, F-35000 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Adil, S (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR 6211, CREM,Grad Sch Management IGR, 11 Rue Jean Mace, F-35000 Rennes, France.",safaa.adil@etudiant.univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,,68,16,19,2,41,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

We use a large panel of farm-level data to investigate the potential bias induced by such approaches. Consistent with the literature on plant physiology, we observe significant nonlinear interaction effects, with more abundant precipitation acting as a mitigating factor for increased heat stress. This interaction disappears when the same data are aggregated in the conventional manner, leading to predictions of climate change impacts that are significantly distorted.","[Fezzi, Carlo] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Fezzi, Carlo; Bateman, Ian] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, CSERGE, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of East Anglia,"Fezzi, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",c.fezzi@uea.ac.uk,"Bateman, Ian J/F-8011-2010","Bateman, Ian/0000-0002-2791-6137",,,,,55,63,75,2,20,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

In particular, we attend to the role of the informal subgroup or clique in cultivating and distributing locally adapted and integrated knowledge, or know-how. We develop two hypotheses based on the importance of intraorganizational coordination for an organization's capacity for change. The first emphasizes the importance of distributing know-how evenly to potential recipient subgroups. The second emphasizes the importance of restricting know-how to flow from high know-how subgroups. We test our hypotheses with longitudinal network data in 21 schools, finding stronger support for the second hypothesis than the first. Our findings can help managers cultivate know-how flows to contribute to organizational change.","[Frank, Kenneth A.] Michigan State Univ, Measurement & Quantitat Methods, Dept Counseling Educ Psychol & Special Educ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Frank, Kenneth A.] Michigan State Univ, Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Penuel, William R.] Univ Colorado, Sch Educ, Boulder, CO 80305 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Frank, KA (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Measurement & Quantitat Methods, Dept Counseling Educ Psychol & Special Educ, Erickson Hall,Room 462, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",kenfrank@msu.edu; Penuel@colorado.edu; aekmcb@gmail.com,"Krause, Ann/GRT-0163-2022","frank, kenneth/0000-0002-6116-5509; Penuel, William R./0000-0001-7096-6669","National Science Foundation [0231981, 0624307]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [0624307] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Research On Learning; Direct For Education and Human Resources [0231981] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Division Of Research On Learning; Direct For Education and Human Resources(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU))","This work has been supported by National Science Foundation grants #0231981 and #0624307.

Firms can exploit their existing R&D capabilities by entering into overseas markets via strategic alliances. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find R&D intensity to be a major determinant of cross-border strategic alliance decisions involving US firms. R&D intensive firms prefer alliances in Continental Europe and Emerging Asia-Pacific regions.

We investigate whether this forecasting failure can be partly attributed to a break in the elasticity of inflation to the output gap. Using structural break tests and time-varying parameter models, we find that this elasticity has indeed increased substantially in the past 2 years. We offer two (observationally equivalent) interpretations of this result. The first is that the increase in the cyclicality of inflation has stemmed from lower nominal rigidities or weaker strategic complementarities in price setting. A second possibility is that current output gap estimates are understating the amount of spare capacity in the economy. We estimate that, in order to reconcile the observed fall in inflation with the historical correlation between consumer prices and the business cycle, the output gap should be wider by around one third.","[Riggi, Marianna; Venditti, Fabrizio] Banca Italia, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Venditti, F (通讯作者)，Banca Italia, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",fabrizio.venditti@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,23,21,21,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

We demonstrate that the relationship between inequality and attitudes toward redistribution tends to be positive within provinces but negative across them. We argue that two markedly different mechanisms explain this discrepancy. First, within any particular political and economic context, people are more likely to benefit from redistribution, and hence support it, when inequality is high. Second, both inequality and attitudes toward redistribution are affected by characteristics unique to provincial political cultures, which results in attitudes toward redistribution having a different baseline depending on the province. We end with a discussion of the policy implications of these findings.","[Sealey, Anthony] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Andersen, Robert] Univ Toronto, Dept Sociol, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Sealey, A (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,,,,,,58,9,11,0,14,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

The GSE May 2009 Home Valuation Code of Conduct (HVCC) aims to prohibit lenders from influencing appraisers. Refinance loans, without a transaction price, are potentially more susceptible to appraisal inflation than purchase loans. We use GSE refinance loans as our treatment group and non-GSE refinance loans as the control group, and find that GSE refinance loans originated after May 2009 have lower default rates than non-GSE refinance loans. We further measure the appraisal inflation (bias) as the difference between the appraisal value in a 2009 refinance transaction and the actual transaction price in an earlier purchase transaction for the same property adjusted for local housing value changes. We find that the reduction in appraisal bias was larger for GSE refinance loans than for non-GSE refinance loans.

I provide strong empirical evidence that banks in the region use loan-loss provisions to smooth their income streams, and that these provisions are procyclical with respect to national business cycles. In addition, I find that income smoothing may only partly be explained through the concept of saving for a rainy day'. Banks do use periods of high earnings to smooth income, but they also elect to build further reserves during periods of heavy lossesthat is, on the rainy days' themselves. This behaviour deepens existing losses and may obscure the bank's underlying profitability. Introducing regulatory measures in line with the Bank of Spain's dynamic provisioning system would make income smoothing in Central European banks more transparent and could limit the scope for discretionary provisioning during periods of low profitability.","Univ Szczecin, WNEiZ, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Skala, D (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, WNEiZ, Ul Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",dskala@wneiz.pl,,,,,,,42,24,26,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

These foreign financial institutions are commonly referred to as the foreign strategic investors (FSIs), whose aim is to improve the performance and governance of the local banks. This study investigates whether FSIs can influence the earnings smoothing (ES) of local Chinese banks, which is dubbed as the FSI effect. If such effect is observed, we examine whether the transmission is achieved through the accounting quality channel (i.e., more FSIs reduce Chinese banks' ES) or the safety and soundness channel (i.e., more FSIs strengthen these banks' ES). We use data from 102 local banks from 2006 to 2011 to examine the PSI effect and the two channels by considering banks with zero, one, and two FSls. Our results support the safety and soundness channel, indicating that more FSIs enhance ES and a stronger PSI effect for banks with more FSIs and more FSI directors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The paper explores this link in times of crisis and provides new insights on the role of relationship lending for small and micro-sized firms. Not only small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have a lower probability to innovate and a higher likelihood to face financial constraints, their innovative propensity is also more sensitive to firm financial condition. The establishment of close ties with the lender bank can help overcoming financial barriers to innovation. By exploiting firm-specific proxies of relationship lending I document a highly nonlinear effect that is decreasing with the size of the firm, suggesting that small companies can gain disproportional benefits from banks' accumulation of soft information, especially for the introduction of new products and processes.","[Brancati, Emanuele] LUISS Guido Carli Univ, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Brancati, Emanuele] MET, I-00195 Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University,"Brancati, E (通讯作者)，LUISS Guido Carli Univ, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy.",e.brancati@luiss.it,,"Brancati, Emanuele/0000-0002-4221-7991",,,,,53,57,71,2,105,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Reflecting spatial autocorrelation while controlling for a variety of demographic and locational (e.g., built environment) attributes, the zone-level spatial count model in this paper offers valuable information for power providers and charging station location decisions. By anticipating over 745,000 personal-vehicle registrations across a sample of 1000 census block groups in the Philadelphia region, a trivariate Poisson-lognormal conditional autoregressive (CAR) model anticipates Prius hybrid EV, other EV, and conventional vehicle ownership levels. Initial results signal higher EV ownership rates in more central zones with higher household incomes, along with significant residual spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that spatially-correlated latent variables and/or peer (neighbor) effects on purchase decisions are present. Such data sets will become more comprehensive and informative as EV market shares rise.

We find that as a firm experiences an exogenous decrease in analyst coverage, shareholders value internal cash holdings less, its CEO receives higher excess compensation, its management is more likely to make value-destroying acquisitions, and its managers are more likely to engage in earnings management activities. Importantly, we find that most of these effects are mainly driven by the firms with smaller initial analyst coverage and less product market competition. We further find that after exogenous brokerage exits, a CEO's total and excess compensation become less sensitive to firm performance in firms with low initial analyst coverage. These findings are consistent with the monitoring hypothesis, specifically that financial analysts play an important governance role in scrutinizing management behavior, and the market is pricing an increase in expected agency problems after the loss in analyst coverage.

Our findings suggest that acquisitions relieve financial frictions in target firms, especially when the target firm is relatively small.","[Erel, Isil; Jang, Yeejin] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Jang, Yeejin] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Weisbach, Michael S.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Erel, Isil; Weisbach, Michael S.] Ohio State Univ, Natl Ctr Middle Market, Fisher Coll Business, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; National Bureau of Economic Research; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Erel, I (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",,"Jang, Yeejin/AAC-4999-2021","Jang, Yeejin/0000-0003-1143-7534",,,,,56,149,157,11,141,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

A total of 496 first year undergraduates studying business or social science completed a 20-item questionnaire. This focused on their attitudes to their debt incurred while studying, as measured on a five-point Likert scale. A factor analysis model was developed, from which four consistent factors emerged, explaining 45 percent of the variation and consistent between countries. These factors were named: Anxiety, Utility-For-Lifestyle, Utility-For-Investment and Awareness. The first three factors were found to be uncorrelated with each other, but higher Awareness was associated with lower levels of Anxiety and Utility-For-Lifestyle and higher levels of Utility-For-Investment. The relationship with previous studies and implications for theory and practice are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The respective state authority is responsible in managing zakat administration which includes zakat collection and distribution. Despite the increase in the amount of zakat being distributed to the recipients, there are complaints received from asnafs with regard to the quality of services rendered to them. Hence, the objectives of this study are to identify the medium of information utilised by the recipients to obtain information on zakat distribution and to assess the satisfaction level of zakat recipients towards zakat management.

The latest Malaysian federal government debt to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio is 54.47%; more than the 50% threshold for developing economies. This increasing debt level will hurt the economy in the long run. In an effort to reduce the debt, the Malaysian government is presently selling government assets and reforming the taxation system i.e. by introducing Goods and Sales Tax (GST) on 1st April 2015. We however notice that there is an alternative solution from Islamic economics which complies with the Shari'ah law. The alternative is waqf. This paper provides a conceptual framework of the possibility of waqf with respect to its role in federal government debt sustainability. Firstly, the aspect at which waqf can contribute to federal government debt reduction is presented. Secondly, the study discusses the Shari'ah law of waqf, its contemporary issues and the management of waqf in Malaysia. Since Malaysia is a multi-religion society consisting of Muslims and non-Muslims alike, we also analyse the Shari'ah law of waqf pertaining to the non-Muslims. Finally, this paper offers suggestion of a waqf model that may be able to manage and control the federal government debt from ballooning. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Shared value creation can defined as policies and operating practices that enhance the competitiveness of a company while simultaneously advancing the economic and social conditions in the communities it operates in. The aim of this paper is to examine shared value creation in a construction project and how shared value creation improves quality, cost-effectiveness, sustainability and collaboration. The research is based on an in-depth case study. In order to understand actors' involvement and ambitions in a construction project semi-structured interview were conducted and written sources of public and confidential documents of the case project were analysed. Based on case project material and interviews shared value creation thinking has potential to improve quality, cost-effectiveness, sustainability and collaboration in a construction project. In the case project shared value creation components emerged, yet more benefits would have been gained if shared value creation would have been implemented intentionally and strategically.

Considering that the majority of studies on herding behavior are focused on the US and Asian markets and given that in emerging and frontier markets there is a slower assimilation of information into stocks prices, and in consequence a higher propensity to herd, our study fills a gap in the literature by approaching Central and Eastern European markets. We examine herding behavior by using daily data on stock prices for 384 corporations from January 2, 2003 to December 31, 2013 and we investigate for herding behavior at the level of different size-ranked portfolios of stocks. We find evidence of herding in four CEE countries for at least one quintile over the analyzed period and our results confirm that the GFC affected the gregarious behavior on CEE markets.

The maintenance of the solvency state of insurance companies requires them to have the ability to honour their obligations to policyholders and beneficiaries of the contract. We analysed solvency as a dependent variable as compared to the degree of the exposure of solvency, since solvency is, in our opinion, a key element in the management of assets and liabilities, and is a topic that is currently preoccupying researchers. The importance of the research is underlined by the fact that this subject is highly relevant in regard to insurance companies who have been subject to increased market demands in a business environment that have become difficult to navigate. Through the study conducted, built on relevant opinions from academic literature, we chose as the objective of the research, the identification of the influence variables and the intensity with which they impact the degree of exposure of the Romanian insurance company's solvency.

These principles play nowadays significant role in the modernization trends of public administration. They belong to principles of Good Governance, which were first defined in 1999, by SIGMA organization and gradually became the basis of efficient public administration in democratic states. Another important trend of contemporary public administration modernization is the development of citizen participation. This is the development of innovative tools that allow citizens to involve actively in decision-making processes of government. Transparency, openness and participation in public administration are currently significantly supported by the entry of modern technologies (Information and Communication Technologies) to this sector. One suitable means which allows better public access to information, greater transparency and citizen participation in decision-making is the development of e-government. This paper focuses on the e-government of local level, especially the disclosure of information on municipal websites. The research was done in the selected Czech municipal websites, where was evaluated the information availability rate about decision-making in the municipalities with extended competences and the availability of participation tools. There were analysed selected information available on the municipal websites in Moravian-Silesian region. The results of the research pointed out the shortcomings in publishing of information on municipal websites.

There are some customer experience approaches in the literature. One of them is flow theory which has intrinsic rewards. Flow theory as a good material to understand tourists' experience has researched in many studies like web and education applications. Though it's also investigated in adventure activities and the importance of the concept, limited research has been carried out. Paragliding is an exciting form of air adventure that satisfies the tourists' need, thereby explaining why it has become a popular adventure activity. Although a few studies have analysed multiple tourist experience, there is still a lack of research adopting the flow experience perspective to understand tourist experiences when participating in paragliding activities. Therefore this study adopts the concept of flow phenomenon to examine the tourist experience in paragliding. The study asked the attendees the extent to which they experienced flow. Open-ended questionnaire was conducted to gather data. The study employs content analytic procedures to analyse open-ended questionnaires to directly elicit attendees' flow experience. According to results, gliders experience challenge-skill balance, a sense of control, time distortion, clear goals, and focused attention dimensions of flow theory. Results of this study provide baseline data on the existence of flow phenomenon in the paragliding environment. It also provides knowledge about the factors associated with the flow experience and attendees' feelings and enjoyments in paragliding.

The industry cluster needs to break through the obstacles set by value chain leaders in terms of function and chain upgrade after inserting into global value chain. (2) Develop from primary industry cluster to Small and medium-sized enterprises cluster, and then to modern industry cluster.

In the last fifteen years, two significant events have affected the competitive performance of agriculture and the food industry in different EU countries, namely the EU accession of Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) and the global economic crisis of 2008. This paper evaluates the EU countries' competitive performance at a sector level in the intra-EU market from 1995 to 2011 by comparing the food industry and agriculture; and assessing the effects of the EU expansion and economic crisis on country competitiveness. EMS and RCA indices were used to measure the competitive performance over time. Results showed that although agriculture and the food industry in the EU are interconnected, they often reveal divergent trends in competitive performance. Germany and the Netherlands have profited the most from the opportunities resulting from the enlargement. On the contrary, France has lost competitiveness. A similar trend was found in Belgium. Italy shows a substantial competitive stasis, similar to Spain.","[Carraresi, Laura] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Banterle, Alessandro] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, I-20133 Milan, Italy",University of Bonn; University of Milan,"Carraresi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Meckenheimer Allee 174, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",l.carraresi@ilr.uni-bonn.de; alessandro.banterle@unimi.it,"Banterle, Alessandro/ACT-7678-2022; Carraresi, Laura/AAG-1718-2019","Carraresi, Laura/0000-0003-0081-6651; BANTERLE, ALESSANDRO/0000-0003-2301-5646",ERDF [SEE/B/0027/1.3/X],ERDF(European Union (EU)),"The paper was carried out within the research project Improving the enabling environment and public awareness for innovation in the South-East-European food sector through transnational collaboration (CAPINFOOD), which is a project financed by ERDF in the frame of the South East Europe Programme.

It is also one of the indicators to measure the quality of modern automobiles. In the article, it establishes a model of the vehicle nonlinear system for suspension with two degrees of freedom. It uses statistic linearization method to translate the random vibration issue in nonlinear system to that in linear system. Besides, a simulation study is conducted and real cars are tested.

To explore this issue, we analyse spot and futures markets on stock market indexes in different countries: the S&P500 for the US, and a representative set of European indexes (CAC40, DAX30, FTSE100, IBEX35 and EuroStoxx50). Consistent with expectations, we have shown that the correlation is not stable with the level of investor sentiment. More specifically, the correlation between the two markets diminishes significantly during periods of high investor sentiment. Moreover, volatility shocks in either market are also found to have less impact during these periods. These results are compatible with behavioural finance theories suggesting that high investor sentiment leads to an increase in noise trading and a decline in arbitrage activity due to institutional investors' attempts to limit their risk exposure.

We develop a 5-dimensional bipolar scale to measure the extent in which opportunities are Schumpeterian or Kirznerian. Drawing on this measure, we examine the shape of the opportunity distribution in relation to the environment and the characteristics of individuals who exploit them. Across a sample of 181 new products introduced by high-tech entrepreneurs, we find that pure Schumpeterian and Kirznerian types are rare, but rather opportunities display varying degrees of membership to one or the other type. The distribution is more skewed toward Schumpeterian opportunities for larger ventures, with a strategic focus on future needs, and operating in growing markets. In contrast, Kirznerian opportunities are more frequently pursued by small ventures, and by entrepreneurs that are young, with a strategic focus on present needs, and who are less innovative in their behavior.","[de Jong, Jeroen P.

In this paper, the authors aim to investigate the effects of the crisis on real estate prices by measuring the impact of transportation infrastructure location. For the purposes of this research, on-line real estate data collected in 2011, when the consequences of the crisis were still uncertain, and in 2013, when a significant decline had been observed, are combined. The analysis is based on various spatial statistical methods. In order to identify potential common price patterns, G spatial clustering is first performed. Spatial error models (SEM) are then developed to parameterize the real estate prices. The results show that, overall, purchase prices have been reduced by 18.2% and rents by 15.2%. More specifically, the positive impact of metro station locations (<500 m) has declined 42.5% for purchase prices and 62.5% for rents. Moreover, dwellings located in the Inner Ring are still more expensive than others; however, the impact of the crisis has been reduced by 30.3% for purchases and 50.7% for rents. On the other hand, the negative impact of ISAP station locations (<500 m) has declined by 53.5% for purchase prices. The findings of this paper could be of great interest to the transportation policy research community and could be used to better predict the benefits and costs of public transport investment under extremely uncertain conditions, such as a long-lasting recession.

The paper uses a small-scale macro model to help illuminate the Federal Reserve's use of forward guidance.

The way how to protect from risk portfolio that includes warrants may be delta-hedging and gamma-hedging. The former is immune to the small changes in underlying asset's price and the letter even for greater changes in price. In this paper we try to answer the question what is the small change in price of an underlying asset. For this purpose we construct 50 portfolios which are delta-neutral and observe and compare how their value reacts to the certain levels of volatility of the underlying asset's price.

As a kind of Internet finance products, Yu'e Bao combines electronic products with monetary fund. Comparing with traditional finance products, Yu'e Bao is more transparent, convenient, novel and has a higher yield rate. Especially, its T+0 withdraw pattern assists in the capital turnover. After being launched, Yu'e Bao rapidly develops and brings revolutionary changes to traditional finance, greatly improving its efficiency. However, the nature of Yu'e Bao is a finance product. There are still some loopholes in its mechanism and regulations. Once some risks appear during the operation, it may not only influence its yield and impede its further development, but have an effect on the national economy. Therefore, this paper takes literature review method and theoretical models combined with empirical analysis method to make an in-depth analysis of the risks of Yu'e Bao. It identifies 3 important risks of Yu'e Bao: the credit risk, the operation risk and the market risk. Then, it constructs its risk measurement system combining the constantly updated data of Yu'e Bao and its operation with the selection of confidence and uses VaR model to make empirical analysis of the risks of Yu'e Bao.

In this paper we presented which are key advantages and disadvantages of fiscal autonomy, and analyze the degree of fiscal autonomy for two medium economical developed counties from Romania. Our results indicate that the degree of local autonomy in the analyzed timeline has never been higher than 30%, proving the need for fiscal transfers from the central budget to the local budgets. Also, we have shown that viewing local fiscal autonomy from the financial point of view isn't enough, because the other important piece of the puzzle, the local government responsibilities are hindered by the lack of legislative autonomy. Nevertheless, we have shown that unbalanced ratios between the sizes of the local public expenses to local revenues are one of the major factors that hinder the economic development, in a rigid environment regarding local autonomy.","[Ivanescu, George; Macsim, Florin-Alexandru; Carausu, Dumitru-Nicusor] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Ivanescu, G (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",geivanescu@gmail.com; florin.macsim1@yahoo.ro; nicusor@live.com,"Carausu, Dumitru-Nicusor/AAV-5311-2020","Carausu, Dumitru-Nicusor/0000-0001-9177-4252",,,,,12,0,0,0,16,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-142-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,456,464,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD6RH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362516600045,0

The present study investigates the possibilities of developing organic farming in Romania and Serbia. The results show that there is a great application that can ensure its development, considering many factors relating to the way in which resources are exploited. Thus, statistical data about agricultural areas under organic farming, uncultivated areas, use of chemicals, and number of semi-subsistent farms are gathered in both countries and comparative analyzed.

Thus, the biodiesel industry has become the most important outlet for rapeseed oil. In light of the increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) saving requirements at the European level, this situation may change: according to the default values specified in the current legislation, biodiesel produced from rapeseed oil will not meet GHG saving requirements as of 2017. In this article, we assess the market impacts of the withdrawal of rapeseed oil from the biodiesel industry in Germany and Europe. Simulations with the MAGNET and CAPRI modelling systems indicate a decline in producer prices for rapeseed of approximately 17% in the EU. The area dedicated to rapeseed production will decline by 6%. Rapeseed oil is primarily substituted by imported vegetable oils. Simultaneously, imports of biodiesel from North America, Argentina and Asia are projected to increase. We investigate options to improve the GHG balance of rapeseed biodiesel. We conclude that only a combination of climate-friendly produced fertiliser and efficient conversion processes can provide the necessary GHG emission-savings to meet the EU's sustainability goals after 2017.","[Junker, Franziska] Thunen Inst Marktanal, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany; [Gocht, Alexander; Marquardt, Sandra] Thunen Inst Betriebswirtschaft, Braunschweig, Germany; [Osterburg, Bernhard] Thunen Inst Landliche Raume, Braunschweig, Germany; [Stichnothe, Heinz] Thunen Inst Agrartechnol, D-52425 Braunschweig, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Junker, F (通讯作者)，Thunen Inst Marktanal, Bundesallee 50, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",franziska.junker@ti.bund.de,,,,,,,42,5,5,0,11,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

In the case of personnel expenses, this new approach to resource management using RAB system has led to improvement of utilization of the resources. The research is based on data for total staff numbers and unit personnel costs (in 2005 constant prices) that were spent on maintaining army manpower from 1980 to 2011. The following periods are analysed: First is the period preceding RAB (from 1980 to 2001); the second period comprises the introduction of RAB during 2001 to 2011. Software STAT1 was used to analyse the collected data. The statistical solution of the given problem has a two-tailed nature; it means that the mean and variance of data was compared in both analysed periods. In the period after the implementation of RAB there was a slowdown in manpower reduction. In the period before the introduction of RAB the staff level was reduced by an average of 5,650 people a year that represents an annual decrease of 2.1%. After the introduction of RAB the average annual decline slowed down to 1920 people (respectively by 0.97%). After the introduction of RAB, in terms of raising the cost of manpower, the extent of investment spending remains unchanged.","[Krc, Miroslav; Golik, Vladimir] Univ Def, Fac Mil Leadership, Dept Econ, Kounicova 65, Brno 66210, Czech Republic",University of Defence - Czech Republic,"Krc, M (通讯作者)，Univ Def, Fac Mil Leadership, Dept Econ, Kounicova 65, Brno 66210, Czech Republic.",miroslav.krc@unob.cz; vladimir.golik@unob.cz,"Golik, Vladimir Ivanovich/K-3731-2018; Vladimir, Golik/U-9000-2019; Krč, Miroslav/AAZ-1851-2021",,,,,,8,3,3,0,0,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,320,325,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200043,0

Methods: Viability of PC12 cells induced by high glucose was detected by MTT assay and cell death by lactate dehydrogenase release. Nucleic acid status in the cell was observed by Hoechst 33342 staining. NO and NOS were measured using detection assay kits. Results: PC12 cells were pretreated with various concentrations of rutin for 1 h and then coped with rutin and D-glucose for 48 h. Rutin protected PC12 cells against high glucose damage, which was determined by cell viability and apoptosis as evaluated by Hoechst 33342 staining assay. Rutin inhibited increased NOS activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Increased NO level was significantly reduced by rutin. Conclusions: Findings revealed the protective effect of rutin against high glucose-induced oxidative damage in PC12 cells.

The theoretical part of the study defines the terms: marketing location, foreign investment and presented measures that country should take to increase the inflow of foreign investment. Due to geofigureical location, climatic conditions and soil workability Bosnia and Herzegovina ranks among the countries that have a high potential for the development of the food sector. Starting from this assumption, in the empirical part of the paper there are secondary and primary research. Secondary research is based on observations of the inflow of foreign investment in the food sector of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the period from 2011 to 2014. Primary research is based on observations of ten companies from the food sector, which in its owner's equity have a part or all foreign ownership. The research confirms that Bosnia and Herzegovina has a great potential for the development of the food sector, and that it is precisely this line of business that is to be regarded as primary for further development. However, despite this fact foreign investors show their dissatisfaction with business environment, complex political structure, insufficient and inadequate incentives from the Government. Based on the results of research comes the conclusion that Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to make huge changes in many spheres of business and political environment in order to become competitive with the countries of the region and to achieve significant volume of foreign investments.","[Ninic, Boro] Govt Brcko Dist, Directorate Finance Tax Adm, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg",,"Ninic, B (通讯作者)，Govt Brcko Dist, Directorate Finance Tax Adm, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg.",boro.ninic@hotmail.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,227,243,,,,,,17,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700013,0

Using standard dispersion indicators to measure the degree of poultry prices volatility and the GARCH-type models to specify poultry international price volatility at time 't' as a function of lagged shocks, we obtain the following results: poultry prices experienced less volatility in recent years relatively to other commodity prices; and the transmission of price volatility from other commodities to poultry prices is rather weak.

Starting with the original consumption capital asset pricing model (CCAPM) derivations, we review both theory and subsequent tests and provide some new applications. The consumption aggregation theorem and CCAPM are derived, and optimal consumption and portfolio strategies are discussed. The term structure of interest rates is derived from the term structures for expected growth, volatility, and inflation.

In addition to various empirical tests, models and tests of limited participation in asset markets as well as models of incomplete markets are presented.

This omission may reduce the credibility of the valuation scenario and contribute to hypothetical bias. In the study outlined in this paper, a choice experiment was conducted to elicit values for environmental improvements in the Great Barrier Reef (Australia), with outcome certainty included as a separate attribute. Different specifications of the utility functions, which imply different behavioural assumptions about the way choices have been made, generate variations in value estimates. Results showed that respondents incorporate outcome certainty into their decisions, but that an expected utility formulation, represented by the interaction between environmental protection and likelihood of occurrence, underestimated environmental values. Some environmental protection values appear to be independent of outcome certainty, which may be consistent with existence values and other non-use categories. A partial expected utility model is cautiously recommended.","[Rolfe, John; Windle, Jill] CQUniversity, Sch Business & Law, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia",Central Queensland University,"Rolfe, J (通讯作者)，CQUniversity, Sch Business & Law, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia.",j.rolfe@cqu.edu.au,"Rolfe, John/O-2945-2017","Rolfe, John/0000-0001-7659-7040",,,,,37,26,30,1,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Managerial flexibility has become the most important source of competitive advantage. Corporate financial theory tries to describe it through the development of real options. During the practical analysis of strategic investments, the results of strategic and financial analysis should be reconciled. The point is how the real option approach can be appropriate for closing the gap between strategic and financial valuation. Traditional integrated management systems do not apply real options; however, based on my former studies, I suggest a strategic real option model, which can be used for the development of strategic communication and decision-making process concerning value creating investments.

Central banks need to decide how much effort to put into developing credit risk assessment tools, taking into account their resources and limitations. This paper proposes a tool that is both pragmatic and conceptually sound, which allows to improve the assessment of credit risk for foreign reserves managers and complements the information produced by the rating agencies. The tool we propose uses three different credit risk models in order to identify the issuers that have a high, moderate, or low probability of having a ratings downgrade below the minimum accepted rating, within the issuers that meet the minimum rating requirements. The signals from the tool are built from market and fundamental information of each issuer. Additionally there is a proposal for a framework to turn the outputs from the model into investment decisions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The study summarizes the issues relating to the national and international IT audit regulations. It highlights the key differences between audit and other forms of economic audit (e.g. financial, internal or statutory). The paper presents the main components of IT audit, namely data center audit, computer network audit, operating system audit, Internet servers audit, database auditing, application auditing, external access flows IT audit (e.g. radio access, access from mobile devices). Practical aspects of the study describe database auditing as an important element of IT audit process. Current trends are presented for processing and storing data in relationship with data storage centers, cloud processing and inclusion of mobile devices as data access terminals. The author makes a presentation of database components that are relevant to database audit. Database audited components concern: file system database, data dictionary, database objects, database customer analysis, data protection and backup system, security and data protection from database. The last part of the paper is dedicated to preparing a new practical approach regarding the audit steps and technical means used in databes auditing. Finally, the author emphasizes the importance of database auditing, of data security and of the need to develop new technical auditing methods which are to be in consensus with the rapid development of Information Technology.

We can detect the impact of changes on final demand in economics by using direct and indirect multipliers from ICI tables. Basic prerequisite for using I-O analysis is long-term stability of economic structure. It is important to know estimations of impacts not only on national but also on regional level to formulate effective national Economic practice. Regional I-O tables are not usually available and they have to be derived from national tables by using mathematical and statistical methods. The aim of this contribution is to analyze potential of I-O multipliers on regional level for creating long-term Economic Policy. This goal will be achieved by using case study of multipliers stability on the level of Moravian-Silesian Region between years 2007-2012 in the context of Czech Republic multipliers. Dynamics of each sector's multipliers will be analyzed with correction component of regional model.

It analyzes how firm ownership via foreign capital affects the investment location choice of the foreign firm, and policy competition between the potential host countries. The findings show that the inflow of foreign capital changes the investment location choice of the foreign firm, as does policy competition between the host countries. Further, an increase in the inflow of foreign capital to a domestic firm in the host country heightens the country's attractiveness as an investment location. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
