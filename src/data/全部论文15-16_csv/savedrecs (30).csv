The research question is What kind of context-specific attributes can be identified in the RECS with respect to procurement, arguing that a better understanding of complex performance procurement is required. The underlying assumption is that although procurement may have generic qualities that are valid despite the industrial context, the construction sector offers unique attributes in respect to procurement. We classify these aspects under four categories: relationship management, supply risk, coordination, and learning/knowledge sharing. The key context-specific attributes include a varying relationship lifecycle, the unique and complex nature of products and services, customisation and the non-repetitive and temporary nature of projects. The key managerial issues involve the acquisition of a wide range of procurement competencies and the overall status of procurement in the organisation. Hence, managing procurement efficiently and competently requires the understanding of all these aspects. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The main purpose of this paper is to assess current traceability systems implemented in South African sheep abattoirs, thereby establishing their ability to guarantee the origin of a carcass. Research indicated that the South African sheep abattoirs have traceability systems in place and they can guarantee the origin of a meat product. The descriptive analysis and hypothesis tests identified the tipping factor for the implementation of a traceability system, as the requirement from retail markets to which these abattoirs deliver their product.","[van der Merwe, M.; Kirsten, J.

Good leader is capable to ensure that strategic goals are fulfilled. Thanks to globalization and rapid changes companies must act quickly and competently if they want to be competitive and profitable. An effective leadership is required to have all the necessary knowledges, competencies and skills. Especially leadership skills are critical to organizations. It is not easy to determinate competencies successfully. And especially for leaders. The object of this paper is to introduce two chosen leadership models. The first one is an effective model for leadership based on theoretical knowledge. It is based on four major competency categories. These are: 1. self-leadership, 2. managing others, 3. psychological factors and 4. environmental factors. These categories together form a Competency model which we call the Model for Effective Leadership. We breakdown the model of the four factors and we make an analysis of each factor. The second introduced model is Leadership Competency Model made by very successful international organization. It is composed of five competency categories: 1. Abilities to achieve results, 2. Focus on Result, 3. Character, 4. Interpersonal competency, 5. Professional skills. At the end we compare these two models and choose competencies and try to tell which is better in which way and why. Successful leadership helps company to achieve and sustain a competitive position in the market, as well as to bring business value and to keep the overall growth.","[Viskupicova, Jana] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Viskupicová, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Management, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",jankavisk@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,1,13,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4200-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,907,917,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF1SG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380432500108,0

Mb can also bind and catalytically reduce Au (III) to Au (0). In the presence of hydroquinone as a electron donator, Mb can catalyze Au(III) reduce to Au(0) and yield gold nanoparticles continuously. In this paper, a quantitative assay method for the content of Mb has been used. Continuous reduction of Au (H) by Mb can be achieved by using hydroquinone as the reducing agent. Effect of pH, reaction temperature, reaction time on Mb-mediated synthesis of gold nanoparticles was studied. The optimal conditions of gold nanoparticles synthesis were as follows: the optimum pH value was 5.1, the optimum reaction temperature was 40 C, the optimum reaction time was 15-20min.

For more close to the actual, we consider the several realities of situations, such as imperfect quality, multiple screening, inspection errors and shortage backordering. We then use the optimal theory to get the optimal decision of order size, the maximum shortage level and the optimal delivery times. Based on it, we also find two useful managerial insights. First, the vendor and the buyer do not need pay attention on changing order size and maximum shortage level when defective probabilities changes.

The empirical approach addresses the possibility that COBRA enrollment is endogenous with respect to post-separation employment outcomes. The main finding is that, although COBRA enrollees are 5 percentage points less likely to become re-employed, this relationship is not causal. Rather, individuals with lower probabilities of becoming re-employed tend to enroll in COBRA. The reason appears to be because, when compared to subjects who voluntarily leave for other jobs, subjects who separate for other reasons not only are less likely to become re-employed, but they also are approximately 23% more likely to enroll in COBRA.","[Zimmer, David M.] Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Econ, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA",Western Kentucky University,"Zimmer, DM (通讯作者)，Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Econ, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA.",david.zimmer@wku.edu,,,,,,,22,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Contrary to static models, where it acts as noise, in dynamic markets stochastic supply contains information about risk premiums. Acquiring private dividend information helps investors disentangle dividend information from discount-rate information contained in prices. For uninformed investors, however, as more informed investors enter the economy prices become more informative about dividends but less informative about discount rates.

The results consistently show, for different specifications and samples of municipalities, that this program brought a substantial decrease of municipalities' expenditures (mostly because of decreases in salary payments), and an increase of local property tax collection. Our analysis shows that all of the fiscal impact of the program is due to the appointment of an accountant that reports directly to the central government, a relatively mild form of administrative subordination. In contrast, more intrusive forms of subordination, like the central imposition of a recovery program, do not result in any substantial improvement of municipalities' fiscal situation. This leads us to conclude that a mild form of administrative subordination is an effective tool to cope with problems related to soft-budget constraints, whereas political subordination is not an effective tool to reach that goal.

Yet few projections of Japan's future demography go beyond estimating population by age and sex to forecast the complex evolution of the health and functioning of the future elderly. This study estimates a new state-transition microsimulation model - the Japanese Future Elderly Model (FEM) - for Japan. We use the model to forecast disability and health for Japan's future elderly. Our simulation suggests that by 2040, over 27 percent of Japan's elderly will exhibit 3 or more limitations in IADLs and social functioning; almost one in 4 will experience difficulties with 3 or more ADLs; and approximately one in 5 will suffer limitations in cognitive or intellectual functioning. Since the majority of the increase in disability arises from the aging of the Japanese population, prevention efforts that reduce age-specific morbidity can help reduce the burden of disability but may have only a limited impact on reducing the overall prevalence of disability among Japanese elderly. While both age and morbidity contribute to a predicted increase in disability burden among elderly Japanese in the future, our simulation results suggest that the impact of population aging exceeds the effect of age-specific morbidity on increasing disability in Japan's future.

Under normal economic conditions, most entrepreneurs who requested loans receive them. In a global financial crisis, popular opinion is that banks are severely restricting lending to smaller businesses. This assumes that low levels of investment are caused by supply-side restrictions in the credit market. Little is said about potential changes in the demand for credit and how it is influenced by entrepreneurs' perceptions about supply-side restrictions. One particularly interesting, and under-researched, group of small businesses is that who have potentially good investment opportunities, but are discouraged from applying for external funding as they fear rejection. In this study, we question whether these entrepreneurs were correct in their assumptions. We find that levels of discouragement are quite low in general at 2.7 % of the total smaller business population. Further analysis implies that 55.6 % of discouraged borrowers would have got loans had they applied.","[Cowling, Marc] Univ Brighton, Sch Business, Brighton BN2 4AT, E Sussex, England; [Liu, Weixi] Univ Bath, Sch Management, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Minniti, Maria] Syracuse Univ, Whitman Sch Management, 721 Univ Ave, Syracuse, NY USA; [Zhang, Ning] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, 111 Ren Ai Rd, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",University of Brighton; University of Bath; Syracuse University; Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,"Cowling, M (通讯作者)，Univ Brighton, Sch Business, Brighton BN2 4AT, E Sussex, England.",M.Cowling2@brighton.ac.uk,,"Cowling, Marc/0000-0001-5731-8712; Liu, Weixi/0000-0002-9971-5748",,,,,76,52,54,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We examine depth by studying whether a bank's preference for domestic, as opposed to external, lending (funding) changes when it is subjected to a large public intervention, such as bank nationalization. Our results suggest that, following nationalization, non-British banks allocate their lending away from the UK and increase their external funding. Second, we find that nationalized banks from the same country tend to have portfolios of foreign assets that are spread across countries in a way that is far more similar than those of either private banks from the same country or nationalized banks from different countries, consistent with an impact on the breadth of globalization. Third, we study the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to examine the persistence of the effect of large government interventions. We find weak evidence that upon entry into the TARP, foreign lending declines but domestic does not. This effect is observable at the aggregate level, and seems to disappear upon TARP exit. Collectively, this evidence suggests that large government interventions affect the depth and breadth of banking globalization, but may not persist after public interventions are unwound. J.

This paper specifically focuses on the economic impacts of the increase in pension eligible age in Japan. The results show that employment to population ratio increases by 2.2 percentage points for people ages 55-59, 5.9 percentage points for 60-64, and 1.9 percentage points for ages 65-69, but does not have an effect on other age groups. The larger behavioral response is in contrast with much smaller responses found in Europe and the U.S. This could be due to the absence of early retirement pension benefits in Japan. The labor income increases for these age groups accordingly. The results based on the Japan data from the 1984-2004 National Transfer Accounts also suggests the shift of age profiles of pension benefits toward older age groups due to the reform. Our simulation results suggest that, with the estimated labor market responses in the study, the policy change will decrease savings in the long-run, although the effect will be quite modest.

Research that examines the effects of maternal employment on children has been motivated by the rapid increase of female participation rates in the labour market and increased shares of children living in female-headed or single-mother households. The existing literature on this issue is very limited, mostly based on American data, and provides conflicting results. Fixed effects have been used in the present analysis to control for characteristics of children and mothers that do not vary over time. The results suggest that full-time maternal employment (as opposed to part-time) has little or no effect on the propensity of adolescents to smoke, their life satisfaction, self-esteem, or intention to leave school at 16. These results are stable and consistent across various specifications of the model and different socio-economic status.","[Mendolia, Silvia] Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Fac Business, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Mendolia, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Fac Business, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",silvia_mendolia@uow.edu.au,,"Mendolia, Silvia/0000-0001-8902-6394",,,,,45,4,4,0,23,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

We use the difference-in-differences approach (DD), comparing individual levels of satisfaction with the economy in Slovakia immediately before and after the introduction of the Euro, with similar individuals in neighboring Czech Republic, which did not adopt the Euro. Both countries were economically and politically integrated for decades, and display similar macroeconomic behavior before and after the currency change in Slovakia. What we assess is not the actual, economic, costs stemming from the Euro adoption, but the change in utility as perceived by the individuals. There is evidence of substantial psychological costs associated with currency transition, especially for the old, the unemployed, the poorly educated and households with children. Our results are robust to the use of alternative control groups and to estimation procedures using the DD matching approach. The significant perceived costs uncovered in this paper suggest policy-makers should not ignore them when considering a sweeping economic change such as the adoption of a new currency.","[Otrachshenko, Vladimir; Tavares, Jose] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal; [Popova, Olga] Inst East & Southeast European Studies IOS, Landshuter Str 4, D-93047 Regensburg, Germany; [Popova, Olga] CERGE EI, Politickych Veznu 7, Prague 11121, Czech Republic; [Otrachshenko, Vladimir; Popova, Olga] Ural Fed Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Management, Mira 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia; [Tavares, Jose] Ctr Econ Policy Res, 53-56 Great Sutton St, London EC1V 0DG, England",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Leibniz Institut fur Ost und Sudosteuropaforschung; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Ural Federal University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Otrachshenko, V (通讯作者)，Nova Sch Business & Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal.",vladotr@novasbe.pt; popova@ios-regensburg.de; jtavares@fe.unl.pt,"Otrachshenko, Vladimir/HTN-3010-2023; Popova, Olga/H-3165-2014","Otrachshenko, Vladimir/0000-0002-2957-8741; Popova, Olga/0000-0001-9859-1504; Tavares, Jose/0000-0002-8159-9646","Fundacao Amelia de Mello; Fundacao para a Ciencia a Tecnologia, Portugal [VID/ECO/00124/2013]; Nova Forum","Fundacao Amelia de Mello; Fundacao para a Ciencia a Tecnologia, Portugal(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Nova Forum","Vladimir Otrachshenko acknowledges financial support from Fundacao Amelia de Mello and the Fundacao para a Ciencia a Tecnologia, Portugal (VID/ECO/00124/2013).

This sector, however, has not been considered as a driving force of innovation and productivity increase in comparison to other sectors in the economy. However, recent economics and international business literature suggests that the agricultural sector (i) has become knowledge intensive with the rise of biotechnology and (ii) is a sector where firms in developing countries can play an important role in the innovation process, given their context-specific or in situ knowledge-based capital. In this article, we present a conceptual framework that characterizes the knowledge base required for agricultural innovation against the backdrop of globalization and rise of biotechnology. We then apply the framework to examine the catchup of Indian seed firms with Bacillus thuringiensis technology, an insect-resistant seed technology used in cotton hybrids. We focus on the role of the knowledge base in the catch-up process, specifically examining the dynamics of knowledge creation or acquisition by local seed firms based on their interactions with global as well as other local players. Our analysis reveals the diverse pathways followed by local firms to catch-up, and that the firms with the ability to efficiently integrate location-specific (in situ) and scientific (global) were able to successfully catch-up and compete in domestic seed markets.","[Thutupalli, Ajay; Iizuka, Michiko] UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Thutupalli, A (通讯作者)，UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands.",thutupalli@merit.unu.edu; iizuka@merit.unu.edu,,"Iizuka, Michiko/0000-0002-7098-1575",European Union [612889],European Union(European Union (EU)),"We gratefully acknowledge the support of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme project, MNEmerge (grant agreement No. 612889).

This paper uses global, spatially explicit data to analyze how extensification can be located to meet crop demand in a way that minimizes carbon losses under varying levels of intensification. Carbon preserving extensification can reduce carbon loss by 7.3 billion tons compared to proportionally increasing extensification by 2050, valued at $1.3 trillion (2012 dollars) based on an estimated social cost of carbon of $181 per ton of carbon (similar to$50 per ton CO2).","[Johnson, Justin Andrew; Runge, Carlisle Ford; Polasky, Stephen] Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Runge, Carlisle Ford] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ & Law, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Senauer, Benjamin] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Polasky, Stephen] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, Ecol Environm Econ, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Johnson, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Inst Environm, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",,"Polasky, Stephen/AAC-5341-2019",,,,,,48,6,9,3,45,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 728 State Street, Suite 443, MADISON, WI, UNITED STATES",0023-7639,1543-8325,,LAND ECON,Land Econ.,NOV,2016,92.0,4,,,,,579,592,,10.3368/le.92.4.579,0.0,,,14,Economics; Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DY4FN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385054500001,0

Meanwhile, at the level of individuals, spending patterns change as people age. This paper investigates the extent to which demographic change is likely to affect household spending patterns by combining the techniques of dynamic microsimulation with an imputation method known as random assignment. While there has been significant concern about the economic cost of the ageing population, this paper finds a potentially beneficial effect in the form of an increase in total spending for most expenditure categories.","[Lawson, Tony] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Lawson, T (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,,,,,38,3,3,2,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

In this discussion, I argue that the evidence is largely circumstantial and puzzling in several respects.

Official statements from the tax administration regarding enforcement effort provide some information. In addition, informal, or unofficial, communication among taxpayers can supplement these official announcements, but individuals do not know with certainty whether such unofficial information is honest (or accurate) versus dishonest (or inaccurate). We examine the truthfulness of an individual's revelation of unofficial information to other individuals, along with the factors that affect any revelation, focusing on the intrinsic motivations for revelations. Our experimental design allows us to examine the type and the honesty of messages that an individual chooses to send to other individuals regarding their own audit outcome and their own compliance behavior. Our results indicate that most individuals send accurate messages about their own audit outcomes and their own compliance behaviors. Nevertheless, many individuals are also systematically dishonest about being audited; that is, we observe a significant tendency for individuals to claim that they were audited when they were not. We also observe a strong interaction between individuals' audit outcomes and their compliance behaviors, so that individuals who engaged in tax evasion and who were audited were more truthful in their communications than those whose tax evasion went undetected.

However, increasing the width of bicycle facilities reduces lane space for motor vehicles, in turn impacting a road's level of service. Presently, no framework exists to systematically measure the potential travel time consequences of employing wider bicycle facilities on a road network. In this paper, we demonstrate how the Network Robustness Index (NRI) can be used to identify the bicycle facility design that limits traffic disruption for any road link in an urban network. To demonstrate the utility of the new approach, we use a theoretical, generalizable network and compare it against an approach used in current bike lane planning practice. The results show that if a planner is challenged to build a road network of wider bicycle facilities while at the same time minimizing potential impacts on motor vehicle traffic, their decision-making power improves when using the NRI to support this aim. If widely adopted, this new evaluation framework may lead to the development of better urban cycling networks that consist of wider bicycle facilities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to systematically test if these two aspects interact with each other. In Studies 1 and 2, we created hypothetical charity appeals related to the Syrian refugee crisis and factorially manipulated characteristics of victims possible to help (one identified child/nine non-identified children) and presence of statistical information about the scope and nature of the problem (information-box absent/present). We found a significant interaction effect both when using self-rated helping intention (Study 1), and when using actual donation behavior as the dependent variable (Study 2). Statistical information decreased helping intentions toward a single identified child but had no, or even a small positive effect on helping nine non-identified children. In Study 3, non-student participants reading a charity appeal with both a story about one identified child and statistical information donated less often than participants reading appeals with either only a story about one identified child or only statistical information. We suggest that both emotional arguments (e.g., a story and picture of an identified child in need) and analytical arguments (e.g., detailed statistical information about the scope and nature of the problem) can make us more motivated to help refugees, but that mixing different argument-types can make charity appeals internally inconsistent and decrease donations.

Using these sources, we explore how participant involvement in the public sector affects the distribution of asset class allocations, management fees, investment outcomes, and portfolio rebalancing at both the individual and aggregate levels. We found that there is little difference between the DB and non-DB plans in terms of asset mix, returns, and fees, except that DB plan have greater access and allocations to alternative investments.

In EMs, skewness is mostly positive and idiosyncratic, and significantly relates to a country's financial and trade openness and balance of payments.

Debt overhang emerges when highly leveraged sellers are forced to post high prices that produce long selling delays. These delays increase foreclosures, raise default premia, and curtail credit. Cheaper credit fuels temporarily higher house prices, faster sales, and fewer foreclosures, but the borrowing surge facilitates future debt overhang and default. More stringent foreclosure punishments also expand credit and, therefore, either generate higher foreclosures or more debt overhang. Leverage caps avoid this conundrum but reduce welfare by restricting borrowing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This global phenomenon has not been restricted to the Global South, but has also been, unexpectedly and interestingly, felt in the Global North in contexts that were considered to be ruled by political systems where the impacts of rapid resource extraction would not be felt. Between 2005 and 2010, for example, the volume of metallic ore and waste rock mining in Finland increased from fewer than 5 million tons to 46 million tons, mostly through the inauguration of four large mines in the east and north of the country. This paper examines the various explanations for the mining expansion, based on expert interviews, participant observation and a spatial analysis of the change dynamics. The importance and causalities in the control and divisions of social, physical and symbolic spaces are assessed, drawing on and interweaving the theories of Arrighi and Harvey, and conceptualizations of Moore and Bourdieu. A series of fertile conceptual tools for analysing the role of spatial dynamics in land-use changes is developed and put to work in the empirical analysis. The results are significant for the literatures on spatial dynamics and Arctic land-use change.","[Kroger, Markus] Univ Helsinki, Dept Social Res, Unioninkatu 37,POB 54, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Kroger, Markus] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Unioninkatu 37,POB 54, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Kröger, M (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Social Res, Unioninkatu 37,POB 54, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.;Kröger, M (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Unioninkatu 37,POB 54, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",markus.kroger@gmail.com,"Kröger, Markus/AAA-3219-2020","Kröger, Markus/0000-0001-7324-4549",Academy of Finland,Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland),"I would like to thank the editors, the anonymous reviewers and all those interviewed for their time and for their extremely constructive comments.

These are investigated via a discrete choice experiment featuring four information treatments and a retest survey completed 6 months after the first. Three information treatments concern a novel, stem cell, food technology with the fourth information treatment featuring a non-novel technology. We find stable welfare estimates over the three information treatments; the use of emotive keywords does not systematically change WTP to avoid the stem cell food technology. We find a significant WTP to avoid the non-novel technology. We find high levels of intertemporal preference stability and choice consistency. The determinants of choice consistency are examined. Two factors are significant: a measure of the choice task's complexity (entropy) and a novel measure of respondents' cognitive capability, derived within the survey. We find a significant selection issue, not previously identified in discrete choice experiment test-retest studies, with those opting to take the retest exhibiting greater choice consistency in the initial survey. This suggests that studies which report high levels of test-retest choice consistency, without accounting for the selection issue, are overstating population choice consistency.","[Rigby, Dan] Univ Manchester, Environm Econ Sch Social Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Burton, Michael; Pluske, Jo] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Perth, WA, Australia",University of Manchester; University of Western Australia,"Rigby, D (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Environm Econ Sch Social Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England.",dan.rigby@man.ac.uk; michael.burton@uwa.edu.au; johanna.pluske@uwa.edu.au,"Rigby, Dan/A-9606-2009; burton, michael/A-9541-2009","rigby, dan/0000-0003-0820-5740; burton, michael/0000-0003-4213-4093",CSIRO Flagship Collaboration Fund Projects: the Breed Engineering Theme of the CSIRO Food Futures Flagship,CSIRO Flagship Collaboration Fund Projects: the Breed Engineering Theme of the CSIRO Food Futures Flagship,"The authors acknowledge funding from CSIRO Flagship Collaboration Fund Projects: the Breed Engineering Theme of the CSIRO Food Futures Flagship, and acknowledge that all views expressed in this paper are their own.

We set up a game-theoretical model to derive the participation conditions for a non-Annex I country and evaluate the effect of a no-lose target on the reduction of global emissions. Our analyses show that meaningful contributions from non-Annex I countries are possible, but their contribution to global emission reductions is limited and depends on several factors. Ambitious targets for the Annex I countries are a precondition. Further determining factors are differences in the abatement potentials between Annex I and non-Annex I countries, and market power on the certificate market.

As a result of logically categorizing various definitions of seigniorage (opportunity cost approach, monetary approach, and inflation tax), we conclude that these differences pivot on the issue of whether to confine the scope of debts, which is reduced by unexpected inflation, to the usual general government debt or to expand it to the integrated government debt including the monetary base of the Bank of Japan. We also point out the possibility that, in light of the degree of reduction in government debt as a percentage of GDP during and after the Pacific War, the monetary approach or inflation tax (the cases of confining the taxation base to the usual general government debt) are appropriate means to estimate seigniorage obtained by the general government.

This article examines whether these changes affected earnings trends among immigrants. Among all new immigrants and economic principal applicants, aside from cyclical fluctuations, entry earnings changed little over the 1990s and 2000s. This stability was the result of competing influences, some that tended to increase earnings and some that tended to reduce them. The key changes in immigrant characteristics that put upward pressure on entry earnings were the rising educational attainment in the 1990s and a large increase in the share of immigrants with high pre-landing Canadian earnings during the 2000s. The latter characteristic also accounted for the earnings advantage of provincial nominees over skilled worker immigrants. The policy implications of the results are discussed.","[Hou, Feng] STAT Canada, Social Anal & Modelling Div, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Hou, Feng] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Sociol, London, ON, Canada; [Picot, Garnett] Citizenship & Immigrat Canada, Res & Evaluat, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Picot, Garnett] Inst Res Publ Policy, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Statistics Canada; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Hou, F (通讯作者)，STAT Canada, Social Anal & Modelling Div, Ottawa, ON, Canada.;Hou, F (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Dept Sociol, London, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,15,15,17,0,2,CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY,GUELPH,"UNIV GUELPH, ROOM 039 MACKINNON BLDG, GUELPH, ONTARIO N1G 2W1, CANADA",0317-0861,,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

This paper demonstrates that when the degree of price stickiness is endogenously determined in a Calvo model, indeterminacy caused by higher trend inflation is less likely. A key factor for determinacy is the long-run inflation elasticity of output implied by the New Keynesian Phillips curve. This elasticity declines substantially with higher trend inflation in the case of exogenously given price stickiness, whereas in the case of endogenous price stickiness the decline in the elasticity is mitigated because higher trend inflation leads to a higher probability of price adjustment.","[Kurozumi, Takushi] Bank Japan, Tokyo, Japan",Bank of Japan,"Kurozumi, T (通讯作者)，Bank Japan, Tokyo, Japan.",takushi.kurozumi@boj.or.jp,,,,,,,44,5,5,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

A review,EUROPEAN RESEARCH ON MANAGEMENT AND BUSINESS ECONOMICS,,,English,Review,,,,,,Securitization; Primary yield; Tranche,MODEL,"The reasons for the strong rise in the securitization phenomenon up until the start of the subprime crisis need to be analysed. According to many authors, they mainly stem from its offering the possibility of generating fixed yield securities with the highest rating and a low risk premium, thanks to the issues being structured in differentiated bond series, so that certain series absorb most of the risk, thus facilitating the safer or senior tranches having a higher rating. Accordingly, this paper reviews the literature on the factors underlying the generation of differentiated tranches in this type of issues and regarding the determining factors of the yield offered by securitization issues. It concludes that the search for more complete markets, along with the reducing of problems associated to the moral hazard, are the main reasons for the multi-tranche structuring. And given the strong influence of the number of tranches on the yield offered by the issues, the paper likewise concludes that the multitranche structures has been an efficient tool to place securitization issues with more competitive yields.

We explore the performance of a combinatorial landscape auction design to establish environmental corridors using an agent based simulation model. This modelling technique is highly flexible in modelling decision making processes involving heterogeneous landholders. Such structures allow landholders the opportunity to submit joint bids and, as such, share in the benefits that synergies across the landscape provide. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, we compare spatial and non-spatial project selection to observe whether it is possible to achieve corridor outcomes with a non-spatially targeted project selection mechanism? We observe that while a corridor project selection mechanism increases the procurement cost, such selection mechanisms are necessary for spatially targeted objectives. Second, we study the effect of allowing agents to form coalitions and submit joint bids. We find evidence that joint bidding substantially increased procurement costs especially when the agency's target was to secure environmental corridors. Third, we study the combined effect of off-site synergies and joint bidding. We observe that relative benefits from off-site synergy are higher in spatial targeting programs compared to non-corridor targeting programs.","[Iftekhar, Md.

For this purpose, we use a unique dataset based on data published on Tenders Electronic Daily which covers public procurement contract award notices for the 2008-2012 period and consists of more than 30 variables. Among others, results of the econometric estimation suggest that the probability of awarding a contract cross-border depends positively on the value of the contract and negatively on the number of bids. Among awarding country characteristics, GDP per capita and trade-to-GDP ratio are found to positively impact the probability of a cross-border award. Our results also provide econometric evidence for predictions from the economic theory. We make the case for the importance of product market regulation indicators used as proxies for anticompetitive practices, such as regulatory protection of incumbent firms and barriers to foreign direct investment, as well as the scope of public enterprises, and show that they have a significant negative impact on the probability of a cross-border win.","[Kutlina-Dimitrova, Zornitsa] European Commiss, Trade Anal Unit DG Trade, Brussels, Belgium; [Lakatos, Csilla] World Bank, Dev Prospects Grp, Global Modelling & Analyt Team, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Kutlina-Dimitrova, Z (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Trade Anal Unit DG Trade, Brussels, Belgium.",Zornitsa.KUTLINA-DIMITROVA@ec.europa.eu; clakatos1@worldbank.org,,,,,,,24,22,22,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We first show that the setting up of a nationalization policy is locally efficient only for high levels of horizontal product differentiation degree in the national market.

In a proper real-option-style model for the exporters' equity exposure to the foreign exchange rate, we argue, the convexity of the relationship implies that the elasticity should depend on the exchange rate level. For instance, it should shrink to zero when the option to export becomes worthless, and that should happen at a critical exchange rate that is still strictly positive. We propose a class of tractable multi-regime regression models featuring, in line with the real-options logic, smooth transitions and within-regime dynamics in the foreign exchange exposure. We then analyze the exchange rate exposure of Chinese exporting firms and find that the model in which the moneyness of the export option has a positive impact on the exchange rate exposure detects a significantly positive and convex exposure for 40% and 65% of the firms depending on whether the market return is included in the regression or not.","[Boudt, Kris] Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium; [Boudt, Kris] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Liu, Fang] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sercu, Piet] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Central University of Finance & Economics; KU Leuven,"Boudt, K (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.;Boudt, K (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,"Boudt, Kris/N-3646-2019","Boudt, Kris/0000-0002-1000-5142",Dutch science foundation,Dutch science foundation(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"An anonymous referee's suggestions are gratefully acknowledged as very useful to the current version of the article.

We find support for this hypothesis using trust-preferred securities issuance, a form of regulatory arbitrage available to almost all U.S. banks from 1996 to Dodd-Frank. We also find support for predictions that constrained banks are riskier, perform worse during the crisis, and use multiple forms of regulatory arbitrage.

In this paper motivations for diversification within livelihood strategies in rural communities in southern Laos are investigated through theories of distress-induced risk spreading in response to crises and progressive success and wealth. Results indicate that livelihood diversification at the household level is associated with higher wealth status and ownership of a range of assets as part of a progressive, accumulation livelihood strategy for those with fewer constraints. Diversification strategies across all socioeconomic groups commonly include a combination of agricultural and non-agricultural activities as well as migrant remittances, however, the types of activities undertaken are dependent on wealth. The increased asset status of households extends to enabling higher income-generating migration opportunities and may facilitate transition into both non-agricultural employment, as well as into a wider variety of agricultural employment activities. This further strengthens livelihoods through the mutually reinforcing complementarities across livelihood activities and reducing the risks associated with each. But this has the effect of leaving the poor, with lower levels of diversification, at most risk to natural or economic disasters or other shocks. Results have implications for development policy for rural southern Laos, highlighting the importance of recognizing the positive aspects of livelihood diversification for rural poverty reduction. Broadened policy mechanisms which support and encourage diversification and mobility at the household level are needed. Likewise, pro-poor development initiatives that focus on increasing the diversity of assets (rather than the quantity of any one single asset) of the poor are more likely to be successful in supporting livelihood diversification and reducing vulnerability.

However, managing one's personal finances takes more than financial knowledge and literacy: an individual also needs a sense of self-assuredness, or 'self-belief, in their own capabilities. This personal attribute is known within the psychology literature as 'self-efficacy'. This paper examines the significance of an individual's financial self-efficacy in explaining their personal finance behaviour, through the application of a psychometric instrument. Using a 2013 survey of Australian women, financial self-efficacy emerges as one of the strongest predictors of the type and number of financial products that a woman holds. Specifically, our analysis reveals that women with higher financial self-efficacy that is, with greater self-assuredness in their financial management capacities are more likely to hold investment and savings products, and less likely to hold debt-related products. Even alongside other important factors such as education, financial risk preferences, age and household income the explanatory power of financial self-efficacy is found to be significant at the 1% critical level. Moreover, the significance of financial self-efficacy is independently identified from that of financial literacy factors, which bears important implications for the development of policies aiming to improve financial outcomes.

A decision support system is introduced, which automatically generates a rail network and simulates passenger and freight traffic. In case of rail closures, freight traffic is rerouted and resulting delays are calculated. Furthermore, the option to transship from rail to road at terminals is enabled. The model is tested using data originating from a major transalpine rail corridor, the 'Brenner Pass', which connects Austria and Italy. Results show rail links which are critical and the impact of various disaster scenarios is compared. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

For identification, we exploit privatizations and deregulations of electricity markets, geographical variations in natural resources, the technological evolution of gas-fired power plants, and differences in electricity prices and recapitalization cost across regions. Production flexibility affects financial leverage via the channels of reduced expected cost of financial distress and higher present value of tax shields.

Sequentially-linked models capture natural resource constraints; emissions from land use change; economywide growth linkages; and household poverty. Results indicate that there are economic incentives to convert unused lands to sugarcane-ethanol production, but only grasslands (not forests) have a reasonable carbon payback period. There are also strong socioeconomic reasons to involve smallholders in feedstock production in order to reduce rural poverty, especially since our results indicate that biofuels have little effect on food production. Yet smallholders require more land than large-scale plantations and so face more binding natural resource and emissions constraints. Overall, environmental constraints alter the socioeconomically optimal biofuel strategy for Tanzania by limiting potential poverty reduction. Unlike previous studies, our integrated assessment suggests that a mixed farming system with greater emphasis on large-scale plantations is more appropriate for producing sugarcane-ethanol in Tanzania.","[Thurlow, James] Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Thurlow, James] United Nations Univ, World Inst Dev Econ Res, Katajanokanlaituri 6 B, Helsinki 00160, Finland; [Branca, Giacomo; Felix, Erika; Maltsoglou, Irini; Rincon, Luis E.] FAO, Rome, Italy",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Thurlow, J (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",j.thurlow@cgiar.org; giacomo.branca@fao.org; erika.felix@fao.org; irini.maltsoglou@fao.org; luis.rincon@fao.org,"Branca, Giacomo/N-5551-2015; Thurlow, James/JQW-4545-2023","Branca, Giacomo/0000-0002-4741-066X; Rincon, Luis/0000-0001-6007-8334",,,,,38,14,14,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Certain ECEs, especially mangroves, marshes, seagrasses and near-shore coral reefs, may significantly reduce storm surges through attenuating waves. This function is key to the protective value of ECEs, which is used as a basis for coastal restoration efforts worldwide. In a wealth accounting framework, net domestic product (NDP) should be adjusted for the direct benefits provided by the current stock of this restored ecological capital but not for their indirect contributions in terms of protecting or supporting economic activity, property and human livelihoods. If ecosystem restoration leads to the creation of new ecological landscape, including transforming developed land back to ecological capital, then NDP must be further modified to reflect any capital revaluation that occurs. Both the current benefits of restoration and any capitalized land values must be adjusted if there is a risk of restoration failure. These issues encountered in a wealth accounting approach to the protective value of ECEs is illustrated with reference to the case of marsh creation in Louisiana, USA, in light of the 2012 Louisiana Coastal Master Plan.","[Barbier, Edward B.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wyoming,"Barbier, EB (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",ebarbier@uwyo.edu,,,,,,,82,18,18,4,127,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Conversely, over the period 1992-2007 increases in inflows for long-term borrowing by the private sector and for equity investment both increased the probability of a banking crisis.

In response to an exogenous shock to credit risk in the German economy, capital charges for loans under model-based regulation increased by 0.5percentage points. As a consequence, banks reduced the amount of these loans by 2.1 to 3.9percentage points more than for loans under the traditional approach with fixed capital charges.

This result is consistent with public opinion polls and the trajectory of government spending. And it adds to the ability of rational voter ignorance and apathy to explain the latitude politicians have to ignore the cost they impose on taxpayers without losing votes. The appeal of higher costs to voters makes it easier for organized-interest groups to exploit the good intentions of voters by capturing private advantage and sabotaging the hopes upon which those good intentions are based. The appeal higher costs have for some voters also suggests another way bootleggers can benefit from the moral cover Baptists provide for their rent-seeking activities. We also point out that expressive voting implies that there is no reason for believing that the special-interest activity that sabotages the moral intentions of voters are in general any less moral than morally motivated voters.,"[Clark, J.

Due to frictions in traders' market access, liquidity providers on alternative trading platforms can be exposed to an increased adverse selection risk. As a consequence, the main market will dominate (display better quotes) frequently albeit charging considerably higher transaction fees. The empirical analysis of a dataset of trading in French and German stocks suggests that trades on Chi-X Europe, a low-cost trading platform, carry significantly more private information than those executed in the Primary Markets.

The results support the notion that social trust and trust-related information help mitigate informational barriers in international equity investments. Our results are robust to alternative measures of social trust and a range of model specifications, including instrumental variable estimation. We document that the effects of social trust on foreign ownership diminishes in the presence of organizational learning, better formal institutional development, conservative financial reporting, and asset transparency.

We also provide evidence that comparability can mitigate the asymmetric market reaction to bad versus good news disclosures.

In this study, we examine the effect of child allowances on fertility by assuming that fertility is a joint product of both parental and grandparental child care and that providing grandparental child care improves welfare. In doing so, we aim to establish a theoretical framework that more accurately predicts the impacts of child care policies than that which is currently utilized in the literature (empirical evidence for which has been inconclusive at best). We find that the fertility effect of child allowances critically depends on individual preferences and household production technology. In some cases, the fertility rate is monotonically decreasing or shaped like an inverted U with respect to the size of child allowances. We therefore conclude that small child allowances can increase fertility in situations where there is little initial parental child care. However, in situations where the initial rate of parental child care is relatively large, or where grandparental child care features as a key factor in household fertility production, child allowances can effectively reduce the fertility rate.

The disposition effect, which is the tendency to sell winner stocks too early and hold on to loser stocks for too long, is more pronounced for fund managers who invest in stocks that are more difficult to value. Using different measures of stock and market uncertainty, we show that mutual fund managers display a stronger disposition-driven behavior when stocks are more difficult to value. We also find that the level of the disposition effect is monotonically increasing with the level of systematic risk (i.e., beta). In addition, we document that the trading behavior of mutual fund managers is partly driven by attention-grabbing stocks (dividend-paying stocks). Overall, our results suggest that stock-level uncertainty and trading of attention-grabbing stocks amplify the disposition effect and that differences in the effect can be explained by mutual fund managers' investment styles. Given that mutual funds hold a large fraction of the U.S. equity market, our findings add to the ongoing discussion whether professional investors can create stock mispricings and shed new light on market efficiency.","[Wulfmeyer, Sina] Univ St Gallen, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Wulfmeyer, S (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Swiss Inst Banking & Finance, Chair Finance Prof Ammann, Rosenbergstr 52, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",sina.wulfmeyer@gmail.com,,,,,,,50,15,15,0,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

The empirical findings of this paper provide evidence for the distinct driving forces in mean and volatility and the state-dependent tradeoff between risk and return. The empirical results demonstrate that the stock market displays four types of dynamic processes (high-return-low-volatility state, low-return-low-volatility state, high return-high-volatility state, and low-return-high-volatility state) and that the structural change process of stock market returns is greatly at odds with that of stock market volatility. The TSV-GARCH(1,1)-Risk-Mean model provides better in-sample fit compared to the conventional GARCH(p,q) and regime-switching GARCH(p,q) models. Moreover, the relationship between excess returns and risk is positive, and the intensity of this positive relationship during periods of bear market is significantly higher than that during periods of bull market, which provides supporting evidence for the countercyclical risk premiums hypothesis in which the magnitude of compensation for enduring risk is weaker during periods of favorable financial conditions than during periods of adverse conditions.

In weak market states, skilled managers focus on minimization of systematic risk via dynamic reallocations across asset classes at the cost of fund alpha and foregoing market timing opportunities. As markets strengthen, attention shifts to asset selection within consistent asset classes. The superior performance of low systematic risk funds previously documented arises due to the superior asset selection ability of managers in strong market states.

The research joins the results agenda debate, arguing that in dealing with CD interventions, pre-defined indicators fail to represent the process and the key elements that take CD recipients toward patterns of change. The study highlights the fact that CD deals with projects that, by their nature (consisting of change processes designed to initiate change in people, organizations, and/or their enabling environment), rely more on non-planned changes than on the pre-defined indicators and results to contribute to livelihood improvements and social transformation. The study recognizes the difficulty of evaluating CD under straight-forward mechanisms. It concludes that the existing approaches are not adequate to truly capture or measure impact, as CD projects, restricted by previously agreed budgets, resources, and time frames, are usually not designed to evaluate the sustainability of change and its impact over the medium or long term. As resources are scarce, donor agencies and policy-makers need to know the value of CD in order to best prioritize their investments. However, due to the nature of these projects, measuring the return rate between the project cost and its impact remains a difficult task. There is a need for new, multi-path approaches to capturing changes in capacity in order to serve as a basis for decision-making regarding CD investments. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We use an intersectionality framework to examine how the adaptive strategies of Tanzanian farmers are mediated through their gender and marital statuses. Drawing on focus group discussions and using logistic regression to analyze questionnaire data, we compare the relative adoption of the different adaptive strategies of single, married, divorced, and widowed men and women. Our study shows that, while a woman's marital status is a vital factor in determining her access to adaptive strategies, it is a less important factor in the case of men. We show that, compared with other women, widows and female divorcees are disadvantaged in the field of agricultural water management, and divorced women assume relatively more income-earning activities outside the farming sector. Finally, we find evidence of livelihood diversification at the household level through specialization by individual household members.

Previous work on the resource curse suggests that oil can lead to violent conflict because it increases the value of the state as a prize or because it undermines the state's bureaucratic penetration. On the other hand, the rentier state literature has long argued that oil might provide states with resources to deliver public and private goods, and stabilize political regimes. The empirical evidence to settle these conflicting predictions is limited. This paper argues that the effect of oil on civil conflict is conditional on the size of government expenditure and the allocation of government spending for welfare or the military. To test these hypotheses, logit models of conflict onset are used and a global sample of 148 countries from 1960 to 2009 is examined. Higher levels of military spending are found to be associated with lower risks of both minor and major conflict onset in countries rich in oil and gas. By contrast, in countries with little oil or gas resources, increases in military spending are associated with a higher risk of conflict. Welfare expenditure is associated with a lower risk of small-scale conflict, irrespective of the level of oil revenue. However, general government spending does not appear to have any robust mitigating effects. Consistent with the focus in the more recent literature to disentangle the average effect of natural resources, these results nuance the conditions under which there may be a resource curse. The results point to what governments can do with resource revenues to mitigate conflict risk.

Indeed, many countries have recently initiated policy reforms to strengthen the enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR). Further, minimum standards of enforcement have been incorporated in many international treaties, especially trade agreements. This emphasis on enforcement raises basic questions about the actual impacts of IP rights infringement, which differ across the types of IPR and economic sectors. We review the academic literature and other studies in the public domain to evaluate what has been learned about these socioeconomic effects, with an emphasis on developing countries where possible. We also identify important gaps in our understanding of the consequences of counterfeiting and piracy and develop recommendations on how governments might collect data and conduct studies to better inform IPR enforcement policy.","[Fink, Carsten] World Intellectual Property Org, Geneva, Switzerland; [Maskus, Keith E.] Univ Colorado Boulder, Econ, Boulder, CO USA; [Qian, Yi] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Mkt & Behav Sci, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of British Columbia,"Fink, C (通讯作者)，World Intellectual Property Org, Geneva, Switzerland.",carsten.fink@wipo.int,,,,,,,75,35,37,4,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

Experimental Evidence From Mozambique,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,gender; extension; sustainable land management; experiment; Africa,CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; PRODUCTIVITY; TECHNOLOGY; WOMEN; ATTRITION; FARMERS,"Agricultural innovation is essential to meet the food requirements of Africa's growing population. One pathway to increasing yields may be to enhance female farmer productivity. In many settings, married women cultivate plots separated from those of other family members. They face different challenges to productivity, such as deficiencies in inputs, weak property rights, and time constraints. It has long been argued that traditionally male-dominated extension services may also contribute to a gender bias in adoption of new agricultural techniques. If this is true, placing women in extension positions may help other women overcome barriers to adoption posed by inequitable access to agricultural extension services or exposure to inapt information. To better understand the role of gender in the dissemination of sustainable land management (SLM) techniques, this study uses a randomized policy experiment conducted in 200 communities in Mozambique. We examine the impact of training female messengers of SLM techniques on the awareness, knowledge, and adoption of SLM practices by other female farmers. Communities were randomly selected in 2010 to have a female messenger trained in SLM who was encouraged to teach other women the techniques. Using data from panel surveys collected in the experimental areas, we find women's awareness of pit planting farming techniques increased by 9 percentage points in 2012 and adoption of the technology by 5 percentage points in 2013 in communities with female messengers.

The latter procedure produces general underconfidence, which is significantly reduced, but not eliminated when we filter out the effects of risk attitudes. Finally, we find that self-reported confidence correlates significantly with features of individual risk attitudes including parameters of individual probability weighting.","[Murad, Zahra; Sefton, Martin; Starmer, Chris] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Sch Econ, Ctr Decis Res & Expt Econ CeDEx, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Murad, Zahra] Univ Surrey, Surrey Business Sch, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England",University of Nottingham; University of Surrey,"Starmer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Sch Econ, Ctr Decis Res & Expt Econ CeDEx, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",chris.starmer@nottingham.ac.uk,"; Starmer, Chris/K-8891-2018","Sefton, Martin/0000-0002-1327-7311; murad, zahra/0000-0001-6258-7415; Starmer, Chris/0000-0001-7705-0127",ESRC [ES/K002201/1]; ESRC [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful to Thomas Epper for providing us with the data from their experiments and the R-code for the econometric estimation.

We test these predictions by investigating how the financial health of leading US banks influenced their borrowers' credit risk surrounding the announcement of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Changes in borrower credit risk, measured by credit default swap (CDS) spreads, should reflect the expected relief from liquidity shocks and other benefits of rescuing banks, such as maintaining the existing lending relationships. Consistent with the theory, prior to the TARP capital infusions, unhealthy banks' borrowers with high leverage experienced a greater increase in their credit risk relative to similar healthy banks' borrowers. Following the event, the CDS market anticipated less liquidity relief to these vulnerable unhealthy banks' borrowers, but more liquidity relief to the vulnerable healthy banks' borrowers.

Such countries remain trapped at a relative low-or middle-income level. In this article, the authors redefine the concept of income traps as situations in which income levels relative to the United States remain constantly low and with no clear sign of convergence. This approach allows them to study the issue of economic convergence (or lack of it) directly. The authors describe evidence pointing to the existence of both relative low-and middle-income traps and examine cross-country historical transitions between income groups at the global and regional levels. Finally, they point out challenges to the benchmark neoclassical growth theory, which predicts convergence to the developed world over time, and discuss existing theories with the potential to explain income traps.","[Arias, Maria A.; Wen, Yi] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA; [Wen, Yi] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Tsinghua University,"Arias, MA (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,"Wen, Yi/I-5756-2016","Wen, Yi/0000-0001-5658-1578",,,,,36,4,4,1,4,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

While the concept of poverty is well developed, the concept of vulnerability is less established in the economic literature. I test for the dynamics of vulnerable households in the United Kingdom using Waves 1-12 of the British Household Panel Survey and find that, of three different types of risks for which I test, household-specific shocks and economy-wide aggregate shocks have the greatest impact on consumption, in comparison to shocks to the income stream. I find vulnerable households up to at least 10 percentile points above the poverty line. Savings and earnings from a second job are not significantly associated with smoothing consumption of all vulnerable households. The results strongly indicate that income transfers and benefits assist the vulnerable in smoothing consumption. Thus, traditional poverty alleviating policies are not likely to assist the vulnerable.","[Bandyopadhyay, Sanghamitra] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, London, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Bandyopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, London, England.",,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78560-993-0; 978-1-78560-994-7,RES ECON INEQUAL,,,2016,24.0,,,,,,29,58,,10.1108/S1049-258520160000024003,0.0,,,30,Economics; Social Issues,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Issues,BI1QE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406693400002,0

However, there is a lack of sufficient studies that investigate how the factors of country image, FDI and investment in technology are related to each other, or the country image is related to investment in technology. Thus the purpose of the paper is to analyse theoretically and to test empirically the interaction of country image, FDI and investment in technology. Methodology/methods The relation between investment in technology, FDI and country image is analysed using constructive research approach by applying systematic review, analysis, deduction and other methods. The strength of the relation between investment in technology, FDI and country image indicators is evaluated using correlation method. The theoretical literature and empirical studies are analysed. Moreover, the theoretical method is created for the evaluation of this relation and tested by empirical study. Scientific aim The aim of the paper is to determine and to evaluate the relation between investment in technology, FDI and country image. Findings According the results of empirical study, the correlation between FDI and investment in technology is stronger than between FDI and country image, investment in technology and country image. Thurthermore, country image have stronger relation with investment in technology than with FDI. Conclusions On the basis of the scientific literature review it could be concluded, that any country has to define the desired country image and change the current image to the desired. The amount of FDI should be strongly influenced by the country image. Creation of desirable country image could be beneficial instrument for attracting investors with innovative technologies and technological knowledge. Moreover, the opinion of foreign investors should affect FDI inflow, which also has the impact for economic growth and changes of country image.","[Banioniene, Justina; Dagiliene, Lina] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business, Gedimino Str 50, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Banioniene, J (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business, Gedimino Str 50, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania.",justina.banioniene@ktu.edu,"Dagiliene, Lina/AAI-7238-2020",,,,,,29,0,0,2,6,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,337,345,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200042,0

Both ex ante and ex post moral hazard problems in workers' compensation (WC) have been extensively analysed in developed countries. The main objective of this paper is to test the presence of ex post moral hazard in the Tunisian context. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis on this topic in a developing country, Tunisia. It is particularly important to study moral hazard problems in developing countries, since the negative impacts of such problems could be exacerbated in the developing world. Dionne and St-Michel (1991) have developed a methodology for testing for the presence of ex post moral hazard in the context of a more generous WC regime in Quebec. The Tunisian institutional context that we study is similar to that prevailing in Quebec; that is, in 1995, there was a significant increase in the generosity of the WC regime. Applying a more general econometric technique than that used by Dionne and St-Michel, we find that this increase in the generosity of WC led to longer periods out of work for recovery. This increase is more pronounced in the case of difficult-to-diagnose injuries.","[Benkhalifa, Abdelaziz] Univ Tunis, Ecole Super Sci Econ & Commerciales Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia; [Lanoie, Paul] HEC Montreal, Appl Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ayadi, Mohamed] Univ Tunis, Inst Super Gest, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Tunis; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Universite de Tunis,"Benkhalifa, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tunis, Ecole Super Sci Econ & Commerciales Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.",abenkhalifa@gmail.com,,"BENKHALIFA, Abdelaziz/0000-0002-4746-7674",,,,,36,1,2,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In our work, we aim to address these issues, analysing a sample of large European listed banks (those under ECB supervision) for the 2007-2013 period.

To this aim, wine purchases made by a nationally representative panel of Italian households were analyzed. Estimates based on quantile regression reveal that the effects of the two reputation strategies (private and collective) have a different weight according to the price segment of the wines in question.

The results indicate significant patterns of abnormal returns and trading volumes surrounding the event day and that the rumors seem to be disseminated in the stock market before appearing in newspapers. The results also indicate asymmetry: Investors hearing a positive rumor about a stock may tend to buy the stock, prompting a price run-up until the rumor dies away, while negative rumors usually have greater and longer negative impacts on stock returns than positive rumors do. The presence of a daily price limit is negatively correlated to the size of abnormal returns and abnormal trading volumes on the event day, and the abnormal trading volumes are more sensitive to the price limit surrounding the event day.

Identification of the challenges faced by supply chains carried out at the initial stage of the research and directions of evaluation of supply chains presented in the literature constituted for the author the justification for seeking new solutions for supply chain and logistics management. The dynamics of the changes in the logistics companies' business environment forces the decision makers to focus on the future, which, on the one hand, is aimed at capturing the changes, and on the other, on dealing with uncertainty. Foresight is one of such tools. Diversity of the existing applications of the foresight research indicates the increased possibility of its application also to the needs of prospective supply chain management. The article presents the current range of applications of foresight studies in the area of supply chain management (including logistics), and three new categories of foresight research, taking into account the supply chains specificity, were suggested. Methodology/methods The methodology used for the needs of the research process includes a review of the literature and an analysis of foresight projects in the area of supply chain and logistics management. Scientific aim Proposing new types of foresight studies focused on supply chain and logistics management was the main purpose of the article. According to the proposed new types of foresight studies, possibilities of its application, reasons for it uses by particular users were identified. Findings Taking into account the types of foresight projects acknowledged in the literature and used in practice and various application areas of foresight research, the author has attempted to expand the existing classification of the foresight studies with three types taking into account the specificity of determinants of supply chains and logistics processes: chain foresight, the process foresight and strategic project foresight. Conclusions Since the conducted studies are theoretical, they require orientation of further research on the process of operationalization of the foresight research methodology, aiming at the selection of research methods, selection of experts, identification of the goals and results of research. Limitations of the carried out literature studies stem from heretofore narrow achievements in the application of foresight studies in the area of supply chain and logistics management. Subsequent foresight initiatives in the analysed area should enrich the achievements with solutions of both theoretical-methodological and practical nature (in the form of, for example, good practice).","[Ejdys, Joanna] Bialaystok Univ Technol, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",,"Ejdys, J (通讯作者)，Bialaystok Univ Technol, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",jejdys@gmail.com,"EJDYS, JOANNA/D-6654-2013","EJDYS, JOANNA/0000-0002-5132-166X",,,,,48,1,1,0,9,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,523,532,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200065,0

This study further analyses factors with an impact on implementation lag. Implementation lag is the length of period between decision of the economic policy makers on the actual response to the fundamental change in the economy and implementation of this response to the legislation. Average implementation lag of discretionary fiscal policy in the Czech Republic is 2.4 quarters. The greatest deal counts for the implementation lag in the Chamber of Deputies.

Consumer decisions in emerging economies are further biased by perceptions regarding the intentions these manufacturers and distributors. Members of emerging economies distrust other societal members to a larger degree than found in developed countries. Distrust of other societal members is an indicator of low social capital. Social capital is considered as the accrual of trust at a social level, has no tangible value, but it generates productive activities. Social capital enables economic transactions that are impossible in its absence. In the inverse, low social capital societies do not accrue much trust and productive activities are not constrained by it its relative absence. In our paper we propose a social capital explanation of emerging economy consumer perception toward product quality. We will use a social capital framework developed by Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998) based on: 1) cognitive capital, 2) structural capital, and 3) relational capital. We will also provide propositions that consider the following ideas. Consumers in emerging economies perceive that products made specifically for their country are low quality and these low-quality goods enter their markets from domestic and foreign manufacturers. Consumers in emerging economies perceive that high-quality products made in their country are exported to developed countries and lower quality products stay in the country for domestic consumption. Consumers in emerging economies perceive that domestic manufacturers mislead them by using foreign sounding product names and false statements on labels. They also prefer products made for developed countries. When making purchase decisions, they rely on family and friends for information. Consumers from emerging economies do not trust that manufacturer or their representatives will be honor product warranties and, by extension, they do not trust their government to protect their interests. We also will discuss why a similar concept, country of origin effect, does not address the emerging economy consumer perception deliberated in our paper. This paper contributes to the field of operations and supply chain management by focusing on perceptions of product quality in emerging economies using a social capital explanation and by developing a framework of eight propositions meant to explain in more depth certain particularities.","[Glaser-Segura, Daniel; Welsh Voges, Kathleen; Calafiore, Pablo J.] Texas A&M Univ San Antonio, One Univ Way, San Antonio, TX 78224 USA; [Krishnan, Omkumar] Indian Inst Management Kozhikode, Kunnamangalam 673570, Kerala, India; [Salanta, Irina-Iulia] Univ Babes Bolyai, 58-60 Teodor Mihali St, Cluj Napoca 400951, Romania; [Anghel, Laurentiu Dan] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 41 Dacia Blvd, Bucharest 010404, Romania",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University San Antonio; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Glaser-Segura, D (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ San Antonio, One Univ Way, San Antonio, TX 78224 USA.",dglaser@tamusa.edu; kvoges@tamusa.edu; pablo.calafiore@tamusa.edu; omkumar@iimk.ac.in; irina.salanta@econ.ubbcluj.ro; laurentiu.anghel@ase.ro,"Salanţă, Irina-iulia/AEC-6804-2022; Anghel, Laurentiu-Dan V/P-1592-2016","Salanţă, Irina-iulia/0000-0001-7616-1343;",,,,,48,1,1,1,5,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,641,652,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300053,0

The paper studies the balance between these responses and shows that the response to $1 of resource revenue is, for our preferred estimates, to decrease nonresource exports by 74 cents and increase imports by 23 cents, implying a negligible effect on foreign savings. The negative per $1 impact on exports is larger for manufactures than for other sectors, and particularly large for internationally mobile manufacturing sectors. Although standard Dutch disease analysis points to contraction of the tradable sector as a whole, division into nonresource exports and imports is important if, as suggested by much development literature, a higher share of exports to GDP is associated with faster growth. The large negative impact of resources on these exports points to the difficulty resource-rich economies face in diversifying their exports.","[Harding, Torfinn] Norwegian Sch Econ NHH, Dept Econ, Bergen, Norway; [Harding, Torfinn] Univ Oxford, Oxcarre, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Harding, Torfinn] Univ Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway; [Harding, Torfinn] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Venables, Anthony J.] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Venables, Anthony J.] Univ Oxford, Ctr Anal Resource Rich Economies, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Venables, Anthony J.] British Acad, London, England; [Venables, Anthony J.] Econometr Soc, London, England",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of Oxford; Universitetet i Stavanger; Ifo Institut; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Harding, T (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ NHH, Dept Econ, Bergen, Norway.",,"venables, anthony/JDW-7805-2023","venables, anthony/0000-0003-0251-7479",BP,BP,"This work was supported by the BP funded Centre for the Analysis of Resource Rich Economies (Oxcarre), Department of Economics, University of Oxford.

This paper examines the relationship between the 3-Month Treasury Bill Rate (DTB3) and 10-Year Treasury Rate (DSG10) from January 1962 to November 2015 by employing the Markov-switching VEC model, which allows for the asymmetric adjustment of interest rates to the long run equilibrium across regimes. We find that the high-volatility regime more frequently exists prior to the 1990s, and the low-volatility one occurs more often after 1990s. Secondly, with allowing for the distinct short-run adjustment parameters in the MS-VECM setup, we find that the evidence of asymmetric adjustments of interest rates to the long run equilibrium in difference regimes. More specifically, the long-term interest rate adjusts more quickly towards the long run equilibrium in the high-volatility regimes than in the low-volatility one. Moreover, by comparing the impulses response functions of linear and nonlinear models, we find that empirical results could be misleading if the regime shift is not taken into account.","[Huang, Sai-Nan] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Econ, 182 Nanhu Ave, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Song-Lin] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Finance, 182 Nanhu Ave, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Zeng, SL (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Finance, 182 Nanhu Ave, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",sainan.huang@263.net; songlin.zeng@263.net,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-365-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,292,297,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF8YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385267100048,0

Design/methodology/approach - The research informants were recruited from a Southeastern Nigerian city. Data analysis was based on 303 qualified cases extracted from the 332 valid responses retrieved from the customers of retail banking services through a bank-intercept method and online survey. Findings - Except customer orientation, all the antecedents of RQ were directly related to trust and satisfaction. Whereas satisfaction was both directly and indirectly related to repurchase intention and willingness to recommend, trust was directly and indirectly related to repurchase intention but was not directly related to willingness to recommend. It was only indirectly related to willingness to recommend through satisfaction and repurchase intention. Trust and satisfaction mediate the link between RQ antecedents and repurchase intention and willingness to recommend. The research model explained 67 per cent of the total variance in willingness to recommend. Research limitations/implications - The mediating role of RQ in the link between customer orientation, expertise and information sharing and repurchase intention and willingness to recommend remains largely untested in the literature. This provides an avenue for future studies to extend RQ research to the nature of the construct's behaviour when it is tested as a mediator in the relationship between its antecedents and consequences especially in West Africa where substantive research is scarce. Practical implications - One of the key measures that retail banks can use to keep customers' patronage and spur them into making business referrals is to build trust and deliver pleasurable satisfaction by leveraging customer orientation, expertise and information sharing. Originality/value - As far as could be established, this paper represents the first attempt to simultaneously explore the indirect effects of customer orientation, expertise and information sharing on repurchase intention and willingness to recommend through the constructs of RQ. The paper further demonstrates that the relationships estimated within the model are not moderated by gender and occupation differences.","[Izogo, Ernest Emeka] Ebonyi State Univ, Dept Mkt, Fac Management Sci, Abakaliki, Nigeria",,"Izogo, EE (通讯作者)，Ebonyi State Univ, Dept Mkt, Fac Management Sci, Abakaliki, Nigeria.",ernyemmy@gmail.com,"Izogo, Ernest Emeka/AAP-8713-2020","Izogo, Ernest Emeka/0000-0001-6226-8836",,,,,51,30,31,1,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The empirical evidence of statistically significant increase in the economic activity before election is especially a matter of less developed countries. There is a shift in focus to the examination of the political budget cycle in case of the developed economies. This paper examines the presence of conditional political budget cycle (PBC) in the OECD countries using data from all 34 member states over the period 1995-2012. We suppose that the conditionality of the PBC depends on the credibility and transparency of the fiscal policy. The dynamic panel linear regression model is used in this article. Generalized method of moments (GMM) with instrumental variables (IV) is used for estimating parameters in this model. Three important results emerge: First, there is a PBC in the OECD countries. Second, the PBC in OECD countries strongly depends on credibility and transparency of fiscal policy. Third, the shape of the PBC in the OECD countries indicates that there is an immediate fiscal restriction after the elections.","[Janku, Jan] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Janku, J (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",jan.janku@vsb.cz,"Janků, Jan/ABC-8909-2021; Janků, Jan/AAA-7569-2021","Janků, Jan/0000-0002-4112-4611;",,,,,36,4,4,0,9,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The article compares NAIRU estimates of previously fine-tuned models with estimates of models extended by selected institutional factors. The difference between these groups will then be compared with development of relevant variables of the real economy. That will allow us to determine whether the institutional factor influenced structural or cyclical unemployment.

Methodology/methods To evaluate competitiveness of companies in Lithuanian manufacturing sector composite competitiveness index was developed. Composite index includes key indicators, qualifying the actual performance and competitiveness of manufacturing companies, such as labor productivity per employee, gross margin, average monthly wages per employee, labor efficiency, ratio of investment into machinery and gross profit. Relationship between competitiveness index of the analyzed sectors and their export to income ratios were established with the help of scatter graph and correlation coefficient. Scientific aim Aim of the research is to determine whether companies in Lithuanian manufacturing sector, which generate higher income from activities in foreign markets, possess competitive advantage over companies, realizing most of their production in local market. Findings Competitiveness index indicated that advantage in separate manufacturing sectors is determined by specifications of their activities and nature of the operations. Scatter graph did not display a linear relationship between competitiveness index and export to income ratio. Nevertheless, sectors, generating either very large or very small shares of their income in foreign markets (compared to other Lithuanian manufacturing sectors), encounter higher operation risks. Because of this reason values of their competitiveness indexes stand out as having largest and smallest values. Conclusions In order to secure a stable competitive situation companies in Lithuanian manufacturing industry are required to diversify their operating activities by ensuring income streams from several different markets. Companies, which concentrate their operations mainly in a single environment, may face greater risks of deteriorating results in case of unanticipated economical or political occurrences. To further verify these conclusions examination of larger data volume is required.","[Markauskas, Mantas; Saboniene, Asta] Kaunas Univ Technol, Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44249 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Markauskas, M (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Donelaicio Str 73, LT-44249 Kaunas, Lithuania.",mantas.markauskas@ktu.edu,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,3,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,364,369,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200045,0

To this end, we devise an empirical framework linking credit risk and profitability changes to bank dimension. By applying a Quantile Regression Approach to a sample of 1476 European financial institutions, and considering the combination of risk and profit size sensitivities at quantile level, we observe that the theoretical hypothesis behind the too big to fail is confirmed when the change in ROA proxies for the risk undertaking. We obtain a different picture-much less consistent with our moral hazard hypothesis-when the change in ROE is employed instead. We also provide a possible explanation for this contradictory pattern by discussing the role of managers versus shareholders in the bank strategic design.","[Mattana, Paolo; Rossi, Stefania P.

If the corporate culture may be one of the tools how to maximize the profit, it is important for organizations to have clear vision about its strategic goals that will fit to their corporate identity. All aspects of the corporate culture should follow and support strategic goals. Therefore, there is effort to bring corporate strategy to every staff member. The scale of values creates a springboard for setting the direction of the company, sets goals and solves the question how to achieve them. Progressively oriented businesses realize that even the best strategic goals cannot be realized without the support of people. To attain the condition where all of employees are envoys of organizations, there is a corporate culture. Corporate culture is package of shared values, standards significantly influencing the working behavior of employees. Basically, the corporate culture reflects the real state of the achieved compatibility, adaptability and consistency of corporate philosophy. The realization of the current state is the starting point for the reaching of the desirable state. One of the tools of desirable corporate culture is internet marketing.

Findings - The paper identifies the institutional voids that contributed to the scandal. It also examines the effects of the scandal on the MNE's legitimacies and evaluates the appropriateness of its actions in China during the formation, erosion and repair stages of its legitimacy. Research limitations/implications - It contributes to legitimacy literature by discussing the importance of MNE's active commitment when entering the emerging market. It argues that the building of pragmatic legitimacy is not sufficient, and explains why attendance to moral obligations is part of building moral and cognitive legitimacy. Originality/value - This unique case study of a corporate scandal offers deep insights into how, what and why questions regarding how the three forms of legitimacy are necessary for improving IJV performance by MNEs operating in emerging economies.

The paper asserts that Russia and Brazil could learn much from Poland regarding formal institution building and formal institutional voids that cause problems like corruption and limit economic growth. Design/methodology/approach - A comparative case study approach is utilized to assess the relative success of the three emerging market countries in transitioning to a market economy, viewed through the lens of institutional theory. Findings - Poland's experience in building successful formal institutions and mitigating major institutional voids can be instructive for Russia and Brazil which have shown far less success, and correspondingly less sustained economic growth. Research limitations/implications - This paper demonstrates the value of applying institutional theory to analyze the progress of emerging economies in transitioning to a market economy. Practical implications - This country comparison can prove valuable to other emerging economies seeking a successful transition to a market economy. Social implications - Since institutions are the fabric of any society, the emphasis on institutions in this paper can have positive implications for society in emerging markets. Originality/value - This paper is an original comparison of two BRIC countries with a smaller emerging economy, utilizing institutional theory. Factors contributing to Poland's success are compared to Russia and Brazil to assess how those countries might be positively informed by Poland's experience in building and strengthening sustainable formal institutions as well as avoiding institutional voids and their associated problems.","[Puffer, Sheila M.; McCarthy, Daniel J.] Northeastern Univ, DAmore McKim Sch Business, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jaeger, Alfred M.] McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, Org Behav, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Northeastern University; McGill University,"Puffer, SM (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, DAmore McKim Sch Business, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",s.puffer@neu.edu,,,,,,,52,50,53,1,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

We find that a sizable fraction of investors follows an established trend even in a setting where there are no reputational incentives. In a setting where there are reputational concerns, they do not seem to create substantial herd behavior.","[Roider, Andreas] Univ Regensburg, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Voskort, Andrea] Fed Financial Supervisory Author BaFin, Bonn, Germany",University of Regensburg,"Roider, A (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, Dept Econ, Univ Str 31, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany.",andreas.roider@ur.de,,,,,,,38,12,13,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

The opposite is true for many emerging and transitional countries that are experiencing an increase in purchasing power and demand. However, these countries often have lower food safety standards than in the EU. In response to current trends in international food trade, this study seeks to determine whether traders in developing-transitioning countries and in industrialized European countries (especially Germany), are experiencing changes in trade flows in the international fresh-fruit trade and also identify the role of private standards in connection with relevant situational factors driving these changes. Underlying assumptions are derived from the concepts of the contingency approach. To obtain qualitative data, a series of semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with industry experts from fourteen import countries and twenty-two export companies. Based on the results of a structured content analysis of these interviews, appropriate political, managerial and research implications are developed promoting the liberalization and harmonization of public and private maximum residue levels for fruits within the EU.","[Sonntag, Winnie; Theuvsen, Ludwig; Kersting, Valerie; Otter, Verena] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Sonntag, Winnie] Mkt Food & Agr Prod, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Theuvsen, Ludwig; Kersting, Valerie; Otter, Verena] Agribusiness Adm, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Sonntag, W (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.;Sonntag, W (通讯作者)，Mkt Food & Agr Prod, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",winnie.sonntag@agr.uni-goettingen.de; theuvsen@uni-goettingen.de; valerie.kersting@stud.uni-goettingen.de; verena.otter@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Otter, Verena/AAC-5237-2020","Sonntag, Winnie Isabel/0000-0002-7944-5795",Deutsche Fruchthandelsverband (DFHV),Deutsche Fruchthandelsverband (DFHV),The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Deutsche Fruchthandelsverband (DFHV).,,49,7,7,0,15,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The analysis of investment subsidies between the meat processors can reveal typical receivers of investment support from the RDP, investment priorities of the companies, a concentration of the subsidies distribution and the duration of the project completion. The database of 533 investment projects since 2007 in the sub-measures I.1.3.1 and I.1.3.2 was used as the secondary data source. The database was linked with Albertina database of accounting reports. The analysis is based on description of the distribution of investment subsidies. Moreover, statistical hypothesis testing (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) was applied to reveal differences between participants and nonparticipants. The distribution analysis showed that the Pareto principle of distribution has been fulfilled: 24 % of participants received 80 % of investment subsidies. 36 % of participants successfully applied repeatedly. The success rate was lower in the group of small companies than in the medium and large ones probably because the bigger companies usually use own specialists or professional consulting services. Hypothesis testing indicated that participants were significantly bigger, had better financial situation and were more capital-intensive than nonparticipants. The question is whether the strategic goal of the Ministry of Agriculture is to change the strategy of investment support in the new programming period 2014+ to be distributed more evenly.","[Spicka, Jindrich; Naglova, Zdenka] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Dept Econ, Agr Sect, Manesova 75, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Spicka, J (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Dept Econ, Agr Sect, Manesova 75, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic.",spicka.jindrich@uzei.cz; naglova.zdenka@uzei.cz,"Naglova, Zdenka/W-7256-2019; Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013","Naglova, Zdenka/0000-0001-5871-1735; Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0001-5699-9544",,,,,17,2,2,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-4781,,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,384,391,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000050,0

The objectives of this research are: (1) Identifying the main factors that group important aspects when young tourists use the services of an agency to plan a trip, using the common factors method; (2) Comparison of results of the common factors method results with principal components method results, when young tourists use the services of an agency to plan a trip; (3) Identifying the main factors that group important aspects when young tourists use the Internet to plan a trip, using the common factors method; (4) Comparison of results of the common factors method results with principal components method results, aspects when young tourists use the Internet to plan a trip. A quantitative survey was conducted on a sample of 217 young tourists. Two types of statistical procedures were used to compare the results: Principal Component Method and Principal Axis Factoring Method. The research results indicated that Lack of flexibility, Costs saving, Professionalism and Received help are factors used when young tourist use the services of an agency to plan a trip. Comfort ability, Insecurity, and Lack of trust are among the factors when young tourists use the Internet to plan a trip. The study suggests that the Principal Axis Factoring Method is delivering slightly more logical grouped items but the total variance of the scales is smaller comparing to the total variance of the scales delivered by the Principal Component Method. This work is original because we identify scales to measure the importance of using travel agencies and the Internet in planning trips using two different factor analyses.","[Tugulea, Oana; Bobalca, Claudia; Maha, Liviu-George] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, 22 Carol 1 Blvd, Iasi 700505, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Tugulea, O (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, 22 Carol 1 Blvd, Iasi 700505, Romania.",ciobanu.oana@uaic.ro; iuliana.bobalca@uaic.ro; mlg@uaic.ro,"Stoian, Claudia/R-1828-2016; Maha, Liviu-George/F-6014-2016",,,,,,15,1,1,0,6,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,370,382,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300030,0

The contribution demonstrates a particular application on chosen indicators of a particular company. Methodology /methods are based on the Albertina database. It is a database of companies that offer both financial and business characteristics of companies in the Czech market. One of the methods of enterprise evaluation will be applied as an assumption. In particular, it will be the discounting of the future company profits. The scientific aim is to determine whether artificial neural networks are suitable as tools for the assessment of given variables necessary for the calculation of enterprise value. It is necessary to choose a suitable neural structure responding to the financial and strategical analysis, or to adjust this structure based on these analyses, and subsequently state the enterprise value, where appropriate. However, the goal is not to measure the chosen method, but to open the options of prediction in a chosen indicator for the future evaluation of an enterprise. Findings Artificial neural networks should not be considered the only universal tool for the assessment of the enterprise value, but it is suitable to use it as a chosen step towards the process of evaluation. For illustration, the MLP network 5 1: 5-1-34-5:5, which is not applicable in practice, but brings a clear view of how to work with the results acquired through neural networks. The company will according to the outlined time line, report its loss from its operating activities, until 2025. Profit costs in operating activities have grown rapidly, while revenues in the same area were increasing minimally. Conclusions The Robert Bosch s r.o. company will understandably, do everything to make the directive curve of the ordinary (or the operating) profit rise. It will then be the investments' process optimalizations', active cost policy's, etc., turn. Each evaluation must be preceded in the first stage, by financial and strategic analysis. It is also suitable to identify the indicators of the inner and outer environment influencing the development of the given company, and engage them in the calculation. It is therefore possible and suitable to use the artificial neural networks as a tool for determining the chosen variables needed for the calculation of enterprise value.","[Vochozka, Marek] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Vochozka, M (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic.",vochozka@mail.vstecb.cz,"Vochozka, Marek/L-3154-2019","Vochozka, Marek/0000-0001-9923-7814",,,,,26,1,1,0,1,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,737,746,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200091,0

Data relating to the monitoring of the spread of varroa bee clearly have the character of open data. The authors of this paper define the possible potential of the data relating to the varroa bee and then propose the applicable procedure to use this potential.

These policies, principally the affordable-housing goals administered by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), forced the loosening of traditional mortgage underwriting standards in order to make mortgage credit more available to low-income borrowers. However, the loosened standards spread to the wider market and helped to build a massive housing price bubble between 1997 and 2007. By 2008, most of the mortgages in the US were subprime or otherwise weak. When the housing bubble deflated, these mortgages failed in unprecedented numbers, weakening the largest financial institutions and causing a financial panic when Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail.","[Wallison, Peter J.] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Financial Policy Studies, Washington, DC 20036 USA",American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research,"Wallison, PJ (通讯作者)，Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Financial Policy Studies, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,,,,,,15,0,0,1,12,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"PO BOX 128 FARRER RD, SINGAPORE 9128, SINGAPORE",2251-3442,,978-981-4651-25-7; 978-981-4651-24-0,WS-NOW PUBL SER BUS,,,2016,9.0,,,,,,75,100,,,,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0DY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365888000004,0

It is based on questionnaire survey data that covers 400 left-behind women and extensive interviews in 10 rural communities. It reveals how the women take on multiple family responsibilities including mainly family care and agricultural production, and how they maintain their marital relationships in the context of a long separation. The discussion argues that even though the women's unpaid work becomes visible due to the absence of men in family life, there is a reaffirmation and reinforcement of gender traditions; women are more solidified in the unpaid and low-paid field of work in this new era of rural social transition in China. Moreover, separated married life has made women more vulnerable. In the end, it points to the fact that rural women are experiencing a new and deeper form of exploitation of their labour. Thus they are among those paying a heavy price for the development in China.","[Wu, Huifang; Ye, Jingzhong] China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev Studies COHD, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Ye, JZ (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev Studies COHD, 2 Yuanmingyuan West Rd, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",yejz@cau.edu.cn,,"Ye, Jingzhong/0000-0003-4917-3431",National Social Science Foundation of China [12BSH025]; Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Chinese Ministry of Education [09YJC840050]; Scientific Fund of the China Agricultural University [2012QJ048],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Chinese Ministry of Education; Scientific Fund of the China Agricultural University,"This research was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (12BSH025), the Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Chinese Ministry of Education (09YJC840050) and the Scientific Fund of the China Agricultural University (2012QJ048).

It is found that the industrial agglomeration has replaced the traditional location selection factors as an important force to influence the investment decisions of multinational corporations.","[Zuo, Shuhui; Sun, Fang] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Science & Technology,"Sun, F (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",sunfang28@hotmail.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,1,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-262-6,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,16.0,,,,,,404,409,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8DJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392234100061,0

Countries where the crisis led to a relatively greater increase in public spending than a decline in tax revenues - in particular, France and Italy - are found to have implemented consolidations that are more reliant on tax increases than spending cuts. While in France and Italy households with children have lost less from tax and benefit reforms than pensioner households, the reverse is true in Ireland and the United Kingdom. The pattern of cuts to public services also varies: France, Ireland and the UK chose to protect spending on health and schools from cuts, while Italy and Spain chose to cut spending on these services relatively deeply. One clear improvement has been the introduction of greater independence and transparency in the production of economic and fiscal forecasts.

This research posits that decision task type affect the attraction effect. People usually seek justification for their decisions. In a selection (or rejection) task, they are more likely to emphasize the positive (or negative) features of each option. The addition of an asymmetrically dominated decoy to a binary set of options undoubtedly provides an extra positive feature for the dominant option, and therefore induces a greater attraction effect. Contrarily, in a rejection task condition, the decoy in the trinary set seems to be the worst option and would be eliminated first, and the remaining comparison is identical with the original binary condition. Therefore, the attraction effect may decrease. Besides, the decision task type interacts with the construal level to affect the attraction effect. Specifically, a low construal level, compared with a high construal level, dampens the attraction effect to a greater extent in a rejection task than in a selection task. Results from three experiments support the proposed hypotheses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Aggregate leverage low and stable before 1945 more than tripled between 1945 and 1970 from 11% to 35%, eventually reaching 47% by the early 1990s. The median firm in 1946 had no debt, but by 1970 had a leverage ratio of 31%. This increase occurred in all unregulated industries and affected firms of all sizes. Changing firm characteristics are unable to account for this increase. Rather, changes in government borrowing, macroeconomic uncertainty, and financial sector development play a more prominent role. Despite this increase among unregulated firms, a combination of stable debt usage among regulated firms and a decrease in the fraction of aggregate assets held by regulated firms over this period resulted in a relatively stable economy-wide leverage ratio during the 20th century.

Meanwhile, a shifting focus to care in community settings has implied an increasingly important role for informal caregivers. In light of these changes and the unpaid leave policies introduced in the 1990s to reduce the caregiver-labor force participant role strain, it is important to assess whether the labor market outcomes of caregivers have changed over time. We explored the impact of caregiving on women's labor force participation, hours of work, and wages and whether this effect was different for women in the Baby Boomer generation versus women born in the pre-World War II years. Methods: Using data from the American National Longitudinal Surveys of Young Women and Mature Women, we followed two cohorts of pre-retirement aged women at similar points in their careers. We used pooled and fixed effects regressions. Results: We found that intensive informal caregiving was negatively associated with labor force participation and hours of work for both pre-Baby Boomers and Baby Boomers. Further, the caregiving effects were not significantly different across cohorts. Caregiving was not significantly associated with wages after controlling for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. Discussion: This study provides a first step in establishing that caregiving labor market penalties have persisted over time, despite the introduction of offsetting policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Expressive and instrumental preferences may deviate and in electoral settings it is more important to make policies expressively appealing. But policies are even more attractive if they can be made both expressively and instrumentally appealing. This paper studies education policy in England and proposes that the argument for increased state spending in school education is expressively appealing as it appears equitable, but the allocation of students to schools by catchment area is also instrumentally appealing to middle-class families. Allocation to schools by lottery may be expressively but not instrumentally appealing. Cutting education spending and dividing the proceeds between a tax cut to the affluent and a cash transfer to the poor may be instrumentally but not expressively appealing. The effort to provide instrumentally appealing policies with sufficient ethical content to satisfy expressive preferences may lead to inefficiency and distract attention from more serious ethical problems related to the policies.

These emission reports are verified through costly auditing efforts by regulatory agencies that are constrained in their auditing budgets. Atypical assumption in the literature is that the agencies allocate audit efforts randomly among otherwise identical firms (random audit mechanism). This paper compares the incentives on firms' emissions and self-reporting behavior under the random audit mechanism to the incentives under competitive audit mechanisms (CAMs). Under CAMs, higher reported emissions by a firm relative to other firms result in a lower audit intensity. This creates a reporting contest between the firms. The two CAMs under investigation apply different degrees of competitiveness in the reporting contest. I find that both CAMs lead to more truthful reporting, which is in line with the previous literature. Interestingly and novel to the literature, I find that some competition in reporting may induce fewer emissions compared with random auditing, while too much competition in reporting may induce comparatively higher emissions caused by firms.","[Oestreich, Andreas Marcel] Brock Univ, Dept Econ, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada",Brock University,"Oestreich, AM (通讯作者)，Brock Univ, Dept Econ, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",a.marcel.oestreich@brocku.ca,,,Ontario Graduate Scholarship; Sustainable Prosperity Network at the University of Ottawa,Ontario Graduate Scholarship(Ontario Graduate Scholarship); Sustainable Prosperity Network at the University of Ottawa,"I am indebted to Rene Kirkegaard, John Livernois, and Asha Sadanand for their academic supervision, encouragement and valuable research advice.

It is shown that a linear programming estimator (LPE), considered by Nielsen and Shephard (2003) among others, remains consistent under severe model misspecification. Consequently, the LPE can be used to test for, and seek sources of, misspecification when a pure autoregression cannot satisfactorily describe the data generating process, and to isolate certain trend, seasonal or cyclical components. Simple and quite general conditions under which the LPE is strongly consistent in the presence of serially dependent, non-identically distributed or otherwise misspecified errors are given, and a brief review of the literature on LP-based estimators in nonnegative autoregression is presented. Finite-sample properties of the LPE are investigated in an extensive simulation study covering a wide range of model misspecifications. A small scale empirical study, employing a volatility proxy to model and forecast latent daily return volatility of three major stock market indexes, illustrates the potential usefulness of the LPE.

In parallel we view a pressure to increase sustainable mobility through reducing car driving. Against this background, this paper addresses the question: to what extent the frequency of contact between parents and their adult children living out of home is associated with time allocated to work, including commuting time, and with automobility? Face-to-face and telecommunication based contact is considered. Regression analysis of survey data collected in the Netherlands was performed and results suggest that face,to-face contact was significantly associated with work and commute duration, car ownership, car commuting and distance. Telecommunication based contact was mainly associated with work duration, degree of urbanization and distance. Automobility seemed to be more important for women than for men. The policy implication is a potential trade-off between policies that aim at strengthening sustainable mobility behaviour and policies that lead to an increase in the reliance on informal care.

We present a Dual Process Evaluability Framework (DPEF) which suggests that the characteristics of the decision problem, including response mode, presentation mode, and choice-set structure, are critical to predicting preference reversals related to decisions under risk and uncertainty, over time, and between product assortments, as well as presentation mode reversals involving joint versus separate evaluations, and response mode reversals involving a combination of choice tasks, monetary value tasks, and attractiveness ratings. Our framework, grounded in evaluability theory and dual process models, predicts how these decision problem characteristics directly affect the ease of evaluation of alternatives which subsequently affects the relative dominance of feeling versus calculation in these tasks. Application of DPEF to previously documented preference reversals, complemented by three studies which test new predictions of DPEF, reveals that DPEF provides a parsimonious explanation for a variety of decision anomalies.

Consistent with the notion that managers react to rising volatility by providing guidance, we document a link between abnormal run-ups in volatility and the decision to issue a forecast after controlling for the market's ability to anticipate the guidance. Upon disentangling pre-guidance volatility changes from post-guidance volatility changes, we find no evidence that guidance increases volatility. Indeed, our evidence consistently supports the view that managers seek to and do mitigate share price volatility with guidance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The effects are stronger for opportunistic (i.e., more informed) insider trades and when short sellers' attention is high.

I argue against seven such myths about the effects of default, the primary cause of the crisis, the likely effects of an exit from the euro zone, the bargaining power of the Greek government in its negotiations with the EU/ECB/IMF troika, and other related issues.

The Anglo-Saxon literature outlines contradictory theoretical arguments on this question and provides mixed empirical results. Controlling for the unobserved heterogeneity bias, using a control function approach, we show that strike frequency has a non-linear effect on French firms' labor productivity, which proves to be positive and growing up to a certain threshold, and non-significant beyond. Then, we highlight that the effect of strike frequency on labor productivity varies significantly depending on employees' absenteeism within the firm. Strike incidence may affect positively and indirectly labor productivity, provided not to be associated with a, problematic absenteeism within the workforce. In contrast, when associated with this individual expression of conflict from employees, strikes have no effect on labor productivity.","[Tanguy, Jeremy] Univ Maine, GAINS TEPP, Orono, ME 04469 USA",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Tanguy, J (通讯作者)，UFR Droit Econ & Gest, Ave Olivier Messiaen, F-72085 Le Mans 9, France.",jeremy.tanguy@univ-lemans.fr,"Bairwa, Arun K/I-4561-2016",,,,,,50,0,0,3,14,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The model implies that one should observe a positive correlation between stock-market participation (and risky asset share, conditional on participation) and financial literacy, and a negative correlation between the generosity of the social security system and financial literacy.

In this paper we analyze 1022 European private equity exits, using information on fund and portfolio company characteristics, and on conditions in capital markets. For over 43% of the exits, private equity funds sold to each other and we analyze why such secondary buyouts have gained in popularity relative to IPOs and sales to corporate acquirers. We find that the exit route depends on various portfolio company characteristics, and that conditions in the debt and equity markets have a strong influence on exit choice. The existing literature has tended to portray the IPO is the preferred exit route. However, our analysis suggests this is mistaken: private equity funds take advantage of 'windows of opportunity', and the exit route that maximizes value varies with market conditions.

The robustness of our PC-based proxies for informed trading in these analyses, especially for the further refined measures, suggests that they successfully capture the adverse selection component of bid-ask spreads and illiquidity due to information asymmetry.

The empirical evidence suggests that the support for the traditional rule and the new view or the new rule depends crucially on the size of the net foreign asset position of the country. For moderate net foreign asset positions the new view or the new rule dominate. However, for large creditor or debtor countries the traditional rule dominates, but the reaction is weaker for debtor countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Households in the poverty-NHI group exhibited much lower satisfaction compared to other groups when they experienced CHE. This study further showed that the harmful effect of facing CHE was confined not only to poor health outcomes or economic hardships but also extended to generally lower life satisfaction in the poverty-NHI group.

We consider situations where citizens and politicians disagree on the value of the expected social harm associated with some activities. We find that a strong law enforcement equilibrium (high level of deterrence) emerges when citizens expect a high level of harm. On the reverse, a weak law enforcement equilibrium emerges when citizens expect a low level of harm.

We show that the viability of the electoral mechanism depends on the balance of military force, the sharpness of divisions within a society, and institutions that moderate policies implemented by winners of elections. For elections to be held and their outcomes to be respected, the probabilities that they would be won by incumbents must bear an inverse relation to the magnitude of policy changes resulting from elections. Elections are competitive when their outcomes make some but not too much difference. Constraining the scope of policy divergence increases the range of the balance of force under which elections are competitive in divided, but not in homogeneous, societies. Hence, competitiveness of elections and constitutional constraints on policies - the norms being promoted as essential for democracies - do not always go together. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Leaving aside post-Fukushima-Daiichi safety concerns, the major issue for nuclear power is whether new builds could be achieved at reasonable costs. In fact, ever since the completion of the first wave of nuclear reactors in 1970, and continuing with the ongoing construction of new reactors in Europe, nuclear power seems to be doomed with the curse of cost escalation. This phenomenon has been studied for the US., and it has been argued that a heterogeneous nuclear fleet, which has made it difficult to learn from experience, can partially explain the escalation. The French nuclear power programme has followed a standardization strategy; however previous cost assessments have also pointed to an increase in capital costs. This observation implies that even in the best economic conditions, cost escalation is inherent to nuclear power In this paper we re-examine the drivers of cost escalation in France, based on construction costs taken from a recent report by the French Court of Auditors (i.e. Cour des Comptes). Using this information, we found that the cost escalation observed in previous studies was lower than argued. Our results indicate that the scale-up resulted in more costly reactors, but we also found evidence of learning effects from these same reactors. This finding shows that the standardization strategy adopted in the French nuclear programme has led to significant cost reductions.","[Rangel, Lina Escobar; Leveque, Francois] PSL Res Univ, MINES ParisTech, CERNA Ctr Ind Econ, F-75006 Paris, France",Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech,"Lévéque, F (通讯作者)，PSL Res Univ, MINES ParisTech, CERNA Ctr Ind Econ, 60 Blvd St Michel, F-75006 Paris, France.",lina.escobar_rangel@mines-paristech.fr; francois.leveque@mines-paristech.fr,,,,,,,33,13,17,0,28,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

The most robust result is that government support to product R&D will elicit less of a response the greater is average firm size within the industry. This result suggests, for example, that government support to upstream research in the life sciences will stimulate less downstream industrial investment in the development of new drugs to the extent that the firms in the downstream industry are larger. The model also predicts that where entry is less encumbered, we can expect demand-side subsidies to elicit greater product R&D within an industry. Thus, to the degree that, for example, barriers to entering the solar panel manufacturing industry are lower, we should expect R&D on solar panel development to rise more in response to tax credits for their purchase.","[Arora, Ashish; Cohen, Wesley M.] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Arora, Ashish; Cohen, Wesley M.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Cohen, WM (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, 100 Fuqua Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",ashish.arora@duke.edu; wesley.cohen@duke.edu,"arora, ashish/A-2513-2008; arora, ashish/M-1720-2013","arora, ashish/0000-0001-5097-8646",,,,,19,10,10,3,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We do not find systematic differences between temporary and permanent workers with respect to the effects of offshoring for wages.

The influences of maternal and paternal parental styles on adolescent socialization outcomes are investigated separately and compared. Results provide stronger support for the mediation model.

At the industry level, the dynamic conditional correlation MGARCH (DCC MGARCH) estimates demonstrate that the market model and three-factor model are appropriate for exposure measurements, and industry returns are more likely to be exposed to unanticipated changes in the real exchange rate and the trade-weighted effective exchange rate, particularly for manufacturing industries. At the firm level, although the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) estimates vary across markets, it is apparent that there is a relationship between firm size and exposure effects, which also show that lagged exchange rate changes have significant exposure effects on firm returns.

The positive effect of migration on human trafficking decreases as income increases, and furthermore, the effect is irrelevant to high income countries. In addition, the migration effect is particularly significant on the criminalisation side of human trafficking, but the evidence is less clear when it concerns the victimisation side.","Univ Marburg, Empir Inst Econ, Fac Econ, D-35037 Marburg, Germany",Philipps University Marburg,"Cho, SY (通讯作者)，Univ Marburg, Empir Inst Econ, Fac Econ, Barfuessertor 2, D-35037 Marburg, Germany.",seo.cho@wiwi.uni-marburg.de,,,,,,,30,5,9,2,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Experiments of an investment game are conducted where a wealth-creating investment decision is made. After it grows, the recipient selects how much to return. The econometric method used allows for a disentangling of the selection effects from learning. We show that finance students are both born and made. Those who choose to study finance do not necessarily make trusting investments or volunteer to return the proceeds, but the effect of the education is to reverse these behaviors promoting pro-social, trusting, and reciprocating choices that generate wealth.","[McCannon, Bryan C.; Peterson, Jeffrey] St Bonaventure Univ, St Bonaventure, NY USA",,"McCannon, BC (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, 1601 Univ Ave, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",bryan.c.mccannon@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,5,8,2,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

However, there is still little known about the influence of the complexity of the choice task on model outcomes. In this paper we investigate task complexity in terms of the design dimensionality of the choice experiment by systematically varying the number of choice sets, alternatives, attributes, and levels as well as the level range. We largely follow a Design of Designs approach originally introduced in transportation. First, we analyse the influence of the design dimensionality on participants' dropout behaviour finding that the probability to drop-out of the survey is influenced by socio-demographic characteristics and increases with the number of choice sets, attributes as well as with designs having five alternatives. Second, we investigate the impact of the design dimensions on stated choices by estimating a multinomial logit model, and heteroskedastic logit models. Results show that the error term variance is influenced by socio-demographic characteristics as well as by all design dimensions. Moreover, we find that accounting for the impact of the design dimension on the error variance does not significantly change willingness to pay estimates.","[Meyerhoff, Juergen; Oehlmann, Malte] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Landscape & Environm Planning, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Weller, Priska] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, Inst Int Forestry & Forest Econ, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Meyerhoff, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Landscape & Environm Planning, Str 17 Juni 145, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",juergen.meyerhoff@tu-berlin.de; malte.oehlmann@tu-berlin.de; priska.weller@ti.bund.de,"Meyerhoff, Juergen/M-5640-2019","Meyerhoff, Juergen/0000-0003-4333-8514","Federal German Ministry of Education and Research [Fkz. 033L029G, Fkz 01LL0909A]",Federal German Ministry of Education and Research,We would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for their very valuable comments.

In this case, it is efficient for consumers to self-select their purchases, with those especially prone to harm refraining from purchase. Achieving this outcome requires consumers to bear their own harm, given that producers cannot observe consumer types. When consumers also misperceive risk, the problem becomes more complicated because accurate signaling of risk requires that firms bear liability. A trade-off therefore emerges between imposing liability on firms versus consumers. This article characterizes the choice among liability rules in the presence of this trade-off.

While an effective source of financing in good times, the 2007 financial crisis has exposed the vulnerability of banks and ultimately firms to such a liability structure. We show that banks dependent on wholesale funding contracted their lending the greatest during the crisis. Our results suggest, however, that in the financial crisis vulnerable banks passed the liquidity shock only to public firms and not to private firms. Loans to private firms were affected through a different channel, largely through higher retained shares by lead arrangers. Consistent with standard models of financial intermediation with information asymmetry, vulnerable banks increased their monitoring of informationally opaque firms for which the potential for informational rents is the highest.

The lack of merchant card acceptance plays a large role in the use of cash, especially for low-value transactions (less than 25 dollars): Participation in a credit card rewards program induces a shift toward credit card usage at the expense of both debit cards and cash. In contrast, changes in the amount of rewards (ad valorem) has a small or inelastic effect on the probability of paying with credit cards.

The theory shows that taking on additional inventory generates a critical principal-agent issue, resulting in the dilution of an agent's selling effort and, ultimately, creating an externality that adversely impacts housing market outcomes across listings. It remains an empirical question whether diluted sales effort leads to lower prices, longer time on market, or both. The empirical results reveal significant inventory externality effects, as greater agent inventory tends to reduce selling price and substantially reduce liquidity for clients' properties in this market.

Using a large database of French housing loans covering the years 2000-2010, we show the following: supplying loans with financial assistance helps financially constrained borrowers to absorb income shocks, adjustable-rate loans are riskier on average, and the combination of public support and adjustable rates can lead to a concentration of risk in the lender's portfolio. The risk measurement methodology used in this paper extends the one-factor economic capital model underlying the Basel 2 regulatory credit-risk formulas. This portfolio approach leads to the credit risk of housing loans being handled as a portfolio management issue for the lender. From this perspective, our results also illustrate that the ability to promote access to homeownership to low-income borrowers may be determined by the lender's capacity to identify diversification benefits at the portfolio level. Thus, risky borrowers may have a limited credit-risk level from the lender's perspective, which facilitates the supply of housing finance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We find that dual holding leads to easier access to bank loans, a result that is more pronounced for non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOES) than SOEs. We also find that dual holding distorts banks' lending decisions and harms the investment efficiency for SOEs, while resulting in optimal lending decisions and enhanced investment efficiency for non-SOEs. For non-SOEs, further analysis suggests that optimal lending decisions and efficient investment can be achieved for firms with higher ownership concentration, and firms in which the family and foreign investors are the controlling shareholders. We argue that, in emerging markets, whether a bank plays a monitoring role by directly holding the debt and equity claims of companies relies heavily on whether the potential collusion between firm executives and bank managers can be averted, which in turn is determined by the firms' governance framework and ownership structure.

We hypothesize that the decision to invest in the IPO market contains positive information about a fund's underlying expectation of newly listed firms' future prospects. Using residuals from a model on the determinants of mutual funds purchases in the IPO market as proxy for consensus expectations, we find that IPO firms with high residual funds have significantly better stock returns and operating performance than those with low residual funds. In other words, residual funds can predict IPO future performance.

This paper analyzes whether international linkages in interbank markets affect the stability of interconnected banking systems and channel financial distress within a network consisting of banking systems of the main advanced countries for the period 1994-2012. Methodologically, I use a spatial modeling approach to test for spillovers in cross-border interbank markets. The results suggest that foreign exposures in banking play a significant role in channeling banking risk: I find that countries that are linked through foreign borrowing or lending positions to more stable banking systems abroad are significantly affected by positive spillover effects. From a policy point of view, this implies that in stable times, linkages in the banking system can be beneficial, while they have to be taken with caution in times of financial turmoil affecting the whole system.","[Tonzer, Lena] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, I-50133 Florence, Italy",European University Institute,"Tonzer, L (通讯作者)，Halle Inst Econ Res, Kleine Maerkerstr 8, D-06180 Halle, Saale, Germany.",lena.tonzer@eui.eu,,,,,,,50,79,84,3,32,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1572-3089,1878-0962,,J FINANC STABIL,J.

In particular, a competing risks model is estimated taking into account the differences among variables leading firms to exit the market through bankruptcy, liquidation and inactivity. The determinants of financial distress for any exit route are identified on the basis of the influence on the hazard ratios of the significant variables selected for each state. Furthermore, the predictive performance of the competing-risks model over the single-risk framework is evaluated, with respect to different time windows, by means of some accuracy measures. The results reached on a sample of Italian firms provide support for the hypothesis that the factors influencing firms' way out strongly depend on the exit routes and highlighting the need to distinguish among them by means of a multiple-state approach.

There is an increase in the CEO turnover rate and a 41% decline in median tenure. Where firm performance is poor, CEOs are increasingly replaced, either by the board or in the process of the firm being taken over. US corporate governance regulations had some success in mitigating the agency problem. In the wake of those reforms, CEO turnover outcomes are more strongly associated with firm performance.

Our results are not driven by account-level weaknesses but by more severe, company-level weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting (ICFR). Further, the economic consequences of cash resources significantly decrease with the remediation of previously reported material weaknesses. These results suggest that the favorable (precautionary) impact induced by weak ICFR appears to more than offset the adverse (agency) effect entailed by ineffective ICFR.

The latter constitute credit chains that include a simple mortgage market. The focus is on the nature and contagion properties of credit chains in an economy where the financial sector plays a real allocating role, and agents have a serious choice of whether to default on mortgages or not. Multiple equilibria with different rates of default are observed, due to the presence of strategic complementarities. A liquidity crunch is associated with higher rates of default that can trigger a financial crisis as well as constrain the purchase of production factors, leading to reductions in welfare, together with potentially serious effects on real economic activity with the potential of causing deep and widespread recessions.","Univ Guanajuato, Dept Econ & Finanzas, Guanajuato, Mexico",Universidad de Guanajuato,"Hernandez-Verme, PL (通讯作者)，Univ Guanajuato, Dept Econ & Finanzas, Guanajuato, Mexico.",paulaherver@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The fish-stock's range will be composed of a number of jurisdictional zones: namely, its intersection with the EEZ of each coastal country for which that intersection is non-trivial. There may also be a zone within international waters of the high seas. We also assume that management of the fishery is vested in a Regional Fishery Management Organization, whose members are countries that are direct stakeholders in the fishery-being either one of the above countries with jurisdictional authority in a zone or a country that has registered fishing vessels that are licensed to harvest in the fishery, or both. Our primary intended audience for the article includes the RFMO member-countries' representatives, who participate directly in negotiations over RFMO policies, and also the RFMO's scientific staff. Oceanic-climate changes are poorly predictable, but there will be periodic updates to enhance the available estimates. Consequently we believe that the RFMO's efforts to cope with these changes would be helped by developing, as a tool, a certain type of a priori dynamic model, which could explore alternative long-time evolution paths for the bioeconomics of the fishery. The model should examine the immediate decisions made by the RFMO, and various possible long-term outcomes as these short-term decisions accumulate. Furthermore the model should be updated periodically, especially after new updated oceanic-climate predictions become available. In the article we work out a relatively simple example model, of an idealized fishery which is attempting to cope with a deteriorating oceanic-climate environment. But we also explain why (and in what ways) each particular real-world fishery's staff needs to modify this generic example, to more closely match its own unique characteristics.","[McKelvey, Robert] Univ Montana, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Golubtsov, Peter] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow, Russia",University of Montana System; University of Montana; Lomonosov Moscow State University,"Golubtsov, P (通讯作者)，Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow, Russia.",pgolubtsov@gmail.com,"Golubtsov, Peter/D-5128-2018","Golubtsov, Peter/0000-0002-2248-2798","NSF through the project Sustaining Cooperative Multinational Marine Fishery Management in the Face of Environmental Variability [0323129]; Norwegian Research Council through the AGAMEM project [216571/E40]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0323129] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF through the project Sustaining Cooperative Multinational Marine Fishery Management in the Face of Environmental Variability; Norwegian Research Council through the AGAMEM project(Research Council of Norway); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",Authors are grateful for financial support from NSF through the project Sustaining Cooperative Multinational Marine Fishery Management in the Face of Environmental Variability (Award No. 0323129) and from the Norwegian Research Council through the AGAMEM project (Grant No. 216571/E40).,,16,4,4,0,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This paper tests whether specific characteristics at both the bank and country levels at the onset of the global crisis contributed to the behavior of real credit growth in this region during the crisis. As shown, financial soundness characteristics of Latin American banks, such as capitalization, liquidity, and bank efficiency in the pre-crisis period, played a role in explaining the dynamics of real credit during the crisis. We also found that foreign banks and banks that had expanded credit growth more before the crisis were also those that cut credit the most. Among country-specific characteristics, we found evidence that balance sheet measures such as the economy's overall currency mismatches and external debt ratios (measuring either total debt or short-term debt) were key variables in explaining credit growth resilience.","[Rojas-Suarez, Liliana] Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Montoro, Carlos] FLAR, Latin Amer Reserve Fund, Lima, Peru",,"Rojas-Suarez, L (通讯作者)，Ctr Global Dev, 2055 L St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",lrojas-suarez@cgdev.org,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The empirical analysis is based on a survey of 268 small and medium-sized enterprises in the Spanish retail trade sector. A logistic regression specification is used as an econometric method. The results indicate that both the acquisition of new technical and electronic equipment and the obtaining of new software are affected by the two types of determinants previously pointed out. The manager/business owner's entrepreneurial motivation and educational background have significant influences on technology adoption in this type of companies. Furthermore, being part of a business group, carrying out training activities for the employees and inter-firm cooperation also positively influence technology adoption in the retail trade industry.","[Romero, Isidoro; Maritnez-Roman, Juan A.] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Romero, I (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Seville, Spain.",isidoro@us.es,"Romero, Isidoro/E-8160-2010; Martinez-Roman, Juan A./N-6819-2013","Romero, Isidoro/0000-0001-8764-2599; Martinez-Roman, Juan A./0000-0001-5013-6748","Department of Economy, Innovation and Science of the Regional Government of Andalusia [P09-SEJ-4857]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)","Department of Economy, Innovation and Science of the Regional Government of Andalusia; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU))","This article is part of the Excellence Research project entitled  Analyzing the qualitative aspects shaping the quality of entrepreneurs and SMEs: Implications for the economic development of the Spanish Regions (P09-SEJ-4857), which was funded by the Department of Economy, Innovation and Science of the Regional Government of Andalusia with the support of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).",,51,13,16,1,36,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2015,17.0,39,,,,,646,660,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW8WK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365279900010,0

We compare our proposed method to a conventional copula-GARCH model where the parameter of a Clayton copula is estimated via Canonical Maximum-Likelihood. The superiority of our proposed model is exemplified by analyzing a data sample of nine different bivariate and one nine-dimensional financial portfolio.

To put it sharply, children are raised by their parents, the elderly rely on society. Since the reallocation of resources within and between households are not registered in National Accounts, the majority of the resources transferred to children are not visible in contrast to resources flowing to the elderly, which are almost entirely observed in public statistics. For our analysis we apply a recent extension of National Accounts, called the National Transfer Accounts, which include private transfers; and a further, experimental extension, the National Time Transfer Accounts, which quantifies the value of time transferred among household members in the form of unpaid household labor. We show that less than one third of the full transfer package flowing to children is registered in the National Accounts and another roughly one third is made visible by the National Transfer Accounts. The remaining one third, which is the value of parents caring for their children, is made visible by the National Time Transfer Accounts. The corresponding shares in funding old age are quite different: 90 percent is observed in public statistics and the two accounting extensions unfold only a bit less than 10 percent.

Historical and sensory associations with payment modes generate differential cognitive and emotional sensitivity in mental accounts, and influence the type, value and amount of products purchased. Although an increasing amount of attention has been devoted to the influence of payment mode on spending behavior, and little effort has been devoted to developing an appropriate measurement scale to capture consumers' cognitive and emotional associations with payment modes. To address this gap in the literature, this study developed a conceptual and empirical framework with a sample of approximately 800 participants, and shows how the constructs and the scales capture perceptions of payment modes. The 19-item PPM scale represents four dimensions: emotions relating to cash and card based payment modes, social and personal gratification and money management. The PPM measurement scale demonstrates acceptable reliability and shows that consumer perceptions of payment modes influence spending behavior and predict ownership of financial cards in possession. The scale is useful in understanding consumer cognitive and emotional associations with payment modes, particularly the use of owned money and how these associations impact on payment mode choice.

South Africa's demographic dividend,JOURNAL OF THE ECONOMICS OF AGEING,,,English,Article,,,,,,National Transfer Accounts; Demographic dividend; Economic lifecycle; South Africa,ECONOMIC-THEORY,"South Africa is in the process of undergoing a demographic transition and the population is currently ageing. Within the next three decades, the median age is expected to rise from 25 years to 31 years. As part of this process, the changing age structure of the population gives rise to the demographic dividend. This dividend represents a potential boost to per capita incomes that countries can only access in the presence of a supportive policy context. However, South Africa is still dealing with the consequences of apartheid-era socioeconomic policies and has already progressed through a significant proportion of the first demographic dividend period.

The comparison shows some changes worth noting and these include the overall increase in per capita labor income and consumption in real terms, the rise in real per capita private health spending at older ages, and change in reliance on labor income as a source to finance consumption of the young and the elderly. Additionally, the implications of changing the definition or treatment of remittances of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) in the estimation of the Philippine NTA are demonstrated and discussed. The 2007 NTA was estimated two ways: first with OFW remittances defined as mainly inter-household transfers; and, second, with OFW remittances defined as mainly labor income (earnings) in the revised estimates. The implications of the change in definition is examined by comparing the first and revised sets of 2007 NTA estimates, and it is noted that the definitional change results in a smaller lifecycle deficit or a smaller gap between consumption and labor income in the revised estimates, among others.

Also, markets with more GVC funding have more VC funding per enterprise and more VC-funded enterprises, suggesting that GVC finance largely augments rather than displaces PVC finance.

Unlike assumed in existing models of commodity price dynamics, a simple analysis of the data reveals that the probability of tail events is not constant but depends on the time of the year, i.e. exhibits seasonality. We propose a stochastic volatility jump-diffusion model to capture this seasonal variation. Applying the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology, we estimate our model using 20 years of futures data from four different commodity markets. We find strong statistical evidence to suggest that our model with seasonal jump intensity outperforms models featuring a constant jump intensity. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our findings, we show that our model typically improves Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

By selecting a set of structural parameters of the model through a systematic procedure, we show that the autocorrelations (of returns, absolute returns and squared returns) of the market fraction model share the same pattern as those of the DAX 30. By conducting econometric analysis via Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize these power-law behaviours and find that estimates of the power-law decay indices, the (FI)GARCH parameters, and the tail index of the selected market fraction model closely match those of the DAX 30.

Results show that better institutions and stronger property rights protection reduce bank profits, while stronger power of creditors drives up bank profits significantly. Results imply that better institutions and enhanced property rights protection lead to greater flow of credit allowing firms and investors to undertake more profitable ventures. By extension, stronger creditor rights erect steeper barriers to external finance for firms and investors. National indicators of economic freedoms may be more important to lowering the spread than strict creditor rights.

These changes closely followed announcements and were very unlikely to have occurred by chance. A simple portfolio choice model can produce quantitatively plausible changes in U.S. and foreign excess bond yields. The jump depreciations of the USD are fairly consistent with estimates of the impacts of previous equivalent monetary policy shocks. The policy announcements do not appear to have reduced yields by reducing expectations of real growth. Unconventional policy can reduce international long-term yields and the value of the dollar even at the zero bound. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We use an innovative Bayesian dynamic frontier model that: (1) distinguishes between short-run and long-run performance; and (2) provides impulse response functions to examine the dynamic effect of shocks in technical and allocative inefficiencies. Based on a rich sample of European banks, we show that while there was a drop in efficiency for most countries following the crisis, the long-run results suggest improvement both in terms of technical and allocative efficiencies. The impulse response functions also show that in the case of shocks in the system, banks seem to revert back to these long-run allocative efficiency scores. We discuss the results in terms of the current financial crisis and provide interesting implications for the European banking industry. We also discuss the determinants of technical and allocative efficiencies. (We would like to thank Professor Allen N.

I find that the negative-risk premium in the interest ratewhich compensates NFA holders for exchange-rate risk with a higher relative rate of return on their NFAsplays a pivotal role in influencing the magnitude of sterilization and in inducing endogenous change in the exchange rate. I show that a feedback loop between the exchange rate and capital inflow exists in the form of a multiplier mechanism that jeopardizes both monetary autonomy and exchange-rate stability. The findings testify to the open-economy trilemma challenging the effectiveness and sustainability of China's monetary-cum-exchange rate policy and point to a flexible exchange rate as a solution that can enhance monetary sovereignty, reduce financial repression and improve economic efficiency.","Salisbury Univ, Franklin P Perdue Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA",University System of Maryland; Salisbury University,"Wu, Y (通讯作者)，Salisbury Univ, Franklin P Perdue Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA.",yxwu@salisbury.edu,,,,,,,23,11,11,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

We use data from Japanese households who purchased a detached house in an urban area to test this strategic interaction. Considering both censoring and endogeneity of inter vivos gifts, which are identified by information on formal care, our preferred results demonstrate that inter vivos gifts do not significantly increase the purchase price of housing. Theory suggests that this occurs when informal care tends to be a heavy burden for children. However, subsample analysis of young home buyers indicates that the empirical results are consistent with the literature: children who receive parental gifts tend to purchase a higher-priced dwelling. One potential explanation is that relatively young adult children are less likely to take charge of care obligations, and accordingly, parental gifts are only expected to relax their liquidity constraints. Subsample analysis appears to indicate that the underlying motivation of parental gifts is influenced by the timing of children's home purchase decisions. J. Japanese Int. Economies 35 (2015) 62-77.

They increase with hard information about repayment arrears and reminders. Late payments have the largest influence on loan prices. Older entrepreneurs do not seem to be discriminated. Rather, the younger have to pay more because their loans and businesses are smaller and they lack liquidity to pay in time.

This paper presents a model for road network classification based on traffic accidents integrated in a geographic information system. Its practical application was developed through a case study in the municipality of Barcelos. An equation was defined to obtain a road safety index through the combination of the following indicators: severity, property damage only and accident costs. In addition to the road network classification, the application of the model allows to analyze the spatial coverage of accidents in order to determine the centrality and dispersion of the locations with the highest incidence of road accidents. This analysis can be further refined according to the nature of the accidents namely in collision, runoff and pedestrian crashes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Even though the studies in this area are still scarce, the authors strongly believe that this will be a topic highly discussed in the near future, given the fact that emotion and logical thought are intertwined, interacting in complex ways during problem solving, decision making, and other important forms of cognition that entrepreneurs use when pursuing their ventures.","[Schiopu, Andreea F.; Vasile, Dragos C.; Tuclea, Claudia E.] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Tuclea, CE (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",claudia.tuclea@com.ase.ro,"Schiopu, Andreea Fortuna/J-6678-2017; Tuclea, Claudia/R-7491-2019; Vasile, Dragos Constantin/D-1783-2015","Schiopu, Andreea Fortuna/0000-0002-6524-0190; TUCLEA, Claudia-Elena/0000-0002-8104-0041; Vasile, Dragos Constantin/0000-0002-2178-4719",European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/142115],European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development,"This work was cofinanced from the European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project number POSDRU/159/1.5/S/142115, Performance and excellence in doctoral and postdoctoral research in Romanian economics science domain",,35,9,10,2,41,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2015,17.0,38,,,,,474,487,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352213800030,0

Although family ownership remained the most prevalent form of ownership, there was considerable churning in the identities of the most powerful family owners.

Although the importance of market liquidity in asset pricing has been well documented, little is known about what causes stock market liquidity to vary over time. This paper examines whether the time-series variation in stock market liquidity is related to investor sentiment. Using the liquidity measure developed by Amihud [2002] and two survey-based investor sentiment indices, I find that the stock market is more liquid when sentiment indices rise, that is, when investors are more bullish. Moreover, the Granger causality tests suggest that investor sentiment Granger-causes market liquidity. Further analyses show that market trading volume also increases when investor sentiment is higher. In addition, the finding that the market is more liquid when investor sentiment is higher still persists even after controlling for the effect of market trading volume.

A possible consequence of poor structure of lending and deposit formation process is the inability to resume lending to the real sector in a sustainable manner, representing an element of inhibition regarding the normal banking operation and the economy functioning as a whole. Lowering the cost of credit and the phenomenon of removing from bank balance sheets the irrecoverable receivables could lead to the improvement from structural point of view of lending; however, in order to provide a balance banking system and economy, also the formation of deposits must support important changes in a similar manner as the loans. For this reason(1), this article aims at analyzing in the period 2007-2014 the positive and negative aspects of the lending process and the setting up of deposits in Romania, suggesting at the same time ways to improve the current status.","Acad Romana, Ctr Financial & Monetary Res Victor Slavescu, Costin C Kiritescu Natl Inst Econ Res, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences; National Institute for Economic Research Costin C.

We used a SEM model and analyzed the indirect relations through the voluntary disclosure of information and the organizational performance. We built a voluntary disclosure index based on the information firms provided in their annual reports and divided the governance characteristics in two constructs: directors' and supervisors' structures and ownership structure. We concluded that the ownership structure exerts a direct influence on share price and share liquidity, Otherwise, the directors' and supervisors' structures exert an indirect influence, through the organizational performance and the voluntary disclosure of information. The results also show that for firms with high levels of disclosure the bid-ask spread is lower. However, in firms with a high ownership concentration investors tend to increase the bid-ask spreads and trade less, which, in this case, reduces the liquidity of the stock. The failure to find the relationship between voluntary disclosure of information and the turnover ratio shows us that the liquidity of shares is more related to the greater or lesser concentration of shareholders, with the performance of their companies than with the access to information. Moreover, it is clear that the role that information disclosure plays is mainly at the level of price formation.

Every bank has two sides to consider, customers and investors. Customers, however, are clearly the most important part of a bank as they provide the basic raw materials of deposits and the demand for loans, which are the revenue streams of net interest income but also provide the fee income. The bank offers an intermediation service between customers with excess funds and those with a funds deficit. It borrows and lends wholesale funds to keep the two piles in some kind of balance. The drivers of customer behaviour are complex. Understanding the needs of their customers and reacting to the changes of their behaviour, aid banks and financial institutions to face the hard competition. Clearly then, the success of a bank is subject to its ability to attract and retain its customers, and a large part of their business. This ability depends on what is called the image of a bank. In highly competitive sectors, like the banking sector, the image represents an asset which allows firms to differentiate and increase their success chances. However, although its impact on consumer behavior is of primary importance, a bank's image is a difficult asset to value and quantify. The concept of image has been given considerable attention in the literature over the past years. Image has been defined as the total impression that an entity makes on the minds of people and as the net result of the interaction of beliefs, ideas, feelings and previous experiences with an institution, which are stored in memory and transformed in concepts. Especially a bank's image can be seen as the perception that customers or potential customers have for a specific bank, based on the messages they received by the examined financial institution. Image is a strategic tool since it helps banks to achieve long-term objectives and it can be shown as a source of competitive advantage. The present paper builds on the previous work on the subject and focuses on the definition and measurement of a bank's image. It introduces image as a variable which expresses a bank's current state of development and future prospects. It identifies the factors affecting this variable, suggests ways of measuring them and uses image as the basis for the building of a non-linear model expressing a bank's development. The image of a bank, as defined in this paper, may prove a very useful tool for planning purposes, since it doesn't only give an early diagnosis of possible changes, sometimes discontinuous, in the bank's pattern of progress, but also indicates the reasons for them. Hence, it may be used as the basis for designing appropriate measures to assist a bank's evolution. The theoretical findings are applied to a group of banks operating in Greece and the results are presented and discussed. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Firms differ substantially with respect to the type of technological knowledge they can generate and exploit through technological innovations. This in turn has major effects on the direction of technological change they are able to introduce. Large firms able to command the recombinant generation of codified knowledge with a strong scientific base are more likely to introduce neutral technological changes that consist in a shift effect of production functions. Small firms that rely more on tacit and external knowledge are more likely to rely on technologies directed toward the most intensive use of locally abundant production factors. The effects of this difference in terms of the resulting total factor productivity growth are important and can be grasped only when the changes in output elasticity of production factors in growth accounting are properly appreciated. The empirical evidence for a sample of 6,600 Italian firms observed between 1996 and 2005 confirms that large firms introduced mainly neutral technological changes while small firms with lower levels of profitability introduced biased technological changes.","[Antonelli, Cristiano] Univ Turin, Dipartimento Econ, Turin, Italy; [Antonelli, Cristiano; Scellato, Giuseppe] Coll Carlo Alberto, BRICK Bur Res Complex Knowledge Innovat, Moncalieri, Italy; [Scellato, Giuseppe] Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Ingn Gest & Prod, I-10129 Turin, Italy",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto; Polytechnic University of Turin,"Scellato, G (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, Dipartimento Ingn Gest & Prod, Cso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",giuseppe.scellato@polito.it,"ANTONELLI, CRISTIANO/HTN-7364-2023","Scellato, Giuseppe/0000-0003-0927-9346; Antonelli, Cristiano/0000-0002-5652-0510",,,,,42,24,26,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The results for the Czech economy are similar to the results for other small open economies described in current literature. Fiscal policy during the estimated period is analyzed through historical shock decomposition. Our findings are that GDP decreases in reaction to fiscal shock and monetary variables show negligible reaction to the same shock.

Globalization is often understood as increasing global economic integration, global forms of governance and globally inter-linked social and environmental development. One of the important factors of institutional quality is economic freedom. The aim of this article is to map, analyze and evaluate, by means of statistical analysis, the mutual relationships between three dimensions of globalization (economic, social and political) and economic freedom. The first part provides the methodology of measuring overall globalization using the composite Index of Globalization KOF 2014. The index of economic freedom according to The Heritage Foundation is used to measure the economic freedom and the second part of the paper deals with it. The third part compares indices and scores together and analyzes them. It is possible to conclude from the results that a statistically significant link between economic globalization and economic freedom was demonstrated for both groups of countries. Improvement in economic freedom is tied with the social dimension of globalization only in developing countries; it is not significantly correlated in developed market economies. The link between political globalization and economic freedom was not statistically demonstrated for both groups of countries neither.","[Bednarova, Pavla] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Bednárová, P (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",pavla.bednarova@tul.cz,"Bednářová, Pavla/HLP-4977-2023",,,,,,17,1,1,0,2,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,68,78,,,,,,11,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300008,0

Purpose of Study: To investigate the leadership style developmental leadership (DL) and any relationship with the factor results of leadership in DL. A second purpose was to investigate the relation between the factor results of leadership and the five personality factors in the personality test NEO PI-R. Methods: 16 respondents working in a municipality in Norway filled out the personality test NEO PI-R. In addition the developmental leadership questionnaire (DLQ) was used in order to collect data on the respondents' leadership. The respondents were also requested to send the DLQ to 6-10 supervisors/colleagues and subordinates in order to get objective feedback on their leadership behavior. The respondents were divided into a high and a low results group dependent upon their scores on the factor result of leadership in DL. Findings and Results: No significant differences were found in the high results group between the respondents' own score and their colleagues' score on the different aspects of DL. Significant differences were, however, found in the low results group between the respondents' and the colleagues' score on the different aspects of DL. No significant differences existed between the two groups regarding the score on the five personality factors. Conclusions and Recommendations: A relationship seemed to exist between the leadership style DL and the factor results of leadership but not with any of the five personality factors.

The CME spot cheese prices are used as reference prices in contract cheese market, and they also influence milk prices at the farm-first-handler level set within a public pricing system, the Federal and State Milk Marketing Orders. The CME spot cheese market performs a critical price-discovery function in the United States dairy industry. This research evaluates the nature of pricing practices used by CME cheese wholesalers during the period of 2000-2014. The analysis focuses on the farm-to-wholesale price transmission process, which reflects the nature of cost pass-through. The empirical evidence presented in the article indicates that pricing strategies of cheese sellers in the analyzed market are consistent with the ones predicted by the profit-maximization models of oligopolistic behavior. The overall empirical evidence may suggest that cheese sellers on the CME spot cheese market used an output (cheese) price stabilization method during the analyzed period of time.","[Bolotova, Yuliya V.] Clemson Univ, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Agribusiness, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Novakovic, Andrew M.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Agr Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Clemson University; Cornell University,"Bolotova, YV (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Agribusiness, 237 McAdams Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",yuliyab@clemson.edu; a.novakovic@cornell.edu,,,,,,,35,1,1,1,7,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

From the analysis reveals, that there is a significant difference between rural and metropolitan areas. With regard to the territory and the population, Hungary is mainly ranked as rural area, so in accordance with our objectives, the attitudes of the business sector have been studied globally on a rural settlement and we present our results in this article. We have chosen Hajduboszormenyfor detailed analysis and 106 enterprises involved in our study. The data collected during the research were construed by Principal Component and Cluster analyses and the results were evaluated from two aspects. On the one hand for the SME-s, and on the other hand for agricultural enterprises. The separation was necessary because the situation of the SME-s had a bad reputation, especially in rural regions. The basis of the results of the analysis, agro-enterprises use ICT at least of all. The farms do not use and consider unnecessary the use of broadband services, referring to the nature of their work. They communicate with partners and clients personally and trust is very important factor for them. They sell the products and carry out the purchase just few places. A change in this situation is not expected in the foreseeable future. In contrast, the most of factors were considered important or expressly important by service and commercial enterprises, regardless from the application. Regarding to remote network services there was a uniform conclusion. The majority of SME-s is not familiar with these services, and when the services are known, these are not considered useful or efficient. The price is not a determinative factor for the use of these services, so the diffusion of the solution would be difficult and lengthy E-business can do much to strengthen the vitality and sustainability of agricultural and related industries.Enterprises still do not interested in new IT solutions, such as Cloud Computing. They not trust about it and only 10% considering to take a remote software or data server. We have concluded that the current result of network investments is principally the creation of the possibility and right of accessibility, and equal opportunities. The business SME sectors do not take enough advantage of business opportunities provided by networks. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This means a paradigm shift with humanistic accents, which makes necessary an interdisciplinary approach to the economic issues. In the last century, emphasizing and validating individualism from an ethical point of view, but also under the influence of other global factors, there were some important changes regarding moral values. In post-communist Romania, social and cultural values are the product and the expression of globalization, but also the result of the collective consciousness, continuously subject to change.

Brand enables the city to develop and promote its recognition. Paris is illuminated city, Milano is city of fashion, Las Vegas is sin city, while Washington represents political power. In other words, brand signifies the city DNA, its components, its uniqueness and authenticity, what is being passed from one generation to another the bridge between the past, present and the future of the city. The main aim of this paper is to present the methodology that can help as the roadmap for successful city branding on the basis of comparative analysis. This methodology encompasses several key stages: (1) The identification of the present level of brand development; (2) The definition of strategic orientation and setting long-term brand aims; (3) The realization of brand aims, i.e. closing up gap between the present and the desired level; (4) The development of measure system to monitor and report about the achieved results. The implementation of this methodology requires project approach where all the interested parties are involved such as: the office for the local economic development, business leaders, touristic organizations, local authorities, media, educational institutions, cultural institutions, etc. Enriched with the theoretical and practical experience, the suggested methodology can help the cities and municipalities in the South-Eastern European region to increase their chances on the market of cities and accelerate their social development.","[Dejanovic, Aleksandar; Ljubojevic, Cedomir] MBS, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Dejanovic, A (通讯作者)，MBS, Belgrade, Serbia.",aleksandar.dejanovic@mbs.edu.rs; cedomir.ljubojevic@mbs.edu.rs,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,291,304,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700017,0

This article reviews the empirical literature that investigates the relationship between governance structures and risk management functions as well as their impact on banks' risk taking and performance. I first discuss risk management's responsibilities and relevance for a value-maximizing bank. The business nature of financial institutions and their funding structure, together with explicit and implicit government guarantees, set them apart from nonfinancial firms. I argue that conventional governance structures alone may be unable to restrain risk taking in banks and thus the presence of a strong and independent risk management function becomes necessary to monitor and control enterprise-wide risk exposures. Recent evidence shows that a strong risk management function, compatible with the appropriate business model and culture, can restrain tail risk exposures at financial institutions and promote long-term value maximization.","[Ellul, Andrew] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Ellul, Andrew] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London EC1V 3PZ, England; [Ellul, Andrew] Univ Naples Federico II, Ctr Studies Econ & Finance, Dept Econ & Stat, I-80126 Naples, Italy; [Ellul, Andrew] European Corp Governance Inst, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; IU Kelley School of Business; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Naples Federico II; European Corporate Governance Institute,"Ellul, A (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",anellul@indiana.edu,,,,,,,77,16,19,2,59,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4807-6,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

The distribution of wages differed drastically between the federal and private sectors. In particular, I find that federal employees with no more than a high school diploma earned 21% more, on average, than their private-sector counterparts, whereas those with a professional degree or doctorate earned 23% less. Overall, the average of federal wages was about 2% higher than the average wage of similar private-sector workers. Other researchers have found larger differences because they used log-linearized models, which result in comparisons of geometric means. I show that arithmetic means are more relevant in the context of the relationship between a government's compensation policy and its budget. The discrepancy between differences in arithmetic and geometric means occurs because the wages of federal employees were much less dispersed than those of employees with similar characteristics in the private sector.

The findings also report associated risks with the emergence of new management roles, for example information overload and misunderstanding. These new managerial roles served both as boundary spanners when creating and maintaining relationships between stakeholders, and as innovators when challenging the traditional and ingrained adversarial construction project practice.

In most countries worldwide, CSR is required primarily in companies operating in countries that are known mainly for human rights violations, such as China and India. In the Czech Republic corporate responsibility standards have become demanded after 2005. In that time one of the first of complex certificates that was already used worldwide, the SA 8000, was introduced. The basic idea of social responsibility within the company lies in trying to meet the wishes of customers and thereby increase enterprise sales. The higher turnover is associated with growth of the economic performance of the company. This article deals with the measurement of economic performance of enterprises in connection with the implementation of SA 8000 certification. The basic approach lies in comparing the economic situation of the company before obtaining a certificate of social responsibility and after its implementation. A set of traditional and modern indicators is used for the measurement of economic performance.

Although prior studies suggest that financial and business reporting on the Internet is emerging, little is currently known about the use of the Web by listed companies for investor relations (IR) communication. This paper seeks to propose a multi-dimensional approach that measures web-based IR activities by considering not only the use of corporate website for information dissemination but also for communication directed at interactive dialogue. The proposed dimensions include content, design, timeliness, and interactivity. Importantly, this paper considers interactivity as one of the main measuring dimensions of IR activities on the Web, which has been overlooked in previous studies. Hence, this paper provides not only an update for the existing measuring dimensions of web-based IR but also insights into the use of interactive tools. This paper contributes in two principal ways. First, the paper introduces to the academic literature a four-dimensional framework (content, design, timeliness, and interactivity) for measuring the extent of IR on the Web. Second, the paper explores the potential of enhancing web interactivity with the investment community that certain tools can bring and integrate into a communication platform.

Findings indicate women are more likely to engage into business if their family matters are still can be prioritized, which is less likely to be a man issue. Meanwhile, men perceived innovation and risk taking activities are less likely to influence performance of their business than what women thought they should have to be. Further, it seemed more challenging for women to succeed in business without knowledge and skills competency compared to men. However, men found dealing with business malpractice posed a great challenge in business where women are less experienced with it.

It is simple to use and significantly outperforms other financial and macroeconomic indicators in predicting recessions two to six quarters ahead. The steepness of the yield curve should be an excellent indicator of a possible future economic activity. A rise in the short rate tends to flatten the yield curve as well as to slow real growth the near term. This paper aims to analyze the dependence between slope of the yield curve and an economic activity of countries of North America (Canada, Mexico, the United States of America) between the years 2000 and 2014. The slope of the yield curve can be measured as the yield spread between sovereign 10-year bonds and sovereign 3-month bonds. The natural and probably the most popular measure of economic growth is by GDP growth, taken quarterly. The results showed that the best predictive lags differ in each country and each time span we chose. The most common lags of spreads are lag 6 and 5 quarters. The results presented confirm that 10 year and 3-month yield spread has significant predictive power for real GDP growth. These findings can be beneficial for investors and provide further evidence of the potential usefulness of the yield curve spreads as indicators of the future economic activity.","[Hvozdenska, Jana; Kajurova, Veronika] Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Hvozdenská, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",174974@mail.muni.cz; vkajurova@seznam.cz,"Kajurova, Veronika/O-4739-2014; Hvozdenska, Jana/AAA-8859-2021","Hvozdenska, Jana/0000-0003-4379-7120",,,,,10,0,0,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,218,223,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200030,0

By applying Runge-Kutta method to established system, we obtain a fitted curve. Then, to get the access to the detailed propagation parameters, the curve obtained are further fitted with overall profile of epidemic situation as well as top three mostly-infected countries, through which the future propagation is more predictable. Finally, we introduce the comprehensive evaluation coefficient of effective cover efficiency xi. The result shows that when xi is 100%, the time of disease controlled is 13 weeks. And when xi is 0, the time of complete eradication of the disease is more than 50 weeks without any medical treatment.

The analysis uses a microsimulation model and survey data SILC 2011. The decline in government revenues from taxes due to these changes is estimated to be CZK 4.7 billion annually, with almost one third of the total budgetary costs (CZK 1.5 billion annually) going to families with children in the upper half of income distribution. The average household with more than one child would save approximately CZK 7,300 per year. While the poorest households with more children would gain on average only CZK 2,900 per year, wealthier households with more children would gain CZK 7,000 to 9,000 per year. There is a high share of low-educated and often single-earner households among the poorest households, who gain the least from This change. Increasing the child tax credit would also lead to an increase in the already very high tax differentials between men and women and differences in the taxation of childless people and married couples with children.","[Kaliskova, Klara] Charles Univ Prague, CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; Acad Sci Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech Academy of Sciences,"Kalísková, K (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic.",klara.kaliskova@cerge-ei.cz; daniel.munich@cerge-ei.cz,"Munich, Daniel/B-8891-2008; Kalíšková, Klára/H-2887-2014","Kalíšková, Klára/0000-0002-4762-086X",,,,,9,0,0,0,10,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

It allows addressing a key question regarding the perception of uncertainty in Russia: how sensitive are the economic agents to political trends? How robust is their assessment of the extent to which the rules of the game are changing, and what are the threshold levels of political change at which the uncertainty begins to affect economic decisions? Due to the sensitive nature of questions, a large-N randomized selection was not feasible, and we relied on a small sample of convenience. The study focuses on the case of Nizhny Novgorod region in Russia and is based on a survey of the owners and employees of small-and medium-size businesses. The data, collected in 2014 and 2015, provides tentative insights into the correspondence between political signals and local economic calculus in today's Russia. The study demonstrates that the local businesses are aware of the political costs, especially high levels of corruption and the general arbitrariness of power. They also appear to dismiss the probability of substantive changes in political status quo.","[Mitin, Dmitry] N Carolina State Univ, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Dept Polit Sci, Campus Box 8102, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Ginzburg, Maria; Yashina, Nadezhda] Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Inst Econ & Entrepreneurship, Finance & Credit Dept, Nizhnii Novgorod 603950, Russia",North Carolina State University; Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod,"Mitin, D (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Dept Polit Sci, Campus Box 8102, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",dmitin@ncsu.edu; ginzburg@iee.unn.ru; yashina@iee.unn.ru,"Yashina, Nadezhda/S-7469-2016",,,,,,25,2,2,0,4,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,391,399,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200052,0

The probability of an introduction into other European countries is high and could have catastrophic economic consequences, one reason being that there is currently no vaccination available. The goal of this project is to determine - for a country that produces and exports pork, such as Germany - which parts of the pork supply chain would experience losses as a consequence of an ASF outbreak and to estimate the economic losses such an outbreak would cause. Three types of scenarios and five cost categories were considered in this study. By using these types of costs in combination with a relational database system, it is possible to research various scenarios and to calculate the financial impact under a number of different conditions. The analyses show that a single outbreak of ASF in a German region with a high animal density would result in a total loss of over (sic) 670.8 million. With a second outbreak, the total loss would rise to approx. (sic) 893 million. These high losses are primarily the result of the expected drop in price for pork on the domestic market, the reduction of intra-EU deliveries and the reduction of exports to third countries.","[Naether, Maria; Theuvsen, Ludwig] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Näther, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",maria.naether@agr.uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,17,3,3,0,15,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,300,307,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600033,0

This concept is based on a situation with a contractor being more informed than the client. The asymmetry in information can be used by the contactor to skew unit prices in the ex ante bid and in order to enhance the ex post profit. This is done by increasing the unit price of a quantity that is expected to go up and lower the unit price of a quantity expected to decrease. Research regarding unbalanced bidding has to a large extent focused on models to assists clients in detecting and contractors in optimising the skew. There is also theoretical literature on efficiency losses of unbalanced bidding. The latter models show that it is rational for an informed contractor to raise unit prices on relative underestimated quantities. However, empirical studies that capture the magnitude of the problem are lacking. This paper sets out to fill that void. The analysis is based on a unique dataset of 15 Swedish road investments and 2 795 observations. Data consist of ex ante unit prices and quantities that are related to the final (ex post) quantities. By looking for a positive correlation between these variables and controlling for other affecting variables, the hypothesis of unbalanced bidding can be empirically tested. Along earlier studies on US data, this paper, using more project specific control variables concluded that the effect is even smaller or non-existent.

In the Czech Republic Government top strategic document - The Transport Policy of the Czech Republic for 2014-2020 with the Prospect of 2050, this issue is dealt with in the priority Social Issues, Employment, Education and Qualification. Transport policy and the related national level strategic and legislative documents set the targets and measures to achieve these targets, which imply risks and responsibilities for transport companies. The article presents a methodical advancement which enables to find risk factors to transport companies in the HR field, determines their significance and impact on the economic results of the company. Timely detection risk ability, importance assignment of individual risk factors and the subsequent division into risk groups will allow then to determine the appropriate measures that will help reduce the risk to a predetermined level or eliminate risk causes, and thus overall to reduce the enterprise risk, to enable flexible response to changing market conditions and to increase company competitiveness.

Furthermore, the implied volatility has varying volatility forecasting ability depending on the level of investor sentiment. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of volatility forecasting models based on option-implied information varies over time with the level of investor sentiment. We confirm the important role of investor sentiment in volatility forecasting models exploiting option-implied information with strong evidence from in-sample and out-of-sample analyses.

The first mentioned has introduced some programmes and activities to develop and strengthen mutual relations subsequently under the European Neighbourhood Policy umbrella and the Eastern Partnership more intensively. A relatively remarkable progress has been achieved when Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement was signed (even if still not ratified) as a unique sign of Ukrainian tendencies. On the other hand, Russia considers Ukraine as a part of its Near Abroad, sphere of its influence. Dissolution of Soviet Union has brought integration ambitions in post-soviet space, Ukraine included. This country also presented tendencies towards Moscow-led integration projects as Customs Union leading to the Eurasian Economic Union, later rejected. Since 2013 Ukraine has witnessed unprecedented crisis both domestically and diplomatically. Street protests have intensified and diffused countrywide and led to armed conflict.

Both the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and a powerful member of the Senate Banking Committee hailed from Missouri, which at the time was a solidly Democratic state. The committee charged with selecting cities for Reserve Banks and drawing the boundaries of Federal Reserve Districts claimed that its decisions were based solely on economic grounds, including existing banking and business ties, transportation and communications networks, and the convenience and preferences of the Fed's future member banks. Both St. Louis and Kansas City were among the top choices of bankers, many of whom had established correspondent relationships with banks in the two cities. St. Louis and Kansas City also served distinct markets-St. Louis to the south and east, and Kansas City to the west and southwest. Moreover, Kansas City dominated its rivals for a Reserve Bank serving western states, especially in terms of banker preferences and railroad connections.

Access to electricity is a marker for development but it is far from being universal in developing countries. The shortage of electricity is mainly the consequence of inability of governments in planning, financing, and developing necessary electricity infrastructure. In this context, investments from other actors can be essential. Particularly, we focus on the role of FDI and MNEs. We claim that when MNEs invest in developing countries, they are incentivized to solve the lack of electricity infrastructure mainly for two reasons: to guarantee their business activities and to gain legitimacy with their local stakeholders. In addition, we argue that MNEs and FDI from institutionally underdeveloped countries will be more prone to develop infrastructure for the provision of electricity to local population, as generally they suffer from a negative stereotype. For this study, we rely on 1,547 observations composed of pairs of 83 home countries and 15 host countries in sub-Saharan Africa, observed from 2005 to 2011. Due to the nature of the database, we adopt panel data techniques, i.e., system-GMM and corrected Least Square Dummy Variable estimators. We find that FDI promotes access to electricity in developing countries with weak institutions and this is more likely true when FDI come from institutionally underdeveloped countries. These results are far from obvious, as they controvert common idea among institutional scholars that a regulatory authority is essential in the provision of infrastructure. In conclusion, with this paper we partially rehabilitate the image of MNEs investing in developing countries, by demonstrating that under certain conditions they, could contribute to energy poverty alleviation of local population.

Beyond data availability, this research is complicated by the fact that the debit card provides two services for consumers - cash withdrawal and payment - that have contrasting effects on cash holdings and cash usage. Using micro-level data, we estimate the impacts of both services on the demand for cash by comparing the cash holdings and cash usage of three populations, namely non-cardholders, ATM-only cardholders, and debit cardholders. Controlling for various individual and network characteristics as well as a possible endogeneity issue, we find that the negative effect of the payment service on the demand for cash dominates the positive effect of the cash withdrawal service resulting in an overall negative impact of the debit card on the demand for cash.

Results show, based on stamp price, S&P 500, bond, and T-bill rate data over the period 1969 through 2013, that collectible stamps tend to underperform stocks and bonds on a risk-adjusted basis. Using estimates based on the Modigliani measure (M-2), it was determined that collectors incur an opportunity cost when selecting collectible stamps over more traditional investments. However, it is known that collecting as a hobby provides sociological and psychological benefits. This paper adds to the literature by illustrating how collecting also provides psychic return benefits that can be valued similarly to investment returns. In this study, the foregone return rate of stamp collecting for those who allocate a significant percent of available resources to their collection equates to between 3 and 13 % on an annual basis.","[Grable, John E.; Watkins, Kimberly] Univ Georgia, 205 Dawson Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Grable, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, 205 Dawson Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",grable@uga.edu; kimberly.watkins@uga.edu,"Grable, John/M-4791-2019","Grable, John/0000-0001-7093-8510",,,,,34,6,7,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Their successes and failures can suggest innovative social protection solutions for other countries. It seems that the 1999-2001 labor reforms and a three-year plan to increase the minimum wage intensified the recession's effects on unemployment. Probit models indicate that households coped with the recession's effects by increasing wives' labor supply but not by withdrawing children from schools.

Our results suggest that personality has meaningful predictive power in explaining bidding behavior but only for female subjects. Further, females also earn more than males and the gender gap in earnings is large and significant. Finally, personality indirectly affects earnings through the choice of strategies but has no direct effect on earnings, controlling for strategies.

Previous research from Anglo-Saxon countries implies that the social, political and economical interests of the voluntarily childless are in conflict with the interests of parents and that state subsidies and policies in support of parents could be considered as discrimination of childless people. However, in contrast to this previous research, the interviewees did not object to the redistributive tax system that benefits parents or to the political ambition to build a child-friendly labour market where it is possible to reconcile work with parenthood. Instead they defended themselves against accusations for being free-riders who did not contribute to society by referring to the responsibility they took by paying high taxes. Notwithstanding, the informants criticized how some parents misused their benefits and cashed in on them, making the voluntarily childless feel exploited. The article also suggests that state subsidies can eliminate some motives for voluntary childlessness but not all of them. The results add nuances to previous research as they highlight the importance of further investigating the relations between parents and non-parents in a social and political context.","[Peterson, Helen] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Sociol & Work Sci, Box 729, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Engwall, Kristina] FoU Sodertorn, Doktorsvagen 2, S-14730 Tumba, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Peterson, H (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Sociol & Work Sci, Box 729, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",helen.peterson@gu.se,"Peterson, Helen/GZL-2520-2022; Engwall, Kristina/AEI-3971-2022; Peterson, Helen/AAG-7476-2020","Peterson, Helen/0000-0002-5171-2783",,,,,96,7,7,4,27,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

A Cross-National Cohort Analysis,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,adult literacy; MDGs; cohort analysis; DHS,EDUCATION,"There is a potential disconnect between adult literacy initiatives on the one hand and the indicators typically employed to operationalize their targets and measure their progress on the other. Specifically, the policy discourse is typically framed in terms of illiterate adults becoming literate, while changes in the main indicator, the overall adult literacy rate, may instead be driven by literate youth becoming adults. The aim of this study is to quantify the relative contribution of these two factors (adult literacy acquisition and cohort replacement) in order to understand the extent to which the latter needs to be taken into account in assessing the progress achieved toward the Education for All (EFA) literacy target. Using DHS data on the education and measured (rather than self-reported) literacy status of women aged 20-49 for 30 countries to examine changes in literacy along cohort lines (while bounding the possible distortion due to migration and differential mortality), I demonstrate how much of the increase in the overall adult literacy rate is due to literate youth becoming adults, rather than illiterate adults becoming literate. The results show that in most countries, observed gains in overall adult literacy greatly overstate the degree to which adults have gained literacy at adult ages. Some countries do exhibit changes in literacy along cohort lines that cannot be easily attributed to selective migration or mortality and may indicate 'true gains or losses in individual literacy. The finding that the cohort effect is of large magnitude in practice has significant implications for research on and design of literacy policies: relying on an indicator that conflates two distinct goals, namely of increasing the share of literate adults and, of helping illiterate adults become literate, results in misleading policy conclusions. This affects both the retrospective assessment of policy success and failure (and its causes), and the prospective assessment of the challenges in meeting one size fits all literacy goals faced by countries with very different population dynamics. This insight is particularly timely given the opportunity presented by the beginning of the new Sustainable Development agenda to reconsider the monitoring of improvements in adult literacy around the globe.

The paper uses a variant of the aggregate shock model under the GARCH framework and investigates the effects of both return and volatility spillover from the US market to the BRICS markets and among the BRICS markets. The chronological order of trading among the six markets (US and five BRICS markets) is utilized in analyzing the transmission of information between the US and BRICS equity markets. The results suggest that the US stock market has a significant mean return and volatility spillover effects on the BRICS stock markets. In addition, the Chinese stock market exerts a significant mean spillover effects on both the Indian and the US stock markets, and the mean spillover effects from the Indian market to the Chinese market are equally strong. Further, overnight returns in the BRICS stock markets are significantly influenced by their own latest daytime returns. The results contribute to the extant spillover literature in demonstrating that the mean and volatility spillover effects exist not only from the US market to the well-developed equity markets of Europe and East Asia as shown in previous studies, but they also exist from the US market to the emerging equity markets of BRICS economies.","[Bhuyan, Rafiqul] Amer Univ Kuwait, Dept Finance, Coll Business & Econ, Kuwait, Kuwait; [Robbani, Mohammad G.; Jain, Ajeet] Alabama A&M Univ, Dept Accounting & Finance, Coll Business & Publ Affairs, Huntsville, AL USA; [Talukdar, Bakhtear] Univ Wisconsin Whitewater, Dept Finance & Business Law, Whitewater, WI USA",American University of Kuwait; Alabama A&M University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Whitewater,"Bhuyan, R (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Kuwait, Dept Finance, Coll Business & Econ, Kuwait, Kuwait.",rafiqulbhuyan@gmail.com,"Talukdar, Bakhtear/AAJ-4828-2021","Talukdar, Bakhtear/0000-0001-6650-8665",,,,,30,45,47,1,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Studies available at the regional level in Europe focus on ICT use by households. This paper sheds light on the digital divide by exploring the differences in ICT use across European regions, investigating simultaneously not only ICT use by households but also by firms. Using canonical correlation analysis, we first explore the existence of regional patterns of ICT use in Europe. Second, we test the influence of regional characteristics to explain ICT use by households and firms. Our results identify a first pattern defined by the regions that combine high levels of both ICT uses. This pattern is explained primarily by the quality of the regional government, knowledge-intensive services and economic development variables. A divide between southern and northern, and western and eastern regions is detected. We also identify a second pattern that captures ICT use by firms (not related to the first), predominantly determined by educational variables and some economic factors. This pattern does not exhibit the geographical digital divide found in the first. The findings show that there are synergies and regional factors explaining the use of ICT both at home and at work at the regional level in Europe that should be considered when designing public policy geared toward encouraging ICT diffusion.","[Billon, Margarita] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Struct & Dev Econ, Carretera Colmenar Viejo,Km 15 Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Lera-Lopez, Fernando] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Campus Arrosadia S-N, Pamplona 31006, Spain; [Marco, Rocio] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Appl Econ, Carretera Colmenar Viejo,Km 15 Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; Universidad Publica de Navarra; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Lera-Lopez, F (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Campus Arrosadia S-N, Pamplona 31006, Spain.",margarita.billon@uam.es; lera@unavarra.es; rocio.marco@uam.es,"MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/CAG-4979-2022; MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/L-3511-2013; MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/CAH-0724-2022; Billon, Margarita/L-2498-2013; Lera-Lopez, Fernando/J-4450-2016","MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/0000-0002-2854-9121; MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/0000-0002-2854-9121; MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/0000-0002-2854-9121; Billon, Margarita/0000-0003-4860-9133; Lera-Lopez, Fernando/0000-0002-9230-9405",,,,,83,21,22,5,39,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Most distinctions, eight and seven, were awarded in Cluj and Alba county, followed by Brasov, Suceava county, each with five distinctions. Discussions are held about the possibilities of granting life annuity, following the model of athletes and some artists and writers. It is clear however that the title holders and their performance can be assimilated to tourism assets, as attractions of itself, transforming communities they belong to genuine tourist destinations. Furthermore, it would avoid the exhausting movements of artisans at the various trade fairs, being preferable to receive the audience in their personal household tranquility. A series of semi structured personal interviews with some LHT confirm this hypothesis. Strong promotion of those tourist destinations should no longer delay. At the central level it would require that the Tourism Authority take the, dossiers for those LHT and promote them in a centralized manner, dedicating them an advertising brochure and a map.","[Lupu, Nicolae; Tanase, Mihail Ovidiu; Tudorache, Petronela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Lupu, N (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",nicolae.lupu@com.ase.ro,"Lupu, Nicolae/GXV-2393-2022; Tanase, Mihail Ovidiu/Q-2955-2016","Lupu, Nicolae/0000-0002-0999-6874; Tanase, Mihail Ovidiu/0000-0002-7101-2485",,,,,13,1,2,1,10,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2016,18.0,,,,10,,757,766,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ED1SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388624700003,0

We present a model where banks actively manage their portfolio risk by buying and selling credit protection. We show that anticipation of future risk management opportunities allows banks to operate with riskier balance sheets. However, since they are better insulated from shocks than banks without active risk management, they are less prone to insolvency. Empirical evidence from US bank holding companies broadly supports the theoretical predictions. In particular, we find that active risk management banks were less likely to become insolvent during the crisis of 2007-2009, even though their balance sheets displayed higher risk-taldng. These results provide an important message for bank regulation, which has mainly focused on balance-sheet risks when assessing financial stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Land endowment has generally been measured in terms of area without much consideration to variation in the qualities of land at the level of village territories. Building from work on the variation of soil fertility, this paper considers the potential relationship between soil fertility variation and wealth inequality within rural communities in Sahelian West Africa. The management history, yields, and characteristics (livestock and land wealth, labor, tenure security, cropped area) of the households managing and owning 181 sampled fields within two village territories in southwestern Niger are analyzed to evaluate the relative importance of land area and soil fertility in affecting the ability of households to produce food and the factors that affect household investments into soil fertility. Soil fertility variation is found to play a major role in the crop production achieved in the study area. This variation results in part from contemporary and historic investments by farmers largely through manure application. Manuring rates are found not to be affected by the extent of land owned or managed nor by the security of land tenure. Instead, these investments are determined by livestock wealth, the major store of wealth in rural parts of the Sahel. These findings point to a major mechanism for increased inequality in areas where subsistence cropping prevails-a mechanism that is mediated through soil fertility variation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We document which blockholder types (e.g., mutual funds, hedge funds) are more likely to be associated with active monitoring and show that firms targeted by such blockholders are more likely to increase the equity portion of chief executive officer (CEO) pay. Further, using market-wide and exogenous shocks to liquidity to identify differences in efficacy across blockholder types, we observe greater operating-performance improvements in actively monitored firms when passive monitoring is less effective, suggesting causal impact. We propose differences in compensation arrangements across blockholder types as a mechanism underlying blockholders' heterogeneous role.","[Clifford, Christopher P.] Univ Kentucky, Gatton Coll Business & Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Lindsey, Laura] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",University of Kentucky; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Clifford, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, Gatton Coll Business & Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",chris.clifford@uky.edu; laura.lindsey@asu.edu,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019",,,,,,79,26,31,1,45,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

Yet the valence of these discussions has focused almost entirely on the character of citizen engagement itself, with little attention to the ways in which citizens' agency is constituted in relation to changing forms of public authority. In this paper, I advance a theoretical account of political representation, a concept that is central to analysis of democracy, but which has seen only limited attention in the scholarship on democratic decentralization. I draw on two contrasting models selection and sanction to elaborate an understanding of representation that recognizes both mechanisms that enable citizens to hold their leaders to account as well as the character of leaders' own intrinsic motivations. Through a qualitative account of three decades' political change from a locality in the Indian Himalayas, I document a gradual process of institutional and social change that has enabled a new generation of more diverse elected leaders to ascend to positions of elected authority, including many from historically marginalized sections of society. By examining the experiences of three such individuals in detail, I demonstrate the importance of understanding who leaders are and what they do their skills and aspirations, their identity and affiliations, and the kinds of representative relationships that they embody. Placing the selection and sanction models in dialog reveals new and productive avenues to explore the interplay between external incentive structures and leaders' intrinsic motivations in shaping broader process of political change.

An assumption that is not properly appreciated in the relevant literature is that the competency of the group members is assumed to be exogenous. In numerous applications, members of the group make investments to improve the accuracy of their decision making (e.g., pre-meeting efforts). We consider the collective action problem that arises. We show that if individual competence is endogenous, then increases in the group size encourages free riding. This trades off with the value of information aggregation. Thus, the value of the larger group size is muted. Extensions illustrate that if committee members are allowed to exit/not participate, the equilibrium committee size is reduced. Additionally, supermajority voting rules encourage investments and, consequently, individual competence.","[McCannon, Bryan C.; Walker, Paul] West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University,"McCannon, BC (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",bryan.c.mccannon@gmail.com; prwalker@mix.wvu.edu,,,,,,,59,9,10,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2016,169.0,1-2,,,,,1,18,,10.1007/s11127-016-0366-z,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DZ9CG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386170200001,0

This paper tests for the existence of discrimination in the French rental market against individuals with names which signal their connection to five immigrant groups (Northern Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Turkey, Poland, Portugal-Spain) by implementing an online field study using one of France's largest online advertisements website. The results show that applicants with foreign sounding names coming from Northern Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and Turkey are 16 to 22 percentage points less likely to receive a response than applicants with French names or names associated with Poland, Portugal or Spain. In addition, when applicants with foreign sounding names from any origin receive a response, it is significantly more likely to be negative or include a request for more information than responses to emails including French sounding names. Finally, we find some geographic differences in response rate differentials that are correlated with differences in the local income and share of immigrants. This provides evidence that landlords use names as a proxy for economic and other sociodemographic characteristics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This paper examines the geographical pattern of this great rebalancing. Specifically, we test whether euro area and non-euro area investors adjusted their holdings of debt securities of euro area stressed and non stressed countries disproportionately relative to benchmarks derived from a standard gravity model for portfolio choice. We find that non-euro area investors under-invested in stressed euro area countries, but did not over-invest in non-stressed euro area countries. As regards intra-euro area flows, we do not find evidence for a disproportionate slowdown of capital flows from non-stressed into stressed euro area countries. Instead, our results suggest that investors in stressed euro area countries disproportionately shifted capital into debt securities of non-stressed euro area countries. Finally, we find that both non-euro area investors' under-investment in stressed countries and stressed euro area investors' over-investment in non-stressed euro area countries ceased after the announcement of the ECB's OMT programme.

We next investigate possible influences of various risk management measures on the firms' foreign exchange exposure. Risk management variables include financial and operational hedging, the invoice currency choice, and the price revision strategy (pass-through) of 227 listed firms in 2009, which were collected from a questionnaire survey of Japanese firms listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Our main findings are as follows: First, firms with greater dependency on sales in foreign markets have greater foreign exchange exposure, judged by the market. Second, the higher the US dollar invoicing share, the greater the foreign exchange exposure is, which can be reduced by both financial and operational hedging. Third, yen invoicing reduces foreign exchange exposure. These findings indicate that Japanese firms use a combination of risk management tools to mitigate the degree of exchange rate risk.

This includes evidence on the distribution of medical spending, the dependence ofmedical spending on age and other demographic characteristics, its persistence, and how medical spending evolves in the years before death. Our main findings are that health care spending more than doubles between ages 50 and 80 and that spending is very concentrated: the top 10 per cent of all spenders are responsible for 53 per cent of all medical spending in a given year. There is a 50 per cent probability that individual expenditures lie in the same quintile of the distribution after five years, for both very-high- and very-low-cost individuals. Medical spending in the year of death is six times higher for the deceased than for everybody else in that year and accounts for 7.9 per cent of lifetime spending. Females use more office-based care and have higher spending at younger ages, whereas males have higher spending at older ages, particularly for hospital care, and die younger. The presentation of these empirical facts is framed by an institutional discussion of the German health care system, a comparison between publicly-and privately-insured individuals, and a discussion of medical spending trends in aggregate-level data.","[Karlsson, Martin] Univ Duisburg Essen, CINCH, Duisburg, Germany; [Karlsson, Martin; Ziebarth, Nicolas R.] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Karlsson, Martin] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway; [Klein, Tobias J.] Tilburg Univ, Netspar, CentER, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Ziebarth, Nicolas R.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Ziebarth, Nicolas R.] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Oslo; Tilburg University; Cornell University; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Karlsson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, CINCH, Duisburg, Germany.;Karlsson, M (通讯作者)，IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany.;Karlsson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway.",martin.karlsson@uni-due.de; T.J.Klein@uvt.nl; nrz2@cornell.edu,"Ziebarth, Nicolas Robert/A-2812-2012","Ziebarth, Nicolas Robert/0000-0003-3562-2371; Klein, Tobias/0000-0001-7724-3260",,,,,53,17,19,1,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

With these features, an increase in uncertainty resembles an aggregate demand shock because it increases unemployment and lowers inflation. Using a new empirical measure of uncertainty based on the Michigan survey and a VAR model, we show that these theoretical patterns are consistent with US data. Using a calibrated DSGE model, we show that combining search frictions and nominal rigidities can match the qualitative VAR pattern and account for about 70 percent of the empirical increase in unemployment following an uncertainty shock.

This makes it difficult to compare price changes in the export market with the first-hand price of cod. All first-hand sales of cod in Norway are organized through sales organizations that are entitled to set minimum prices. New legislation states that the minimum price should be market-based. In this study, we use Lewbel's (1996) Generalized Composite Commodity Theorem (GCCT) as an empirical test of whether all seven product forms of cod can be aggregated into a representative price index. We find that the first-hand price of cod is cointegrated with the price index, forming a stable long-term relationship. In addition, we find weak evidence that price signals go from the first-hand price to the export market price. Cod prices are driven by supply. Finally, we find that there is asymmetry in the transmission of these price changes. A positive change in the first-hand price is almost twice as large as a negative price change, indicating that market prices rise twice as fast as the price declines. These findings are important for the whole whitefish industry in terms of price policy settings.

We also find that the average effect of the dividend remains unchanged for any constant annual rate of population growth, that contributors who reach retirement age always get a higher return than the scheme does, and that population growth enables cohorts with more years of contributions to benefit to a greater extent from the dividend effect.","[Vidal-Melia, Carlos] Univ Valencia, Dept Financial Econ & Actuarial Sci, Valencia, Spain; [del Carmen Boado-Penas, Maria] Univ Liverpool, IFAM, Dept Math Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Navarro-Cabo, Francisco] Towers Watson Espana SA, Dept Benefits Retirement, Madrid, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Liverpool,"Boado-Penas, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, IFAM, Dept Math Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",Carmen.Boado@liverpool.ac.uk,"VIDAL-MELIA, CARLOS/AAH-9010-2020","VIDAL-MELIA, CARLOS/0000-0002-7227-5076; Boado Penas, Carmen/0000-0002-0643-4921","Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-36,685]; European Union [318984-RARE]",Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); European Union(European Union (EU)),"Maria del Carmen Boado-Penas and Carlos Vidal-Melia are grateful for the financial assistance received from the Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness (project ECO2012-36,685).

This paper provides a contribution to the debate, starting wiGth an endogenous growth model and extending it to account for the effects of corruption on components of government spending, namely military and investment spending. It then illustrates the non-negligible indirect effects of corruption on military spending and government investment expenditure using model simulations. The resulting model is then estimated on a comprehensive panel of 106 countries and the results show that the interactions between corruption and investment and corruption and military spending have strong negative impacts on economic growth. The results also indicate important complementarities between corruption and military spending, suggesting that combating corruption will not only have direct positive effects, but is also likely to have positive indirect effects, through reducing the size of the negative impact of the military burden. They are also found to be robust across different measures of corruption, levels of economic development and groupings of countries. This suggests that policies to reduce corruption, combined with those to reduce military burdens, such as regional security agreements, would have a considerable impact on economic growth.

Student in grades four and seven served as the control group and continued to obtain their lunches through the normal lunch line.

In addition, we find the nudge had a statistically significant positive effect in addition to the effect of pre-ordering; students who received the MyPlate nudge while pre-ordering selected statistically significantly more fruits, vegetables, and low-fat milk than students who pre-ordered without nudging.

A positive association was also found between the growth of PIB per capita level and the increase of income inequality in the examined countries.","[Neagu, Olimpia; Dumiter, Florin; Braica, Alexandra] Vasile Goldis Western Univ Arad, Arad, Romania",Vasile Goldis Western University of Arad,"Dumiter, F (通讯作者)，Vasile Goldis Western Univ Arad, Arad, Romania.",fdumiter@yahoo.com,"Neagu, Olimpia/AAD-9525-2019; Dumiter, Florin Cornel/G-9398-2015","Dumiter, Florin Cornel/0000-0002-1043-238X",,,,,59,9,9,1,29,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2016,18.0,43,,,,,557,574,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DU5MP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382256100006,0

For identification, we use the exogenous shock to the Brazilian banking system caused by the international turmoil of 2008 that sparked a run on small and medium banks toward systemically important banks. We find that a reduction in liquidity causes banks to strongly decrease their loan supply, whereas a positive liquidity shock has a small (if any) effect on the loan supply. Our evidence shows that this asymmetric effect of liquidity on the loan supply occurs both at the intensive and the extensive margins. Our findings are consistent with the theories that predict that borrowers face switching costs and that banks tend to hold on to liquidity during periods of systemic uncertainty.

We analyze local sewage treatment policies in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The Brazilian Constitution divides the mandates related to the control of water pollution. It gives the mayors of municipalities the control of local sanitation services while the governor of the state of Sao Paulo is responsible for the quality of water bodies (watersheds and rivers). As a result, the state government and municipalities have conflicting objectives. The former is committed to water environmental protection while the latter do not internalize the externalities associated with dumping raw sewage that affect neighboring municipalities. In this paper, we argue that informal arrangements between state and local authorities play a key role in addressing this principal agent problem or moral hazard issue. Given that constitutional debates have failed to set up a regulatory framework, the de facto solution is a more informal type of regulation anchored in the political leverage of the governor. In particular, the hierarchy within a political party allows the governor to provide aligned mayors with tailored incentives to improve local sanitation infrastructure. As a result, aligned municipalities should, on average, allocate more resources to sewage treatment. Relying on difference-in-differences estimations, we establish a causal relationship between political alignment and higher sewage treatment provision. We find that sewage treatment provision is between 18% and 46% higher in municipalities in which the mayor is aligned with the governor of the state of Sao Paulo. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that stock short selling activities decrease (increase) significantly after Rule 203 (Rule 202T) implementation, supporting the validity of Rule 203 (Rule 202T) as an exogenous increase (decrease) in short-sale constraints. Options volume increases significantly after Rule 203 went into effect and the result is more pronounced among firms with lower levels of institutional ownership and smaller options bid-ask spreads. Therefore, the evidence from Rule 203 suggests that investors may use options as substitutes for stock short sales when short selling is less feasible or more costly due to the locate and delivery requirements. In contrast, we find no significant change in the options trading volume of pilot stocks during the pilot program of Rule 202T. Overall, our results indicate that the impact of short-sale constraints on options trading varies with the types of constraints affected.","[Li, Yubin; Zhao, Chen] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accounting, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Zhaodong] Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Business Sch, Dept Finance & Econ, 100 Rockafeller Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Zhong, ZD (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Business Sch, Dept Finance & Econ, 100 Rockafeller Rd, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.",zdzhong@business.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

To match our theoretical predictions, we consider different types of property crime (larceny, burglary, motor vehicle theft, and robbery) and broad and narrow definitions of inflation separately. We control for the state of the business cycle and demographic changes over time explicitly. Unobserved or difficult-to-measure determinants of property crime are captured through a stochastic-trend specification within a state-space framework. We find a robust statistical link between inflation and each of the four property crime rates. Our findings are robust to alternative definitions of inflation and the inclusion or exclusion of different control variables. In terms of policy, our findings suggest that monetary policy that creates inflation has costly spillover effects.","[Nunley, John M.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA; [Stern, Michael L.; Seals, Richard A.] Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Zietz, Joachim] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA",University of Wisconsin System; Auburn University System; Auburn University; Middle Tennessee State University,"Nunley, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, La Crosse, WI 54601 USA.",jnunley@uwlax.edu; sternml@auburn.edu; ras0029@auburn.edu; joachim.zietz@mtsu.edu,,"Seals, Alan/0000-0002-2191-3154; Zietz, Joachim/0000-0001-8874-5370",,,,,44,7,7,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

Drawing on longitudinal field based quasi-experimental survey data, we estimate the causal effect of the project on the use of modern farming techniques and production, household assets and food security, and child education, health and nutrition. Mixed-methods include multiple rounds of focus groups with farmers, key informant interviews with community leaders, and project monitoring farmer diaries. Treatment farmers showed increased use of modern farming techniques and improved production, households experienced greater access to food, and while no significant changes were found for children, for the outcomes of interest, treatment children outcomes trended in the positive direction. The evaluation suggests that participation in agricultural value chain interventions contributes to positive farm outcomes and social assets, but economic-focused activities alone are insufficient to improve children's lives. Since improving the lives of children from birth is critical to breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty, economic strengthening programs like value chain interventions, must monitor their effects on children: to do no harm and to identify and take advantage of opportunities to improve the lives of children.

Using this decision as a unique natural experiment, we examine the causal relation between political connections and firm valuation. We find that the value of firms with politically connected directors drops significantly upon the announcements of the new rule and the resulting director resignations. Furthermore, the decline in valuation is more pronounced when a firm is in a regulated industry, and when a departing director is of vital importance for building and maintaining political connections. Moreover, non-state-owned enterprises suffer more loss of value than their state-owned peers following the resignations of politically-connected directors. Finally, firms exhibit insignificant value loss when their departing directors are of less political importance in allocating resources. These results suggest that hiring politically connected directors has a positive effect on firm valuation in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The three mechanisms compared are the World Wildlife Fund for Nature's fishery improvement project model, Marine Stewardship Council certification, and the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation Pro Active Vessel Register. The main question addressed in this paper is how and to what extent the private incentive mechanisms support the development of fisher capabilities to respond to the requirements set out by these mechanisms. Applying a global value chain approach to analyze results collected from key actors involved in Philippine tuna fishers contributing to both domestic and regional economic development in the Western Pacific, we explore the structure and function of these private incentive mechanisms in achieving both environmental and economic development outcomes. Our results show that these private incentive mechanisms deliver different direct and indirect incentives for changing to more sustainable fishing practices, and that the success of these mechanisms is dependent on the extent to which the mechanisms support the development of target fisher capabilities to comply with their sustainability requirements. We conclude that the future success of these incentive mechanisms depends for a large part on stricter sustainability requirements, but also on the capacity of the mechanisms to incentivize the inclusion of more developing country fishers. These findings contribute to a wider understanding of how the capabilities of developing country producers are influenced by their relationship with chain and non chain actors, and with the wide institutional arrangements that the producers operate in.

Consistent with this prediction, we find that ex ante contracted severance pay is positively associated with proxies for a CEO's risk of dismissal and costs the CEO would incur from dismissal. Additionally, we show that the contracted severance payment amount is positively associated with CEO risk taking and the extent to which a CEO invests in projects that have a positive NPV. Overall, our findings imply that ex ante severance pay contracts are consistent with efficient contracting.","[Cadman, Brian D.] Univ Utah, Eccles Sch Business, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Campbell, John L.] Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Athens, GA 30606 USA; [Klasa, Sandy] Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Arizona,"Klasa, S (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",brian.cadman@business.utah.edu; johnc@uga.edu; sklasa@eller.arizona.edu,,,,,,,47,21,25,0,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

We find that a firm's leverage is lower when a larger proportion of its revenue is derived from CDS-referenced customers. This finding is robust to alternative samples and measures, placebo tests, and the selection of customers by suppliers. Moreover, firms affected by customer CDS trading issue equity to lower leverage, and their equity issuance costs are lower. These findings are consistent with the view that CDS trading on customers improves the information environment for suppliers. Therefore, while many firms are not directly linked to CDS trading, CDS trading on their customers has spillover effects on these firms' financial policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The paper exploits exogenous variation in the tax treatment of debt and equity created by the introduction of a tax shield for equity. The results demonstrate that a more equal treatment of debt and equity increases bank capital ratios, driven by an increase in common equity. The change also leads to a significant reduction in risk taking for ex-ante low capitalized banks.

In this paper, we use two retrospective series of the EVI, based on constant definitions. The real change in vulnerability is thus isolated from the impact of revisions in the design of the index, allowing comparison of the evolution of LDCs and non-LDCs.

Consistent with previous studies, we find an elasticity of average establishment earnings with respect to metropolitan area population of 0.03, controlling for the endogeneity of location and establishment and metropolitan area characteristics. More importantly, we find that the estimated density premium is realized almost entirely at entry and is constant over an establishment's life. We find little evidence that the endogenous entry or exit of establishments can account for any of the estimated density premium.

First, we use copulas to estimate the systemic risk contribution and systemic risk sensitivity based on CDS spreads of European banks from 2005 to 2014. We then run panel regressions for our systemic risk measures using idiosyncratic bank characteristics and country control variables. Our results comprise highly significant drivers of systemic risk in the European banking sector and have important implications for bank regulation. We argue that banks which receive state aid and have risky loan portfolios as well as low amounts of available liquid funds contribute most to systemic risk, whereas relatively poorly equity equipped banks, mainly engaged in traditional commercial banking with strong ties to the local private sector, headquartered in highly indebted countries are most sensitive to systemic risk.

We show that when policy risk is low and there is a high probability that the market will recover subsequent to government intervention, the optimal solution is for investors to make investments.

Three theoretical findings are presented: (i) competitive models yield predictions only for the extensive product margin; (ii) countries continuously diversify their production and exports-a major controversy in the empirical literature; and (iii) causality runs from diversification to GDP per capita, and not the other way around. The theoretical analysis also provides indication for the appropriateness of alternative measures of diversification, and enables estimating the relationship to economic development in a gravity-type parametric specification. Using detailed data on countries' exports, the case of re-specialization is rejected. Inference of causality reveals some evidence for GDP per capita affecting the level of diversification, but stronger support for diversification affecting GDP per capita. Generally, both variables are highly endogenous as they are both driven by the technology parameters in standard models of economic growth and international trade.","[Mau, Karsten] Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg,"Mau, K (通讯作者)，Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",karsten.mau@leuphana.de,,,,,,,47,30,32,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

A State authority, the Urban Land Development Authority (ULDA), took planning control away from local councils in selected areas in order to increase the speed and scale of development in those areas, in the process increasing land values. Using micro-level relationship data from multiple sources, we compare the relationship-network characteristics of landowners of comparable sites inside and outside the ULDA areas, finding that 'connected' landowners owned 75% of land inside the rezoned areas, and only 12% outside, capturing $410 million in land value gains out of the total $710 million from rezoning. We also find that engaging a professional lobbyist is a substitute for having one's own connections. Scaling up from our sample of six rezoned areas to the hundreds of rezoning decisions across Queensland and Australia in the last few decades, suggests that many billions of dollars of economic rent are being regularly transferred from the general population to connected landowners through political rezoning decisions.

The debt policy in the initial year of operation is a very important determinant of future debt policies, even after controlling for traditional contemporaneous determinants. The founder-CEO has an important impact on the stability of debt policies: the influence of initial debt policies on future debt policies is significantly reduced when the founder-CEO is replaced or when (s)he dies.

Traditional methods of data collection are expensive, time consuming, and lack spatial and temporal detail. New sources have emerged as a result of crowdsourced data from fitness apps, allowing cyclists to track routes using GPS enabled cell phones. Our goal is to determine if crowdsourced data from fitness apps data can be used to quantify and map the spatial and temporal variation of ridership. Using data provided by Strava.com, we quantify how well crowdsourced fitness app data represent ridership through comparison with manual cycling counts in Victoria, British Columbia. Comparisons are made for hourly, AM and PM peak, and peak period totals that are separated by season. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and a Generalized Linear Model we modelled the relationships between crowdsourced data from Strava and manual counts and predicted categories of ridership into low, medium, and high for all roadways in Victoria. Our results indicate a linear association (r(2) 0.40 to 0.58) between crowdsourced data volumes and manual counts, with one crowdsourced data cyclist representing 51 riders. Categorical cycling volumes were predicted and mapped using data on slope, traffic speeds, on street parking, time of year, and crowdsourced ridership with a predictive accuracy of 62%.

Recent scholarship describes such projects as symptomatic of a broader liberalization of global governance. However, few studies investigate how such liberal governance is applied on the ground in host countries. This paper fills this need by examining one such case in Sierra Leone, and describing the various technologies of control deployed to make local land legible to the corporate eye and therefore manageable within the liberal model. As I show, such imported technologies are disrupting and displacing traditional modes of authority and allowing the company concerned to apply power and manage both the land and the local people. At the same time, however, these technologies generate frictions on the ground, creating dangerous tensions between the various actors in the local setting.","[Millar, Gearoid] Univ Aberdeen, Dept Sociol, Edward Wright Bldg, Aberdeen AB24 3ND, Scotland; [Millar, Gearoid] Univ Aberdeen, ICTPR, Edward Wright Bldg, Aberdeen AB24 3ND, Scotland",University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen,"Millar, G (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Dept Sociol, Edward Wright Bldg, Aberdeen AB24 3ND, Scotland.;Millar, G (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, ICTPR, Edward Wright Bldg, Aberdeen AB24 3ND, Scotland.",g.millar@abdn.ac.uk,,"Millar, Gearoid/0000-0002-0069-9742",Faculty of Management at Radboud University Nijmegen,Faculty of Management at Radboud University Nijmegen,"I would like to thank the Faculty of Management at Radboud University Nijmegen for funding the 6 months of fieldwork on which this paper is based, and the three peer reviewers for extremely helpful comments.",,67,23,28,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We find evidence of a simultaneous relation between systemic risk exposure and sovereign debt yields. This suggests that models of sovereign debt yields should also include the systemic risk of a country's financial system in order to avoid potentially important mis-specification errors. We find evidence that systemic risk of a country's financial institutions and the risk of sovereign governments are inter-related and shocks to these domestic linkages are stronger and longer lasting than international risk spillovers. Thus, the channel in which domestic sovereign debt yields can be affected by another nation's sovereign debt is mostly an indirect one in that shocks to a foreign country's government finances are transmitted to that country's financial system which, in turn, can spill over to the domestic financial system and, ultimately, have a destabilizing effect on the domestic sovereign debt market.

In a choice experiment, Sudanese farmers are asked to pay an increase in existing irrigation fees to secure future irrigation water availability by either enhancing the removal of sediments in their local irrigation channels or compensating farmers in the Ethiopian highlands for taking soil conservation measures to prevent land degradation and soil erosion. Although Sudanese farmers downstream do not feel very connected to farmers upstream in Ethiopia, we find a high degree of trust in international cooperation and a positive WTP for improved irrigation water supply and water use efficiency through transboundary collaboration.","[Tesfaye, Abonesh; Brouwer, Roy] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Tesfaye, A; Brouwer, R (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",abonesh.tesfaye@gmail.com; roy.brouwer@vu.nl,"Brouwer, Roy/M-9437-2013","Brouwer, Roy/0000-0002-0525-2050",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO-WOTRO),Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO-WOTRO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This study was financed by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO-WOTRO) and is part of the project 'In search of sustainable catchments and basin wide solidarities; transboundary water management of the Blue Nile river basin' coordinated by UNESCO-IHE.

Under asymmetric and uncertain costs of civil conflicts members of the elite would like to commit in advance to a strong response to insurgencies, but ex-post they have the incentives to block any response if the conflict mainly affects other members of the elite. One way of solving this commitment problem is empowering the executive so he may react forcefully to conflicts, despite the opposition of some fraction of the elite. The main prediction is that, conditional on asymmetric and uncertain costs, the higher is the likelihood of a conflict in the future, the lower are the constraints imposed on the executive. The paper validates this implication using a sample of former colonies and geographic variables to identify the exogenous component of the likelihood of conflicts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate multivariate difference-in-differences regression models that compare changes in the outcomes for new California parents before and after the enactment of CA-PFL to those for corresponding parents in control states. Our results suggest that CA-PFL raised leave use by almost fiveweeks for the average covered mother and two to three days for the corresponding father. Maternal leave-taking appears to increase in the quarter before the birth and to extend through the two quarters after it. Paternal leave-taking rises fairly quickly after the birth and is short-lasting. Rights to paid leave are also associated with higher work and employment probabilities for mothers nine to 12 months after birth, probably because they increase job continuity among those with relatively weak labor force attachments. We also find positive effects of California's program on hours and weeks of work during their child's second year of life.

Results suggest that household debt is positively associated with greater depressive symptoms. However, this association appears to be driven by short-term (unsecured) debt; we found little evidence of associations with depressive symptoms for mid-or long-term debt. The link between short-term debt and depressive symptoms persisted with alternative estimation strategies, including defining debt in absolute and relative terms. Furthermore, this association was particularly concentrated among 51-64 year-old adults, those with a high school education or less, and those who were not stably married throughout the observation period. These findings suggest that short-term debt may have an adverse influence on psychological wellbeing, particularly for those who are less educated, approaching retirement age, or unmarried.","[Berger, Lawrence M.] Univ Wisconsin, Inst Res Poverty, Sch Social Work, 3420 William H Sewell Social Sci Bldg, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Collins, J.

In this study, we explore the influence of recommendations made by others with whom consumers have different degrees of familiarity on the cognitive processes of online shopping using event-related potentials (ERPs). Sixteen healthy university subjects were recruited for 2 experiment tasks. These subjects viewed a stimulus sequence of pictures of certain products that contained either recommendations from individuals with whom they had low familiarity or no recommendation. Several days later, they viewed the other stimulus sequence of the same product pictures but this time with either recommendations from individuals with whom they had high familiarity or no recommendation. Electroencephalogram data were recorded during the experiment. Compared to having no recommendations, the results showed that the ERP components N2 and P3 evoked by recommendations were different: The recommendations from low-familiarity individuals induced the largest average amplitude of N2, and the recommendations from high-familiarity individuals induced the largest average amplitude of P3. The results suggest that N2 reflects the process of identifying the recommendation information, and P3 reflects consumers' propensity to purchase recommended products, or the cognitive process of selection based on value measurement. These findings indicate that recommendations may impact consumer responses and highlight the importance of careful consideration of social preferences in marketing.","[Guo, Fu; Zhang, Xuefeng; Ding, Yi; Wang, Xueshuang] Northeastern Univ, Sch Business Adm, 11,Lane 3,Wenhua Rd, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xuefeng] Liaoning Tech Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Liaoning, Peoples R China",Northeastern University - China; Liaoning Technical University,"Zhang, XF (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Sch Business Adm, 11,Lane 3,Wenhua Rd, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China.",zhangxuefengnue@gmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71471033, 71171041]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 71471033 and Grant 71171041).

Based on a sample from January 1, 1996 to May 31, 2010, our tests show robust evidence that the S&P 500 options market is not efficient. By examining the subsamples before and after the 2008 financial crisis, we find this options market inefficiency is mainly driven by the outbreak of the subprime crisis. Our diagnostic tests further indicate that this inefficiency is due to the skewness-in-mean effect of forward variance. Specifically, the skewness-in-mean effect is weakened once we account for the S&P 500 index jump effects. Hence, we can establish a link between jumps and options market inefficiency. Finally, we find that the lagged skewness of the forward variance can help forecasting the forward variance both in sample and out-of-sample. The economic significance of this forecasting ability is further highlighted by the performance of a trading strategy based on forward variance. In sum, out study provides robust evidence and a trading implication on testing the S&P 500 options market efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

That is, when confronted with a large number of options, individuals often choose the first acceptable option, rather than the best possible option (Simon, 1957).

A new class of accessibility models is derived in accordance with the above definition, exploiting the strengths of both utility-based and opportunity-based models, and explicitly incorporating spatiotemporal constraints which may limit the availability of perceived opportunities. The proposed model is formulated for both active and passive accessibility, does not suffer from reflexivity issues, supports both trip based and activity-based formulations, and scales up from individual to spatially aggregated opportunities, taking into account effectively the different ways of perceiving opportunities. Moreover, the resulting accessibility measure has a straightforward interpretation, being expressed in physical units, and is comparable across different locations. Performances of the proposed model in reproducing the active accessibility to cinemas in the Naples metropolitan area (Italy) are compared to those of a traditional isochrone-based measure and a distance-decay model. For this aim, measurements of individuals' perceived cinemas were gathered through a survey, and adopted for the calibration of both the accessibility models. Calibration results show that the proposed model outperforms both the traditional isochrone-based measure and a distance-decay model calibrated against the same dataset, better reproducing both the quantity and spatial distribution of perceived opportunities.

We use the auditor's explanatory language to partition MAOs into Inconsistency opinions, resulting from an accounting change or a restatement; and Inadequacy opinions, arising from a material uncertainty or a going concern (GC) opinion. Using the loan contracts of firms with MAOs, we find that, compared with loans issued in the year after a clean opinion, loans issued in the year after an MAO are associated with higher interest spreads (17 basis points on average), fewer financial covenants, more general covenants, smaller loan sizes, and a higher likelihood of requiring collateral. We find that the effect on loan spreads (as well as on other non-price terms) varies by the type of MAO, ranging from no effect for an accounting change to an average increase of 107 basis points for a GC opinion.

Consequently, the covariance between firm-specific and market cash flow news spikes around announcements, making announcers especially risky. Consistent with our hypothesis, announcer returns forecast aggregate earnings. The announcement premium is persistent across stocks, and early (late) announcers earn higher (lower) returns.

We build a model combining Transaction Cost Economics and Property Rights Theory to describe the tradeoff that foreign investors face between choosing a larger share ratio and a smaller one. We argue that when the contractual hazard increases, foreign investors request larger shares to avoid being held up by their domestic partners, and when the political hazard increases, they hold smaller shares to circumvent the local government's grabbing hand. Moreover, the effect of the contractual hazard is channeled through enterprises' asset specificity. These theoretical predictions are verified by studying the relationship between the ownership structure of Chinese manufacturing joint-venture enterprises and the provincial-level institutions they are embedded in.","[Zhang, Yuxiao; Jiang, Ting; Nie, Huihua] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Fang, Mingyue] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Capital University of Economics & Business,"Nie, HH (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",niehuihua@vip.163.com,"Fang, Mingyue/JWA-3746-2024","Nie, Huihua/0000-0002-8850-0637",Outstanding Innovative Talents Cultivation Funded Programs of Renmin University of China; National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals,Outstanding Innovative Talents Cultivation Funded Programs of Renmin University of China; National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals,Financial support is provided by the Outstanding Innovative Talents Cultivation Funded Programs 2014 of Renmin University of China for Yuxiao Zhang and the National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals for Huihua Nie.,,22,8,8,5,46,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This paper should compare results gained by several dozens models which were created in transition economies (Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Baltic states) after economic-political shift at the end of 1980's. Verification is performed on financial accounting data of Czech enterprises therefore Czech models present national approach. The models from other economies are examples of non-national approaches in this case. Methodology/methods The necessary step is a quality review of literature because transition models have to be detected not only by their names but also by their formulas and recommendations for practical use. The verification of the selected models predicting financial distress will be based on the elementary verification tools as computation Type I Error and Type II Error accompanied by reliability ratio. The greatest benefit of these tools is that the results can be introduced to auditorium without prerequsited knowledge. Scientific aim The scientific aim is to find the models predicting financial distress which have the highest accuracy and provide the most reliable results for further decision making. The second research question is based on the comparison of national approaches (in our case Czech models) and approaches from other transition economies. Critique of the models predicting financial distress is very often connected with the issue that only national models can provide enough accuracy and approaches from other economies have worse results. Findings Findings will be the models predicting financial distress which have high explanatory power and comparison of national and non-national approaches. Conclusions The main conslusions are comparison and answers which models have the highest accuracy and if we should prefer national approaches. Limit depends on the used data samples of defaulted and non-defaulted entities. Data samples contain almost 100 defaulted entities and more than 650 non-defaulted entities. These entities belong to manufacturing and construction industries which are not homogenous.","[Camska, Dagmar] Czech Tech Univ, Masaryk Inst Adv Studies, Dept Econ Studies, Kolejni 2637-2A, Prague 616000 6, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague,"Cámská, D (通讯作者)，Czech Tech Univ, Masaryk Inst Adv Studies, Dept Econ Studies, Kolejni 2637-2A, Prague 616000 6, Czech Republic.",dagmar.camska@cvut.cz,"Čámská, Dagmar/AAC-7644-2020","Čámská, Dagmar/0000-0003-4597-379X",,,,,31,0,0,0,2,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,15,23,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200001,0

We extend their analysis by arguing that the effect of strong family ties on economic outcomes depends on a country's level of economic and institutional development. This cross-country heterogeneity arises because strong family ties not only foster traditional family values (which have disruptive effects on economic outcomes), but also provide economically valuable social networks - especially in societies characterised by weak institutions and limited market access. Empirical evidence using the European and World Value Surveys (EVS/WVS) are supportive of our theoretical argument.","[Daniele, Gianmarco] VUB, Dept Appl Econ, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Daniele, Gianmarco] Univ Barcelona, IEB, Barcelona, Spain; [Geys, Benny] Norwegian Business Sch BI, Dept Econ, Oslo, Norway",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; University of Barcelona; BI Norwegian Business School,"Daniele, G (通讯作者)，VUB, Dept Appl Econ, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",Daniele.Gianmarco@vub.ac.be,,"Daniele, Gianmarco/0000-0003-2608-5615; Geys, Benny/0000-0003-4524-1820",FWO Vlaanderen [G.0022.12],FWO Vlaanderen(FWO),"The authors are grateful to Alberto Alesina and Paola Giuliano for access to their data and stata code, and thank Bruno Heyndels, Joshua Holm, Marc Jegers, Pierre-Guillaume Meon, Paolo Pinotti and an anonymous referee for insightful comments and suggestions.

The stock risk premium is taken to be an affine function of the predictive variables and the stock return volatility is assumed to depend on the observed factor. The latent factor is estimated based on the observations. It is shown that stock return predictability can significantly impact the optimal bond portfolio. Considerable welfare benefits may arise from using bonds in learning about/hedging against stock return predictors. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Brazil plans to build dozens of hydroelectric dams in its Amazon region and in neighboring countries. Benefits are much less than is portrayed, partly because electricity is exported in electro-intensive products such as aluminum, creating little employment in Brazil. Dams perversely affect politics and social policies. Aluminum export offers an example of how a rethinking of energy use needs to be the starting point for revising energy policy. Dam impacts have been systematically underestimated, including population displacement and loss of livelihood (especially fisheries), biodiversity loss, and greenhouse-gas emissions.

The steepness of the yield curve should be an excellent indicator of a possible future economic activity. A rise in the short rate tends to flatten the yield curve as well as to slow down real economic growth the near term. The relationship between the spread and future GDP activity was proved already before. One question remains - which spread is the best for the future prediction? Is it the spread between sovereign 10-year bonds and 3-month bonds or 15-year and 3-month or 10-year and 1-year sovereign bonds? This paper aimed to analyze which spread is the most suitable for predicting of future economic growth in countries of V4 (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia) between the years 2000 and 2015. We proved that in these selected countries the best spread is a spread of 5-year and 3-month government bonds. The second best spread is spread of 5-year and 1-year government bonds. The results show that dividing of the sample made a difference between pre-crisis and after-crisis period and it showed the different relationship of spreads and the models. The finding that the best spread is spread of 5-year and 3-month eventually 5-year and 1-year is in contradiction with the theoretical background when almost everybody who predicts the future GDP growth uses a spread of 10-year and 3-month of government bonds.","[Hvozdenska, Jana] Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Hvozdenská, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic.",174974@mail.muni.cz,"Hvozdenska, Jana/AAA-8859-2021","Hvozdenska, Jana/0000-0003-4379-7120",,,,,12,2,2,0,1,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Fuzzy clustering was used to cluster people into a number of groups based on their use, tendency and intention. In our experiments, we used Fuzzy C-Means algorithms and it was calculated by using R Studio's packages.

We utilize a new measure to examine the impact these restrictions have on information efficiency between the two instruments. Based on one year of intraday data surrounding the US emergency order of 2008, we find evidence of traders switching from SSR restricted products to a matched group of stocks and options. At the same time there is a decline in the role options provided to price discovery in the SSR affected stocks, along with a significant rise in the importance of options for the matched sample as informed traders move to trading in markets that are unaffected by the restrictions. From a policy perspective our results indicate that a greater consideration needs to be made for the impact SSR has on trade informativeness and the price discovery process, as well as how it affects the inter-related markets through the trader-switching effect.

Our results show that a firm's stock return has stronger comovement with the returns of nearby firms than with those of distant firms. Being in the same state and/or in the same industry strengthens the return comovement, but does not substitute for the negative effect of geographic distance on price comovement. Firms of similar share price and size also show stronger return comovement, but these factors do not mitigate the negative distance impact. Consistent with investor home bias and neighborhood effect literature, our results suggest that investors' preference for local stocks and their interactions lead to correlated trading in local stocks and therefore stronger local price comovement.

With the help of country case studies, we argue, first, that the African political business cycle is not homogeneous, and occurs relatively infrequently in so-called dominant-party systems' where a pre-election stimulus confers little political advantage. Secondly, we show that, in those countries where a political cycle does occur, it does not necessarily cause institutional damage. Whether it does or not depends not so much on whether there is an electoral cycle as on whether this cycle calms or exacerbates fears of an unjust allocation of resources. In other words, the composition of the pre-election stimulus, in terms of its allocation between different categories of voter, is as important as its size.","[Mosley, Paul] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, 9 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England; [Chiripanhura, Blessing] Univ Namibia, Dept Econ, Windhoek, Namibia",University of Sheffield; University of Namibia,"Mosley, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, 9 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England.",p.mosley@sheffield.ac.uk,,,"Political Economy of Pro-Poor Adjustment and Growth, within the ESRC's World Economy and Finance Programme [156/25/0016]; ESRC","Political Economy of Pro-Poor Adjustment and Growth, within the ESRC's World Economy and Finance Programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","Our thanks to Helene Ehrhart, Victor Lledo, Vera Troeger, Paul Whiteley and other participants at seminars at the University of Essex and the Centre for the Study of African Economies, Oxford (March 2010), also Abdulai Abdul-Gafaru of the University of Ghana, for most valuable comments on an early version.

These products are different from the traditional food products and the risks associated with them may also differ from the traditional food risks. The aim of this research is to examine the consumption patterns and the most important factors of the decision making process among adult food supplement users. The other research question is how determinants of food safety - such as quality, availability of information and risks - influence consumption patterns in the market and to what extent customers take these factors into consideration during purchasing process. Within the framework of primary research, [1] focus group interviews were conducted in order to understand how people hold certain beliefs about food supplements and [2] a survey was also used to measure the consumers' attitudes towards these products as well as food safety. In data processing, factor-and cluster analysis were used to segment consumers based upon how they consider the use of food supplements. From the results, it can be seen that 42% of customers consume food supplements seasonally. The main motivation in the consumption of food supplements is 'vitamin supplementation', followed by 'health protection'. In the case of food-supplements, a difference has also been shown between genders' consumption habits. Furthermore, four homogenous groups were identified among the respondents: comfortable, skeptics, careful users, conscious health-protectors. I conclude that use of food supplements are judged differently by the respondents. Segmentation can help businesses to tailor the marketing mix for specific target markets. Findings can also improve the innovation of new products that suit better to customers' unique needs.","[Nemeth, Nikolett] Szent Istvan Univ, Doctoral Sch Management & Business Adm, 1 Pater Karoly Utca, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary",Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Németh, N (通讯作者)，Szent Istvan Univ, Doctoral Sch Management & Business Adm, 1 Pater Karoly Utca, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary.",nikolett_nemeth@hotmail.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-4781,,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,229,235,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000029,0

Uncivillity in work environment is a concept of antisocial behavior recently introduced, characterized by disrespect for others, recklessness, impoliteness, lack of manners and social isolation. The current research included 65 participants (32 male and 33 female), private sector employees, aged between 23 and 59 years (M = 34.43, SD = 8.53), who were invited to answer to the following questionnaires: a) Stress scales. The Stress scale combine four subscales-ICAWS-Interpersonal Conflict at Work Scale; OCS-Organizational Constraints Scale; QWI-Quantitative Workload Inventory and PSI-Physical Symptoms Inventory; b) Counterproductive Work Behavior Checklist. The CWB scale contains five subscales: abuse, production deviance, sabotage, theft, and withdrawal; c) Uncivil Workplace Behavior Scale. The results showed significant positive correlations between occupational stress and counterproductive work behavior (r =.56; p =.000), and between occupational stress and incivillity (r =.31; p =.001). At the same time, we have found a significant positive correlation between counterproductive work behavior and incivillity (r =.39; p =.000). Concerning gender differences in performing counterproductive work behaviors, the mean scores of CWB reported by males (M = 45, SD = 8.89) were significantly higher (t (63) = 2.55, p =.014) than those reported by female participants (M = 40.4; SD = 4.91). Regarding the main objective of the research, the moderation analysis certifies that uncivillity of the employees performed within the organizational environment influences the relationship between occupational stress and counterproductive work behavior: AR2 = 132 It, F (1, 61) = 16.280, p <.000. In conclusion, this research revealed that impolite, rude behavior oriented toward other members of the organization, associated with increased occupational stress, will only hasten and accentuate the emergence of counterproductive work behaviors.","[Ojog, Iulian; Stanescu, Dan Florin] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Ojog, I (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",ojogiulian@yahoo.com; dan.stanescu@comunicare.ro,"Stanescu, Dan Florin/P-6421-2019","Stanescu, Dan Florin/0000-0001-8188-903X",,,,,38,0,0,1,21,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,460,470,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300038,0

While most investment flows correspond to firms from large economies, small developing economies have also witnessed the increase of outward investment flows from their domestic companies. The literature on outward FDI (OFDI) from developing economies has focused mainly on large emerging countries, such as China and India. In the case of small developing economies, for which there is scant empirical evidence, firms willing to invest abroad face a different business environment with several barriers such as a small domestic market to achieve economies of scale and a limited supply of specialised resources. In this setting, the purpose of this paper is to examine firm-level strategies and the home-country effects in a small developing economy. Design/methodology/approach - A research case study is conducted through a representative sample of Costa-Rican firms investing abroad. Costa Rica makes a strong case since it stands out among small developing economies investing abroad in terms of both the number of operations and the amount of OFDI. Findings - The main findings are: outward investment is not only for large and mature firms, as medium and small-sized firms are actively investing abroad; most firms pursue a market-seeking strategy; the benefits for the firm and the home country are stronger when companies follow a clear outward investment strategy; and there is a positive relationship between international trade and OFDI. Originality/value - This paper provides novel empirical evidence to better understand an emerging trend in OFDI: in an increasingly integrated world economy, even SMEs from small developing economies are compelled to internationalise their operations in order to compete successfully.","[Padilla-Perez, Ramon] United Nations Econ Commiss Latin Amer & Caribbea, Econ Dev Unit, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Gomes Nogueira, Caroline] United Nations Econ Commiss Latin Amer & Caribbea, Int Trade & Ind Unit, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",,"Padilla-Perez, R (通讯作者)，United Nations Econ Commiss Latin Amer & Caribbea, Econ Dev Unit, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",ramon.padilla@cepal.org,,,,,,,67,30,34,1,43,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The empirical evidence on the topic is limited as the decision on tax evasion is purely private information of the taxpayer. The experiment presented in the paper focuses on two main topics. At first, we analyze potential influence of two factors probability of being caught while cheating on taxes and penalty rate imposed on subject who evade. We conclude that behavior of the Czech subjects corresponds to foreign results. At the same time, there is a stronger effect when probability of being caught increases. The effect of increasing penalty rate is rather moderate. Second research question focuses on the terminology used during the experiment. We find that the rate of tax compliance is higher within experimental sessions where subjects face neutral language in the instructions compared to the group with loaded instruction (tax language). This behavior contradicts the results to date and indicates possible country effect which could be linked to specifics of post transformational society.","[Spalek, Jiri; Spackova, Zuzana] Masarykova Univ Brno, Ekon Spravni Fak, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Spacková, Z (通讯作者)，Masarykova Univ Brno, Ekon Spravni Fak, Brno, Czech Republic.",spalek@econ.muni.cz; Zuzana.Spackova@econ.muni.cz,"Špalek, Jiří/J-9210-2012; Špačková, Zuzana/AAX-8486-2021","Špalek, Jiří/0000-0001-5832-4946; Špačková, Zuzana/0000-0001-8349-5106",,,,,33,4,4,0,18,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Moreover, the results of the studies on the application of APM in non-IT companies are presented. Methodology/methods Based on the literature review, the descriptions of TPM and MPM methods are given. Furthermore, the questionnaire-based survey is applied to obtain relevant knowledge on the application of APM methods in the non-IT companies. Scientific aim The scientific goal of the article is to ascertain the prerequisites for applying the TPM and MPM methods in the organisations, with a special focus on non-IT companies. Moreover, the conducted survey shed some light into the current state of application of APM methods in non-IT companies. Findings The TPM methods have been developed since the sixties and are suitable for application in large, long-term projects in a stable environment. The prerequisite for their application is the ability to plan, in detail, the project ex-ante, while MPM methods seem to more accurately match the client's needs, especially if the requirements have the tendency to change frequently over time. However, the result of the study showed that the application of APM methods is very limited, even if the companies reported that they mostly operate in turbulent environments. Conclusions The MPM methods, with a special focus on APM, are a good alternative for non-IT companies seeking new ways of managing projects in a turbulent, client-oriented environment. However, the results of the studies revealed the limited application of APM methods in non-IT companies. They outlined directions for further research that should try to answer what hampers APM application in non-IT companies. Moreover, research dedicated to select industries should be performed.","[Spalek, Seweryn] Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Org & Management, Akad 2A, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland",Silesian University of Technology,"Spalek, S (通讯作者)，Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Org & Management, Akad 2A, PL-44100 Gliwice, Poland.",spalek@polsl.pl,"Spalek, Seweryn/K-9582-2013; Spalek, Seweryn/E-1313-2018","Spalek, Seweryn/0000-0003-1261-0626; Spalek, Seweryn/0000-0003-1261-0626",,,,,53,5,10,3,44,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,499,506,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200062,0

In some member countries, young people start working much earlier than in others, e.g. in the form of summer jobs or jobs for students. It is also possible to be in education system and on the labour market at the same time, leading to an overlap. Another challenge of this specific labour market is migration of young people from non-member states of EU which began in 2008 and has caused a migration crisis in 2015.

These factors increase probability of corruption, strictly related to the culture of informality. The aim of this article is to present an impact of the culture of informality in the Republic of Kosovo on the European Integration process, by examining the situation from the public procurement practice perspective. The analysis uses both qualitative and quantitative method to measure the impact of informality on the change process.","[Targosz, Ewelina] Fac Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, Pl Litewski 3, Lublin, Poland",,"Targosz, E (通讯作者)，Fac Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, Pl Litewski 3, Lublin, Poland.",ewelina.targosz@gmail.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

TEN-T has been created by the European Commission to ensure the mobility of citizens, as well as fast and safe trading. However, the European transport infrastructure is characterized by large variations on the level of development that occurs in the East and West of the EU. In Poland, the infrastructure is technically unadjusted to the current transport needs and preferences. Modernization and development of infrastructure requires large capital expenditures. At the same time the public finance sector is overloaded, and the budget deficit is common. European countries and governments around the world are more likely to engage the private sector to finance infrastructure. The usual form of involvement of private investors is the public-private partnership (PPP). However, not all projects are successful. Achieving tangible benefits of PPP requires the creation of appropriate conditions conducive to its implementation. The aim of this study is to identify and analyze critical success factors for PPP transport infrastructure projects in Poland. The research literature proves that there are many factors and they relate to various aspects and stages of the PPP implementation. The factors are classified in four groups: financial and economic, political and legal, technical, and social. The ones that have significant impact on transport infrastructure include: stable macroeconomic situation of the country, political support and commitment of the government, legal system, well-organized public consulting agencies, financial market availability, credible and experienced private investors. In Poland, the most important factors that are necessary for success in the implementation of PPP projects are: support of the government and governmental institutions, legal framework and regulations and the existence of adequate public advisory bodies. For the past 20 years, these conditions have not been fully met and formed a barrier to the development of the partnership. The consequence of the lack of public advisory body is limited knowledge on PPP in public administration as well as in banks, which in the case of the latter, limits the availability of the financial market for private partners.","[Zagozdzon, Beata] Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Transport & Elect Engn, PL-26600 Radom, Poland",Kazimierz Pulaski University of Technology & Humanities in Radom,"Zagozdzon, B (通讯作者)，Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Transport & Elect Engn, PL-26600 Radom, Poland.",b.zagozdzon@pr.radom.pl,,,,,,,29,0,0,1,22,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-26848-4; 978-3-319-26846-0,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,125,138,,10.1007/978-3-319-26848-4_12,0.0,,,14,Business; Economics; Transportation,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Transportation,BG0LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386325500012,0

In this task, an impulsive reinforcement-based heuristic can either conflict or be aligned with Bayesian updating. According to the limited-resource model of self-control, depleted participants should have difficulties inhibiting the heuristic and commit more decision errors in case of conflict. We conducted 3 studies using different depletion manipulations plus controls with milder versions (as standard in the literature). Only 1 study found the predicted effect in case of conflict. One study found decreased error rates for depleted participants in case of alignment, which is consistent with an increased reliance on the heuristic in this case. We conclude that the effects of self-control depletion in complex decision-making tasks are less systematic and robust than assumed in the literature.","[Alos-Ferrer, Carlos; Huegelschaefer, Sabine; Li, Jiahui] Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Alós-Ferrer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",carlos.alos-ferrer@uni-koeln.de,"Alos-Ferrer, Carlos/GQO-9340-2022","Alos-Ferrer, Carlos/0000-0002-1668-9784",Research Unit Psychoeconomics [FOR1882]; German Research Foundation (DFG),Research Unit Psychoeconomics; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Authors appear in alphabetical order.

Context can influence not only how an institution performs but also the very choices of institutions that societies choose to govern themselves. In this paper, we construct a model that produces contextual effects that result in institutional path dependence. In doing so, we provide formal foundations for qualitative arguments that context matters and identify a contributing causal mechanism: behavioral spillovers. Using both mathematical and computational techniques, we show that spillovers provide a mechanistic explanation for how pre-existing institutions affect-the performance of new institutions as well as the optimal choice among institutions. We find that these spillovers can depend on either the set or the path of previous institutions. Both results support qualitative arguments that historical institutional contexts influence outcomes in current institutions. Importantly, the spillovers depend not only on the outcomes produced in the institutions but also on the specific behavior that produces the outcomes. As a result, we show that institutions that create diverse ensembles of behaviors generate better outcomes and less path dependence than those that cause all agents to converge on the identical strategy.

We find no significant impact of these regimes on deterring outward cross-border attribution of patent ownership, or on attracting ownership of foreign inventions.

A minority of very concerned individuals appear to be unhappy, which cannot be explained by personality or other observable factors typically affecting well-being. As a novelty, this investigation exploits exogenous variation in reported concerns by using the intensity of media coverage on the euro crisis with its extraordinary events throughout the year 2011 as an instrument. Results from the application of several empirical approaches confirm that there is an effect from being concerned about the euro on people's satisfaction with life. A potential explanation is that political beliefs and euro-skeptic attitudes are at play and may trigger unhappiness as a consequence of a perceived lack of representation in German politics. In line with this argument, a regional analysis links the variation in unhappiness among concerned citizens to the actual votes for Germany's first major anti-euro party in the subsequent federal elections.

The method we put forward in this article decomposes the social interaction potential (SIP) metric into interactions within and between social groups, such as people of different race, income level, and occupation. This provides a novel metric of exposure, one of the fundamental spatial dimensions of segregation. In particular, the SIP metric is disaggregated into measures of inter-group and intra-group exposure. While activity spaces have been used to measure exposure in the geographic literature, these approaches do not adequately represent the dynamic nature of the target populations. We make the next step by representing both the source and target population groups by space-time prisms, thus more accurately representing spatial and temporal dynamics and constraints. Additionally, decomposition of the SIP metric means that each of the group-wise components of the SIP metric can be represented at zones of residence, workplace, and specific origin-destination pairs. Consequently, the spatial variation in segregation can be explored and hotspots of segregation and integration potential can be identified. The proposed approach is demonstrated for synthetic cities with different population distributions and daily commute flow characteristics, as well as for a case study of the Detroit-Warren-Livonia MSA.

This paper offers new evidence on the relationship between native self-employment and the self-employment decision of immigrants and their descendants. We argue that the previous literature has neglected to account for different proxies of entrepreneurial behavior and for determinants of self-employment in the country of origin. We find mixed evidence of a significant relationship between entrepreneurial activity of US immigrants and two different measures of entrepreneurial activity in their respective countries of origin. Our findings suggest that differences in self-employment across immigrants of different origin are to some degree an expression of the behavior acquired under varying economic and institutional environments.","[Lassmann, Andrea] ETH, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Lassmann, A (通讯作者)，ETH, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, G118,Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",lassmann@kof.ethz.ch,,,,,,,77,21,25,0,55,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Rising PT fares create a competitive disadvantage against private motor vehicles which is threatening PT ridership. This paper seeks to gain further insights into transport disadvantage by exploring spatial patterns of household transport expenditure on PT fares and private vehicle fuel use for the Brisbane metropolitan area. Several datasets are used to measure mode-specific transport costs, including the journey to work matrix, fuel efficiency of the private vehicle fleet and PT fares for the city. Through an advanced spatial analysis, the results show that PT was not a cost-effective means of transport for households when compared to private motor vehicles. The paper then compares mode-specific trip costs with patterns of suburban socio-economic disadvantage in Brisbane. We demonstrate that the high PT fares increase household exposure to higher transport costs and compound other forms of transport disadvantage and vulnerability, particularly in outer suburban areas.

Entrepreneurs face idiosyncratic investment distortions and credit constraints. An intrinsically useless asset such as land serves as collateral for borrowing. A land bubble can form because land commands a liquidity premium. The land bubble can provide liquidity and relax credit constraints, but can also generate inefficient over investment. Its net effect is to reduce welfare. Property taxes, Tobin's taxes, macroprudential policy, and credit policy can prevent the formation of a land bubble. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Non-parametric and parametric-based techniques are used to study sample regimes before and after the peak in wheat prices that occurred during the global economic crisis in 2008. Findings of the study indicate that wheat returns on Mondays and Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT) holidays are significant and positive while Tuesday returns are negative and significant. These seasonal patterns occur largely in the second sample of the wheat dataset. Furthermore, it is observed that volatility diminished after the global financial crisis. Finally, based on the return seasonality detected and by applying Monte Carlo simulation in an out-of-sample period, some trading rules are developed that yield higher returns than any trading approach based on chance.","[Motengwe, Chris] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Pardo, Angel] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Financial Econ, E-46003 Valencia, Spain",University of Witwatersrand; University of Valencia,"Motengwe, C (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",busdevelop7@gmail.com; angel.pardo@uv.es,"Pardo, Angel/E-8919-2017","Pardo, Angel/0000-0002-8624-0640",EU - European Commission,EU - European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The authors are grateful for financial support under an EU Saturn Mobility arrangement supported by the European Commission under the Erasmus Mundus Action 2 programmes.

The first rationale behind this asymmetry is the asymmetric policy response of the central bank around the target. Central banks could have a stronger bias towards overshooting rather than undershooting the inflation target. Consequently, the policy response would be stronger once the inflation jumps above the target, compared to a negative deviation. Second rationale is the asymmetric inflation persistence. We suggest that recently developed Asymmetric Exponential Smooth Transition Autoregressive (AESTAR) model provides a convenient framework to capture the asymmetric behaviour of inflation driven by these two effects. We further conduct an out-of-sample forecasting exercise and show that the predictive power of AESTAR model for inflation is high for some countries in our sample, especially at long-horizons.","Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Akdogan, K (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Ankara, Turkey.",,,"Akdogan, Kurmas/0000-0002-1297-3737",,,,,42,10,10,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

A Meta-Regression Analysis,ECONOMICS & POLITICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION; POLITICAL COMPETITION; GROWTH; METAANALYSIS; INVESTMENT; MODEL,"A growing literature documents the existence of strategic political reactions to public expenditure between rival jurisdictions. These interactions can potentially create a downward expenditure spiral (race to the bottom) or a rising expenditure spiral (race to the top). However, in the course of identifying the existence of such interactions and ascertaining their underlying triggers, the empirical evidence has produced markedly heterogeneous findings. Most of this heterogeneity can be traced back to study design and institutional differences. This article contributes to the literature by applying meta-regression analysis to quantify the magnitude of strategic inter-jurisdictional expenditure interactions, controlling for study, and institutional characteristics. We find several robust results beyond confirming that jurisdictions do engage in strategic expenditure interactions, namely that strategic interactions: (i) are weakening over time, (ii) are stronger among municipalities than among higher levels of government, and (iii) appear to be more influenced from tax competition than yardstick competition, with capital controls and fiscal decentralization shaping the magnitude of fiscal interactions.","[Costa-Font, Joan; De-Albuquerque, Filipe] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Doucouliagos, Hristos] Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Deakin University,"Costa-Font, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Cowdray House, London WC2A 2AE, England.",j.costa-font@lse.ac.uk,"; Costa-i-Font, Joan/C-9609-2013","Doucouliagos, Hristos/0000-0001-5269-3556; Costa-i-Font, Joan/0000-0001-7174-7919",,,,,59,11,11,1,33,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Current utility-theoretic approaches assume an aggregated group utility function and hence ignore aspects of the group decision making process. In this study, an empirical model of joint-activity choice is developed that, in contrast, assumes a negotiation process. A social utility function describes how individuals deal with preference differences in the group. The model is estimated based on an experimental activity-travel choice task where group settings are mimicked. A sample (N = 315) from a national panel of individuals participated in the experiment. Estimation results based on a discrete mixture model show that individuals display a preference for locations in which losses are equally distributed in the group even when this comes at the costs of the total group outcome. Results further show that the social utility function is asymmetric: compromise solutions are favored more strongly when consequences relate to costs (travel costs) than when they concern rewards (attractiveness). Furthermore, there is considerable heterogeneity in how people make social trade-offs. It is concluded that the model offers new insights in location preferences for joint activities that should be taken into account in spatial choice models and accessibility analysis.

We employ a new measure of corruption based on data from random audits of municipal governments. Our results suggest that higher levels of corruption are generally associated with reductions in the number of business establishments. Furthermore, we find that these effects become larger over time, suggesting that corruption is particularly detrimental over the long-run. However, we also find that the effect of corruption on business activity can be insignificant or even positive conditional on institutional quality being very poor. This is consistent with the grease the wheels hypothesis, which argues that corruption provides entrepreneurs with means to avoid burdensome regulations and taxes.","[Bologna, Jamie; Ross, Amanda] W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University,"Ross, A (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",jbologna@mix.wvu.edu; amanda.ross@mail.wvu.edu,"Ross, Amanda/AAI-9138-2020",,,,,,45,58,65,0,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,OCT,2015,165.0,1-2,,,,,59,77,,10.1007/s11127-015-0292-5,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CX0ZR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365426500005,0

A methodology to identify and classify centres based on mobility data was applied to Metropolitan Stockholm in Sweden using multi-modal public transport passenger flows. Stockholm is known for its long-term monocentric planning with a dominant central core and radial public transport system. Strategic nodes along its radial public transport system have been a focus for development of sub-centres. Although the regional planning policy embraces a shift towards a polycentric planning policy, the results indicate that this has not been realized insofar. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This created an unusually well controlled quasi-experimental opportunity for learning about the role of parties in the Senate-it held most important variables constant while one variable, majority status, changed. We use roll call data to evaluate the probability of individual members of each party being rolled on Senate final passage votes, before and after the switch. We find that, contrary to conventional wisdom on the Senate, majority status is an important factor in Senate decision-making.

Using rich panel data with annual observations from 1998 to 2012 allows us to control not only for country-and time-invariant factors but also for potential reverse causality between corruption and income levels in a 3SLS framework. Democracy reduces corruption but only in economies that have already crossed a GDP/capita level of approximately US$2,000 (in 2005 US$). For poorer nations, democratization is suggested to increase corruption. Other institutional characteristics are unlikely to drive this result and findings are robust to a variety of robustness checks and quantile regressions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the additional predictive power remains small and it is not normally confirmed for the Asian and the 1998 crises.

Reciprocity is the basis for cooperation in repeated public goods games, and a uniform price would provide a natural focal point for a common international commitment. Such a price is also essential for efficient abatement. Countries would retain flexibility in how to implement the price with cap-and-trade, a carbon tax, or a hybrid approach. Country risk is reduced relative to risk under international cap-and-trade since carbon revenues stay within the country. Price commitments also tend to equalize effort intensity and can facilitate enforcement.

Bond return standardization yields considerably more powerful tests. Also, due to infrequent trading, use of bond transaction price observations over several days before and after an event, while giving more weight to returns calculated from transactions closer to the event, yields considerably more powerful tests than returns based solely on transactions the day before and the day after the event.

Exploiting quasi-experimental variation in incentives to construct and rehabilitate rental housing across neighborhoods generated by Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program rules, we explore the impacts of subsidized development on local housing construction, poverty concentration, and neighborhood inequality. While a large fraction of rental housing development spurred by the program is offset by a reduction in the number of new unsubsidized units, housing investment under the LIHTC has measurable effects on the distribution of income within and across communities. However, there is little evidence the program contributes meaningfully to poverty concentration or residential segregation.

It analyzes the predatory and productive interactions of 400,000 users of a virtual world. Virtual worlds are computer-created environments that visually mimic physical spaces, where people interact with each other and with virtual objects in manifold ways. Notably, the paper examines the behavior of users acting as virtual pirates. The paper finds that even in a largely anonymous and anarchic virtual world private rules of order mitigate the most destructive forms of conflict. This is true even though the virtual pirates are found to be conflict-loving rather than conflict-averse. Although the costs of conflict are dramatically reduced in virtual worlds, private rules that limit violence spontaneously emerge. An important part of the paper's contribution is methodological. The analysis of the problem of order in anarchy serves to exemplify the power and usefulness of the new approach.","Univ St Andrews, Dept Philosophy, Edgecliffe, Scores, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland",University of St Andrews,"Mildenberger, CD (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Dept Philosophy, Edgecliffe, Scores, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland.",cdm4@st-andrews.ac.uk,,,,,,,78,4,5,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2015,164.0,3-4,,,,,401,421,,10.1007/s11127-015-0284-5,0.0,,,21,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CU7NM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363727500012,0

Based on a sample of Portuguese employees in retail banking, our results confirm significant inter-firm and inter-industry skill transferability. Difference-in-differences estimates with propensity score matching show that firm switchers benefit from a wage premium compared to firm stayers.

In particular, feedback from discontinued and implemented opportunities has rarely been included and/or integrated with individual, organizational, and strategic variables in existing corporate entrepreneurship frameworks. We propose a system dynamics perspective to explain how entrepreneurship occurs within organizations. To accomplish this, we employ a framework that includes the four main activities of opportunity recognition, assessment, legitimation, and implementation. Feedback loops are used to show the connection to strategic assessment and entrepreneurial renewal that portray corporate entrepreneurship as an integration of entrepreneurial and strategic efforts. This model integrates a variety of perspectives that have been utilized in the literature and allows for activation at any point in the system dynamics process. In this paper, we provide theoretical background for our model, discuss our contributions to the literature, and suggest how scholars may implement and enhance this framework in future research efforts.","[Bloodgood, James M.] Kansas State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Management, Entrepreneurial Studies, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Hornsby, Jeffrey S.] Univ Missouri, Henry W Bloch Sch Management, Dept Global Entrepreneurship & Innovat, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Burkemper, Andrew C.; Sarooghi, Hessam] Univ Missouri, Henry W Bloch Sch Management, Dept Global Entrepreneurship & Innovat, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA",Kansas State University; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City,"Bloodgood, JM (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Management, Entrepreneurial Studies, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",jblood@ksu.edu; hornsbyj@umkc.edu; andrew.burkemper@umkc.edu; hsarooghi@umkc.edu,,"Sarooghi, Hessam/0000-0003-0682-2710; Hornsby, Jeffrey/0000-0003-3946-135X",,,,,156,27,36,10,126,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

One solution that allows the use of individual assets while overcoming the EIV problem is iterated TPCSR (ITPCSR). ITPCSR converges to a fixed point regardless of the initial factors chosen.

When two such rates follow stochastic processes, it is not optimal immediately to arbitrage out any discrepancy that arises between them. The reason is that immediate arbitrage would induce a definite expenditure of transactions costs whereas, without arbitrage intervention, there exists some, perhaps sufficient, probability that these two interest rates will come back together without any costs having been incurred. Hence, one can surmise that at equilibrium the financial market will permit the coexistence of two riskless rates that are not equal to each other. For analogous reasons, randomly fluctuating expected rates of return on risky assets will be allowed to differ even after correction for risk, leading to important violations of the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The combination of randomness in expected rates of return and proportional transactions costs is a serious blow to existing frictionless pricing models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

They focus on two change-related cultural differences suggested by previous research on dialectical vs. analytic approach to thinking. The first implies that East Asians are more likely to change their behavior over time (i.e., are less consistent), the second that they expect more changes in the environment. The results show that the less consistency in the East hypothesis has a high predictive value. This hypothesis accurately predicts a behavioral pattern that was documented in all three studies, as well as a non-trivial effect of limited feedback in Study 3: When feedback was limited to the obtained payoff, the participants from Taiwan exhibited less risk aversion than the Israeli. Analysis of the expecting more changes in the East hypothesis reveals mixed results. This hypothesis was supported in Study 2, which examined relatively complex multi-alternative multi-outcome tasks, but not in Studies 1 and 3, which examined simple two-alternative two-outcome choice tasks.

Results indicate that the increases in the investment goods price in China but the decreases in it in the United States negatively affected the domestic labor demand of multinationals in Japan.

Moreover, we argue that the high degree of integration propagated the crisis across the global financial markets at the beginning of the crisis, but it had little effect during the crisis.

Veridical information is a helpful tool when deciding whether to continue or de-escalate commitment. However, field data suggests that one primary source of information, namely information provided by experts, is often biased toward the continuation of projects. This bias is partly the result of attempts to influence decision-makers to escalate their commitment. Previous research has, so far, not addressed the question of how decision-makers in an escalation context utilize meta-information that makes them aware of such biases. In three experiments, we show that decision-makers act in accordance with expert advice: they further escalate their commitment when the experts suggest continuation of a failing project, and they de-escalate their commitment when the experts argue in favor of withdrawal (Experiment 1). When participants are made aware of the possibility that the expert advice is biased, the impact of this advice is reduced (Experiment 2). Most importantly, when decision-makers were made aware beyond doubt that the experts aimed to manipulate them, they also relied on the information less, but they failed to fully ignore it (Experiment 3). In sum, our data suggest that decision-makers in an escalation context are prone to attempts at manipulation as they cannot fully ignore biased advice even when the deceptive motive of their advisors is disclosed to them.

Drawing on unique Greater Rotterdam (The Netherlands) travel diary data enriched with hourly meteorological and spatial route attributes, we analyse how weather affects different transport mode users' en-route place valuations in terms of liveliness, friendliness and aesthetics. Our main findings indicate that windy, cloudy, cold (<15 degrees C) or too hot (>= 25 degrees C) weather conditions negatively affect en-route place valuations, either directly or through lower thermal comfort. Active mode users generally value their route surroundings more positively than motorised transport modes, however they also appear more strongly affected by weather in their thermal experiences and place valuations. Policy makers are advised to expand climate-sensitive urban planning along active transport mode infrastructures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Nonetheless, the question could be asked as to whether the financial and personal shocks an individual faces over his lifetime modify his risk aversion. Our empirical analysis provides evidence that risk aversion is composed of a time-variant part and shows that the variation cannot be ascribed to measurement error or noise given that it is related to income shocks. Yet, the true time variant factor explains a relatively small share of the observed variation in risk aversion while differences between individuals account for nearly 50% of it. Taking into account the fact that there are time-variant factors in risk aversion, we investigate how often it is preferable to collect the risk aversion measure in long panel surveys. Our result suggests that the best predictor of current behavior is the average of risk aversion, where risk aversion is collected every two years. It is therefore advisable for risk aversion measures to be collected every two years in long panel surveys.","[Jung, Seeun] ESSEC Business Sch, Cergy, France; [Jung, Seeun] Univ Cergy Pontoise, Cergy, France; [Treibich, Carole] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Marseille, France; [Treibich, Carole] CNRS, F-75700 Paris, France; [Treibich, Carole] EHESS, Paris, France",ESSEC Business School; CY Cergy Paris Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Jung, S (通讯作者)，ESSEC Business Sch, Cergy, France.",jung@essec.edu,,,LABEX-MME-DII,LABEX-MME-DII,The financial support from LABEX-MME-DII is acknowledged.,,33,4,4,0,13,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

It analyzes the correlates of consumption, shock exposure, and severity, as well as vulnerability to poverty. Using panel data of over 4000 rural households from Thailand and Vietnam, strong evidence of heterogeneity among subgroups of female-headed households are found. In particular, in comparison with male headed households de facto female-headed ones are found to be richer in Thailand, but prone to more severe shocks in both countries. Furthermore, our results suggest that in Thailand single female-headed households are less vulnerable to poverty than households headed by men. However, in Vietnam these households are particularly poor and vulnerable to poverty; we show that this is mostly due to their greater poverty rather than their higher risk exposure.

The STGP-based trading algorithm produces one-day-ahead return forecasts for groups of artificial traders with different levels of intelligence and different group sizes. The performance of the algorithm is compared with a number of benchmark forecasts and these comparisons clearly demonstrate the short-term superiority of the STGP-based method in many circumstances. Subsequently we provide detailed analysis of the impact of trader cognitive abilities and trader numbers on the accuracy of forecasting rules which allows us to conduct new experimental tests of the Marginal Trader and the Hayek Hypotheses.

While period and rule solvency depend on analyzing dividend rules and sources of risk to net income, evaluating intertemporal solvency requires overcoming the difficult challenge of measuring the present value of seignorage.

One explanation for the lack of attention on Asian outcomes follows from the perceived relative economic prosperity of this minority group, which may lead to the belief that they are less in need of consumer protection or policy support. While simple group averages of economic characteristics support this belief, documented heterogeneity of Asian experiences suggests that the use of other measures may be needed to account for the varied outcomes of Asians in the U.S. housing markets. Using a unique proprietary source of lender data, we examine these Asian outcomes. We find that Asians face challenges in mortgage markets in ways that may be unique as compared to other minority groups. For example, while an examination of unadjusted average denial rates indicates favorable outcomes for Asians compared to other minority groups, we find that after accounting for loan and borrower characteristics, Asians have denial rates as high as other minority groups.

The main goal of this work is to identify the most important roads in a network. Herein, a new model is proposed to evaluate the most important roads in the network through the application of biclustering technique, identifying patterns of attributes (road performance measures) and patterns of roads (connectivity patterns). Thereafter the model presented here is compared with the mean geodesic distance variation. Both methodologies are applied to a case study and the pros and cons are discussed as well. Results point out the alpha index as the topological measure more relevant in the normal network flow; moreover the interruption of the links with highest values of connectivity will have larger consequences in the normal functioning of the network than the links with the lowest levels of connectivity. The approach here proposed is a useful insight of the network dynamics, which allows optimizing the worst-case performance of the system. This work can be useful for risk management actors, for civil protection agents, who need to decide on the effective allocation of human and physical resources and define priority areas, and for the government institutions which design the network of facilities.

We find that better than expected (i.e. good) news tend to reduce sovereign CDS spreads, whilst worse than expected (i.e. bad) news increases spreads. News from the three major economies has significant spillover effects on other national sovereign CDS markets but the volatility responses to domestic news and foreign news from the major economies differ. CDS spread volatility increases in response to all domestic news and good news tends to exert relatively stronger effects than bad news. In contrast, good news from the major economies is market calming and consistently reduces spread volatility and they are also economically more important than bad news. Bad news from China and the Eurozone generally increase volatility in other sovereign CDS markets but bad news from the U.S. has been calming for other sovereign CDS markets in the extended crisis period from 2007 to 2012. Our results suggest that market participants in the market for sovereign credit protection pay more attention to good news than bad news both at home and from the major economies in times of financial instability.

Rapid motorisation, particularly in South East Asia (SEA), has emerged as a global concern given the region's cumulative population, rate of industrialisation, and large-scale urbanisation. Thus, there is a compelling need to enhance our understanding of the underlying dynamics of how people perceive and use transportation such that transport planning is better placed to address the current, unsustainable travel patterns in SEA. Despite this need, there has been relatively limited SEA-based research that has endeavoured to examine travel perceptions and transport mode choice from a non-instrumental perspective. This research redresses this deficit by investigating the relationship between transport users' perceptions and travel behaviours within SEA, with a particular focus on psychosocial drivers of transport mode choice interfaced with more traditional instrumental measures. Spatially stratified survey data have been collected in a case study area, Johor Bahru, Malaysia, comprising users from different transport user groups. Employing regression modelling, drivers of individual's travel behaviour are examined. Results highlight the merit in recognising the role of non-instrumental motives alongside instrumental motives to explain transport mode choice. We conclude by highlighting that transport mode choices are motivated by a range of locational, socio-demographic, psychological and cultural determinants. The current research has contributed to a better understanding of transport mode choice in Johor Bahru and provides a foundation for future SEA-based travel behaviour research. Studies in this area can inform more sustainable travel behaviour in the SEA region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

HotCopper is the largest online stock message board in Australia and the sample of messages covers over 2000 companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) from January 2003 through December 2008. We exclude messages surrounding public price-sensitive announcements released centrally by the ASX in order to examine the private information content of internet board messages. We find that the number of board messages and message sentiment significantly and positively relate to the contemporaneous returns of underperforming (low ROE, EBIT margin, EPS) small capitalization stocks with high market growth potential (low book-to-market). Posting activity is positively associated with trading volume for small stocks and negatively associated with bid-ask spreads for small and large stocks in the short term. Bullish small stocks outperform bearish ones significantly in respective days and months, exhibiting no return reversals to pre-message board activity levels in subsequent time periods. Large stocks are not found to be affected by message board activity. We conclude that higher message board activity quickly reflects itself into the prices of small capitalization stocks in a highly regulated market like the ASX. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

One recently revived proposal would transform US dollar official reserves into claims denominated in the IMF's key currency basket, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). Drawing on new archival evidence and simulations, this article highlights issues that derailed earlier agreement on such an account and shortcomings of design and ambition revealed by subsequent developments. One design issue was account losses if US dollar yields failed to exceed SDR yields enough to offset dollar depreciation. In fact, uncovered interest parity did not hold and could well have left the account persistently insolvent. Another shortcoming was ambition: the proposed account proved simply too small to achieve the desired lowering of the dollar's share of foreign exchange reserves. Any new proposal needs to address these shortcomings.","[McCauley, Robert N.] Bank Int Settlements, Monetary & Econ Dept, Basel, Switzerland; [Schenk, Catherine R.] Univ Glasgow, Int Econ Hist, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",Bank for International Settlements (BIS); University of Glasgow,"Schenk, CR (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Int Econ Hist, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",catherine.schenk@glasgow.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [RES-062-23-2423]; ESRC [ES/H026029/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H026029/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors thank Michela Scatigna for research assistance and the Economic and Social Research Council for support (grant RES-062-23-2423).

High leverage is optimal for banks in a model that has just enough frictions for banks to have a meaningful role in liquid-claim production. The model has a market premium for (socially valuable) safe/liquid debt, but no taxes or other traditional motives to lever up. Because only safe debt commands a liquidity premium, banks with risky assets use risk management to maximize their capacity to include such debt in the capital structure. The model can explain why banks have higher leverage than most operating firms, why risk management is central to banks' operating policies, why bank leverage increased over the last 150 years or so, and why leverage limits for regulated banks impede their ability to compete with unregulated shadow banks.

We investigate the association between firms' liquidity level/mix and entrenchment within a system model accounting for endogeneity. Several results are obtained. Entrenched CEOs (i) hold more liquidity because it helps reduce their firm's risks, provides them with job and wealth security, and gives them discretion in pursuing personal objectives; (ii) prefer cash over lines of credit (LCs) because the latter are accompanied by bank monitoring; and (iii) use more LCs, despite their associated monitoring, because they provide extra liquidity. Sample disaggregation shows that increased liquidity due to CEO entrenchment can be attributed to smaller and more opaque firms large and transparent firms maintain their liquidity levels but increase their shares of cash. These findings imply that firms should align the interests of entrenched CEOs with those of shareholders to reduce the undesirable effects of entrenchment on liquidity management.

In addition, planning for accessibility is being promoted, which requires integrating land use with transportation planning, and to match the transportation features with the intensity and diversity of land use of the station areas. Nevertheless, and despite the evident similarities between the two approaches, an integrated evaluation tool of a station area in terms of its transportation, land use, and urban design features is missing. In this paper, we bring into the literature on integration of land use and transport a key feature of the transit-oriented development literature: the urban design features of the station areas, in particular their pedestrian friendliness. By complementing the node-place model with an evaluation of the pedestrian connectivity of station areas of Lisbon, we combine these two perspectives in order to evaluate and classify station areas in three different aspects: land use, transportation, and walkability conditions. Our results show that a balanced node-place is not necessarily a transit-oriented development, and vice versa, and so a complementary analysis of both is useful to identify and classify a station area. Therefore, we suggest a typology of station areas based on the three components, which might be used as a planning tool for the development of the station areas into balanced transit-oriented development areas.

We propose a conceptual frame within which a broad range of behavioral spillovers can be accounted for when applying behavioral science to policy challenges. We consider behaviors which take place sequentially and are linked, at a conscious or unconscious level, by some underlying motive. The first behavior leads to another behavior which can either work in the same direction as the first (promoting spillover), or push back against it (permitting or purging spillover). Looking through this conceptual lens at the existing evidence, we find pervasive evidence for all kinds of spillover effects across a variety of fields and domains. As a result, behavioral scientists, especially those seeking to inform policy, should try to capture all the ripples from one behavior to the next when a pebble of intervention is thrown in the pond, and not just at the immediate behavioral splash it makes.

I use data from Moody's Financial Metrics on its quantitative adjustments for off-balance-sheet debt and qualitative adjustments for soft factors. In the cross-section and for borrowers experiencing adverse economic shocks, I find that these adjustments are more favorable for PPrating firms than for other firms, consistent with rating agencies catering to the PPrating borrowers. I find that this catering is muted in two circumstances when rating agencies' reputational costs are higher than usual: (1) near the investment grade and prime short-term rating thresholds and (2) when Fitch Ratings also provides a rating.

This paper examines these challenges, revealing both the importance of community-driven sanitation improvement and its difficulties. The nature of the challenges, and the means by which two successful community-driven initiatives have overcome them, suggest that while recognizing the human right to sanitation is important this should not be taken to imply that typical rights-based approaches are the appropriate means of realizing this right.

Our results indicate significant effects of agricultural shocks on the child's overall work hours and agricultural work hours, with higher effects for boys. Crop shocks also have significant adverse effects on school attendance, with girls experiencing a more-than 70% increase in the probability of quitting schooling. The results also indicate that access to a bank account has a buffering effect on the impact of shocks on child hunger. Having a bank account reduces both male child labor and household work hours of a girl child. While assets reduce working hours of girls, we do not find it having a significant effect on boys.

By analyzing a panel of banks operating in the EU-15 from 1999 and 2011, our paper provides empirical evidence that supervisory culture influences the stability of banks.

To characterize diversification potential, we estimate spatial correlation and integration among 401 U.S. metropolitan housing markets. The 2000s boom brought a marked uptrend in housing market integration associated with eased residential lending standards and rapid growth in private mortgage securitization. As boom turned to bust, other macroeconomic factors, including employment and income fundamentals, importantly contributed to the trending up in housing return integration.

We find no evidence that Dodd-Frank disciplines CRAs to provide more accurate and informative credit ratings. Instead, following Dodd-Frank, CRAs issue lower ratings, give more false warnings, and issue downgrades that are less informative. These results are consistent with the reputation model of Morris (2001), and suggest that CRAs become more protective of their reputation following the passage of Dodd-Frank. Consistent with Morris (2001), we find that our results are stronger for industries with low Fitch market share, where Moody's and Standard & Poor's have stronger incentives to protect their reputation (Becker and Milbourn, 2011). Our results are not driven by business cycle effects or firm characteristics, and strengthen as the uncertainty regarding the passage of Dodd-Frank gets resolved. We conclude that increasing the legal and regulatory costs to CRAs might have an adverse effect on the quality of credit ratings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a model for the stock price process that allows for increased and asymmetric dependence between extreme return realizations. We isolate the portfolio hedging demands that arise due to extreme co-movements and find a substantial shift of the portfolio holdings toward the risk-free asset. We demonstrate that accounting for dependence between extreme events in portfolio decisions leads to significant economic gains that stem primarily from intertemporal hedging motives.

The standard interpretation of the effects of these policies is concerned with short-run market distortions associated with excess supply. Since price controls prevent markets from clearing, they lead to higher prices. While this analysis may be correct in the short-run, it does not consider the dynamic equilibrium consequences of price controls. We demonstrate that price floor regulations can have important long-run effects on the the structure of markets by crowding them and creating endogenous barriers to entry for low-cost retailers. Moreover, we show that these factors can indirectly lower productivity and possibly even prices. We test this in the context of an actual regulation imposed in the retail gasoline market in the Canadian province of Quebec and show that the policy led to more competition between smaller/less efficient stations. This resulted in lowered sales, and, despite the reduction in efficiency, did not increase prices.","[Esteban Carranza, Juan] Banco Republ, Cali, Colombia; [Esteban Carranza, Juan] Univ Icesi, Cali, Colombia; [Clark, Robert; Houde, Jean-Francois] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Clark, Robert] CIRPEE, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Houde, Jean-Francois] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Houde, Jean-Francois] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Banco de la Republica Colombia; Universidad ICESI; Universite de Montreal; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Carranza, JE (通讯作者)，Banco Republ, Cali, Colombia.",jcarraro@banrep.gov.co; Robert.clark@hec.ca; houde@wharton.upenn.edu,,"Clark, Robert/0000-0002-5197-8370; Carranza, Juan Esteban/0000-0002-8908-214X",,,,,37,17,21,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

However, a public choice literature exists that has long recognized that self-governance often works well and that the state may not be able to improve upon local economic institutions at reasonable cost. Although the implication that legal titling should proceed with caution is seemingly straightforward, the literature on legal titling does not take anarchy seriously as a policy option. In addition, there is a public choice literature that presumes the state is the most important source of property rights. This essay fills this gap in the property rights literature by applying the concept of efficient anarchy to legal titling in Afghanistan. Original fieldwork evidence from rural Afghanistan suggests that anarchy of land governance is a better option than legal titling. The essay concludes by opening up the black box of state building by explaining why it often makes sense to sequence improvements in political capacity and political constraints prior to investing in legal titling.","[Murtazashvili, Ilia; Murtazashvili, Jennifer] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Murtazashvili, I (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",imurtaz@pitt.edu; jmurtaz@pitt.edu,"Murtazashvili, Jennifer Brick/ABB-8461-2020","Murtazashvili, Jennifer Brick/0000-0003-4919-9287; Murtazashvili, Ilia/0000-0001-9096-9488","Democracy International, the Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit","Democracy International, the Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit","We are grateful to Peter T.

We show that firms with high rollover risk are less likely to enter the CP market, borrow less CP, and borrow more from bank credit lines.

The categories and terms used by workers to describe their employment situation are then contrasted with those used by the latest labour force survey in Tanzania. The article scrutinises how key employment categories have been translated from English into Swahili, how the translation biases respondents' answers towards the term 'self-employment', and how this, in turn, leads to the statistical invisibility of wage labour in the informal economy. The article also looks at the consequences of this 'statistical tragedy' and at the dangers of conflating varied forms of employment, including wage labour, that differ markedly in their modes of operation and growth potential. Attention is also paid to the trade-offs faced by policy-makers in designing better labour force surveys.","[Rizzo, Matteo] Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Kilama, Blandina] REPOA, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Wuyts, Marc] Erasmus Univ, Inst Social Sci, Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Rizzo, M (通讯作者)，Univ London, SOAS, Dept Dev Studies & Econ, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",mr3@soas.ac.uk,,,,,,,41,14,16,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

It also aims to examine the extent of the use of hedging theories in the prediction of CDs. Most of the available literature which focuses on the factors that determine the use of CDs are reviewed to achieve the main purpose. The findings show that the use of hedging theories is beneficial in the prediction of CDs as hedging instruments. In addition, the decision on the use of CDs as hedging instruments is positively and consistently associated with the size of banks, costs of financial distress, the use of other risk management instruments and the level of exposure to risk. At the same time, it is negatively associated with the capital positions of the banks. With regards to the factor of the liquidity of the asset, findings on the impact of the use of CDs are contradictory. Hence, this study provides an extensive review on the factors that influence the decision on the use of CDs by banks, as well as identify the theory that supports its use.

We provide new up-to-date estimates of ERPT by paying attention to either the time-series properties of data and variables endogeneity. Using VECM framework, we examine the pass-through at different stages along the distribution chain, that is, import prices, producer prices, and consumer prices. When carrying out impulse response functions analysis, we find a higher pass-through to import prices with a complete pass-through (after one year) detected for roughly half of EA countries. These estimates are relatively large compared to single-equation literature. We denote that the magnitude of the pass-through of exchange rate shocks declines along the distribution chain of pricing, with the modest effect recorded for consumer prices. When assessing for the determinant of cross-country differences in the ERPT, we find that inflation level, inflation volatility, and exchange rate persistence are the main macro-economic factors influencing the pass-through almost along the pricing chain. Thereafter, we have tested for the decline of the response of consumer prices across EA countries. According to multivariate time-series Chow test, the stability of ERPT coefficients was rejected, and the impulse responses of consumer prices over 1990-2010 provide an evidence of general decline in rates of pass-through in most of the EA countries. Finally, using the historical decompositions, our results reveal that external factors, that is, exchange rate and import prices shocks, have had important inflationary impacts on inflation since 1999 compared to the pre-EMU period.","[Ben Cheikh, Nidhaleddine; Louhichi, Wael] ESSCA Sch Management, F-49000 Angers, France",ESSCA School of Management,"Ben Cheikh, N (通讯作者)，ESSCA Sch Management, 1 Rue Lakanal, F-49000 Angers, France.",nbcheikh@gmail.com,"Ben Cheikh, Nidhaleddine/E-8449-2019","Ben Cheikh, Nidhaleddine/0000-0003-2550-6721",,,,,37,4,4,0,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78441-779-6; 978-1-78441-780-2,INT SYMP EC,,,2015,24.0,,,,,,113,162,,10.1108/S1571-038620150000024017,0.0,,,50,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358537900006,0

There has been a development of different methodologies and this in turn led to fragmentation of this area. The need for cost monitoring in the Czech Republic has led to introduction of a new methodology by Research Institute for Labour and Social Affairs (RILSA). This methodology is the main focus of this paper. Its main set of indicators consists of the labour costs, the relative proportion of labour to overall costs and the unit labour costs. The Czech Republic is compared to the European Union member countries and the United States in the period from 2007 to 2012. The European Union represents a partnership of countries that are on the contrary in the economic sense natural competitors.

As existing model for mosques performance are not available for comparison, this research is limited to the performance measurement frameworks based on for profit and non-profit organisations. Despite the perceived uniqueness of the mosques as faith-based non-profit organisations, this paper shows that learning from the private sectors' performance measurement models can also be applied to non-profits. The survey covered the whole of Malaysia including Sabah and Sarawak. Given the size of the population and the large geographical area to be covered, a self-administered questionnaire was used as the main method of data collection. Out of 217 questionnaires received, 203 (25.4%) were usable and valid for analyses. Structure Equation Model (SEM) was performed to analyse the data. The results show that there are positive significant relationship between the three main variables which are resources, processes and outputs which form the basis of performance measurement modelling. The findings from this study will benefit various stakeholders of the mosques especially those that are related to the management, congregations and religious authorities whom are directly affected by mosques performance.

The recent collapse of some large companies resulting partially from accounting manipulation has created an argument in term of the effectiveness of corporate governance mechanism toward investor protection. Effective corporate governance plays a key role to mitigate earnings manipulation. Therefore, boards have fiduciary responsibility to monitor the management to protect shareholders' interest. They also become an essential element of corporate governance and are considered the main internal mechanism in reducing earning manipulation. The proportion of board independence are also a crucial part to reduce the tendency of earnings manipulation due to their ability to withstand pressure from the firm to manipulate earnings and are better able to monitor earnings process. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between board independence and earnings manipulation by using Beneish profit model. This study employed the data from 372 Public Listed Companies in Malaysia from 2010 until 2013. The result of this study found that board independence has negative and significant relationship with earnings manipulation. These results indicate that higher number of independent directors will reduce the tendency of earnings manipulation. The finding of this study will be fruitful to industry by maintaining the appropriate numbers of directorship (independent non-executive directors) in the companies. Besides that, it may also assist the statutory bodies to strengthen and reinforce the composition of board of director in the companies. (C) 2015 The Authors.

A case study illustrates the social and environmental impacts of the expansion of agribusiness in central Argentina and the social struggle - both rural and urban - that has arisen to resist this process. Although government policies after the 2001 crisis differ in many ways from those of the 1990s, current agrarian policies are not significantly distinct from those followed during the pre-crisis neoliberal period. Rather than post-neoliberal', the new model could thus be better described as neo-extractivist'. With the connivance of the state, agribusiness is producing the largest-ever transformation of natural capital into economic capital in the history of the region. Moreover, the latest policy developments suggest that Argentina is on the threshold of a new and deeper stage of agrarian capital expansion and wealth concentration, this time operating at a much larger scale.","[Caceres, Daniel M.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Cordoba, Argentina; [Caceres, Daniel M.] Univ Nacl Cordoba, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of Cordoba,"Cáceres, DM (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Avda Valparaiso S-N,Ciudad Univ,X5000, Cordoba, Argentina.",dcaceres@agro.unc.edu.ar,,,Directorate For Geosciences [1138881] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),,,132,146,173,6,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The aim of the paper is to highlight and discuss the main features of these systems. The sickness insurance system was significantly reformed in 2009, when employers started to be involved in the system and began paying wage compensation in the first 14 calendar days of an employee's sickness. This led to a decrease of the average percentage of temporary incapacity for work; however, the average length of sickness grows. The structure of sickness insurance benefits has changed over the years as the ratio of sickness benefit decreases. The study further examines the revenues and expenses of the sickness insurance system, their values usually resulting in a surplus. The health system in the Czech Republic is described with emphasis on financing. The expenses on health as % of GDP are on a low level when compared to EU countries, reaching approximately 7 %. The Czech Republic is one of the leading countries in terms of utilizing public sources. In 2013, the ratio of public sources reached 85 % of all sources, from which the main part represents the collection of premium by the health insurance companies.","[Daler, Jan] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Daler, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xdaler@mendelu.cz,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4200-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,103,113,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF1SG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380432500012,0

At local elections, half of the constituencies have to vote in a single election (regional elections), whereas the other half cast two ballots (a departmental election and a regional election). Since these two categories of constituencies are distributed randomly, this context provides the conditions of a natural randomized experiment. Comparison of the turnout rates in both types of constituencies allows us to assess in a particularly robust way the significant impacts of mobilization activities and of the cost of voting on turnout in the context of double ballots. We estimate the average impact of an additional election at the national level on turnout to be around four percentage points, but this impact is much higher at the local level.","[Fauvelle-Aymar, Christine] Univ Tours, CITERES, UMR 7324, Tours, France; [Fauvelle-Aymar, Christine] Univ Orleans, UMR 7322, LEO, Orleans, France; [Francois, Abel] Strasbourg Univ LARGE, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, Strasbourg, France; [Francois, Abel] Telecom ParisTech, Dept SES, Paris, France",Universite de Tours; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Orleans; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Fauvelle-Aymar, C (通讯作者)，Univ Tours, CITERES, UMR 7324, Tours, France.",fauvelle@univ-tours.fr; abel.francois@unistra.fr,,,,,,,21,12,13,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2015,162.0,1-2,,,,,183,199,,10.1007/s11127-014-0212-0,0.0,,,17,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AW6ZK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346414000010,0

The parameters are estimated by means of a sequential matching procedure which adopts as an auxiliary model a time-varying generalization of the HAR model for the realized volatility series. It emerges that during the recent financial crisis the relative weight of the daily component dominates over the monthly term. The estimates of the two factor stochastic volatility model suggest that the change in the dynamic structure of the realized volatility during the financial crisis is due to the increase in the volatility of the persistent volatility term. A set of Monte Carlo simulations highlights the robustness of the methodology adopted in tracking the dynamics of the parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, what remains a puzzle is whether the ISO 14001 subscription has desirable effects on the participating firms. Such investment should only be advised if it can enhance firm's financial standing particularly for business oriented companies. Based on 17 companies certified with ISO 14001 which are listed in Malaysian Stock Exchange, this paper studies the impacts from this voluntarily action on firm financial performance through analysis of financial ratios. Three years of performance covering before and after the certification periods for selected ratios was analyzed using Paired Sample T-Test. The results show that the ISO 14001 certification does not significantly induce higher financial performance based on the perspective of firms' asset management, profitability, leverage, liquidity and earnings per share (EPS).

The reasons for this reluctance are largely unknown. We experimentally investigate and compare the investment behavior of organic and conventional pig farmers and examine the question whether the investment behavior changes ceteris paribus due to a varying framing - different description - of an investment possibility with organic or conventional farming. Our results show that pig farmers are more reluctant to invest in the production method which they are not currently applying compared to an investment in the production method in use on their farm. Conventional, risk-averse pig farmers and farmers who holding a university degree invest later in a hog barn. The results provide some evidence for that the effect of subsidies granted to encourage the conversion to organic farming is overestimated.","[Hermann, Daniel; Agethen, Katrin; Musshoff, Oliver] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Hermann, D (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Fak Agrarwissensch, Dept Agrarokonomie & Rurale Entwicklung, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",daniel.hermann@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Hermann, Daniel/HNI-8466-2023; Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Hermann, Daniel/0000-0003-0023-3675; Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",,,,,62,2,2,0,11,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Using Danish register data, we investigate the importance and workings of parental role models for the probability of becoming self-employed. We find that the effect of a self-employed father (mother) is much higher for males (females). These results are statistically and economically very significant, and they survive when we control for parental wealth and work experience from the parents' firms and when we exclude cases where the offspring takes over the family business. This points to a strong role for parental role models in explaining why self-employment runs in the family.","[Hoffmann, Anders] Danish Business Author, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Junge, Martin] DEA, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Junge, Martin; Malchow-Moller, Nikolaj] Copenhagen Business Sch, Ctr Econ & Business Res, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Malchow-Moller, Nikolaj] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School; University of Southern Denmark,"Malchow-Moller, N (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",andhof@erst.dk; mj@dea.nu; nmm@sam.sdu.dk,"Hadri, Valdet/AAE-5457-2021","Malchow-Moller, Nikolaj/0000-0001-5350-3152",,,,,30,66,76,4,81,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The main research question is to identify whether students from different selected disciplines exhibit different rates of enterprising potential, and if so, which are the differentiating attributes. In order to answer this question we conducted a pilot study using the General Enterprising Tendency v2 Test (GET2test) and analysing the enterprising potential of students in four different majors (business administration, applied informatics, psychology and pedagogy). Our sample comprised of 370 students from three different faculties at two universities in Slovakia. Our findings suggest that there are significant differences in the general enterprising tendency, as well as in three out of five its components (namely need for achievement, calculated risk taking and internal locus of control). Thus, students in different disciplines exhibit different rates of entrepreneurial predispositions. In our paper we present and discuss these findings, especially from the entrepreneurship education perspective in its broadest sense.","[Holienka, Marian; Gal, Peter] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Dept Strategy & Entrepreneurship, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia; [Holienkova, Jana] Univ SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava, Fac Arts, Dept Psychol, Trnava 91701, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava; University of SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava,"Holienka, M (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Dept Strategy & Entrepreneurship, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia.",marian.holienka@fm.uniba.sk; jana.holienkova@ucm.sk; peter.gal@fm.uniba.sk,"Gál, Peter/AAB-8794-2019; Holienka, Marian/N-8162-2015","Gál, Peter/0000-0001-8499-9533; Holienka, Marian/0000-0002-8975-6116",,,,,17,0,0,0,7,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,285,294,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000032,0

Examination relevant literature we attempted to clarify its fundamental concepts and to provide relevant examples from the global practice. The study was conducted with the respondents from the town of Split by means of a questionnaire, the purpose of which was to establish the level of existing environmental awareness and engagement in eliminating the problems. We also looked into the level of familiarity of the citizens of Split with the work of the Department of Environmental Protection of the local self-government of the town of Split, and conducted an interview with some of the official representatives of the town of Split in order to determine the extent to which the officials themselves recognize and use the concept of social marketing. The results revealed an insufficient employment of the concept of social marketing, which they mainly equated with advertising. Furthermore, the citizens demonstrated a good understanding of environmental issues and willingness to change their behaviour into being socially responsible, except young age group of citizens which are least willing to change their attitude, so it is necessary to communicate environmental programs via social networks which they consider the most accessible. The local self-government should conduct studies on the citizens' satisfaction, analyse the examples of good practice, implement concept of social marketing in the work, and collaborate with schools, faculties... in order to raise the citizens' awareness and to encourage them to actively think and act for the purpose of preserving their environment.","[Ivisic, Nikolina; Mihanovic, Zoran] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Ivisic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split, Croatia.",nikolina.ivisic@gmail.com; zmihanov@efst.hr,,,,,,,46,0,0,0,0,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,205,226,,,,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700012,0

Emotional intelligence (EQ) and entrepreneur cultural was associated with entrepreneurs. Among the success factors of entrepreneurs is to have a high level of emotional intelligence (EQ). Apart from having a high level of education, having a high level of emotional intelligence (EQ) can also help a person become more successful as an entrepreneur to compare with other entrepreneurs who have low emotional intelligence (EQ) as both should be balanced. With a high emotional intelligence (EQ), an entrepreneur can manage the business more orderly and disciplined. This will create a positive entrepreneurial culture. They can also adapt them in whatever situation to continue to manage the business and solve the problem in the best way. Entrepreneur culture is about behaviors and activities in managing the entrepreneur business. Those activities will later determine the success of failure rate of the entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs should strive to improve their emotional intelligence (EQ) and discipline to succeed in any field of work, especially when facing the situations that require competence to decide the best option. Hence, emotional intelligence (EQ) affects the way entrepreneurs run their business. Entrepreneurs need to perform the activities to move forward in a positive and sustainable competition.

Shadow banking can be regarded as one of the causes of potential financial instability because these activities are realised outside the regulated banking sector. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor and measure the interconnectedness of banking and shadow banking activities. The aim of the paper is to measure the national distribution of banking and shadow banking activities in the Euro Area countries and assess the relationship between these activities and credit lending standards imposed by banking institutions. When measuring the shadow banking activity at national level, the shadow banking activities are most extensive in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. We conclude that banking institutions of the analysed countries originated less loans in reaction to tighter lending standards imposed by these banking institutions on their loans. However, the expected positive impact of tighter lending standards on loans provided by shadow banking institutions is confirmed only in some countries.","[Kucerova, Zuzana] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Econ Policy, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 72101, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Kucerová, Z (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Econ Policy, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 72101, Czech Republic.",zuzana.kucerova@vsb.cz,"Kucerova, Zuzana/K-6162-2018","Kucerova, Zuzana/0000-0001-6888-9262",,,,,10,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,461,469,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000051,0

Taking a differences-in-differences approach, this study finds that the probability of males marrying in a village increased by altering its customary land inheritance rule in favor of widows. In the light of the traditional system favoring exogamous and patrilocal marriage, this finding indicates that females relocate at marriage in response to the favorable land tenure system at the destination.

To date, little is known about how the design of government policy potentially affects the level of corruption in a country, even though there is growing recognition that the design and administration of tax and spending policies play important roles in promoting or discouraging corrupt practices. Using a large sample of countries over the 1995-2009 period, this paper fills the gap by conducting the first analysis in the literature to examine the significance of the tax structure, as measured by both tax mix and tax complexity, in determining corruption. Our results suggest the following: (1) countries relying more heavily on direct taxes tend to exhibit less corruption than countries that rely more heavily on indirect taxes, and (2) countries with more complex tax systems tend to be more corrupt than countries with less complex tax systems. These results are robust across alternative measures of corruption and tax structure and alternative estimations with and without correcting the potential endogeneity issue of the tax structure variables.","[Liu, Yongzheng] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Feng, Haibo] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Jinan University,"Liu, YZ (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",yongzheng.liu@ruc.edu.cn; fjash@sina.com,,,,,,,46,14,16,4,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2015,162.0,1-2,,,,,57,78,,10.1007/s11127-014-0194-y,0.0,,,22,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AW6ZK,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346414000004,0

Such interest to these regions is not random because exactly at the junction of regions, as in the junction of different sciences, identifies and opens up new mechanisms of interaction which could be tested in new non-standard approaches directed on strengthening of their competitiveness. In EU context population distribution on maritime coastal regions basins is the following: in the coastal regions of the Mediterranean Sea lives most of all the population from all inhabitants of coastal areas - 36,0%, in the North-Eastern shores of the Atlantic Ocean - 29,4%, at the coast of the North Sea - 20,6%, Baltic - 10,9%, and at the coast of the Black Sea and in Outermost Regions - 3,1%. Lithuania, along with such countries as Romania, Germany, Poland, Bulgaria and Slovenia is among the countries where the share of the population living in coastal areas is less than 15%. At the same time, for such countries as Sweden, Portugal, Greece, Ireland, Cyprus, Malta and Denmark this percentage is over 80, and for other countries varies from 32 to 74%, in particular for Italy 66%. Coastline have 23 of the 28 EU states. This study focuses on the role and place of the coastal region of Lithuania - Klaipeda region in the overall economy of the country. Formal coastline in Lithuania is 99 km or about 8% of the total length of the border, as opposed to 36% (498 km) in Latvia and 12,5% (440 km) in Poland. Since the Lithuanian segment of the Curonian Spit (about 60 km) as well as on the territories around Palanga and between Palanga and Sventoji located only recreation areas, they affect the economic performance of the region only in the recreation and tourism which on the coast is seasonal. Therefore Lithuanian stable economically active coastline is still much smaller and makes not more than 15-20 km, concentrating around Klaipeda and on an interval from Sventoji to Butinge. In this regard, having only one commercial port of Klaipeda and specialized port only on oil pumping in Butinge, Lithuania unfavorably differs from other neighboring countries, which may have a greater positive impact on the development of coastal areas and increase their competitiveness, which along with metropolitan regions are most commonly the engines of the economy throughout the country. Is no exception in this line and the Klaipeda region in Lithuania. Research methodology is based on a comparative evaluation of Klaipeda region compared with other regions of Lithuania. To prove the role and weight of the coastal regions in the overall economy of the country, different authors use different quantitative and qualitative indicators to assess their impact on coastal as well as to be compared with them regions. There is therefore noted a big role of clustering to increase competitiveness, efficiency and dynamic development as the industrial and services sectors as well territories. Through the use of two groups of cluster analysis - a divide and merge methodology for clustering and also the Ward's method, which gives out algorithm of clustered territories for an assessment of distances between clusters, was shown and analyzed the role of relationships and mutual influence of the coastal region with other regions of Lithuania. Suggested in this work the methodology can significantly specify directions of interaction between regions of Lithuania to enhance the overall competitiveness of the Lithuanian economy and create products and services with high added value.

It uses data for the period 1993-2014 and the Bayesian estimation method of instrumental variables. This method exploits a priori information from similar studies for other countries and considers the potential endogeneity of macroeconomic developments vis-a-vis non-performing loans. The estimation results reveal a strong persistence of NPLs and a significantly positive and robust, effect of economic growth and income effect of the exchange rate on the financial condition of borrowers. We also find a significantly negative and robust effect of lending rates on the financial condition of borrowers. The effects of inflation and unemployment are significant but not as robust as the experience of other countries suggests. The balance sheet effect of the exchange rate is positive, but its significance is changing with model specifications.

In order to express the share of effect of intensive factors on the economic development, it uses special dynamic parameters of intensity and extensity.","[Mihola, Jiri; Kotesovcova, Jana] Vysoka Skola Financni, Spravni, Czech Republic",,"Mihola, J (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Financni, Spravni, Czech Republic.",jiri.mihola@quick.cz; jkotesovcova@volny.cz,"Kotěšovcová, Jana/JGD-5630-2023",,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-547-9,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2015,5.0,,Pt 2,,,,258,266,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM2SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000461418800032,0

Employing dynamic panel data methods, we obtain the following results. First, education (or labor productivity) has slightly higher wage effects in the Border-North region. Second, allowing for foreign capital and labor to respond to wages, returns to education have higher effects in South-Center Mexico, the region with (average) lower education levels. Third, convergence rates become lower with endogenous foreign capital and migration flows: wages move faster in the South-Center region than in Border-North. Overall, migration flows have greater effects on wages than foreign direct investment inflows.

There are many channels through which international migration affects institutional outcomes and democracy in sending countries. Its effect can be positive or negative depending on who migrates, to where, and on how migration affects education and occupational choices. For convenience I divide here these various channels into traditional political economy approaches (rent seeking/avoiding models, models of competition across jurisdictions, Laffer effects due to education, occupation and location choices) inducing policy responses on the supply side and channels pertaining to democracy diffusion involving adjustments of preferences on the demand side. The political economy literature is very rich theoretically and rather poor empirically. The opposite is true for the democracy diffusion literature which is essentially agnostic at a theory level but rich of a growing number of careful case-studies. Finally, cross-country comparisons show an overall positive effect of emigration on the institutional development of source countries; however, the channels through which such an effect operates are not identified.","Univ Paris 01, Ecole Econ Paris, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Rapoport, H (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Ecole Econ Paris, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",,,,,,,,64,1,1,0,22,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Purpose of Study, The aim of the paper is to carry out an assessment of potential complexity-related risks which exist in a specific project and how they can be made manageable. Methods, Develop an evaluation model to assess potential complexity-related risks in the context of the strategic project outsourcing. Based on the current status of scientific, outsourcing experts are interviewed by means of interviews, such as problem descriptions and recommendations of the theory consistent with practical experience. Findings and Results, The result of the study is a evaluation model to assess potential risks and transfer to the presented business situation. The discussion will show which methods and tools for managing outsourcing projects can be used. Conclusions and Recommendations, The model as confirmed by the research results can be applied and recommended as a way to deal with the risks resulting from complexity and can be used in specific business situations to take the appropriate strategic decisions.

On the basis of the financial world as it currently operates, we propose to identify the paradoxes and the likely evolution of a banking and financial system evolving. Based on the facts, this chapter seeks to extend the discussions initiated in the last chapter, entitled Socially responsible banks? of our book The management of the bank, published by Vuibert editions. The frantic pace of innovation and the requirements of regulators encourage banks to review their organization and their governance. This chapter attempts to position the bank between two paradoxes: on one side, the crises have not made more responsible banks. The facts remain: rates and currency manipulation, embezzlement rules on bonuses, even if some are still under financial assistance of the United States. On the other hand, the  finance otherwise innovates, disturbs, and upsets. Creative players such as collaborative funding or virtual currencies are not really threatening to the big banks. But in the past, marked by their personnel costs and infrastructure cannot meet the agility of these new entrants crowdfunding, and other online payment methods have backed the Web. These innovations really threaten banks that do not lack the resources to adapt. And if tomorrow, the banks no longer existed? Behavior changes and already a growing number of clients save, borrow, and lend the use of means of payment to settle their online purchases without using the services of traditional financial institutions! A certainty, finance otherwise, will play a stimulatory role. The speed and magnitude of change is such that it becomes necessary for banks and financial institutions to adapt to these new technologies to increase or simply maintain their business. Based on the facts, the chapter explores and analyzes the developments that may become sustainable for a banking system reluctant to lose the monopoly of the distribution of credit and means of payment. The end of the banks, is a provocative subject but insufficiently addressed in the economic literature.","Univ Paris 13, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France",Universite Paris 13,"Roux, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, Fac Econ & Management Sci, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.",michel.roux@univ-paris13.fr,,,,,,,4,3,3,0,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78441-779-6; 978-1-78441-780-2,INT SYMP EC,,,2015,24.0,,,,,,517,536,,10.1108/S1571-038620150000024027,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358537900016,0

However, empirical investigations of this particular effect have been scarce. This paper tests the existence of the local knowledge advantage in a real-world setting. Specifically, it looks at the variation in local knowledge across regions based on the origins and careers of regional politicians, assuming that politicians who have spent more time in a particular region possess more and better knowledge of that region than outsiders. To avoid the reverse causality problem, the paper investigates how local origins affected the performances of politicians in a 'natural experimental' environment, studying the responses of regional governors in Russia to disastrous forest fires in 2010. We confirm that local knowledge improves gubernatorial performance. In a highly centralized federation such as Russia, though, the effect is dependent on access to federal resources obtainable through close ties to the federal center. We also discuss alternative interpretations of the local origins of politicians and test whether the effects found are indeed more plausibly explained by local knowledge.","[Schultz, Andre; Libman, Alexander] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany",Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Schultz, A (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",a.schultz@fs.de; a.libman@fs.de,,"Libman, Alexander/0000-0001-8504-3007",,,,,64,19,19,3,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2015,162.0,1-2,,,,,25,42,,10.1007/s11127-014-0187-x,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AW6ZK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346414000002,0

A lack of cross-functional integration has been reported in four major international contracting organisations both vertically in the management hierarchy and horizontally along project lifecycles. One of the main aspects previously reported was the low level of management coordination and hence integration of value propositions between business development and bid management functions. This paper examines the matter further. It specifically examines business development (BD) and bid management (BM) in two additional major contractors where the two functions are combined under a single functional department. In the department, the same personnel manage BD and bidding. It poses the research question as to whether this leads to greater levels of coordination and integration. Two dimensions are examined in particular, namely understanding client needs to develop value propositions through BD and developing win-strategies during BM to potentially add value and deliver benefits during execution. The conceptual lens of marketing in construction is used for analysis. There are two main findings. First, the degree of coordination is marginally improved, yet the understanding and effort committed to BD was lower compared to BM. Therefore, the ability to develop win-strategies during BM was compromised by the lower emphasis on BD. Second, it was found that the level of integration between the two functions and with other functions, such as procurement and supply chain management, was low. This compromised the value propositions and delivery of benefits. The outcome is a contractor focus upon survival with sub-optimal strike rates and value propositions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The aim of the paper is to examine impact of GDP growth, budget balance, debt and the fiscal rules index on government bond yield spread. The empirical evidence is based on unbalanced annual panel data of 15 EU countries (time span is divided into a pre-crisis and a post-crisis period), data are taken from Eurostat and OECD database. Explanatory variables are not examined in individual regressions, but the study uses Generalized Method of Moments. For a model specification, Dynamic Panel Data Model Wizard is applied. Evidence shows that before the financial crisis investors generally ignored bond risk factors in individual countries, but the spreads sharply diverged from year 2008. Results confirm statistically significant impact of fiscal fundamentals on government bond yield spread. In a post-crisis period, findings report raising of importance fiscal variables for spread and the GDP growth became a major determinant of government bond yield spreads, followed by the budget balance and debt development.","[Szarowska, Irena] Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm, Dept Finance, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Szarowská, I (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm, Dept Finance, Univ Nam 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",szarowska@opf.slu.cz,"Szarowská, Irena/J-6391-2012","Szarowská, Irena/0000-0002-5197-6455",,,,,22,0,0,2,2,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,596,604,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200078,0

Racial and ethnic differentials are more troubling because the largest gaps correspond to the fast-growing Hispanic population.

We have to know the factors of digital divide to find solutions for eliminating disparities in ICTs.The first goal of our research is to measure or calculate the digital divide in Hungary. The digital divide is a complex and multidimensional issue, which requires taking into account diverse technologies, variables, and territories. In this context, factor analysis has revealed as a useful tool to capture the overall dimension of the digital divide. Therefore our research is based on different ICT indicators from Eurostat statistics and the Empirica survey results. Our research focuses on the digital divide circumstances in Hungary. The investigated fields are the followings: Percentage of households with access to the Internet; Percentage of households with a broadband connection; Percentage of individuals regularly using the Internet at least once a week; Percentage of individuals who have never used a computer; Percentage of individuals who ordered goods or services online for private use. The correlation matrix in our research (which comes from factor analysis) shows that all variables are closely related to each other, with correlation coefficients larger than 0.8. For instance, the percentage of individuals who have never used a computer is highly and negatively correlated with using the Internet and having access at home because most people are connected to the Internet through a computer. Furthermore, the high and positive correlations of broadband infrastructural and usage indicators show the increasing importance of high-speed connections: many of the latest online services, are only possible through fast networks. Given these strong correlations, factor analysis seems to be appropriate.Since the EU has been paying special attention to bridging the rural-urban digital divide the relationship between ICT factor and population density has also been analyzed. Furthermore, the percentage of population aged 65 and over is included to capture the potential influence of regional demographic differences on the extent of ICT adoption. In this sense, older people often face more barriers to use ICT than younger individuals. The highest correlations with ICT factor are found for GDP per capita, human resources in science and technology, in contrast to population density, which shows the lowest one among the considered variables. This article shows our research results on the field of digital divide factors using by statistical analyses. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This paper fills the gap by examining the cash holdings of US property-liability (P-L) insurers in order to analyze the difference in cash holding and cash adjustments between public and private insurers and between mutual and stock insurers within the private insurers category. We find that the cash holdings of insurers are mean-reverting. Different from the findings for industrial firms but consistent with the argument that public firms have a lower cost of financing than private firms, we find that public insurers hold less cash than private insurers. Consistent with the managerial discretion argument, we find mutual insurers tend to hold less cash than private stock insurers. In regard to excess cash, public insurers tend to hold more excess cash than private insurers, supporting the agency theory that managers of public firms like more free cash flows to reduce firm risk and increase managerial discretion. Mutual insurers also hold more excess cash than private stock insurers due to their limited access to the capital market. In addition, public insurers are found to adjust cash holdings faster toward their target cash levels when there is a cash shortfall and slower when there is cash excess than private insurers would. Mutual insurers adjust cash holdings slower toward their target cash levels than private stock insurers in the cases of both cash shortfall and cash excess.","[Wang, Yuling; Zhao, Guiqin] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Finance, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Xie, Xiaoying; Lu, Weili] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Finance, Fullerton, CA 92831 USA",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Xie, XY (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Finance, Fullerton, CA 92831 USA.",wang.yuling@mail.shufe.edu.cn; xxie@fullerton.edu; zhaogq@mail.shufe.edu.cn; wlu@fullerton.edu,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,1,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-614-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,48,89,,,,,,42,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376410500005,0

The traffic signs tracking system must deal with real conditions with data that are frequently obtained in poor light condition, fog and heavy rain or are otherwise disturbed. Completely same problem is solved by mapping companies that are producing geospatial data for different information systems, navigations, etc. Examples of such companies can be TomTom or Mapy.cz.

As the choice of risk weights affects the regulatory capital ratio, economic theory suggests that banks with a higher cost of equity should be more aggressive in reducing risk weights. We consider a large panel of international banks and find that, after controlling for a number of bank and country characteristics and contrary to what happens for a non-Basel II bank, for a Basel II bank a higher cost of equity is not associated with a higher ratio between risk-weighted assets and total assets. These results are obtained in the context of state-of-theart endogeneity-robust econometric procedures and across several specifications. We propose an indicator of risk weights saving and assess its impact on several performance measure during the 2008-2009 and the 2010-2012 crises. We find that for European banks not located in peripheral countries, a higher degree of RWA-saving is associated with more equity raising during the European crisis, more volatility, and lower distance-to-default. European banks located in peripheral countries engaged less strongly in RWA-saving than European banks located in core countries, and its impact on the various performance measures is almost nonexistent, except for a decrease in the distance-to-default.

An accompanying assumption is that gender diversity positively affects one of the aspects of team performance in form of group cooperation. However, it is unclear whether this positive effect can be achieved if diversity increases due to a quota rule. In two fully incentivized experiments involving a real-effort task (N-1 = 188 and N-2 = 2 6 8), we examined the impact of quotas as compared to performance-based promotion on group cooperation. We thereby categorized participants either with regard to gender or to an artificial category that was randomly assigned. Cooperation within groups declined when promotion was based on quota compared to performance-based promotion, irrespective of the categorization criterion.

We then design a hedging mechanism for this risk exposure and examine its contribution to the corporate value of the teams. In particular, we use the Wang transform model to incorporate the decision makers' risk preferences in the evaluation of the weather derivatives, where the risk aversion parameters are obtained from a survey of J.

These reforms marked a dramatic change in Japan's compulsory education system in two main respects: from April 2002, every Saturday became a public school holiday and instructional time was reduced following the government's revisions of national curriculum guidelines, leaving private schools largely unaffected. Based on aggregate data taken from the Child Study Expenditure Survey, the difference-indifferences estimation households with children attending public schools as the treatment group and those attending private schools as the control group reveals that the 2002 educational reforms increased target household expenditure on supplementary education by 13% and spending on outdoor activities/volunteering, arts, sports, and cultural activities by 23%. Disaggregated analysis based on microdata taken from the National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure carried out by the Bureau of Statistics further reveals that the impacts of these educational reforms were larger for higher-income households than for lower-income ones.

Yet, the determinants and rationale of gendered access to land are not well understood. This paper argues that gender relations are more than the outcomes of negotiations within households. It explains the importance of social norms, perceptions, and formal and informal rules shaping access to land for male and female farmers at four levels: (1) the household/family, (2) the community, (3) the state, and (4) the market. The framework is applied to Ghana, using the results from qualitative field work. Norms on household and family organization and on men's and women's responsibilities and capabilities play a key role in gendered allocation of resources. However, these norms and perceptions are dynamic and evolve jointly with the development of markets and changes in values of inputs such as labor and land. Theoretical models that represent the gendered distribution of assets as the result of intrahousehold bargaining should be revised, and extrahousehold factors should be included. From a policy perspective, laws that ensure gender equality in terms of inheritance and a more gender-equitable distribution of property upon divorce can play a key role in improving women's property rights. Yet, their impact may be limited where customary rights dominate and social norms and rules continue to discriminate according to gender. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Tourism is crucial for the economies of Spain and China, and both countries have the longest high speed rail (HSR) networks in the world. What role has HSR infrastructure played in the development of tourism in both countries? Little research has been done to date, even in Europe, to estimate empirically how tourism indicators are affected by new HSR lines. In 2012 a multivariate panel analysis by Chen and Haynes was applied to 27 Chinese regions, and confirmed that emerging highspeed rail services (during the period 1999-2010) had significant positive impacts on boosting tourism in China. No similar empirical tool has ever been tested in Europe. The aim of this paper is to analyse and validate this tool when applied to the Spanish context, and to develop a comparative analysis with the Chinese case study. The methodology is applied to 47 Spanish provinces during the period 1999-2015, and the results clearly reveal a positive but lower-value link (compared to China) between the increase in certain tourism outputs (foreign arrivals and revenues) and HSR network construction. However, further research is needed into the model's limitations, namely the availability of suitable tourism indicators in the official databases, the HSR explanatory variables considered, and the ability to detect circular cause-effects between HSR and tourism.

But how do we explain the acceptance of such disadvantageous offers? We propose that buyers represent offers in terms of costs and benefits in a conditional goal-related mental rule along the lines of if a cost is paid, a benefit is obtained. This representation would be influenced by BAS (approach) and BIS (avoidance) motivational systems. Behavioural approach system (BAS) would trigger seeking evidence confirming the offer and would lead us to accept it. Behavioural inhibition system (BIS), on the contrary, seeks disconfirming evidence, leading to rejection of the offer. Activation of approach and avoidance motivation would be influenced by internal variables and the context. We carried out three experiments where participants were told to check if.a deceptive conditional offer was a cheat in a thematic Wason Selection Task. Experiment 1 showed that participants preferred confirmatory selection when the benefit was linked to a human need. In Experiment 2, warning information indicating cheating was introduced, while in Experiment 3 information about product alternatives was added to the instructions. We found a weakening of confirmatory card selection in Experiment 2, and a clear preference towards falsifying selection in Experiment 3. These results support the role of approach and avoidance motivated reasoning in buying/selling exchanges. Implications of these results are discussed in comparison with cheater detection algorithm and conformation bias predictions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The opportunity of African countries to convert these changes into demographic dividends for growth and poverty reduction will depend on several factors. The outlook will likely be good if African countries can continue the gains already made under better institutions and policies, particularly those affecting the productivity of labor, such as educational outcomes. If African countries can continue to build on the hard-won development gains, the demographic dividend could account for 11-15% of gross domestic product (GDP) volume growth by 2030, while accounting for 40-60 million fewer poor in 2030. The gains can become more substantial with better educational outcomes that allow African countries to catch up to other developing countries. If the skill share of Africa's labor supply doubles because of improvements in educational attainment, from 25 to about 50% between 2011 and 2030, then the demographic dividends can expand the regional economy additionally by 22% by 2030 relative to the base case and reduce poverty by an additional 51 million people.","[Ahmed, S.

As private tutoring involves two decisions: (1) whether to take private tuition or not, and (2) how much to spend on private tutoring conditional on positive decision in (1), we analyze the determinants of the two decisions separately using a Hurdle model. We find that private tutoring is not a new phenomenon in India: a significant proportion of students at each stage of schooling took private tutoring even in 1986/87, and there has been no dramatic increase in those proportions. Students from urban areas, private schools, and from better economic backgrounds are more likely to take private tutoring. Furthermore, the demand for private tutoring is inelastic at each stage of schooling, which implies that private tutoring is a necessary good in the household consumption basket. We also find evidence of pro-male bias in both decisions regarding private tutoring.","[Azam, Mehtabul] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies Business, 326 Business Bldg, Stillwater, OK 74074 USA; [Azam, Mehtabul] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Azam, M (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies Business, 326 Business Bldg, Stillwater, OK 74074 USA.",mazam@okstate.edu,,,,,,,28,32,36,2,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

We construct a simple lobbying environment where an uninformed policy-maker is a price-setter who sells access to two opposed and privately informed lobbyists. The key equilibrium property is the curse of the ex ante favored lobbyist; the lobbyist proposing a project with the higher expected public value ends up worse off than the lobbyist proposing a project with the lower expected public value. In the absence of contribution caps, the ex ante favored lobbyist strategically devalues her project, and the resulting competitive devaluations destroy private values, revenues, as well as correlated public values. Ex ante, the policy-maker benefits from a binding contribution cap protects the ex ante favored lobbyist, eliminates competitive devaluations, and thus remedies the hold-up problem.","[Gregor, Martin] Charles Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Gregor, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.",martin.gregor@fsv.cuni.cz,"Gregor, Martin/A-6295-2008","Gregor, Martin/0000-0002-7657-724X",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P402/12/G097],Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"I thank two reviewers and participants at the European Public Choice Society Meeting 2013 in Zurich, Central European Program in Economic Theory Meeting 2014 in Udine, and the European Public Choice Society Meeting 2015 in Groningen for their useful comments on a preliminary version of the paper.

We show that user groups will manage a resource more efficiently when confronted with such a non-concave resource growth function, compared to groups facing a logistic growth function. Even among cooperative groups there is a significant behavioral difference, although theory predicts there should not be. We argue that effectiveness of communication is endogenous to the problem; the threat of reaching a critical tipping point, beyond which the growth rate will drop drastically, triggers more effective communication within the group, enabling stronger commitment for cooperation and more knowledge sharing, which together explains the results. We argue that the insights generated by this study can be seen as one of many, but nevertheless important, contributions towards an increased understanding of the interactions between human behavior and the environment in common-pool resource systems.","[Lindahl, Therese; Crepin, Anne-Sophie; Schill, Caroline] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, Box 50005, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lindahl, Therese; Crepin, Anne-Sophie; Schill, Caroline] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics; Stockholm University,"Lindahl, T (通讯作者)，Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, Box 50005, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden.;Lindahl, T (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Kraftriket 2B, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",therese@beijer.kva.se,,"Schill, Caroline/0000-0001-7628-4829; Lindahl, Therese/0000-0003-4089-1509; Crepin, Anne-Sophie/0000-0002-7370-2973",European Union [226248]; Arctic Climate Change Economy and Society [265863]; Ebba and Sven Schwartz foundation,European Union(European Union (EU)); Arctic Climate Change Economy and Society; Ebba and Sven Schwartz foundation,"We are thankful for valuable comments received from Aart de Zeeuw, Amnon Rapoport, Anabela Bothelo, Mathias Ekstrom, Scott Barrett, Steve Polasky, Ted Groves and two anonymous reviewers as well as from seminar participants of the following conferences, workshops, and meetings: the workshop on Economics of Complex Systems, the Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics, Stockholm (April 2014); the CSID workshop, University of Arizona in Tempe, Arizona (March 2013); the ASSA annual meeting, San Diego (January 2013); the Department of Economics, Tromso University (November 2012); the Department of Economics, Umea University (October 2013); the Swedish National Conference for Economists, Stockholm (September 2012); and the EAERE conference, Prague (June 2012).

The functions of traditional institutions also help to address context-specific local issues, thereby avoiding the application of a one-size-fits-all approach that has continued to be a common problem in the development process. The challenge is designing appropriate policies and institutional frameworks that create conducive environments for an effective deployment of traditional institutions to promote desirable development goals. Our study shares experience in the application of traditional dispute resolution in land administration in Lay Armachiho Woreda (district) of the Amhara region in Northern Ethiopia. The Amhara regional government created Shemagle Shengos (popularly elected traditional arbitration committees) at the Kebele (local) level and gave them judicial mandate to address land disputes among farmers through the use of customary practices. The study thus examines the role and functions of the arbitration committees and assesses their effectiveness in dispute resolution including the potential to strengthen land administration capacity. Overall, the Ethiopian experience shows that traditional institutions and interactions work effectively if there are appropriate operational frameworks that harness their natural qualities (e.g., convenience, access, and participation) while aligning their functions with policy norms that direct the development process.

This paper studies the long-run welfare benefits of optimizing the design of the existing renewable energy subsidy (the status quo) in the presence of heterogeneity in the offset emissions. In particular, I measure the welfare gain from differentiating renewable subsidies across location and time to reflect the environmental benefits from emissions offset in the context of wind energy in the Texas electricity market. I find that the welfare gain from differentiation is small compared to the gain already achieved under the status quo subsidy. In contrast, the optimal emissions tax yields much larger welfare gain because it engages in other cost-effective emissions abatement channels that renewable energy subsidies do not: namely, demand conservation and cross-plant fuel substitution.","[Wibulpolprasert, Wichsinee] Thailand Dev Res Inst, 565 Ramkhamhaeng 39, Bangkok 10310, Thailand",,"Wibulpolprasert, W (通讯作者)，Thailand Dev Res Inst, 565 Ramkhamhaeng 39, Bangkok 10310, Thailand.",wichsine@alumni.stanford.edu,,,,,,,31,7,7,0,16,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

Fatal and non-fatal burdens of road traffic injuries display contrasting external shape dynamics and intra-distribution mobility. The results show that while the shape of the global distribution of YLD due to road traffic injuries (RTIs) has become tighter over time, the cross-country distributions of mortalities, DALYs, and YLL from road crashes have become more dispersed. The implication of the results is that international efforts should make a priority of targeting the prevention of a greater spreading out of the distribution of the burden of fatal RTIs. The exchange of relative positions within the distributions is substantial, but there is no linear relationship between a country's change in its relative position for the burden of fatal and non-fatal RTI distributions. Thus, further research is needed to determine whether policy interventions dealing with the burden of fatal RTIs also alleviate the burden of non-fatal RTIs and vice versa. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, China's agriculture has experienced a large expansion of machine rentals and machine services provided by specialized agents, which has contributed to mechanization of agricultural production. On the other hand, the empirical results show that an increase in non-agricultural wage rates leads to expansion of self-cultivated land size. A rise in the proportion of non-agricultural income or the migration rate also increases the size of self-cultivated land. Interestingly, however, relatively educated farm households decrease the size of self-cultivated land, which suggests that relatively less educated farmers tend to specialize in farming. The demand for machine services has also increased if agricultural wage and migration rate increased over time, especially among relatively large farms. The results on crop income also support complementarities between rented-in land and machine services (demanded), which implies that scale economies are arising in Chinese agriculture with mechanization and active land rental markets.

Based on panels of both provincial-level and city-level data for the period of 1999-2010, our empirical results shows that: (1) the supply of public housing has crowding-out effect on the supply of market housing in China but its degree is generally moderate; (2) the crowding-out effect varies substantially under different scenarios; (3) the crowding effect changes over time but its estimation accuracy is gradually improving in the sample period.

For the purpose of this paper we also allow consumption to cause environmental damage. Analysing the social context of consumption naturally lends itself to the use of game theoretic tools. We shall be concerned with two ways in which social interactions affect consumer preferences and behaviour: socially-embedded preferences, where the behaviour of other consumers affect an individual's preferences and hence consumption (we consider two examples: conspicuous consumption and consumption norms) and socially-directed preferences where people display altruistic behaviour. Our aim is to show that building links between sociological and behavioural economic approaches to the study of consumer behaviour can lead to significant and surprising implications for conventional economic analysis and policy prescriptions, especially with respect to environmental policy.","[Dasgupta, Partha] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Dasgupta, Partha; Southerton, Dale; Ulph, Alistair] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Ulph, David] Univ St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",University of Cambridge; University of Manchester; University of St Andrews,"Ulph, A (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",alistair.ulph@manchester.ac.uk,,"Ulph, David/0000-0003-3171-1270; Southerton, Dale/0000-0002-1561-5521",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H044914/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H044914/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,75,26,26,5,60,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Our analysis produces several major findings. First, diversified banks are different from specialized banks in their board structure, monitoring function of audit committee, and the level of antitakeover provisions. Second, governance mechanisms are associated with bank diversification: as the level of diversification increases, board independence, institutional ownership, and managerial entrenchment decrease whereas the ratio of certified inside board directors significantly increases. Our results show that governance structure particularly the leadership structure, the ratio of certified inside directors on the board, and the level of managerial entrenchment plays an important role in determining the excess value of diversified banks. The findings provide some insights for bank policymakers, including the proper design or regulation of bank governance structures, which is critical to bank performance because regulation is no longer a substitute for bank governance.

In this paper we extend popular discrete time short-rate models to include Markov switching of infinite dimension.

Applied to weekly U.S. data we find significant parameter change over time and strong evidence of non-Gaussian conditional distributions.

Female Disadvantage in Private School Enrollment in India,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,private school enrollment; female disadvantage; parental altruism; household fixed-effects model; India,PANEL-DATA MODELS; CHILD HEALTH; GENDER BIAS; RURAL INDIA; EDUCATION; GIRLS; MORTALITY; COHORT; GAP,"Women make up one-half of the world's population, though two-thirds of the world's non-literate adults are women, which highlight the pervasive denial of the basic human right to education experienced by women across the globe. While there is a sizeable literature on gender discrimination in girls' schooling, we know very little about girls' access to private schooling, despite its rapid growth around the world in recent years. Using two nationally representative datasets from household surveys conducted in India in 2005 and 2012, our paper aims to bridge this gap by examining the role of gender in private school choice. We argue that the gender of the child is potentially endogenous in India because parents continue to have children until they have a son. To redress this potential endogeneity, we exploit the variation in private school choice among 7-18 year olds born to the same parents within the same household in an attempt to minimize both child-invariant and child-varying household-level omitted variable bias. We then explore the nature of female (dis)advantage across different types of households, communities, and years with a view to assess the role of parental preferences in this respect and its change, if any. The analysis thus allows us to provide new evidence for the causal effect of gender on private school choice in India. Significant female disadvantage exists in both survey years, though the size of this disadvantage varies across sub samples and years. Female disadvantage is significantly higher among younger (relative to eldest) girls and also in northern and northwestern (relative to western) regions, but it is lower among girls from poor (relative to rich) households, Christian (relative to Hindu high caste) households, and those with more educated mothers. Our results are robust, irrespective of whether or not we restrict the sample to those born to a household head. We infer that the observed within-household variations in female disadvantage across sub-samples reflect variations in non-altruistic parental preferences linked to deeply held cultural norms (for example, sons acting as old-age security and the exogamy of girls), access to schools and other public goods, and also job opportunities and returns to schooling for girls, thus posing considerable challenges in the attempt to secure education for all.

The purpose of the study is to explicitly quantify information asymmetries by compliance with the IMF's Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The authors find that compliance with the SDDS increased FDI inflows by an economically relevant magnitude of 56 % while there are no such aggregate effects for portfolio flows. The empirical strategy demonstrates that the effect runs from SDDS to FDI and not vice versa, introduces a test for endogeneity bias due to omitted variables, and tests for spatial correlation in the residuals.","[Hashimoto, Yuko] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Wacker, K.

Using data on agro-pastoral households from northern Kenya, we explore whether migration of household members enhances adoption of agricultural innovations that aim to provide protection against weather shocks. Specifically, we seek to test whether migration and adaptation are complementary mechanisms to protect the household against adverse shocks, or whether they are substitutes. Do remittances relax capital constraints and facilitate the uptake of adaptive measures, or do they render adaptation superfluous? Our data provide suggestive evidence that remittances from migrant household members may relax capital constraints, and that remittances are an important mechanism linking migration to adoption, enabling the uptake of new technologies that involve change in activities or high costs. Specifically, migrant households adopt more adaptive measures (promoting self-protection), and we document some support for the hypothesis that this is especially the case for high-cost adaptations such as the purchasing of drought tolerant livestock. These findings suggest that migration and local innovation are complementary rather than substitutive mechanisms of self-protection for pastoral households in the semi-arid lands of northern Kenya. Households who have at least one member who has migrated are able to overcome barriers to employ high cost agricultural innovations through using remittances received thus enhancing their self-protection against climate change related shocks.

Given that online stores are a profitable business model in the area of electronic commerce and because the relationship between consumer digital Romania and its decision to purchase products or services on the Internet has not been sufficiently explored, this study aims to identify specific features of the new type of consumer and to examine the level of online shopping in Romania. Therefore a documentary study was carried out with statistic data regarding the volume and the number of transactions of the online shopping in Romania during 2010-2014, the type of products and services that Romanians are searching the Internet for and demographics of these people. In addition, to study more closely the online consumer behavior, and to interpret the detailed secondary data provided, an exploratory research was performed as a structured questionnaire with five closed questions on the distribution of individuals according to the gender category they belong (male or female); decision to purchase products / services in the virtual environment in the past year; the source of the goods / services purchased (Romanian or foreign sites); factors that have determined the consumers to buy products from foreign sites; categories of products purchased through online transactions from foreign merchants. The questionnaire was distributed electronically via Facebook social network users and the data collected was processed directly in the Facebook official app to create and interpret responses to surveys. The results of this research correlated with the official data reveals the following characteristics of the digital consumer in Romania: atypical European consumer, interested more in online purchases from abroad, influenced by the quality and price of the purchase. This paper assumed a careful analysis of the online acquisitions phenomenon and also represents a direction for conducting a future research. The particularities identified in the Romanian digital consumer can help develop an online marketing mix based on behavioral study.","[Onete, Cristian Bogdan; Teodorescu, Ioana; Vasile, Viorel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Onete, CB (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",bogdan.onete@com.ase.ro,"Onete, Cristian Bogdan/E-6579-2017",,,,,,14,6,6,0,41,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2016,18.0,43,,,,,654,662,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DU5MP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382256100011,0

The dependent variable employed in the empirical analysis, a proxy for the economic growth, is GDP per capita growth (annual %). The main finding of this paper's investigations is that income inequality has a positive and statistically significant impact on economic growth and a 1% increase in the Gini coefficient enhances the GDP by 0.68% in the ten former socialist Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries which are members of the European Union (EU) during the period 2006-2014.","[Pescu (Beca), Marusa] Ovidius Univ Constanta, Constanta, Romania; [Stefan (Barabas), Camelia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Ovidius University; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Pescu, M (通讯作者)，Ovidius Univ Constanta, Constanta, Romania.",marushabk@yahoo.com,,,,,,,50,3,3,0,22,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2016,18.0,43,,,,,592,610,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DU5MP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382256100008,0

This paper analyses the ways in which public transport mobility plays a role in the livelihood strategies of women living in a resettlement area at the fringe of Chennai, India. The main question addressed is how women exercise agency in embedding spatial practices within their livelihood strategies to reconnect to the city. The analysis is based on 4 months fieldwork in Semmencherry Resettlement Area in Chennai (India). It combines a qualitative analysis with a spatial exploration drawing on concepts from debates on the livelihoods approach, spatial practices, and accessibility and transport-related exclusion. Results show that the more agency women have to negotiate livelihoods strategies, the better they can take complex decisions on accessing resources over large distances and minimizing their adverse effects. We argue that combining a livelihood with a spatial analysis is important because it shows how spatial exclusion has to be assessed according to women's own priorities and decisions concerning spatial practices as part of livelihoods strategies. Accessibility and recreating relational spaces may both widen women's opportunities as well as overstretch their physical and financial resources. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that management turnover weakens the link between equity issues and the returns that preceded the new chief executive officer (CEO). Moreover, there is a discontinuity in the distribution of equity issues around the specific share price that the CEO inherited, while there is no discontinuity around salient share prices prior to turnover. The evidence suggests that capital allocation involves an attribution of past returns not only to the firm but also to its CEO. A corollary is that a firm with poor stock market performance may be better able to raise new capital if its current CEO is replaced. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Previously proposed methodologies are not free of computational biases mainly because involved problems are not treated accurately and in unity. Upon revealing the mistreatment in commonly used YZ algorithm (Yan and Zhang, 2012), we suggest a remedy for the problem of boundary solutions. Next, we differentiate and focus on another computational issue: determination of powerful initial value sets. We develop a new algorithm that employs cluster analysis to assign multiple powerful sets of initial values for the MLE function. The analyses of the simulated quarterly datasets reflect that applying the algorithm outperforms the existing methods in accuracy. Most notably, none of the mean estimates on PIN and five intermediary parameters contains significant bias at 1% level. Empirical evidence from BIST-30 Index constituents provides consistent and supportive results. In addition to accuracy concerns, consuming one-seventeenth of the time spent in YZ algorithm, the algorithm is highly applicable by researchers and professionals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find foreign acquisitions in the service sector are in industries of U.S. comparative advantage while new foreign firms are in industries of investing country's comparative advantage. This suggests that foreign acquisitions in the service sector are not directly related to foreign investors' competitiveness in the industry of investment. In contrast foreign investors in new service sector firms come from countries with a competitive edge in the industries of investment.

We also consider the extent to which banks' characteristics - i.e. size, capitalization and liquidity - affect the banks' response to monetary policy shocks. We apply two structural and two non-structural indices to assess the level of competition. The two-step system GMM dynamic panel estimator is applied to bank level data from five ASEAN countries over the period of 1999-2014. The results from three competition measures (CR5, HHI and Lerner Index) imply that the effect of monetary policy on banks' loans reduces as the level of competition decreases. However, the results from the Boone Indicator suggest that a decrease in the level of competition strengthens the monetary policy transmission through the bank lending channel. The weakening/strengthening effect is stronger for highly capitalized, highly liquid and large banks. These findings are robust in relation to alternative measures of monetary policy and different sample periods. The use of alternative competition measures enables us to argue that based on a single measure, the implications about the role of competition can be misleading. The results of this study necessitate policy measures that can counter the adverse effects of changes in banking competition on the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission.

We show that New Zealand regions reap moderate gains from perfect risk sharing when they form a union with Australia, whereas for Australian states, the gains are somewhat similar to what they have attained at the intranational level. Second, we measure the extent of interstate risk sharing and intertemporal smoothing between the two countries. We are able to observe a substantial degree of intertemporal smoothing among Australian states and New Zealand regions, either alone or jointly, thus confirming the permanent income hypothesis. Further, unique to the risk-sharing literature, we decompose the aggregate (nondiversifiable) output shocks into positive and negative components, in order to assess the strength of risk-sharing mechanisms across business cycles. The study finds a virtual absence of risk sharing when Australia and New Zealand face negative aggregate fluctuations, raising doubts about the feasibility of the union, particularly during economic downturns.","[Rana, Faisal] Bursa Orhangazi Univ, Dept Int Trade, Bursa, Turkey; [Rana, Faisal] Effat Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Balli, Faruk] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Auckland, New Zealand; [Balli, Faruk] Univ Gediz, Dept Int Trade & Mkt, Izmir, Turkey",Bursa Orhangazi University; Effat University; Massey University; Gediz University,"Rana, F (通讯作者)，Bursa Orhangazi Univ, Dept Int Trade, Bursa, Turkey.;Rana, F (通讯作者)，Effat Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",frana.eco@gmail.com; f.balli@massey.ac.nz,"Balli, Faruk/H-8162-2019","Balli, Faruk/0000-0003-2372-4709; Rana, Faisal/0000-0001-7849-0482",,,,,68,2,2,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

Our approach focuses on real estate (land) price data for the ex-post spatial evaluation. First, we prepare a panel of land prices observed before, during, and after the project in the areas that are potentially impacted. Second, using functional data analysis, movements of land prices in each observed site during the target period are approximated by continuous functions. Third, using the functional ordinary Kriging technique, the functions for land price movements in each micro district are spatially predicted. Lastly, by employing the functional clustering (functional K-means) technique, potential areas of benefit may be identified. Different from exiting before-and-after methods, including difference-in-differences method, the proposed procedure based on functional data analysis can describe a map with a complex spatial distribution pattern of benefit rather than using distance bands (ring buffer) from transportation cores, such as railway stations, bus stops, and highway interchanges. Then, the proposed procedure is empirically applied to a large-scale Japanese heavy railway project. The obtained result shows so-called redistributive effect, that is, land prices decrease around exiting stations and increase around new stations. In addition, interestingly enough, the spatial distribution pattern of the identified areas of benefit using this procedure are fairly similar to that of ex-ante predicted areas of benefit by the hedonic approach. Thus, capitalization is observationally confirmed with regard to accessibility improvement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study statistically explores the efficacy of such standards for the important case of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), an international non-governmental organization which maintains a voluntary standard for revenue transparency in the extractive industries. As of November 2015, 31 countries were EITI Compliant and another 49 were EITI Candidates. In total, 49 countries had disclosed payments and revenues worth some $1.67 trillion in more than 200 EITI Reports, and over 90 major companies involved in oil, gas, and mining are committed to supporting the EITI. The EITI has also received support from 84 global investment institutions that collectively manage about $16 trillion in energy infrastructural assets. Moreover, the European Union, African Union, G8 and G20, and the United Nations have all endorsed the EITI. This article provides the first broad empirical examination of the EITI's effectiveness in improving governance and economic development outcomes in its member countries using non-parametric tests, regression analysis, and data from the World Bank. We analyze the performance of the first 16 countries to attain EITI Compliance Status over the period of 1996-2014. We find, interestingly, that in most metrics EITI countries do not perform better during EITI compliance than before it, and that they do not outperform other countries. We postulate four possible explanations behind the relative weakness of the EITI: a limited mandate, its voluntary nature, stakeholder resistance, and dependence on strong civil society.

Recent studies have identified issues associated with capital estimates by applying the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method for truncated distributions: significant upward mean-bias, considerable uncertainty about the estimates, and non-robustness to both small and large losses. Although alternative estimation approaches have been proposed, there has not been any comprehensive study of how alternative approaches perform compared to the MLE method. This paper is the first comprehensive study on the performance of various potentially promising alternative approaches (including minimum distance approach, quantile distance approach, scaling-based bias correction, upward scaling of lower quantiles, and right-truncated distributions) as compared to MLE with regards to accuracy, precision and robustness. More importantly, based on the properties of each estimator, we propose a right-truncation with probability weighted least squares method, by combining the right-truncated distribution and minimizing a probability weighted distance (i.e., the quadratic upper-tail Anderson-Darling distance), and we find it significantly reduces the bias and volatility of capital estimates and improves the robustness of capital estimates to small losses near the threshold or moving the threshold, demonstrated by both simulation results and real data application.

A majority of women are risk averse and behave according to the Golden Rule while a majority of men are risk seeking in some part of the income distribution and treat others differently than they treat themselves. Our experiments allow subjects to increase or reduce spreads in a five-element income distribution. All changes reduce average pay so any change is costly. Changes may be made that affect only the individual subject and reflect behavior toward risk or behind a veil of ignorance that is thought to induce just behavior, or as an observer. On average women tend to reduce spreads across all conditions, treating others as they treat themselves and reducing risk and inequality to the same degree. Thus, their behavior, on average, follows a concave utility function whether applied to themselves or others. Men generally increase spreads in at least one tail of the distribution if only their pay is affected. However, men either abstain or reduce spreads to the degree others are involved and therefore reduce spreads most when acting as observers. Behavior of men cannot be described either by a concave utility function or by a function that makes no distinction between themselves and others. The gender differences conform to theories of sexual selection.","[Beckman, Steven R.; Smith, W.

In the first game, appropriation leads to deterministic degradation in the value of a shared resource. In the second game, appropriation leads to both deterministic and probabilistic degradation, introducing endogenous uncertainty in the value of the opportunity cost of conserving the shared resource. The results show that subjects systematically decrease appropriation the lower the opportunity cost of conservation, and the addition of probabilistic degradation leads to further decreases in group appropriation. As conjectured, the response of individual subjects to the addition of probabilistic degradation is conditional on their expected marginal net benefits to appropriate, which depend in turn on their first order beliefs of others' appropriation. The overall decreases in appropriation due to probabilistic degradation, however, are not large enough to offset decreases in expected efficiency due to expected losses in the value of the shared resource.","[Blanco, Esther] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Lopez, Maria Claudia] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, 326 Nat Resources Bldg,480 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Walker, James M.] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Wylie Hall 105, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Blanco, Esther; Lopez, Maria Claudia; Walker, James M.] Indiana Univ, Vincent & Elinor Ostrom Workshop Polit Theory & P, Bloomington, IN USA",University of Innsbruck; Michigan State University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Blanco, E (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",esther.blanco@uibk.ac.at; mlopez@msu.edu; walkerj@indiana.edu,"Blanco, Esther/K-9124-2014","Blanco, Esther/0000-0002-4887-5717",University of Innsbruck; National Science Foundation [SES-0849551]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P25973] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF),University of Innsbruck; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"Financial support was provided by the University of Innsbruck.

Subjects have to pay a fee over and above punishment costs if they wish to condition punishments on previous play, which is equivalent to a binary choice between the acquisition of perfect information on the target subject's behavior and no information at all. When monitoring is costly both second and third party punishment is weaker and less discriminate and hence generates weaker incentives for cooperation than when monitoring is free. There are subtle differences between second and third parties: The presence of monitoring costs leads subjects to withhold sanctioning more often as second parties than as third parties, and to punish indiscriminately more often as third parties than as second parties. The results contribute to the understanding of peer-enforcement of cooperation in social dilemmas and whether there is a common motivational structure underpinning second and third party punishment.

The model by Weingast et al. (1981) predicts that a legislature with members from different areas will spend more in total on local public goods when the geographic constituency of each member is small. I test this prediction using panel data on the 18 Norwegian regional councils, exploiting that the geographic allocation of regional council seats varies considerably over time. Consistent with the theory, I find robust evidence that investments in regional public roads are lower when many council members come from the more populated areas in the region. This gives a more direct test of the prediction by Weingast et al. (1981) than existing empirical evidence, which concerns the relationship between public spending and legislature size. I find similar but less robust results for the maintenance of existing roads. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Threshold cointegration is applied with findings that indicate a long run relationship exists between the pairs (WTI Brent and WTI-Oman) of spatially separated spot markets. For the WTI-Brent spot price pair, there has not been a reversion to the long run relationship since the reversal in spread between the WTI and Brent. Further, threshold error correction models provide evidence that all three series move to restore the long run relationship in at least one regime for both pairings.

We document three findings. First, we find that the level of the heterogeneity in investor beliefs on a firm's value is higher when the firm experiences a larger increase in its accounting accruals. Second, we find that future stock returns following the earnings announcement are lower when the firm's accounting accruals increases the heterogeneity of investor beliefs to a larger degree. Finally, we also find that the effect of the accruals-induced heterogeneous investor beliefs on future stock returns is more pronounced when short-sale constraints are more binding. Overall, our empirical findings suggest that accounting accruals are a key determinant of the heterogeneity of investor beliefs. They also suggest a channel of investor beliefs whereby accruals affect future stock returns by affecting the heterogeneity of investor beliefs.

The theoretical predictions, econometric estimation techniques as well as, the corresponding empirical evidence are discussed focusing on both the closed economy and the open economy versions of the NKPC. A number of important findings are reported about the ability of NKPC to explain the process of inflation dynamics. First, there is weak support for the open economy version of the NKPC to be able to track inflation dynamics if imported inputs are used in the production process. Second, the NKPC describes inflation dynamics across sectors if microeconomic and sectoral level data are used. Further, the survey data employed as a proxy for inflation measure in the newer studies provide enhanced support to the closed economy NKPC with the sign, size and statistical significance of coefficients in line with the theoretical predictions. We provide fresh empirical evidence to check the first finding from the review. The deep structural parameters for four different versions of the NKPC, the pure forward looking NKPC, the Gali and Monacelli's (2005) NKPC, the open economy NKPC and the open economy hybrid NKPC, are estimated for Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. These estimated coefficients show some support that the specifications of open economy NKPC, which incorporate prices of imported goods as opposed to the terms of trade and real exchange rate, seems to be a better, however, weak indicator of the inflation dynamics. These findings may have important policy implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Rethinking the Role of the State and Business in Chinese Development Cooperation in Africa,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,State-business relations; China; Africa; Zimbabwe; Mozambique,,"The growing involvement of the Chinese state and business in Africa has generated significant debate, about China's Africa strategy and the benefits for Africa's development. What is the nature of Chinese-state capitalism in Africa? This study examines Chinese state-business relations and argues that China's involvement in Africa is more complex than often portrayed. It aims to build a closer understanding of the diverse factors that influence the Chinese state-business relations as it is implemented in Africa. This paper focuses on how state-business interactions influence agricultural development outcomes, using six case-studies from Zimbabwe and Mozambique. It explores the question of how far the state can control business and direct development by identifying the key relationships that influence the decision-making processes of state and business actors within China and its African engagement. The paper challenges the conventional wisdom of homogenized, unitary relations. It argues that these relations are, in practice, heterogeneous, as a result of the state being disaggregated into a multiplicity of provincial relations and central state agencies, and tensions arising between commercial market and political interests. The active role of African governments in agricultural schemes is also affecting outcomes. China's engagement is multivariate, involving a multiplicity of agencies, operating at different levels, structures, and processes with sometimes contrary interests and goals. The findings of an analysis of six state-business projects in the agricultural sectors of Zimbabwe and Mozambique suggest that where agriculture is concerned, a wide range of Chinese agencies are involved, with businesses being driven by either market forces or national state interests, which together make outcomes less open to generalization.

We identify a heterogeneous and nonlinear relationship between an explicit quantitative goal for monetary policy and inflation after controlling for the problem of possible endogeneity. We also find that both having and successfully hitting quantitative targets is more effective for monetary policy in lowering inflation in high-inflation episodes than in low-inflation episodes. When countries suffer from severe inflation problems, the adoption of quantitative goals for monetary policies can thus deliver important economic gains. Conversely, the adoption of quantitative goals may not result in a lowering of inflation when countries are more economically sound. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This is possible in an empirical model that considers the influence of uncontaminated commercial properties on home values concurrently with contaminated property influences. Our approach addresses an important source of omitted variable bias that has not been fully recognized in the literature, and it allows identification of stigma effects in a way not possible in past studies. We estimate difference-in-differences models that pool observations across a metro area and across time, as well as repeat sales models that rely on multiple transactions per home. Results indicate that environmental contamination more than doubles the negative influence commercial properties have on neighboring residential home values. Furthermore, we find little evidence of stigma effects once a contaminated site is remediated. The negative spillover effects associated with remediated contaminated sites are largely indistinguishable from the spillover effects from commercial properties with no known contamination.

Drawing on the economics of collective action literature, the authors attempt to shed light on whether forest collective action itself sequesters carbon. Using satellite imagery combined with household and community data from Ethiopia, they examine whether community forests (CFs) with high levels of collective action attributes known to be associated with better management have more carbon than other systems. Although these results should be considered indicative due to the nature of the data, the analysis suggests that in the absence of dedicated sequestration policies the quality of local-level collective action offers at best marginal carbon benefits. Specific incentives like REDD+ may therefore play important roles in delivering climate change benefits from CFs in low-income countries.","[Beyene, Abebe D.] Environm Econ Policy Forum Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Bluffstone, Randall] Portland State Univ, Dept Econ, POB 751, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Mekonnen, Alemu] Univ Addis Ababa, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Portland State University; Addis Ababa University,"Beyene, AD (通讯作者)，Environm Econ Policy Forum Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.;Bluffstone, R (通讯作者)，Portland State Univ, Dept Econ, POB 751, Portland, OR 97207 USA.;Mekonnen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Addis Ababa, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",abebed2002@yahoo.co.uk; bluffsto@pdx.edu; alemu_m2004@yahoo.com,,,Sida through the Environment for Development (EfD) initiative; EfD Center in Ethiopia; Environmental Economics Policy Forum for Ethiopia (EEPFE) at the Ethiopian Development Research Institute (EDRI),Sida through the Environment for Development (EfD) initiative; EfD Center in Ethiopia; Environmental Economics Policy Forum for Ethiopia (EEPFE) at the Ethiopian Development Research Institute (EDRI),"The authors acknowledge with thanks the financial support obtained for data collection and analysis from Sida through the Environment for Development (EfD) initiative and the EfD Center in Ethiopia, and the Environmental Economics Policy Forum for Ethiopia (EEPFE) at the Ethiopian Development Research Institute (EDRI).

We apply commonly used measures of persistence, which we test using a set of simulated passive funds. In the first stage we apply contingency tables and transition matrices in accordance with previous literature. Results show how these methodologies are biased towards finding evidence of persistence too easily. In the second stage, we take a recursive portfolio approach, which assesses the performance of investing by following recommendations based on past performance. Results show the importance of both estimating persistence by distinguishing among fund style groups, and considering the cross-sectional significance of recursive portfolios. In general, our results support evidence of persistence in mutual fund performance, especially for the case of the best mutual funds. However, this evidence does not hold for the most recent subperiod, 2008-2015. Empirical evidence of persistence is conditioned by the sample period, a result that could explain the inconclusive results found in the literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Most regional travel demand forecasting performed in practice in the US uses four-step travel demand models, despite advances in the development and implementation of activity-based travel demand models. This paper introduces a framework that facilitates the abilities of four-step regional travel models to better represent walking activity, allowing metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) to implement these advances with minimal changes to existing modeling systems. Specifically, the framework first changes the spatial unit from transportation analysis zones (TAZs) to a finer-grained geography better suited to modeling pedestrian trips. The MPO's existing trip generation models are applied at this spatial unit for all trips. Then, a walk mode choice model is used to identify the subset of all trips made by walking. Trips by other modes are aggregated to the TAZ level and proceed through the remaining steps in the MPO's four-step model. The walk trips are distributed to destinations using a choice modeling approach, thus identifying pedestrian trip origins and destinations. In this paper, a proof-of-concept application is included to demonstrate the framework in successful operation using data from the Portland, Oregon, region. Opportunities for future work include more research on the potential routes between origins and destinations for walk trips, application of the framework in another region, and developing ways the research could be implemented in activity-based modeling systems.

Furthermore, we extend our analysis by applying a Markov regime switching model to identify normal and turbulent periods. Our findings indicate that the probability distribution of the Heston model performs well for emerging markets under full sample estimation and retains goodness of fit for high volatility periods, as it explicitly accounts for the volatility process. On the other hand, the distributions of the Levy processes, especially the VG and NIG distributions, generally improves upon the fit of the Heston model, particularly for developed markets and low volatility periods. Furthermore, some distributions yield to significantly large test statistics for some countries, even though they fit well to other markets, which suggest that properties of the stock markets are crucial in identifying the best distribution representing empirical returns.

Do the chances of a financially distressed firm to improve or to close depend on the bank? Does the survival of a financially distressed firm depend on its main bank relationship? Using German data from 2000-2013, I analyze the effect of a bank's organizational complexity, non-performing customers, and the strength of main bank relationships at the bank and firm level.

To isolate causality, we employ a quasi-experiment that exploits exogenous reductions in analyst following resulting from brokerage house mergers. We find that managers respond to the coverage loss by decreasing real earnings management while increasing accrual manipulation. These effects are significantly stronger among firms with less coverage and for firms close to the zero-earnings threshold.

Using nationally representative survey data on micro, small, and medium-sized firms, we find that most of Indonesia's informal firms are very small, micro firms, with less than five employees. These firms pay low wages, are relatively unproductive when compared to large firms, are managed by individuals with low educational attainment, predominantly supply products to local markets, and have not recently attempted to expand their operations. From a small-scale, qualitative survey of firms, we find that many informal firms do not register their businesses either because they have no desire to expand or borrow from formal financial sources, or because they are avoiding taxes. Finally, we evaluate the impact of Indonesia's one-stop-shops for business registration program, a large-scale program that attempted to reduce registration costs. We find both that the program had no effects on firms' informality rates, and we also find that it did not reduce the probability that workers were informally employed. Taken together, the evidence suggests that a combination of the rational exit and the dual economy theories best explains why so many firms in Indonesia are informal. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The focus of this paper is on the choice of contract instruments to incentivise the provision of ecosystem service outputs from farms. The farmer is better informed than the regulator in terms of hidden information about costs and hidden-actions relating to effort. The results show that with perfect information, the regulator can contract equivalently on inputs or outputs. With hidden information, input-based contracts are more cost effective at reducing the informational rent related to adverse selection than output-based contracts. Mixed contracts are also cost-effective, especially where one input is not observable. Such contracts allow the regulator to target variables that are costly-to-fake as opposed to those prone to moral hazard such as effort. Further results are given for fixed price contracts and input-based contracts with moral hazard. The model is extended to include a discussion of repeated contracting and the scope that exists for the regulator to benefit from information revealed by the initial choice of contract. The models are applied to a case study of contracting with farmers to protect high biodiversity native vegetation that also provides socially-valuable ecosystem services.","[White, Ben] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Hanley, Nick] Univ St Andrews, Dept Geog, St Andrews, Scotland",University of Western Australia; University of St Andrews,"White, B (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",Benedict.white@uwa.edu.au; ndh3@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012; White, Benedict/D-1434-2011","Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499; White, Benedict/0000-0001-7256-2449",,,,,43,29,32,1,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We also estimate cross-section regressions using 40-year (1970-2010) changes in government variables. In general, the estimated effects of crises on government size/scope are statistically insignificant. We report reasonably robust evidence that inflation and currency crises lead to decreases in the extent of government regulations throughout an economy over a 10-year horizon. Also, over the 40-year period, countries that spent more years in crisis are associated with weaker legal systems and property rights. The size and scope of government appear to be persistent to the extent that even crisis episodes fail to leave a significant mark upon them.

Modeling the variables' conditional mean processes using a multiplicative error model, we map the resulting residuals into a Gaussian domain using a copula-type transformation. Based on high-frequency volatility, cumulative trading volumes, trade counts and market depth of various stocks traded at the NYSE, we show that the proposed transformation is supported by the data and allows capturing (multivariate) dynamics in higher order moments. The latter are modeled using a DCC-GARCH specification. We suggest estimating the model by composite maximum likelihood which is sufficiently flexible to be applicable in high dimensions. Strong empirical evidence for time-varying conditional (co-)variances in trading processes supports the usefulness of the approach. Taking these higher-order dynamics explicitly into account significantly improves the goodness-of-fit and out-of-sample forecasts of the multiplicative error model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

If two varieties are introduced in consecutive periods then they become imperfect substitutes and the firm has an incentive to raise prices and sell each one to consumers with higher valuations (better preference matching). Higher frequency can also generate market expansion. However, under strong temporary satiation, better preference matching may dominate and the frequency of new product introductions may become socially excessive.","[Caminal, Ramon] CSIC, Inst Anal Econ, Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain; [Caminal, Ramon] Barcelona GSE, Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Autonomous University of Barcelona; Barcelona School of Economics; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Caminal, R (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Anal Econ, Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain.;Caminal, R (通讯作者)，Barcelona GSE, Campus UAB, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain.",ramon.caminal@iae.csic.es,"Caminal, Ramon/ABH-5707-2020","Caminal, Ramon/0000-0002-3348-3235",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2014-59959-P]; Generalitat de Catalunya [2014 SGR 510],Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya),"I would like to thank Roberto Burguet, Ricard Gil, Sjaak Hurkens, Martin Perry, Clara Ponsat, Pasquale Schiraldi, the Editor and two anonymous referees, for their useful comments.

Income and wealth inequality increased over the same period, leading some to suggest the two phenomena are interconnected. Indeed, there is supporting evidence for the idea that heterogeneity in economic shocks and spending are connected, most notably in studies using local-area geography as the unit of analysis. The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) provides a household-level perspective on changes in wealth, income and spending across different types of families. The SCF confirms that inequality is indeed increasing in recent decades, and the data provide support for the proposition that shocks to income and wealth are indeed related to large swings in spending across and within birth cohorts. However, the economic shocks associated with the Great Recession and changes in spending and debt to income ratios are widespread, and inconsistent with a narrow focus on the experiences and changes in behaviour of particular (especially low- and modest-income) households.","[Devlin-Foltz, Sebastian; Sabelhaus, John] Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, Washington, DC 20005 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Devlin-Foltz, S; Sabelhaus, J (通讯作者)，Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",Sebastian.J.Devlin-Foltz@frb.gov; john.sabelhaus@frb.gov,,,Nuffield Foundation,Nuffield Foundation,"The analysis and conclusions set forth are those of the authors and do not indicate concurrence by other members of the research staff or the Board of Governors.

However, in many economies, the state's capacity to identify and tax winners is limited. How do such limitations impact the adoption of reforms? We show that for reforms where the distribution of winners and losers is exogenously given, higher state capacity unambiguously helps the adoption of Pareto-improving reforms.

First, the results show that all measures of audit quality are positively associated with most institutional factors of investor protection in all clusters. Second, audit quality is lower during financial crisis in all clusters and in most of audit quality measures. Third, audit quality is higher (lower) for firms with strong (weak) investor protection and legal enforcement during financial crisis in all clusters. Fourth, we report that earnings quality is stronger (weaker) in countries with strong (weak) investor protection in all clusters before and during the crisis. Fifth, higher (lower) audit quality implies higher (lower) earnings quality in all clusters, irrespective of the financial crisis.

This paper offers a theoretical analysis of the stability of regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) in a non-cooperative, coalition formation game based on the classic Gordon-Schaefer model. We employ a new stability concept which modifies Farsighted Stability (Chwe, J Econ Theory 63:299-325, 1994). We call this concept farsighted downwards stability (FDS). We also employ the internal stability (IS) concept for comparison. Analytical results regarding FDS for symmetric players without changing stock location show stable Grand Coalitions for player games and the possibility for partial cooperation. Sensitivity analysis deals with changing stock location and cost asymmetry. Stability decreases in , increases when costs are asymmetric and increases when FDS is employed. Farsighted conjectures on behalf of RFMO members can thus help to maintain cooperation as stock location changes. However, FDS is more sensitive to changes in stock location than IS.","[Walker, Adam N.; Weikard, Hans-Peter] Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Walker, AN (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",adam.walker@wur.nl; hans-peter.weikard@wur.nl,"Weikard, Hans-Peter/O-1120-2013","Weikard, Hans-Peter/0000-0002-5209-9845",European Community [266445],European Community,"We would like to acknowledge the helpful comments of Ekko van Ierland, Maarten Punt and Andries Richter.

We calibrate our model to match key characteristics of a number of OECD economies, including the distribution of wages and wealth, social security, taxes, and government debt and study how a fiscal multiplier depends on various country characteristics. We find that the fiscal multiplier is highly sensitive to the fraction of the population who face binding credit constraints and also to the average wealth level in the economy.

This paper assesses the extent to which projected sea-level rise is likely to impact upon the functioning of the Dawlish to Teignmouth stretch of the London to Penzance railway line, in England. Using a semi-empirical modelling approach, we identify a relationship between sea-level change and rail incidents over the last 150 years and then use model-based sea-level predictions to extrapolate this relationship into the future. We find that days with line restrictions (DLRs) look set to increase by up to 1170%, to as many as 84-120 per year, by 2100 in a high sea-level rise scenario (0.55-0.81 m). Increased costs to the railway industry deriving from maintenance and line restrictions will be small ( pound millions) in comparison with damage caused by individual extreme events (10s pound of millions), while the costs of diversion of the railway are higher still (100s pound of millions to billions). Socio-economic costs to the region are likely to be significant although they are more difficult to estimate accurately. Finally, we explain how our methodology is applicable to vulnerable coastal transport infrastructure worldwide. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Drawing from fairness heuristic theory and the slippery slope framework of tax compliance, we predicted that procedural justice fosters voluntary tax compliance, particularly when legitimate power of the tax authority is low and when coercive power of the authority is high. Moreover, we predicted that these interactive effects are mediated by (cognition-based) trust. Finally, we predicted that coercive power of the tax authority is positively related with enforced tax compliance. The results of a field study among Ethiopian business owners supported most predictions.

Two-thirds of loans with unreported second liens had the same originator issuing both the first and second lien.

Using bilateral trade data in manufacturing sectors of 34 countries from 1995 to 2010, we find that most of the impact of skilled labor on exports goes through the intensive margin, whereas most of the effect of unskilled labor works through the extensive margin. These outcomes result from the impact of labor skill composition on the productivity cut-off of exporters. We also find that the impact of skilled and unskilled labor on trade margins depends on the income level of countries and on the type of products. The results indicate that the effect of skilled labor is greater for low-income countries and differentiated products, while that of unskilled labor is greater for high-income countries and homogeneous products.","[Luong, Tuan Anh; Chen, Wei-Chih] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wei-Chih] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, 168 Univ Rd, Chiayi 62102, Taiwan",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; National Chung Cheng University,"Chen, WC (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.;Chen, WC (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, 168 Univ Rd, Chiayi 62102, Taiwan.",wei.chihchen@shufe.edu.cn,"Chen, Wei-Chih/AGN-5533-2022","Chen, Wei-Chih/0000-0002-3333-4555; Luong, Tuan Anh/0000-0001-9569-3564",,,,,23,4,4,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Each Working Group has charged ahead with independent assumptions that obscure any possibility of an integrated assessment. The Report provides an authoritative collection of climate related materials but is organized so poorly that it provides very little insight into how to solve the climate problem.

This inefficiency appears to reflect an inability to coordinate over how to distribute the cost of providing the good. So, why do groups not just split the cost equally? We offer an answer to this question by demonstrating that in a standard threshold public good game there is no collectively rational recommendation. We also demonstrate that if full agreement is required in order to provide the public good then there is a collectively rational recommendation, namely, to split the cost equally. Requiring full agreement may, therefore, increase efficiency in providing threshold public goods.

The paper examines collected dataset using two different approaches: the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the partial least squares multi-group analysis (PLSMGA). Results derived from the two different approaches are compared and discussed, highlighting the additional findings gained via PLS-MGA regarding the moderating role of emphasis framing on the relationship between perceptions and purchase intentions. Testing the parametric differences arising from between groups design, ANOVA provides limited findings, while the non-parametric approach-PLS-MGA-estimates the effects of the experimental conditions on the structural model parameters, offering additional and more accurate results. Concluding that non-parametric approaches allow enhanced investigations, the paper explains why researchers should sometimes extend data examination using variance-based structural equation modeling as an exploratory tool.","[Andrei, Andreia Gabriela] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, 22 Carol 1 Blvd, Iasi 700505, Romania; [Zait, Adriana] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, 22 Carol 1 Blvd, Iasi 700505, Romania; [Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Doctoral Sch Econ & Int Business, 6 Piata Romana, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Andrei, AG (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, 22 Carol 1 Blvd, Iasi 700505, Romania.",andrei.andreia@gmail.com; adrianazait@yahoo.com; madalina.vatamanescu@yahoo.com,"Andrei, Andreia/I-9722-2017; Zait, Adriana/K-2913-2013; Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina/F-4872-2017","Andrei, Andreia/0000-0002-1093-6713; Zait, Adriana/0000-0002-5959-7732; Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina/0000-0002-9397-0385",,,,,31,1,1,0,2,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,347,358,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300028,0

This competition is also manifested in the tax area, when less economically developed countries are trying to attract the foreign investors from economically advanced countries to their country through a lower corporate tax burden, which is considered as harmful tax competition. This article examines the extent of Foreign Direct Investments flows depending on the size of corporate income tax burden in EU countries. The amount of the corporate income tax burden is expressed here using two types of tax rates, namely the statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate, defined by the ratio of the aggregate revenue of corporate income taxes to GDP. The degree of dependence of FDI flows on the size of the corporate tax rates is determined using correlation analysis.","[Blechova, Beata] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Karvina, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Blechová, B (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Karvina, Czech Republic.",blechova@opf.slu.cz,,,,,,,14,2,2,0,6,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Thomas Kuhn introduced the notion of a paradigm shift in scientific discourse. The aim of this paper is to argue that economics should undergo such a paradigm shift as well. We will use a model scenario of an entrepreneur starting and running a business to try to prove that neoclassical economics cannot adequately explain such a scenario without dropping three fundamental assumptions of neoclassical economic theory. These are the assumptions of Say's law, optimising agents and equilibrium. In this we will pursue the tradition of the heterodox postkeynesian school of economic thought. The resulting implications should provide a case for a paradigm shift in economics.","[Cas, Marcel] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Int Relat, Dept Int Econ Relat & Econ Diplomacy, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Cas, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Int Relat, Dept Int Econ Relat & Econ Diplomacy, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava, Slovakia.",marcel.cas@euba.sk,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4261-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,43,50,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8MD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392433400006,0

Methodology/methods while studies were used methods of statistical observation and grouping. Out of the analysis methods the emphasis was placed on absolute and combination dimensions, average and variable indicators, the analysis showings of time lines. Scientific aim of the Research in Georgia is exposure of reasons, exploration of active factors, searching ways for reduction of unemployment rate and stimulation of employment. Findings Certainly the general picture of unemployment in 2014 was improved in Georgia, though the situation of unemployment has not changed. It should be noted economical activities of women are lower than in men. Level of economical activity of men increases with age and employment as well. Unemployment rate of urban area comparatively low as 4-4.5 times for rural population caused by large share of self-employed. As well economical activity in urban areas is lower (57.5%) than in rural areas (74.8%). It should be noted that in 2014 compared with 2013 unemployment rate was decreased either in women (1.9%), or in men (2.5%) and correspondingly composed 10.4% and 14%. Conclusions Generally, situation in 2014 concerning unemployment has been improved. Economical activity and employment in rural areas compared with urban areas is higher and unemployment is 4-times lower. Economical activity of women compared with men is relatively low; the level of economical activity is increased with age and employment as well, unemployment decreases; indicators of differentiated unemployment under context of rural-urban areas, gender and age; in Georgia unemployment level of men is rather high compared with women; along with increase of age unemployment rate of Georgia decreases and achieves minimum in age over 65 and etc.","[Chitaladze, Ketevan] I Javakhishvili Tbilis State Univ, 1Chavchavdze Ave, GE-0179 Tbilisi, Georgia",Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University,"Chitaladze, K (通讯作者)，I Javakhishvili Tbilis State Univ, 1Chavchavdze Ave, GE-0179 Tbilisi, Georgia.",ketachitaladze@mail.ru,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,3,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,278,284,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200034,0

To control the questioned risks of the award, the arbitral tribunals shall make superior award which could be recognized by both parties as far as possible. Explaining the superior award in the method of categorization is able to analyze a series of awards under the procedure or substantial issues of same type or the procedural or substantial contents of specific issue arguments on the individual cases. The application of the method could proceed from two angles: The micro categorization means the content of arbitral award should be divided into the superior part and inferior part in terms of the reasonableness of the individual award. The former has the value of being invoked while the latter should be excluded. The macro categorization studies the categorization of a series of awards in the range of the same legal relationship, and the separation of superior and inferior award makes its appearance. However, the analysis of award through the empirical method may further determine the inherent characteristics of superior award - the integrity of the logic clues and the hierarchy of the argument should be put more emphasis on the argument, and adequate and rigorous demonstration should be made combined with specific facts of the case. If the pro-portion of superior award in the investment arbitration award can be improved, the possibility that the parties finally accept the award will be increased, and the risk of disqualification and annulment could be controlled.","[Ding, Xia] China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Beijing, Peoples R China",China University of Political Science & Law,"Ding, X (通讯作者)，China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-365-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,459,463,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF8YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385267100077,0

We estimate a two-good recursive utility model that features persistent growth fluctuations and inflation nonneutrality for durable and nondurable consumption.

Traditional development transfers to increase income and reduce poverty are complemented by new financial flows to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation transfers) and become climate-resilient (adaptation transfers). We find that in the absence of barriers to adaptation, mitigation or development, climate change will make isolated transfers less efficient: A large part of their intended effect (to increase income, reduce emissions, or boost climate-resilience) dissipates as the South reallocates its own resources to achieve the mitigation, adaptation and consumption balance it prefers. Only in the case of least-developed countries, which are unable to adapt fully due to income constraints, will adaptation support lead to more climate resilience. In all other cases, if the North wishes to change the balance between mitigation, adaptation and consumption it should structure its transfers as matching grants, which are tied to the South's own level of funding. Alternatively, the North could provide an integrated climate-compatible development package that recognizes the combined climate and development requirements of the South. If the aim is to increase both mitigation and adaptation in the South, development assistance that increases the income level, can be an effective measure, but only if there is an international agreement and the recipient country is not income constrained. If the recipient country is very poor, development aid may reduce adaptation effort.","[Eyckmans, Johan] KU Leuven Campus Brussels, Ctr Econ & Corp Sustainabil, Brussels, Belgium; [Fankhauser, Sam] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Fankhauser, Sam] London Sch Econ, Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Kverndokk, Snorre] Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, Oslo, Norway",KU Leuven; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Fankhauser, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Fankhauser, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.fankhauser@lse.ac.uk,"Eyckmans, Johan/AAN-6590-2020","Eyckmans, Johan/0000-0002-2885-4740; Fankhauser, Samuel/0000-0003-2100-7888",MILJO program at the Research Council of Norway; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK Economic and Social Research Council; Research Council of Norway; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,MILJO program at the Research Council of Norway; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The project was supported financially by the MILJO2015 program at the Research Council of Norway.

In the estimation of physical capital such as machinery and implements, a possible approach is to use the ratio of the value of tractor sales to overall expenditure to impute overall machinery sales. The use of a constant ratio over an extended period results in increasingly incorrect estimates and fails to reveal the changing nature of mechanisation. In this article, the problems with such an approach are highlighted through an analysis of the historic share of tractor sales to overall machinery sales in South Africa. This article establishes that the current methods have led to underestimation in the overall value of machinery and implements sales in South Africa by approximately a billion rand per annum for recent years. An alternative method is suggested and the implications of a new capital formation series are discussed.","[Gandidzanwa, Colleta; Liebenberg, Frikkie] Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Gandidzanwa, C (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Agr Econ Extens & Rural Dev, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",colleta.gandidzanwa@up.ac.za; frik.liebenberg@up.ac.za,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,5,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2016,55.0,3,,,,,216,236,,10.1080/03031853.2016.1203801,0.0,,,21,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,DX4ER,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000384334500002,0

Within this context the degree of airport dependency in terms of market, spatial and temporal concentration is important to know from an economic geography and risk management perspective. A composite index called the Airport Dependency Index (ADI) is developed to measure airport dependency based on the concept of the relative Gini coefficient. Liberalisation has had varying impacts depending on the size and type of airport and so a comparison is made of the degree of dependency at a large sample of European airports using the ADI. The ADI has the potential to provide insight on the sustainability and worthiness of financing airport projects, and on whether airports should diversify further their activities by investing in the growth and expansion of their network.

Methodology/methods Research is based on analytical approach, there was invoked a systematic, logical and comparative analysis of scientific literature, quantitative mathematical-statistical technique was used for empirical data processing (calculating Pearson correlation coefficients). Scientific aim of the research is to assess VAT gap relationship with budget structure and macroeconomic indicators in European Union countries. Findings Paper revealed various determinants (macroeconomic and budget structure indicators) as some tools for understanding developments and differences in the performance of the VAT gap in EU countries. Overall developments are in line with general economic conditions. In the absence of policy changes, revenues and VAT gap tends to follow the nominal growth of the economic base, although revenues reflect a greater sensitivity to the business cycle (real GDP growth). As economy improves, VAT gap diminishes by itself due to the growing taxpayers' income and the decline of risky intentions. When such situation occurs, it is evaluated positively, but it wasn't taken into account on the papers' estimations. Conclusions The results of performed analysis cannot be fully extrapolated to all taxpayers or to the economy as a whole because their impact would be overestimated. Even though, GCI, CPI, Human Development Index correlation coefficients' opposite direction values suggest, that strong governance, institutions and low scores of corruption, balanced social environment in all groups of countries exhibit different, but systematically negative movement with respect to the level and behaviour of VAT gap. Examined the value added tax gap relationship with budget structure and macroeconomic indicators gives a glance to the problem of tax evasion among European Union countries with consequences in the competitiveness area.

Design/methodology/approach - The methodological approach of the paper is multifold. First, the authors use cointegration analysis to determine the simple dynamics among the variables. Second, the authors utilize vector autoregression analysis to study the dynamics among the variables for the 14 countries. Third, the authors employ panel analysis to determine common variations among the variables and across countries. Findings - When examining the linkage between the stock market and economic development, proxied by gross domestic product growth or with gross fixed capital formation growth, the authors did not find a meaningful relationship between them. However, when the authors included additional control variables strong, dynamic interactions between the two magnitudes surfaced. Specifically, it was found that the stock market is positively and robustly correlated with contemporaneous and future real economic development and, thus, it directly contributed to a country's economic development either through the production of goods and services or the accumulation of real capital. Thus, it can be inferred that the stock market alone is not capable of boosting economic development in these countries unless being part of a comprehensive financial system (which includes banks) as well as investment in real capital. Research limitations/implications - The policy implications are clear. Government authorities must recognize that the stock market alone is not a driver of economic development and that a sound, efficient financial system (which includes banks) must be present in order to contribute and foster economic development. Originality/value - The study is original in the sense that it examines various financial and economic variables to determine the degree of (or dynamic interactions among) the stock market and the real economy for each and all emerging markets in the sample.","[Laopodis, Nikiforos T.] Amer Coll Greece, Deree Coll, ALBA Grad Business Sch, Aghia Paraskevi, Greece; [Papastamou, Andreas] Pante Univ, Sch Int & European Studies, Athens, Greece; [Papastamou, Andreas] Minist Foreign Affairs, Athens, Greece",Panteion University,"Laopodis, NT (通讯作者)，Amer Coll Greece, Deree Coll, ALBA Grad Business Sch, Aghia Paraskevi, Greece.",nlaopodis@acg.edu,,"laopodis, nick/0000-0002-9006-6200",,,,,53,9,9,2,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

We introduce commuting costs and search-matching frictions to deal with the spatial mismatch between workers and firms. In a decentralized economy job seekers do not internalize a composition externality they impose on all the unemployed. With symmetric job centers, a change in the distribution of the workforce can lead to asymmetric equilibrium outcomes. We calibrate the model for Los Angeles and Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Areas. Simulations suggest that changes in the workforce distribution have non-negligible effects on unemployment rates, wages, and net output, but cannot be the unique explanation of a substantial mismatch problem.

Scientific aims The first scientific aim was to present the role of TTCs in the development of technological capabilities. The second scientific aim was to discuss the research results on the functioning of these institutions in Poland. Methodology The research method that was applied in the case of the first scientific aim was a theoretical analysis of the scientific works and reports in the field of technological capabilities and cooperation between the science and business sectors. In order to achieve the second scientific aim empirical research was conducted from the perspective of 820 representatives of academic staff. Findings The research study reveals that the analyzed TTCs of Poland have an immense potential to provide an effective support for the development of technological capacity of the companies operating in the local area. This potential is not fully utilized due to an insufficient activity of the TTCs in terms of both establishing and maintaining cooperation with business in the area of implementing a technological change as well as technology commercialization (not sufficient managerial and marketing capabilities). It reflects the weakness of the whole system of technology transfer in Poland and results the lover level of technological capabilities of both sectors. Conclusions The authors emphasize the need for a more effective support for the companies in their innovation activities by the TTCs in Poland, which could result in strengthening technological capabilities in science and business sectors. However, this means intensifying the activities that promote cooperation between science and business as well as indicating how both sides could benefit through their participation in TTCs.","[Lis, Anna Maria] Gdansk Univ Technol, Ul Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland; [Majewska, Maria] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Ul H Wieniawskiego 1, PL-61712 Poznan, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Lis, AM (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Ul Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland.",Anna.Lis@zie.pg.gda.pl,"Majewska, Maria/GVT-1525-2022; Lis, Anna/AAH-5680-2020",,,,,,35,0,0,0,2,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,564,572,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200070,0

The obtained data compare, in the period from 2010 to 2012, with the application of the relative numbers, or index and percentages. For each county is determined by the size of the revenue generated per capita. Based on this we derive a conclusion about the differences in the development of the county. Scientific aim is to investigate how individual levels of local authorities involved in the achievement of the total revenue of all local government units. The goal is to determine the importance of individual levels of local government in the realization of total revenue. Findings confirmed that the total revenues and receipts of local and regional (regional) governments, at the level of all counties in 2012 compared to 2010 decreased. This indicates less able to satisfy public needs. Total revenues and revenues per capita in individual counties differ significantly. Established the importance of funding public needs at the level of the budgets of cities. Conclusions relate to confirmation various participation of individual counties in overall revenues and receipts. These differences are the result of territorial organization, that determined the number of counties, cities and municipalities. The assumption that city budgets have the most significant effect on financing public needs has been confirmed, followed by county budget, while municipal budgets have significantly smaller opportunity to participate. The results of this work suggest the need to review the justification of existing territorial organization.","[Mahacek, Dubravka] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Med Osijek, State Audit Off, Kamenita Vrata 8, Pozega 34300, Croatia; [Vcev, Aleksandar] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Med Osijek, Josipa Hutlera 4, Pozega 31000, Croatia",,"Mahacek, D (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Med Osijek, State Audit Off, Kamenita Vrata 8, Pozega 34300, Croatia.",dmahacek@vup.hr,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,2,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,665,672,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200082,0
J,"Mahembe, EE; Odhiambo, NM",,,,"Mahembe, Edmore E.; Odhiambo, Nicholas M.",,,Does foreign direct investment cause economic growth? A dynamic panel data analysis for SADC countries,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Emerging markets; Foreign direct investment (FDI); Economic models; Economic growth; Emerging economies; Economics,FINITE-SAMPLE PROPERTIES; ERROR-CORRECTION MODEL; UNIT-ROOT TESTS; CAUSALITY TESTS; VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIONS; COINTEGRATION APPROACH; HETEROGENEOUS PANELS; TIME-SERIES; LED GROWTH; FDI,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the causal relationship between inward foreign direct investment (FDI) and economic growth in Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries over the period 1980-2012. It also investigates whether the causal relationship between FDI inflows and economic growth is dependent on the level of income. Design/methodology/approach - In order to assess whether the causal relationship between FDI inflows and economic growth is dependent on the level of income, the study divided the SADC countries into two groups, namely, the middle-income countries and the low-income countries. The study used the recent panel-data analysis methods to examine this linkage. The Granger causality test for the middle-income countries was conducted within a vector-error correction mechanism framework; while that of the low-income countries was conducted within a vector autoregressions framework. Findings - The results for the middle-income countries' panel show that there is a uni-directional causal flow from GDP to FDI, and not vice versa. However, for the low-income countries' panel, there was no evidence of causality in either direction. The study concludes that the FDI-led growth hypothesis does not apply to SADC countries. Research limitations/implications - Methodology applied in this study is a bivariate framework which is likely to suffer from the omission of variable bias (Odhiambo, 2008, 2011). Second, the Granger causality analysis employed in this only investigates the direction of causality and whether each variable can be used to explain another, but does not directly test for the mechanisms through which FDI leads to economic growth and economic growth leads to FDI. Practical implications - Future studies may include a third variable such as domestic savings, exports, or financial development in a trivariate or multivariate panel causality model. A more complete analysis which seeks to explain the channels through which FDI impacts growth is suggested for future studies. Lastly, sector level analysis will help policy makers draft effective industrial policies, which can guide allocation of incentives. Social implications - The results of this study support the Growth-led FDI hypothesis, but not the FDI-led growth hypothesis. In other words, it is economic growth that drives FDI inflows into the SADC region and into Southern Africa, and not vice versa. This implies that the recent high economic growth rates that have been recorded in some of the SADC countries, especially the middle-income countries, have led to a massive inflow of FDI into this region. Originality/value - At the regional level, SADC as a regional bloc has been actively pursuing policies and strategies aimed at attracting FDI into the region. Despite the important role of FDI in economic development, and the increase in FDI inflows into SADC countries in particular, there is a significant dearth of literature on the causal relationship between FDI and economic growth. The study used the recent panel-data analysis methods to examine the causal relationship between FDI and economic growth in SADC countries.","[Mahembe, Edmore E.; Odhiambo, Nicholas M.] Univ South Africa, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Mahembe, EE (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa.",emahembe@gmail.com,,"Odhiambo, Nicholas .M./0000-0003-4988-0259",,,,,68,20,23,0,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Prices in low overconfidence markets tend to track the fundamental asset value more accurately than prices in high overconfidence markets and are significantly lower and less volatile. Additionally, we observe significantly higher bubble measures and trading volume in high overconfidence markets.

This article focuses on the assessment of financial health of agricultural enterprises in the Czech Republic. It determines the most and the least controllable parameters included in financial health assessment. The reliability of the selected models was also evaluated. The selected models include IN 05, Gurcik model, CH-index and the Rezbova OP model for the Operational Programme Rural Development. This reliability was tested on data from 200 enterprises which were in bankruptcy or liquidation at the time of the assessment. The data were taken from the Albertina Gold database. The third part includes a regression analysis of these four models to determine which indicators, both individual and mutual, are statistically significant for the outcome of the model and which of them influence the level of the assessment to the greatest extent. These two analyses were carried out on nearly 10,000 data entries from the Albertina Gold database. The values of assets and profit seem to be the most easily influenced. These values can be influenced by the choice of a depreciation method, creation of provisions and adjustments, but also by specific valuation that is largely done through calculations in agriculture. The most important indicators are profit and a group of indicators related to the enterprise's debt, such as interest payable, current liabilities and total debt.","[Nyvltova, Kristyna] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, FEK, Dept Accounting & Finance, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Nyvltová, K (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, FEK, Dept Accounting & Finance, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",dvorak10@ef.jcu.cz,"Nývltová, Kristýna/D-7214-2016",,,,,,16,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-4781,,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,236,243,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000030,0

Thus, this research assessed the effects of underlying psychometric attitudes, such as fish consumption experience and taste preferences among others, over the probability of eating fish at the recommended level of twice a week in Modern Metropolitan Lima, Peru. A latent-variable-based instrument on validated 5 points Likert scales was applied to a stratified random sample of 159 Modern Metropolitan Lima fish consumers. An ordered logistic regression was used to analyze the marginal probabilities of Peruvian individuals that consume fish twice a week or less. The results showed that underlying psychometric variables as taste preferences and past experience contributed significantly to the probability of eating fish at a recommended level. Contrarily, it was found that perceived health benefits of eating fish, and demographic control variables did not have any impact on fish consumption frequency. Outcomes may have insightful implications on promotion, marketing and sales of fish in Peru, particularly to the positive fish consumers, who consume fish more frequently in Modern Metropolitan Lima.","[Pierre Bolanos, Jean; Higuchi, Angie] Univ Pacifico, Fac Business Sci, Ave Salaverry 2020 Jesus Maria, Lima 11, Peru",Universidad del Pacifico Peru,"Bolaños, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Pacifico, Fac Business Sci, Ave Salaverry 2020 Jesus Maria, Lima 11, Peru.",j.bolanoshurtado@alum.up.edu.pe; a.higuchi@up.edu.pe,"Bolaños, Jean Pierre/IZQ-3809-2023","Bolaños, Jean Pierre/0000-0003-0445-3798",,,,,28,2,2,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,59,66,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000007,0

The solution is subdivided into two parts. In the first part, long-term development tendencies are being discovered, described and modelled, of important indicators of the agricultural sector efficiency, of labour market and of typical natural measures of primary agricultural production in the CR. Applying advanced statistical methods from time series analysis domain, the long-term tendencies of a broad spectrum of Czech agriculture efficiency aspects are being described as based on the development of selected indicators, and future development forecasts are being constructed. In the second part, the paper analyzes Czech agriculture's self-sufficiency level. The authors start from accessible data bases of Czech Statistical Office, CR Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Local Development. When modelling statistically the balance of agricultural production and food self-sufficiency, data on CR foreign trade and customs statistics are analyzed. Based on the analyses mentioned above, development of food security level and of State food self-sufficiency is being predicted, taking into account potential impacts connected with the new European Union Common Agricultural Policy (EUCAP), with CR Ministry of Agriculture efforts for sustainable rural and agriculture development and with nutrition policy of the CR. In spite of satisfactory nature and climate conditions of Czech countryside, efforts to stop or to moderate at least, the drop of domestic production in economically demanding commodities, have so far failed. CR food self-sufficiency has gradually been reduced from the long-term viewpoint. Reduction has accelerated after the Country's accession to EU. Opinions concerning importance of food self-sufficiency and its degree differ. The aim of the paper based on specific research has been to find and offer appropriate instruments for the analysis of the Country's food self-sufficiency level and development and factors affecting it.","[Prochazkova, Radka; Prasilova, Marie; Hlouskova, Zuzana] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Procházková, R (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",prochazkova@pef.czu.cz; prasilova@pef.czu.cz; hlouskova@pef.czu.cz,"Prasilova, Marie/H-7428-2018","Prasilova, Marie/0000-0003-2922-2291",,,,,15,2,2,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-4781,,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,284,290,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000036,0

There are four analysed economics during the period 2008-2014: Czech Republic, European Monetary Union, Great Britain and the USA. No surprise that multipliers had tendencies to decline, especially from high values in the Great Britain and the USA. Development was quite surprising in the EMU, where all multipliers were very stable. We have observed the biggest exceptions in the USA, and the Czech Republic, respectively. Money multiplier of M1 is still less than 1 in the USA. Czech Republic is specific according to the values of credit multiplier. They are lower than values of money multiplier of M2, and even lower than multiplier of M1 since 2012.

Methodology/methods Multimethod qualitative research was chosen concerning retail real estate developers' activity at trade fairs in Europe, including participant observation and a case study. The approach adopted by the authors of the paper can be called triangulation, since many qualitative research methods were applied in different periods of the research. Scientific aim The literature on trade fairs has not so far adopted an experiential perspective. So, there is a research gap, resulting from the lack of research on the evolution of the experiences, building through the trade fair performances in the long-term development project. Therefore, the scientific aim was to partially fill this gap by examining how the influence on the senses of trade fair partipants is changing, in the context of infant developers of retail real estate managing the projects. Findings Shopping centre development projects' life cycle can be divided into the following stages: initiation, planning, preparatory execution, real execution and closure. In each of these stages the role of customers' experiences is different, and the extent of trade fair activities oriented at customers' experiences also differ. Special attention in the area of creating experiences requires second and third stages, when the booths should be places of integration, using sensory marketing, where exhibitors infuence all the senses of visitors in a coherent manner. Conclusions The paper fills the research gap, because so far scientists have occasionally addressed the experiences created during trade fairs. But the exploration of the phenomenon of using trade fairs to stimulate the visitors' senses requires the realization of further studies.","[Siemieniako, Dariusz] Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Management, Ul OS Tarasiuka 2, PL-16001 Kleosin, Poland; [Gebarowski, Marcin] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Fac Management, Al Powstancow Warszawy 10, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland",Rzeszow University of Technology,"Siemieniako, D (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Management, Ul OS Tarasiuka 2, PL-16001 Kleosin, Poland.",d.siemieniako@pb.edu.pl,"Siemieniako, Dariusz/C-7013-2018","Siemieniako, Dariusz/0000-0002-9373-3558",,,,,36,0,0,0,1,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,212,220,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200025,0

The paper looks at the effect of short-term feedback and context on behavior and offers new perspectives on the processes by which decisions are made under conditions of rapid change and uncertainty. The results show that search behavior is affected by feedback on short-term investment returns and the volatility of those returns, conditional upon investor style and context, with considerable evidence of both reactionary behavior and avoidance within the domain of losses. No evidence is found to support the disposition effect, with investors instead found to be more likely to review and cut material losses based upon overall context.

The goal of this article is to analyse the development of the Latvian corporate bond market and, thus, to evaluate the presence of the alternative to bank financing. The paper argues that while many academics have studied the development of the corporate bond market, most of the researchers introduce the descriptive framework to analyse the emerging economies. The more structured frameworks in the form of the comparative factor analysis introduce the ratio type comparison and it is applied to the developed economies. The paper analyses the Latvian corporate bond market with the descriptive factor analysis framework. The paper discovers that the Latvian corporate bond market is reasonably represented and developed when analysed by the selected descriptive factor analysis framework. The paper concludes that the current level of the development of the Latvian corporate bond market makes it possible to attract the capital for the sovereign, quasi-sovereign and financial sector companies. The paper suggests the further analysis by applying a comparative factor analysis framework where the Financial Sector Development Indicators (FSDI) study and the study by Wyman (2015) should be applied.","[Tocelovska, Natalja] Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Aspazijas Bulvaris 5, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Tocelovska, N (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Aspazijas Bulvaris 5, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia.",natalja.tocelovska@sseriga.edu,"Tocelovska, Natalja/HZK-0053-2023","Tocelovska, Natalja/0000-0002-1235-6579",,,,,11,0,0,3,6,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4261-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,374,382,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8MD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392433400044,0

These risks were strongly acknowledged in Romania also, following the markets liberalization, creating confusion in many instances and also creating dissatisfaction among the ones that were registering losses. For such reasons even, the current paper aims to scientifically explain the necessity to introduce and use, at a wider scale, some management techniques and instruments for fighting the market risk that has to be assessed before registering any losses and to be understood in exact quantitative terms. The paper presents methods to determine the market's volatility and ends by presenting a case study in which is illustrated how can be optimized a title portfolio consisting of n financial assets that are temporarily owned by a person so that this person's exposure to the market risk should be evaluated and diminished.

Methodology/methods The empirical research conducted has focused on identifying the main reasons present connected with the implementation of QEHS management systems and tools to improve operational processes (such as TPS, or LM) by companies operating in Poland. The study was carried out from through the use of a postal survey. Scientific aim The scientific goal of the development of the article is to determine the role of risk management concepts, being the current and most up to date approach in the implementation and improvement of the quality management system. Findings The results of the study indicate that enterprises operating in Poland and implementing QM systems focused especially on reducing the risk of nonconformity in the processes and reducing the risks of product. Companies improving QM systems most often implement an environmental management system and a health and safety management system as well as other improvement tools like elements of TPS and LM. Conclusions It can be observed that for many companies operating in Poland the distinguishing feature of competitiveness is not the implementation of a quality management system which complies with the requirements of standard ISO 9001, but, increasingly, companies are focusing their attention on other solutions of the system, consistent with the objectives of other organizational standards, like environmental, health and safety (EHS) management systems as well as the other operational management tools based on TPS or LM concept. Such an approach is often not only perceived as being more ambitious, but also more pragmatic, as these solutions can bring companies more benefits, not only in economic but also social terms.","[Urbaniak, Maciej] Univ Lodz, Fac Management, 22-26 Matejki Str, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Urbaniak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Management, 22-26 Matejki Str, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland.",murb@uni.lodz.pl,"Urbaniak, Maciej/AAU-5485-2020","Urbaniak, Maciej/0000-0003-4127-1192",,,,,20,0,0,0,3,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,507,513,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200063,0

Both personal and corporate bankruptcy law are relevant for most small businesses, as even when businesses are incorporated, lenders often require that business owners personally guarantee loans to the business.

The positive analysis reveals that all three countries are converging on a similar regulatory system that combines strict liability, command-and-control, and management-based regulations for controlling site-specific risks. The timing of the adoption of each element in this regulatory system varies across the three countries and has been driven largely by accidents along the individual country's continental shelf. In particular, the adoption of the management-based approach occurred after a significant accident revealed the weaknesses of a one-size-fits-all set of prescriptive rules. Although the normative analysis reveals theoretical support for the use of both liability and management-based approaches, the empirical data are limited, and the data that do exist call into question the superiority of the management-based approach over command-and-control.

Using randomized field experiments in three different water utilities, we assess the effectiveness of social comparisons to reduce demand and analyze their interaction with existing conservation programs. In two utilities, the program decreases consumption by 5%, with significant heterogeneity across the distribution of baseline water use. We do not detect a statistically significant average treatment effect in the third utility. Social norms do not appear to crowd out existing conservation programs: treated households are more likely to participate in additional programs. Of the two utilities with significant treatment effects, higher participation rates in conservation programs account for a very small fraction of water savings (3%) in one utility and a modest fraction (9%-25%) in the second.

The analysis is based on a factor decomposition of the covariance matrix, in the time and frequency domain, using wavelets. The analysis aims to disentangle two components of volatility contagion (anticipated and unanticipated by the market). Once we focus on standardized factor loadings, the results show no evidence of contagion (from the US) in market expectations (coming from implied volatility) and evidence of unanticipated contagion (coming from the volatility risk premium) for almost any European country. Finally, the estimation of a three-factor model specification shows that a European common shock plays an important role in determining volatility co-movements mainly in the tranquil period, while in the period of financial turmoil, the US common shock is the main driver of volatility co-movements.

The Harvest of Hope programme provides credit, access to inputs and an outlet for organic vegetables. Comprehensive data on inputs are limited and in this study only land, labour, seeds and seedlings, compost and farmer experience are included. Non-parametric models are used to generate individual efficiency measures relative to best practice. The results revealed an average level of overall, technical and scale efficiency of 72.4%, 79.7% and 90.6%, respectively. Overall efficiency was negatively correlated with land holdings and the use of compost and seedlings. This is supported by the finding that the nine best-practice farms were characterised by a smaller scale of production, indicating that efficiency losses are experienced as greater quantities of inputs are used. In terms of area differences, Nyanga farms exhibit significantly higher technical efficiency, whereas farms in Khayelitsha are more scale efficient. Expenditure on compost and seed added value, although mulching or operator experience did not increase output substantially. The latter can be explained by the highly effective training programme provided that makes prior experience unnecessary to achieve good practice. Fully efficient farms are R2 600 per plot more profitable than inefficient farms, while farms that need a windbreak earn R700 less per plot per season than more sheltered operations. These results are the first of their kind for South Africa and lay the foundation for more effective extension to the sector.","[Dyer, Martin; Mills, Richard; Conradie, Beatrice] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Piesse, Jenifer] Bournemouth Univ, Dept Econ, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England; [Piesse, Jenifer] Univ Stellenbosch, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town; Bournemouth University; Stellenbosch University,"Dyer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",martin.dyer94@gmail.com; rwbmills1994@gmail.com; beatrice.conradie@uct.ac.za; jpiesse@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Conradie, Beatrice/ABG-3218-2020","Conradie, Beatrice/0000-0002-4675-6300",,,,,31,8,8,2,38,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,DEC,2015,54.0,4,,,,,73,86,,10.1080/03031853.2015.1116400,0.0,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,DG8ZH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372371600004,0

Conventions are two-sided because organizers must set fees to attract both consumers and dealers. We present several findings: first, consumer pricing decreases with competition, but pricing to dealers is insensitive to competition and in longer distances even increases with competition. Second, when consumer price is zero (and thus constrained), dealer price decreases more strongly with competition. These results are compatible with existing models of two-sided markets, but are difficult to explain without such models.","[Jin, Ginger Zhe] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Jin, Ginger Zhe] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rysman, Marc] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Bureau of Economic Research; Boston University,"Jin, GZ (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",jin@econ.umd.edu; mrys@bu.edu,,"Rysman, Marc/0000-0002-1544-2704",,,,,33,22,24,2,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

We find that the difference in required tasks is an important reason for earnings reduction after an inter-industry job change, and thus, workers may hesitate to move to industries requiring a different set of tasks for fear of losing the wage premium acquired by task-specific human capital. In addition, more workers switch to industries with which their previous industry had larger transactions, although it affects earnings changes only marginally. On the other hand, industry performance does not affect labor inflow or wage changes significantly for inter-industry job changes. Young men, less educated women, and those quitting previous jobs for family or health reasons are more likely to move to industries requiring a different set of tasks, and young individuals who lost their jobs involuntarily are less likely to do so. Individuals more likely to move are not necessarily those whose earnings loss associated with the move is small: earning losses associated with task distance are relatively small among younger and less educated workers and are uncorrelated with the reasons for quitting the previous job.

We explore how preference certainty and overconfidence impact the option value to revise today's decisions in the future. We design a laboratory experiment that creates a controlled choice environment, in which a subject's choice set (over food snacks) is known and constant over time, and the time frame is short - subjects make choices for themselves today, and for one to two weeks ahead. Our results suggest that even for such a seemingly straightforward choice task, only 45% of subjects can predict future choices accurately, while stated certainty of future preferences (one and two weeks ahead) is around 80%. We define overconfidence in predicting future preferences as: the difference between actual accuracy at predicting future choices and stated certainty of future preferences. Our results suggest strong evidence of overconfidence. We find that overconfidence increases with the level of stated certainty of future preferences. Finally, we observe that the option value people attach to future choice flexibility decreases with overconfidence. Overconfidence in future preferences affects economic welfare because it says people have too much incentive to lock themselves into future suboptimal decisions.

J,"Tisch, A",,,,"Tisch, Anita",,,The employability of older job-seekers: Evidence from Germany,JOURNAL OF THE ECONOMICS OF AGEING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Age inequalities; Employability; Employment prospects; Germany; Labour market; Older working-age population,LABOR-MARKET; UNEMPLOYMENT; SUCCESS; WORKERS; EUROPE; TERM; AGE,"Encouraged by the European Employment Strategy, the German government, like many other European governments, promotes individual employability as an instrument to improve the persistently low employment prospects of older job-seekers in the labour market. However, ageing is only rarely discussed in contemporary employability approaches. This article includes various employability approaches and empirically tests the commonly used dimensions of employability in actual labour market prospects with respect to older job-seekers (>50 years of age). Many dimensions of employability are found to vary by age, and older job-seekers can be described as disadvantaged with regard to certain dimensions. However, disadvantages in classical employability factors cannot fully explain the comparatively poor labour market prospects of older job-seekers. This article shows that older job-seekers in Germany are less likely to transit from unemployment to employment, even after controlling for employability factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
