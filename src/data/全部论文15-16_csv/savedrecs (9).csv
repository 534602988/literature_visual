However, the Responder cannot verify whether the delegation is effective or the third party merely plays a scapegoat role, while the decision is made by the Proposer himself. In this uncertain attribution setting, the Proposer can send an unverifiable message declaring his delegation strategy. One possible strategy is false delegation, in which the Proposer makes the decision but claims to have delegated it. In our sample, the recourse to false delegation is significant, and a significant number of potential Delegates accept serving in the scapegoat role. However, there are many honest Proposers, and 20% of all Delegates will refuse to be the accomplices of a dishonest Proposer. Responders tend to more readily accept poor offers in a setup that permits lying about delegation; the acceptance rate of the poor offer is the highest when Delegates can refuse the scapegoat role.

If credit allocation is efficient, banks terminate their relationships with risky borrowers. Alternatively, small business borrowers are more likely to end their relationships when they have poor investment opportunities and do not require borrowed funds. However, if the soft budget constraints of banks or credit crunches are a significant problem, banks are likely to continue their relationships with risky firms or end their relationships with nonrisky firms, which is representative of an unnatural credit allocation. Using Japanese firm-level data, we show empirically that these relationships end naturally, with natural credit allocation supported even during the recent global financial crisis.","[Tsuruta, Daisuke] Nihon Univ, Coll Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Nihon University,"Tsuruta, D (通讯作者)，Nihon Univ, Coll Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",tsuruta.daisuke@nihon-u.ac.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24730275]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24730275] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B)/24730275].,,22,1,2,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Institutions of higher education face multiple challenges in the contemporary world, such as massification of education, knowledge society, innovation, market forces, development of technologies, and globalization. The latter factor involves the student exchange (ERASMUS and other international programs), the growing number of full-time international students, the joint study programs, the need for training of the academic and administrative staff. All these issues are included into the concept of the university social responsibility. There has been quite extensive research in the field, paying attention to different aspects it, such as university reputation, sustainability, communication, social performance, etc., still there is not so much research regarding the university social responsibility within the context of globalization of education. The aim of the present study is to determine if the factor of globalization of education is a part of the social responsibility agenda in the Latvian higher education institution. In order to do this, we conducted in-depth interviews and semi-structured interviews with the international students. The results obtained would help the Latvian universities to develop their social responsibility programs, taking into account the interests of international students.","[Vevere, Velga] Lomonosova 1-5, LV-1019 Riga, Latvia",,"Vevere, V (通讯作者)，Lomonosova 1-5, LV-1019 Riga, Latvia.",velga.vevere@gmail.com,"Vevere, Velga/AAQ-7776-2020",,,,,,12,1,1,1,6,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2362,2369,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800293,0

The realization of the immense potential that lies in the branches of the services sector currently makes Russia's services sphere an important sector of the economy that is growing dynamically. It is safe to say that in the context of globalization, the services sphere is an important source of growth and life standard improvement (Berzakova, 2015; Ruttimann, 2014). In addition to this, the services sphere is instrumental in satisfying the material and cultural needs of the population (Volkova & Plotnikov, 2015). Personal self-fulfilment and self-actualization as attributes of high social value are achieved through the agency of the services sphere. Economically developed countries nowadays are marked by growing entrepreneurial and innovative activity mostly in the sector of small business thanks to the tendency for small scale service companies to develop sustainably (Madalina-Ioana, 2014; Perlmutter, 2014; Vernon, 1971). Therefore, managing the development of service companies necessitates the use of special methods that include efficiency and management quality assessment indicators (Richnak, 2015; Robinson, 2012; Tkachenko et al., 2015; Vertakova et al., 2014, A). Taking into account the fact that there is, as of now, no consistency in the methodology of services company management, and in view of the fragmentary nature of methods used for management efficiency assessment, which are also not adapted to the services sphere specifics, the subject of the study should be deemed relevant.","[Volkova, Albina A.] Shpalernaya Ulitsa 40,Flat 7, St Petersburg 191123, Russia; [Plornikov, Vladimir A.] Ulitsa Sikeyrosa 12,Flat 124, St Petersburg 194354, Russia",,"Plornikov, VA (通讯作者)，Ulitsa Sikeyrosa 12,Flat 124, St Petersburg 194354, Russia.",albvolkova@yandex.ru; plotnikov_2000@mail.ru,"Plotnikov, Vladimir/A-4854-2014",,Grant for State Support of Leading Scientific Schools [NSH-9726.2016.6],Grant for State Support of Leading Scientific Schools(Leading Scientific Schools Program),Prepared by Grant for State Support of Leading Scientific Schools NSH-9726.2016.6 The implementation of state economic policy through the development of tools of strategic and indicative planning.,,17,3,3,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2425,2432,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800301,0

The analysis of the variation of the agrarian structure employed the Gini coefficient and the average size of farms in individual districts in 1921 and in 2002 was calculated. The obtained results allowed to conclude that the agrarian structure in Poland is considerably spatially differentiated. Undoubtedly one of the reasons is the complex history of Poland's borderlines. The agrarian structure for selected districts which belonged to the same annexed territory is not significantly different. However, in the case of districts belonging to different annexed territories (even for neighboring districts), the differentiation of the agrarian structure was substantial and it still remains so.","[Walczak, Damian; Pietrzak, Michal B.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Walczak, D (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Torun, Poland.",dwalczak@umk.pl; michal.pietrzak@umk.pl,"Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/I-4919-2014; Walczak, Damian/K-1331-2014","Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/0000-0002-9263-4478; Walczak, Damian/0000-0002-2986-9928",,,,,18,7,7,0,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-22596-8,,,,2016,,,,,,,461,472,,10.1007/978-3-319-22596-8_33,0.0,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ0HR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000416839900033,0

To do that, the nonlinear score, accuracy and hesitation functions of IVIFNs are developed based on the normal distribution. The novelty of these nonlinear functions is that they have an additional variance value, which can have more information to rank IVIFNs than Xu and Chen's score function and Ye's accuracy function. Based on these nonlinear functions, a ranking method for IVIFNs is proposed. Furthermore, a nonlinearly optimized model is proposed to obtain attribute weights by integrating these nonlinear functions.

Design/methodology/approach - For the first time in the literature the type of trade specialization is taken into account, distinguishing manufacturing between export-specialized and import-specialized industries. Findings - There is evidence that materials and services offshoring have a significantly negative effect on employment in export-specialized industries. In contrast, there is a non-significant association in import-specialized industries. Research limitations/implications - These results may cast new light on the offshoring-employment relationship. Originality/value - Major contribution of this paper is that it sheds new light on the effect of offshoring on employment by distinguishing export-specialized industries from import-specialized industries.","[Yoon, Sang-Chul] Dankook Univ, Yongin, South Korea",Dankook University,"Yoon, SC (通讯作者)，Dankook Univ, Yongin, South Korea.",syoon@dankook.ac.kr,"Yoon, Sang-Chul/P-8129-2016",,,,,,27,1,1,2,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

We asked if there is a relationship between regional agricultural labour productivity and natural conditions, farmland fragmentation, urbanization economies related to urban scale and farm size structure as a proxy for internal scale economies. Two basic dimensions of farmland fragmentation were distinguished - land-use fragmentation and ownership fragmentation. Ownership fragmentation does not necessarily lower agricultural productivity, because farmland land can be consolidated through lease agreements into larger plots. Farmers operating on rented land tend to be, however, less productive than farmers operating on their own land. We ask if larger size and more regular shape of plots is related to higher agricultural labour productivity at micro-regional level despite the negative effects of land tenure. Positive effects of plot size and natural conditions on microregional agricultural labour productivity were found, while the effects of urban scale and farm size structure were found statistically non-significant.","[Zenka, Jan; Zufan, Petr; Slach, Ondrej; Krticka, Ludek; Pavlik, Adam] Univ Ostrava, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Human Geog & Reg Dev, Chittussiho 10, Ostrava 71000, Czech Republic",University of Ostrava,"Zenka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ostrava, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Human Geog & Reg Dev, Chittussiho 10, Ostrava 71000, Czech Republic.",jan.zenka@osu.cz; petr.zufan@osu.cz; ondrej.slach@osu.cz; ludek.krticka@osu.cz; adam.pavlik@osu.cz,"Ženka, Jan/AAJ-5648-2021",,,,,,27,0,0,3,6,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,628,633,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-80,0.0,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500081,0

As the trade networks are endogenously determined by trade and environmental conditions, we use as instrumental variables the growth in the population of trade partners and the growth in the population of trade partners' partners to exploit exogenous variation in the world trade network. Once we simultaneously estimate the environmental, trade, income, and network equations using a three-stage least square procedure, we find that network effects harm the environmental quality of developed countries but improve the environment of developing countries.

Drawing on a unique dataset collected through the administration of a questionnaire to a representative sample of the population of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, we have found that institutional trust is the strongest predictor of prosociality. This result suggests that, in collectivist societies with low levels of generalized trust, the lack of citizens' confidence in the fairness and efficiency of public institutions may compromise social order. The strengthening of institutional trust may also reinforce prosocial behaviour in individualist societies, where a decline in generalized trust has been documented by empirical studies.","[Andriani, Luca] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Management, London, England; [Sabatini, Fabio] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Econ & Law, Rome, Italy; [Sabatini, Fabio] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Lab Comparat Social Res, Moscow, Russia",University of London; Birkbeck University London; Sapienza University Rome; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Andriani, L (通讯作者)，Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Management, London, England.",luca.andriani@bbk.ac.uk; fabio.sabatini@uniroma1.it,"Andriani, Luca/JNS-6687-2023","Andriani, Luca/0000-0001-5541-4583; Sabatini, Fabio/0000-0002-1228-3322",,,,,60,21,22,0,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Results from both Johansen's (J Econ Dyn Control 12:231-254, 1988) and Toda and Yamamoto's (J Econom 66:225-250, 1995) methodologies are quite consistent. For the first six decades of the 20th century, a sub-period characterised by an inward oriented trade policy, we find that growth is fairly independent of foreign trade. This outcome contrasts with findings for the sub-period after the Stabilisation and Liberalisation Plan (1959), where a causal network among variables is supported. We find that both exports and energy imports have been a direct cause of the growth experienced since the sixties. Empirical results from Toda and Yamamoto suggest that the rest of the imports may have also played an important role but after the incorporation of Spain into the European Community (1986).","[Balaguer, Jacint; Florica, Tatiana] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Balaguer, Jacint] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Int Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Ripolles, Jordi] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Business Econ, Palma De Mallorca, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Jaume I; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Balaguer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",jacint.balaguer@uji.es; al121610@uji.es; jordi.ripolles@uib.es,"Balaguer, Jacint/H-9677-2019; Ripollés, Jordi/AGL-5986-2022; Ripolles, Jordi/R-6942-2018","Balaguer, Jacint/0000-0003-3798-1976; Ripolles, Jordi/0000-0002-8637-6871","University Jaume I [P1.1B2012-59]; European Union FEDER founds; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-48496-C4-1-R, ECO2014-58975-P]",University Jaume I; European Union FEDER founds(European Union (EU)); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"Financial support from the University Jaume I (P1.1B2012-59), the European Union FEDER founds and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (ECO2013-48496-C4-1-R; ECO2014-58975-P) is gratefully acknowledged.",,41,3,3,0,17,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Evidence shows that tax compliance is the result of a far more complex decision rule, involving both individual and group motivations, along with nonmonetary components. In this paper, we consider a game in which the individual decision to be tax compliant is affected both by strategic competition between taxpayers and the psychological cost of being detected (i.e., shame). We ran a laboratory experiment using a sample of 138 students at the Centro di Economia Sperimentale A Roma Est (CESARE) to evaluate the efficiency of random versus targeted audit rules and to verify the interaction between strategic competition and shame. The experimental results show that strategic competition between taxpayers plays a critical role in reducing tax evasion.

In empirical analysis, FDI and environmental degradation are jointly determined under the given threshold variable and other exogenous variables. Using carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per capita as a proxy for environmental degradation, the results show that increasing FDI worsens CO2 emissions after a threshold level of corruption has been reached. Our results demonstrate that increasing FDI will increase CO2 emissions when the degree of corruptibility is relatively high. The study suggests that further FDI and improved environmental quality are competing rather than compatible objectives in high-corruption countries and are compatible rather than competing objectives in low-corruption countries. Higher trade liberalization in low-corruption countries could contribute to negative environmental consequences because of the increased output or economic activity which results from increased trade. The robustness estimation confirms the evidence that pollution and economic development increase together up to a certain income level, after which the trend reverses.","[Chang, Shu-Chen] Natl Formosa Univ, Dept Business Adm, Yunlin, Taiwan",National Formosa University,"Chang, SC (通讯作者)，Natl Formosa Univ, Dept Business Adm, Yunlin, Taiwan.",shu-chen@nfu.edu.tw,,,,,,,49,18,19,3,47,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

Although the concept of slow tourism presents certain consensus in academic studies, it still encounters a lot of operational challenges, which could be properly solved through the educational training of operators and consumers and the economic value chain formed by industry alliances. In terms of the practical operation, the slow tourism promotion architecture is developed for promoting slow tourism in Green Island, Taiwan. The architecture is divided into two stages. The preparation stage focuses on communication, training, and the improvement of industrial environment to form the slow tourism industry alliance for cross-selling and importing visitors. The operational stage tends to form the overall image of the destination by maintaining the quality of slow tourism through review and innovation and gradually extend the slow tourism industry alliance. The key role in the promotion architecture is local intermediary organizations which integrate internal and external resources to have slow tourism present the maximal benefits.","[Chao, Ren-Fang] I Shou Univ, Dept Leisure Management, Kaohsiung 84001, Taiwan",I Shou University,"Chao, RF (通讯作者)，I Shou Univ, Dept Leisure Management, 1,Sec 1,Syuecheng Rd, Kaohsiung 84001, Taiwan.",rfchao@isu.edu.tw,,"Chao, Ren-Fang/0000-0002-4285-3971",Ministry of Science and Technology [102-2621-M-214-001],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),The financial support of the Ministry of Science and Technology (102-2621-M-214-001) for this study is gratefully acknowledged.,,50,3,3,3,41,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

The novelty of our approach is that we distinguish between aggregate and sectoral channels of uncertainty and compare their effects on the unemployment rate. Using S&P500 data we construct both an aggregate measure of time-series volatility in stock returns and a sectoral measure of cross-industry uncertainty in stock returns. We find that an increase in aggregate uncertainty leads to an immediate increase in unemployment, only lasting for three quarters. An increase in sectoral uncertainty leads to a longer-lasting increase in unemployment, with the peak impact occurring after two years. The combination of the two channels can account for the unemployment experience during periods such as the Great Recession when unemployment increased sharply at the outset and remained persistently high. The results are based on a standard macroeconomic vector autoregressive model and are shown to be robust to various checks, as well as to the use of other techniques such as a local projection method.

It illustrates the application of a multicriteria decision-making process to supplier selection within a service setting where it is less common than in a manufacturing context. To implement the study, a survey instrument was created and submitted to Taiwanese hospitality firms, namely hotels and restaurants, to identify contributing factors in the selection of a seafood supplier within six initial areas concerning food hygiene, staff training, crisis management, information technology, competitive ability, and logistics and quality assurance. The analytic hierarchical process (AHP) was then applied to the survey results, and the first-and second-level hierarchical factors were rigorously identified and ranked. These can be regarded as useful benchmarks in identifying and ranking the selection and evaluation of a food supplier within the industry. The present study enhances the understanding of supplier selection in the hospitality industry and provides insights which hospitality firms can apply in managing their supply chains. The managerial and research implications of these findings are discussed.","[Chung, Kaie-Chin] Taoyuan Innovat Inst Technol, Dept Hospitality Management, Taoyuan 32091, Taiwan",,"Chung, KC (通讯作者)，Taoyuan Innovat Inst Technol, Dept Hospitality Management, 414,Sec 3,Jhongshan E Rd, Taoyuan 32091, Taiwan.",david@tiit.edu.tw,,,,,,,28,2,2,1,37,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

When a bureaucrat's actions are transparent, his overseer faces a political time inconsistency problem-she is tempted to revise her retention rule in the middle of the policymaking process. As a result, the bureaucrat's equilibrium behavior overemphasizes later tasks. If the overseer knows the technology by which policies translate into outcomes, then she can eliminate these distortions using task-specific budget caps. However, if the overseer is uncertain about this technology, such budget caps introduce ex post inefficiency. When uncertainty is sufficiently large and consequential, the overseer prefers an institutional environment with a fungible budget and no transparency. Such an environment allows the overseer to exploit the bureaucrat's expertise, though at the cost of weaker overall incentives.

This new synthesis reveals that, in all major ownership-based societies, individuals have entered into economic dealings by issuing enforceable claims to their property on the basis of ownership and security. Claims to property historically emerged in two forms: (i) debtor-issued claims, including negotiable instruments and book accounts; and (ii) creator-issued claims, such as bank notes and bank deposits. Commodities, coins, and state instruments attain their monetary roles because they allow private claims to be finally settled. Eight archetypes of monetary arrangements, reflecting the historical evolution of monetary systems, are identified and compared.

We first identify a Pareto distribution for the upper-tail distribution. Unexpectedly, we observe that overall the Pareto coefficients decreased over the years from 2001 to 2013, which has not been reported previously in the literature. In particular, the Pareto coefficients dropped significantly during 2001 to 2008, and then fluctuated at the lowest level after 2008. A decreasing Pareto coefficient implies that the firm size inequality of the China's listed companies continuously increases during these years. By analyzing the relationship between the growth and size of firms based on a panel data model, we find that one possible reason causing the Pareto coefficients to decrease is that large firms grow faster than small ones, which is in particularly true during the non-tradable shares reform period. Furthermore, estimation results of the panel data model show that after 2008 large firms grew not as fast as they would before 2008, indicating a possible negative outcome due to the global financial crisis, which affected the growth of large firms. In addition, we examine the newly listed companies and discover that the newly listed companies with size greater than the lower bound of Pareto distribution also contribute to the decrease of the Pareto coefficients.

Quantitative analysis of student perceptions of university subjects traditionally has been based on instruments containing a list of items (statements) to which students respond in an item-by-item manner using Likert-type rating scales. The main purpose of this paper is methodological: we propose and apply a novel application of a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to evaluate and measure the individual contributions of various subject and teaching attributes on student satisfaction with higher education teaching experiences. We are not proposing the use of a DCE approach as an alternative to regular classroom evaluation exercises. Rather, we see the approach as complementary, especially because DCEs are an attempt to deal with rating scale related issues such as response styles and inter-item correlation. A representative Australia-wide sample of university students completed an evaluation ratings task (the instrument) and/or an evaluation DCE task (the experiment). Our results compare the findings of the instrument and experiment model estimations in terms of their ability to identify the relative importance of various evaluation items that drive student satisfaction. We also use a latent class analysis to explore differences in effects for sub-groups of students. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Naive respondents with more steeply declining impatience are more likely to be debtors. The sign effect relates negatively to borrowing. Survey responses indicative of high or declining impatience are associated with credit card borrowing and other overborrowing indicators.","[Ikeda, Shinsuke] Osaka Univ, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan; [Kang, Myong-Il] Korea Univ, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Osaka University; Korea University,"Ikeda, S (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan.",,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [26380239]; Joint Usage/Research Center Project of ISER from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H05728] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Joint Usage/Research Center Project of ISER from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are very grateful to D.

In such a framework, it analyzes how the market structure of the telecommunications industry can matter for its contribution to long-run growth. It shows that policies which increase the number of firms and/or toughen competition imply higher innovative effort in the telecommunications industry and strengthen its contribution. Modeling entry into the telecommunications industry, this paper also shows that the entry either stops after a number of firms have entered or continues permanently. In the long-run, it is socially optimal to have permanent entry. This can necessitate subsidies to entry into the telecommunications industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In The Triple Package: How Three Unlikely Traits Explain the Rise and Fall of Cultural Groups in America, a new book intended for a popular audience, tiger mom Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld argue that relatively successful ethnic, religious, and national origin groups in the United States possess a common set of culturally determined traits that drive this success: a sense of group superiority, individual insecurity, and good impulse control. The book is an unscholarly romp through fields of ethnic stereotypes and immigrant anxiety that relies on anecdote, rather than data, and that ignores the selectivity of immigrant flows. In their insistence on the need for the whole triple package, however, the authors raise issues relevant to current research on noncognitive skills-that there are important trait-environment interactions in the determinants of economic success, and that the source and impact of aspirations deserves greater attention.","[Lundberg, Shelly] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Lundberg, Shelly] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Lundberg, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",,,,,,,,67,4,4,0,27,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

In the model, an expert has private information on the effect of a policy proposal and communicates to a set of voters prior to a vote over whether or not to implement the proposal. In contrast to previous game-theoretic models of political communication, the results apply to situations involving multiple voters, multidimensional policy spaces and a broad class of voting rules. The results highlight how experts can use information to manipulate collective choices in a way that reduces the ex ante expected utilities of all voters. Opportunities for expert manipulation are the result of collective choice instability: all voting rules that allow collective preference cycles also allow welfare-reducing manipulative persuasion by an expert. The results challenge prevailing theories of institutions in which procedures are designed to maximize information transmission. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

While previous studies focused on the relationship between trade and elasticity of demand for labor, we also consider the effect of international capital mobility. Our main findings can be summarized as follows. Firstly, the results confirm that increased trade has made labor demand more elastic in Austria, Finland, France, Germany, the UK and the US. Second, financial opening, as in the case of trade liberalization, affects labor demand, making it more elastic. We confirm this finding for Finland, Sweden, Korea, Germany and the UK In the case of Finland, Germany and the UK, both trade and financial opening render labor demand more elastic. Finally, we find that globalization has reduced the share of labor within total revenue, possibly due to reduction in the bargaining power of workers as suggested by Rodrik (1997).","[Seo, Hwan-Joo] Hanyang Univ, Sch Business Adm, Ansan 15588, South Korea; [Kim, Han Sung] Ajou Univ, Dept Econ, Suwon 16499, South Korea; [Lee, Young Soo] Korea Aerosp Univ, Sch Business, Goyang Si 10540, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Hanyang University; Ajou University; Korea Aerospace University,"Lee, YS (通讯作者)，Korea Aerosp Univ, Sch Business, 76 Hanggongdaehak Ro, Goyang Si 10540, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",seohwan@hanyang.ac.kr; hkim1@ajou.ac.kr; yslee@kau.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A2A1A01033345],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2013S1A2A1A01033345).,,36,6,6,0,13,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

Bank liquidity, capital adequacy and quality of the loan portfolio are important bank-specific factors. Growth rate of the gross domestic products, unemployment rate, financial crisis and level of interest rates matter among macroeconomic factors.

This outranked the regulatory environment which had been number one for the previous two years. Several reasons were cited by foreign bank managers but three stand out: (1) declining market share for foreign banks due to reduced number of multinationals doing business in China, (2) foreign banks reluctance to lend locally due to the global economic slowdown, (3) the aggressive lending strategies of Chinese banks. This paper focuses on the new reality of contemporary Chinese banking practice. We believe Chinese banks are learning and adapting. They are gaining expertise in a wide array of bank operations such as asset management, branching, securities, leasing and many more. To better understand the nature and context of growing Chinese bank competitiveness, we introduce and apply the concept financial econiche. Financial econiche refers to the learning and adapting that takes place in a specific financial ecological surrounding with attention paid to the macroeconomic need for harmonious development. Econiche theory borrows heavily from similar ideas in the natural world. We construct an evaluation indexation system based on the econiche theory, and use Huaxia bank as a case study.","[Zhang, Long; Xu, Qun] China Univ Geosci, Sch Humanities & Econ Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Shwiff, Steven] Texas A&M Univ Commerce, Dept Econ Finance, Commerce, TX USA",China University of Geosciences - Beijing; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University Commerce,"Zhang, L (通讯作者)，China Univ Geosci, Sch Humanities & Econ Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",zhanglongdragon@hotmail.com; Steven.Shwiff@tamuc.edu; xuq@cugb.edu.cn,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),Supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.,,21,2,2,0,24,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Its proponents have had to balance this objective, which they claim to draw from Islamic law (Sharia), against consumer demand for convenient products. In general they have opted to accommodate consumer demand, but surreptitiously, using legal ruses to disguise their compromises. Turkey's experience with credit cards offers a revealing case of the obfuscation in question. Having denounced credit cards as un-Islamic, Turkey's Islamic banks have all proceeded to issue credit cards of their own in order to remain competitive with their openly interest-friendly, conventional rivals. With local variations, the Turkish pattern resembles that of other markets where Islamic credit cards have made inroads. In Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates, too, Islamic credit cards function like those of the conventional banks with which they compete for customers. The Islamic features of Islamic credit cards amount to branding. Contrary to the claims of their proponents, they do not involve fundamental financial innovations.

Capitalizing on a comprehensive dataset consisting of annual immigration stocks of OECD countries from 207 countries of origin for the period 1984-2008, we explore different channels through which corruption might migrate. We employ different estimation methods using fixed effects and Tobit regressions in order to validate our findings. Moreover, we also address the issue of endogeneity by using the Difference-Generalized Method of Moments estimator. Independent of the econometric methodology, we consistently find that while general migration has an insignificant effect on the destination country's corruption level, immigration from corruption-ridden origin countries boosts corruption in the destination country. Our findings provide a more profound understanding of the socioeconomic implications associated with migration flows.","[Dimant, Eugen; Redlin, Margarete] Univ Paderborn, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany; [Dimant, Eugen] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Krieger, Tim] Univ Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; [Krieger, Tim] CESifo, Oxford, England",University of Paderborn; Harvard University; University of Freiburg,"Dimant, E (通讯作者)，Univ Paderborn, Ctr Int Econ, Dept Econ, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.",eugen.dimant@wiwi.upb.de,"Krieger, Tim/G-6241-2012","Krieger, Tim/0000-0003-0045-9172",,,,,82,23,26,0,17,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

Though LUPAs are games for which a closed-form solution does not seem to exist in general, our model generates several testable implications about the type of strategies played in equilibrium and the highest bid in a given LUPA.

The agents, whose efforts are complementary, are rewarded according to a sharing rule chosen by the principal. Depending on the sharing rule, the agents confront endogenous prisoner's dilemma or stag-hunt environments. Our main findings are as follows. First, we demonstrate that ongoing interaction among team members positively affects the principal's payoff. Greater team cooperation is successfully induced with less generous sharing rules in infinitely repeated environments. Second, we provide evidence of the positive effects of communication on team cooperation in the absence of ongoing team interaction. Fostering communication among team members does not significantly affect the principal's payoff, suggesting that agents' communication is an imperfect substitute for ongoing team interaction. Third, we show that offering low sharing rules can backfire. The agents are willing to engage in costly punishment (shirking) as retaliation for low offers from the principal. Our findings suggest that offering low sharing rules is perceived by the agents as unkind behavior and hence, triggers negative reciprocity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper uses the Indonesian Family Life Survey to study the persistent effects of in utero exposure to Ramadan over the life cycle. The exposed children perform more child labor, score 7.4% lower on cognitive tests and 8.4% lower on math test scores. As adults, the exposed children work 4.7% fewer hours per week and are more likely to be self-employed. Estimates are robust to the inclusion of family fixed effects, particularly for hours worked and test scores. Moreover, results are strongest for religious Muslim families, while insignificant for non-Muslims. Back of the envelope calculations reveal an implied fasting rate of 68%-82% among pregnant Muslim women. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, government spending shocks have larger effects than net tax shocks.

However, losses encountered in the aftermath of the global financial crisis led to a major review of superannuation, mainly in response to the lack of accountability, comparability, and transparency discovered within default' investment options. An outcome of this review was the MySuper initiative, which imposes obligations on fund providers to reconfigure their default investment strategies in accordance with new regulatory requirements. Despite these policy reforms, other challenges remain, such as gender inequality, excessive superannuation fees, low financial literacy, and lack of member participation in growing retirement savings. The paper provides a review of literature pertaining to the background, significant policy changes, and ongoing development of the Australian superannuation system. We emphasise the role of superannuation in the economy; characteristics of the industry, plans, and funds on offer; recent policy initiatives; and perceived inadequacies of the system. The paper concludes with possibilities for further empirical research.","[Panha Heng] So Cross Univ, Sch Business & Tourism, Gold Coast, Australia; [Niblock, Scott J.; Harrison, Jennifer L.] So Cross Univ, Sch Business & Tourism, Finance, Gold Coast, Australia",Southern Cross University; Southern Cross University,"Heng, P (通讯作者)，So Cross Univ, Sch Business & Tourism, Gold Coast, Australia.",scott.niblock@scu.edu.au,"Niblock, Scott/P-1397-2017","Niblock, Scott/0000-0001-9840-238X","Capital Market Cooperative Research Centre, Sydney, Australia","Capital Market Cooperative Research Centre, Sydney, Australia(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme)","Mr Panha Heng, PhD Candidate, Dr Scott J.

J,"Sarkar, S",,,,"Sarkar, Sudipto",,,Price limits and corporate investment: The consumers' perspective,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Real option; Investment; Price cap; Consumer welfare,CAPITAL STRUCTURE; CAP REGULATION; CHOICE,"This paper uses a real-option model to examine how a price cap affects a regulated firm's investment timing/capacity decision and the resulting consumer welfare. The model is too complex to allow for closed-form solutions, hence the results are derived numerically. We show that optimal investment size is an increasing function of price cap, and optimal investment trigger is initially decreasing and subsequently increasing in price cap, hence there is a unique price cap that minimizes investment trigger. The resulting consumer welfare is initially increasing and subsequently decreasing in price cap, thus there is also a unique price cap that maximizes consumer welfare. These two price caps are generally different, and can be substantially different in certain cases; therefore, accelerating investment will not necessarily make consumers better off. Also, increasing (decreasing) the price cap results in a slight (large) reduction in consumer welfare, which implies that consumers are paradoxically better off with a too-high price cap than a too-low price cap. The central message of the paper is that consumers and consumer advocates should be interested in the price-cap setting process, since the price cap impacts consumer welfare, sometimes in unexpected ways.

This method allows the researcher to investigate the asymmetric effects of innovations in oil prices on variables without knowing data generating process is linear or not. Empirical findings that, the oil prices changes have asymmetric effects on CPI and RER at one standard deviation shocks in different periods unlike GDP.

We investigate why monetary policy has been ineffective in insulating domestic liquidity from capital inflows and why some countries from emerging Europe have been especially constrained in responding to the crisis. Our contribution is threefold. First, we show that countries with fixed exchange rate regimes have encountered significant obstacles to conducting monetary policy to cope with large capital inflows and credit booms during the period preceding the financial crisis. Second, we illuminate how pegged countries have been more constrained in responding to the global financial crisis than non-pegged economies.

The case of Vietnam,POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PRIVATIZATION; MOBILITY,"Although most countries follow a market economy, they still maintain a number of state-owned firms. In Vietnam the process of firm privatisation has been going on since the early 1990s. However, state-owned firms and joint-venture firms with public capital still account for nearly 40% of total firm output. In this article we find that the privatisation of firms can help households improve their welfare and reduce poverty, albeit by a small magnitude. The agglomeration of firms, as a result of privatisation, increases employment and wages of individuals and thus has a positive effect on per capita income, per capita expenditure and poverty reduction. In particular, the effect on per capita expenditure tends to be higher for households with male, younger and better educated heads than those with female, older and less well educated heads. We do not find any effect from state-owned firms on household welfare and poverty reduction.","[Long Thanh Giang; Cuong Viet Nguyen; Thieu Vu] Natl Econ Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Huong Vu Van] Acad Finance, Hanoi, Vietnam",National Economics University - Vietnam; Vietnam Academy of Finance,"Nguyen, CV (通讯作者)，Natl Econ Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam.",cuong@ippm.edu.vn,"Giang, Long/AAF-1536-2020; Nguyễn, Cường/JDV-5253-2023; Giang, Long/AAI-7052-2020; Nguyen, Cuong/L-8044-2018","Nguyen, Cuong/0000-0002-6803-3488","Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED), Vietnam [II4.5-2012.10]","Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED), Vietnam","This research was generously funded by Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED) under grant number II4.5-2012.10, Vietnam.

We construct measures of selection across skill groups and estimate the average and the skill-specific premium for migration and return for three typical destinations of Romanian migrants after 1990. Once we account for migration costs, we find evidence that the selection and sorting of migrants are driven by different returns to skills in countries of destination. Our identification strategy for the effects of work experience abroad permits a cautious causal interpretation of the premium to return migration. This premium increases with migrants' skills and drives the positive selection of returnees relative to non-migrants. Based on the compatibility of the results with rationality in the migration decisions, we simulate a rational-agent model of education, migration and return. Our results suggest that for a source country like Romania relatively high rates of temporary migration might have positive long-run effects on average skills and wages.","[Ambrosini, J.

Heterogeneous investors are assumed to discover and process fundamental information disclosed by accounting system of share-issuing entity. Information set available to share market investors for decision-making comprises then market-driven and firm-specific (non-market) information. On the one side, accounting system provides collective signal of fundamental information; on the other side, price system provides collective signal of market-driven information over time. Both jointly drive the formation of aggregate share market prices through limited knowledge, hazard, and social interaction. Numerical simulations are provided under alternative accounting designs (namely, historical cost and fair value accounting regimes), to derive implications and recommendations for the concept and occurrence of speculative bubbles and herd behavior; the cyclical effects of accounting regime on share market dynamics; and the value relevance of accounting information and its role in the formation of share market prices over time. This numerical statistical analysis contributes to shed light on accounting anomalies and fundamental analysis.","[Biondi, Yuri] CNRS ESCP Europe, Paris, France; [Giannoccolo, Pierpaolo] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy",heSam Universite; ESCP Business School; University of Bologna,"Biondi, Y (通讯作者)，CNRS ESCP Europe, Paris, France.",yuri.biondi@gmail.com; pierpaolo.giannoccolo@unibo.it,"Biondi, Yuri/J-8820-2012","Biondi, Yuri/0000-0002-5545-5550",,,,,72,11,11,0,25,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

If markets were perfect, opening the adjustment market to consumers would always increase ex post efficiency, hence welfare, as expected. In reality, some consumers hold private information on their value for electricity. We prove that under such information asymmetry, allowing consumers to participate in the adjustment market may reduce welfare. This arises because electricity suppliers in the model propose inefficient ex ante retail contracts to make them incentive compatible and to limit the information rents they must leave on the table for consumers to prevent them from misreporting their private information. If the value of ex post efficiency gains due to consumers' participation in adjustment markets is low, whereas the information distortion is high, the overall net effect is a welfare decrease.","[Crampes, Claude] Toulouse Sch Econ GREMAQ, Toulouse, France; [Crampes, Claude] IDEI, Toulouse, France; [Leautier, Thomas-Olivier] CRM, IDEI, Toulouse Sch Econ IAE, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Crampes, C (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ GREMAQ, Toulouse, France.",claude.crampes@tse-fr.eu; thomas.leautier@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,16,13,15,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

First, when firms choose investment before the government can commit to its taxes, the tax scheme creates strategic incentives for firms to distort their investment. Second, a system of differentiated taxes has a greater propensity to foster strategic distortions in investment than a uniform tax regime.

The model includes domestic energy production and consumption, trade in energy at world market prices, as well as private and public sector production. The model is calibrated to Egypt and used to study reforms such as reductions in energy subsidies with corresponding reductions in various tax instruments or increases in infrastructure investment. We calculate the new steady states, transition paths to the new steady state, and the size of the associated welfare losses or gains. Our main results for a 15% cut in energy subsidies are: (1) Steady state gross domestic product drops in most of our experiments as less energy is used in production. (2) Steady state consumption rises in most of our experiments. (3) Welfare can rise by as much as 0.6% in consumption equivalent terms. (4) The largest gains in terms of output and of welfare can be obtained when savings from energy subsidy cuts are used to fund additional infrastructure investment.

That is, the estimated effects of a policy intervention should be considered reliable only if that intervention is unlikely to trigger a revision in private sector beliefs about the way that monetary policy will be conducted. I show how to constrain simulations of forward guidance to ensure that they are regarded as modest policy interventions and illustrate the technique using a medium-scale DSGE model estimated on US data. I find that many experiments that generate the large responses of macroeconomic variables deemed implausible by many economists - the so-called forward guidance puzzle - are not modest policy interventions. Those experiments should therefore be treated with caution, since they may prompt agents to believe that there has been a change in the monetary policy regime that is not accounted for within the model. More reliable results can be obtained by constraining the experiment to be a modest policy intervention. In the cases I study, the quantitative effects on macroeconomic variables are more plausible when this constraint is imposed. (C) 2015 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This magnitude effect is robust across specifications including a nonparametric analysis and structural maximum likelihood estimation. Subjects are divided between two different elicitation mechanisms (one a matching task and one a choice task) that should both theoretically provide an incentive for participants to reveal theft true time preferences.

This paper presents an analysis of the possible explicit effects of various measures of financial markets' risk on real economy based on impulse response functions within structural vector autoregressive models. As discussed in the paper the riskiness of financial markets is closely related to the more traditional mechanisms based on financial accelerator approach, however, although the issue of financial risk is closely tied with the financial accelerator model, broader effects outside this model may be considered as well. The analysis is carried out for the Czech Republic. The estimates of the responses in the impulse-response analyses typically correspond with the hypothesized effects of the financial risk factors on the real variables; also the interrelations between some of the financial risk factors are obvious. We conclude that increased financial risk seems to be an amplifying element rather than the key driver in the interactions between financial and real economy.","[Posta, Vit] Univ Econ, Dept Microecon, Minist Finance, Prague, Czech Republic; [Pikhart, Zdenek] Univ Econ, Dept Econ & Social Policy, Minist Finance, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Posta, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Microecon, Minist Finance, Prague, Czech Republic.",vit.posta@vse.cz; zdenek.pikhart@vse.cz,"Pikhart, Zdenek/AAC-5933-2020",,,,,,33,0,0,2,20,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

This is distinct from seasonal adjustment, which controls only for the normal variation in weather across the year. We simultaneously control for both of these effects by integrating a weather adjustment step in the seasonal adjustment process. We use several indicators of weather, including temperature and snowfall. We find that weather effects can be important, shifting the monthly payroll change number by more than 100,000 in either direction. The effects are largest in the winter and early spring months and in the construction sector. A similar methodology is constructed and applied to data in the national income and product accounts (NIPA), although the manner in which NIPA data are reported makes it impossible to integrate weather and seasonal adjustments fully.","[Boldin, Michael] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Wright, Jonathan H.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia; Johns Hopkins University,"Boldin, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA.",,,,,,,,20,6,6,0,7,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

To estimate the causal effects of the scandals on various outcomes, we conduct an event-study analysis that exploits the fine distribution of the scandals over space and time. First, a scandal causes a significant and long-lasting decline in religious participation in the zip code where it occurs. Second, the decline in religious participation does not generate a statistically significant decline in religious beliefs, pro-social beliefs, and some commonly used measures of pro-social behavior. This evidence is consistent with the view that changes in religious participation during adulthood may have limited or no effect on deep beliefs and values. Third, the scandals cause a long-lasting decline in charitable contributions. Indeed, the decline in charitable giving is an order of magnitude larger than the direct costs of the scandals to the Catholic churches (e.g., lawsuits). If we assume that the scandals affect charitable giving only through the decline in religious participation, our estimates would suggest that the strong cross-sectional correlation between religious participation and charitable giving has the presumed direction of causality.

It does so by testing the hypothesis that the growth of federal government size in Canada over the long 1870-2011 period has had an inverted U shape with a tipping point in relation to private output Its contribution is three fold: first it argues that historical size should be linked to the level rather than the growth rate of private performance; second it incorporates formal controls for endogeneity; and third, nonparametric techniques assess whether the quadratic form most often used to test this hypothesis is appropriate. The empirical work finds the inverted U shape to be consistent with the data for Canada, but only for the 1870-1936 time period. In the post WW2 time period when federal size is above peak size, the data suggest that increases have imposed constant rather than increasing cost. The policy implication is that while government size complemented the growth of the Canadian private economy in its early stages, recent experience is more consistent with the hypothesis that increases in government size have decreased rather than increased private per capita output.

Most of the focus has been on the harmonization of policies relating to border control, the processing of asylum claims, and reception standards for asylum seekers. But this still falls far short of a fully integrated EU-wide policy. This article examines the basis upon which a joint EU policy can be justified. I then ask whether superior outcomes can be achieved by harmonization alone or if more centralized policymaking is necessary. I chart the progress of harmonization and burden-sharing in the development of the Common European Asylum System and explore its effects. I also study the political feasibility of deeper policy integration by analysing public attitudes in the European Social Survey. I conclude that deeper integration is both desirable and politically possible.

It also continued to generate positive inflation, though neither actual nor expected inflation is yet 2 percent. The real effects of Abenomics have been modest. Performance would have been better if not for two puzzles: The response of net exports to the weak yen was small, and there is little evidence that expansionary monetary policy had large effects on consumption.","[Hausman, Joshua K.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Wieland, Johannes F.] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Hausman, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,,50,13,14,0,19,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Differences in the players' abilities to analyze the available moves induce preferences over the complexity of the environment and hence incentives to manipulate that complexity. Other things equal, higher-skill players are more likely to win. In a class of long-horizon games with constant complexity, greater complexity reduces the advantage of the higher-skill player when the higher-skill player is the last mover. When the lower-skill player moves last, increasing complexity induces countervailing effects, either of which may dominate. Finally, when complexity can be manipulated over the course of the game, the benefits of strategic manipulation of complexity can override objective considerations about best move choice, resulting in purposeful departures from subgame perfect Nash equilibrium behavior.

The approach decomposes returns into their signs and absolute values, and specifies the joint distribution by combining a multiplicative error model for the absolute values, a dynamic binary choice model for the signs, and a copula function for their interaction. The conditional volatility and kurtosis are determined by innovations following a folded (or absolute) Student-t distribution with time-varying degrees of freedom, and separate time variation in conditional return skewness is achieved by allowing the copula parameter to be dynamic. Model estimation is performed with Bayesian methods using an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. An empirical application to the returns on four major international stock market indices illustrates the statistical and economic significance of the new model for conditional higher moments.

I then examine whether the discovery of an additional variable improves forecasting. Because agents do not know all of the variables in the model, they form expectations using bounded rationality. Under adaptive learning, agents form expectations by regressing a variable of interest on the revealed variables. Surprisingly, I find that the revelation of an additional variable often worsens forecasts, an event deemed a red herring, with probability greater than one-half. If the model includes endogenous variables that depend on agents' expectations, then revealing a new variable will occasionally lead to a catastrophic worsening of forecast accuracy. Under structural coefficients expectations, agents know how each revealed variable appears in the true model and they use this information to forecast. Now, the revelation of a new variable improves forecasting more often than not, I then apply the framework to a calibrated New Keynesian model and find that the revelation of a new variable usually worsens forecasting. Collectively, these results show that learning about a new variable may actually make forecasts less accurate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate a two-regime threshold system of factor demand equations for several manufacturing industries in the United States. Our results suggest significant nonlinear effects in the factor demand relationships in most nondurable goods sectors. Failure to account for this threshold sensitivity to input price change may cause the estimates of price elasticities to be biased.","Univ Florida, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Önel, G (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",gulcan.onel@ufl.edu,,"Onel, Gulcan/0000-0002-1446-1356",,,,,11,2,2,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

However, less is known about the demand side. In this paper, we compare the supply side assumptions versus the demand side assumptions as a cause of the empirical failures in the HOV prediction. While the relaxation in the supply side assumptions is crucial to predict the direction of factor trade, the demand side assumptions are shown to play an important role in explaining why factor trade is missing in relation to the HOV prediction. For example of the slope test for labor, the supply side repair improves from 0.026 to 0.162, whereas the demand side repair improves significantly from 0.162 to 0.891.","[Cassing, James] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, Pittsburgh, PA 15216 USA; [Nishioka, Shuichiro] W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; West Virginia University,"Cassing, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, 4908 WW Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15216 USA.",jcassing@pitt.edu,"Cassing, James H./A-8053-2009",,,,,,0,0,0,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

This construct has not, however, been tested empirically. In this study we analyse variations in FL on the part of individuals who experience major life-cycle events that show up in the data and that can be assumed to have repercussions on their personal finances. The analysis of a panel made up of approximately 12,000 people indicates that there is a correlation between 13 of the 17 selected life events and financial decisions, but only one of those events (job training) is associated with a change in FL. This evidence casts doubt upon the conceptualization of FL as an economic good and is in line with a series of other studies that, for one reason or another, have questioned the soundness of the current conceptual approach to FL.","[Castro, Ruben] Diego Portales Univ, Publ Policy Inst, Santiago, Chile; [Fortunato, Andres] Univ Chile, Sch Econ, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Castro, R (通讯作者)，Diego Portales Univ, Publ Policy Inst, Santiago, Chile.",ruben.castro@udp.cl; fortunato@hotmail.cl,"Castro, Ruben E/J-1948-2015","Castro, Ruben E/0000-0002-7289-9081",,,,,44,0,0,0,13,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,AUG,2015,,116,,,,,143,158,,,,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CY1FT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366152800008,0

But this is the option considered by the worker deciding whether to become self-employed, as are any resulting positive or negative changes to the worker's wages, hours worked, or likelihood of job or business termination and resulting unemployment. The full consequences of attempting self-employment are determined by comparing the actual income streams of individuals who do and who do not attempt self-employment. Selection on observables is controlled by employing nearest-neighbor matching with bias correction. The main result is that there is no significant evidence that individuals who attempt self-employment are punished for doing so: after 15 years, those who attempt self-employment receive an (insignificant) 8% and a (significant) 22% premium in labor income and in labor and asset income, respectively. The consequences of attempting self-employment vary by occupation: individuals in technical and professional occupations realize significant gains, of 45% to 62% after 15 years, whereas craftsmen see no significant differences in income. Quantile treatment effects on the treated are estimated and reveal that the average positive premiums are driven by the upper tail of the treatment effect distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

I show that foreign aid is a relatively new concept in economics, and I emphasize the role of exchange rate policies in the foreign aid controversies of the 1970s through 1990s. I show that in the early 1980s there were major changes in views regarding aid and agriculture. I emphasize the role of ownership of aid programs by the recipient countries as a way of increasing effectiveness. I argue that there is little hope of making progress in these debates if the economics profession continues to rely, almost exclusively, on cross section regressions.

Particularly, the issue of exposing the potential crisis transmission channels has attracted considerable interest. Aiming to contribute to this literature, we construct financial stress indices on a country level and explore further the potential inter-reactions between the root causes of systemic risk. The country-specific index consists of a wide number of series drawn from the money, equity and bond markets, as well as from the banking sector of each Eurozone country. A Euro Area stress index is also provided, exploring the evolution of financial conditions for this group of countries. The investigation of the potential transmission channels is implemented through a multivariate analysis and the corresponding impulse responses' dynamics. The empirical findings suggest that countries are mostly responsive to their own financial shocks, while a degree of regionalism is also evident. That is, the peripheral countries are more susceptible to their financial stress, while the same holds for the core Eurozone countries. Additionally, in contrast to common wisdom, financial conditions in Greece and Portugal do not seem to affect the rest of the Euro Area, at least in the degree that Italy and Ireland do.

However, if the probability of corrupt experts is large, the effect is not sufficient to offset the mechanical effect of decreased information efficiency due to corrupt experts.

While both factors are able to trigger or amplify economic shocks posing a threat for economic activity, it is a natural question whether they are related. The aim of this paper is to analyse the link between different measures of uncertainty and episodes of extreme capital flows for the EMU-12 countries using gross capital flows. We find that country-specific risk factors seem to play an important role in indicating periods of extreme capital flows. Moreover, country-specific uncertainty seems to be more relevant for foreign direct investors and for those in stressed countries of the Euro Area. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The state-space framework extends the methodology of the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) to fully make use of the time-structure present in corruption data. It is estimated using a Bayesian Gibbs sampler algorithm. The state-space framework holds many advantages from a practical, an estimation and a theoretical point of view. Most importantly, it significantly expands the period for which the index can be computed while at the same time addressing the selection bias issues that trouble the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). In addition, its estimates are more stable and have smaller confidence intervals than both CPI and WGI. Because the estimation is transparent and data is entered without any manipulations, the estimation procedure is more objective. Journal of Comparative Economics 43 (3) (2015) 782-803.

We characterize optimal contracts and study the conditions under which standard debt is optimal. Under suitable assumptions about the structure of the problem, standard debt contracts (SDCs) are optimal if and only if investor protection is sufficiently low. On the other hand, low investor protection results in higher funding costs and bankruptcy probabilities. In our setting, this implies that when SDCs are optimal, lowering investor protection reduces the entrepreneur's welfare. Numerical examples show that moderate changes in investor protection can have large effects on the terms of the contract and on the entrepreneur's welfare. Finally, we study the role of leverage and consider the welfare consequences of suboptimally implementing standard debt contracts.","[Tamayo, Cesar E.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Tamayo, Cesar E.] Interamer Dev Bank, Capital Markets & Financial Inst Div, Washington, DC 20577 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Inter-American Development Bank,"Tamayo, CE (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, 75 Hamilton St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",ctamayo@econ.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,41,3,5,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Empirical focus is on the assessment of income per capita on CO2 emissions in the Arctic countries by taking into account the role of energy consumption. An autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) modeling approach to cointegration is applied to annual data for the period 1960-2010. The results provide little evidence of the existence of the EKC hypothesis for the Arctic countries. We also find that economic growth has a beneficial effect on the environment only in some Arctic countries. Finally, energy consumption is found to have a detrimental effect on the environment in most countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Imperfections in savings and credit markets make it difficult for staple farmers to convert harvest season output into lean season consumption. We conduct a randomized evaluation of a seasonal food storage program and a food credit program. By providing improved ways to transfer assets across seasons, each program functions as a subsidy on lean season consumption. We find that neither program had effects on staple food consumption. The storage program increased non-food consumption. The credit program increased reported income and reduced seasonal gaps in consumption. Our results are consistent with positive income effects through the expansion of budget sets, but suggest that the average household could be close to staple food satiation.

We develop a model where the production of high-quality products requires high-quality inputs sold in monopolistically competitive foreign markets. The model predicts that exporters using imported inputs have low exchange rate pass-through, but this effect is weaker for firms shipping high-quality goods. This is due to the heterogeneous price adjustments of foreign suppliers selling inputs of different quality. We test the predictions of the model using Italian firm-level trade data for the period 2000-2006. The empirical analysis shows that the imports of intermediates have a significantly weaker effect in reducing the exchange rate pass-through into the export price of high-quality varieties. By showing that the import price of high-quality inputs is less sensitive to exchange rate variations, we provide evidence supporting the theoretical hypothesis that the pricing power of input suppliers weakens the import channel.

We develop a quantitative dynamic general equilibrium model with endogenous fertility and female labour force participation decisions. We use the model to assess the impact of the war on female labour supply and fertility in the decades following the war. For the war generation of women, the high demand for female labour brought about by mobilization leads to an increase in labour supply that persists after the war. As a result, younger women who reach adulthood in the 1950s face increased labour market competition, which impels them to exit the labour market and start having children earlier. The effect is amplified by the rise in taxes necessary to pay down wartime government debt. In our calibrated model, the war generates a substantial baby boom followed by a baby bust.","[Doepke, Matthias] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Hazan, Moshe] Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Maoz, Yishay D.] Open Univ Israel, Raanana, Israel",Northwestern University; Tel Aviv University; Open University Israel,"Doepke, M (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,"Hazan, Moshe/S-2470-2019","Hazan, Moshe/0000-0002-5459-5455; Doepke, Matthias/0000-0001-8073-6138",Maurice Falk Institute for Economic Research in Israel; National Science Foundation [SES-0217051],Maurice Falk Institute for Economic Research in Israel; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Francesco Caselli (the editor), four anonymous referees, Stefania Albanesi, Leah Boustan, Larry Christiano, Alon Eizenberg, Eric Gould, Jeremy Greenwood, Christian Hellwig, Lee Ohanian, and participants at many conference and seminar presentations for helpful comments.

Finally, we numerically analyze how the magnitude of search frictions is affected by the capacity choices of the firms.","[Godenhielm, Mats; Kultti, Klaus] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Godenhielm, Mats; Kultti, Klaus] Univ Helsinki, HECER, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Godenhielm, M (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, POB 17, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",mats.godenhielm@helsinki.fi; klaus.kultti@helsinki.fi,,"Kultti, Klaus/0000-0003-0827-6338",Academy of Finland; Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; Finnish Cultural Foundation; OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation,Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; Finnish Cultural Foundation(Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish IT center for science); OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation,"The authors would like to thank William Hawkins, Paul Heidhues, John Kennes, Philipp Kircher, Espen Moen, Pauli Murto, Heikki Pursiainen, Timon Tatur, Hannu Vartiainen, Juuso Valimaki, Makoto Watanabe, Randy Wright and the audiences at SED 2011, SaM Inaugural conference, the Workshop on Economic Decisions related to Search and Matching in Aarhus 2010 and EEA-ESEM 2009, for insightful comments.

By now research recognizes cognitive skills (as measured by achievement tests) and soft skills (personality traits not adequately measured by achievement tests) as equally important drivers of later economic outcomes, and skills are seen as multi-dimensional rather than one-dimensional. Explicitly accounting for soft skills often implies departing from the standard economic model by integrating concepts studied in behavioral and experimental economics, such as self-control, willingness to compete, intrinsic motivation, and self-confidence. We review how approaches from behavioral economics help our understanding of the complexity of educational investments and outcomes, and we discuss what insights can be gained from such concepts in the context of education.

Therefore, it is important to understand how much plants reduce their coal usage in response to higher coal prices to assess the effectiveness of the ETS in reducing carbon emissions. We analyze a novel panel of coal-burning large combustion plants from a subsample of eight EU countries and found that, holding constant the natural gas price, a 1% increase in the coal price results in a 0.36% decrease in coal consumption. At current ETS prices, this implies that the average large combustion plant in our sample EU countries is burning 7% less coal than it would be absent in the ETS. This suggests that the ETS has significantly reduced carbon emissions from coal-fired plants for the eight countries represented in our sample.","[Meyer, Andrew] Marquette Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA; [Pac, Grzegorz] Alfred Univ, Sch Business, Alfred, NY 14802 USA",Marquette University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Alfred University,"Meyer, A (通讯作者)，Marquette Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, 606 N 13th St,David Straz Hall, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA.",andrew.g.meyer@marquette.edu; pac@alfred.edu,,,,,,,32,1,1,1,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6108,1935-1682,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

In this context, it is frequently argued that private investment and the quality of thermal upgrades are too low in the light of the challenges faced and the potential energy cost savings. While many authors address the potential barriers for investors to increase energy efficiency, studies on the capabilities of different investors to reduce energy requirements of their property are scarce. This study investigates potential advantages of housing company's size, i.e. economies of scale, economies of scope and institutional learning in thermal upgrades of residential housing. Based on unique data on energy consumption in 102,307 apartment buildings in Germany, we present new evidence for the advantages and disadvantages of a housing company's size in green retrofitting projects. Our estimations show, that large housing companies outperform private landlords by far in high effort refurbishment projects. In contrast, private landlords appear to have advantages in low effort, incremental refurbishment activities. We demonstrate that a substantial share of the advantages of larger firms can be associated with specialization (i.e. repeated projects). The results offer new options for policy makers to refine the support schemes toward a low carbon housing stock. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study reviews recent developments in time series econometrics applications in the energy economics literature. We first consider the literature on the integration properties of energy variables. We begin with a discussion of the implications of whether energy variables contain a unit root and proceed to examine how results differ according to the specific unit root or stationarity test employed. We then proceed to examine recent developments in the literature on cointegration, Granger causality and long-run estimates between (disaggregated) energy consumption and economic growth. We review both single country and panel studies and pay particular attention to studies which have expanded the literature through adding variables such as financial development and trade, in addition to energy consumption to the augmented production function, as well as studies which have extended the literature through examining disaggregated energy consumption by type. In each case we highlight best practice in the literature, point to limitations in the literature, including econometric modeling challenges, and suggest recommendations for future research. A key message of our survey is that the profession needs to guard against 'overload' of research in these areas as most applied studies are no longer adding anything more to what is already known.

It is further shown that financial stability, ignored prior to the 'Great Recession', is important in economic policy. Fiscal policy can contribute to curing unemployment, especially so when coordinated closely not only with monetary policy but also with financial stability policies. It is also suggested that such coordination should be geared towards reducing income inequality. It is then high time that economists and economic policy-makers turned their attention more closely and seriously to restoring faith in fiscal policy with its strong macroeconomic role as a means of curing unemployment. Fiscal policy, properly coordinated with monetary and financial stability policies, should thereby be restored to its proper upgraded role in terms of economic policy.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge Ctr Econ & Publ Policy, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Arestis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge Ctr Econ & Publ Policy, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,,,,,63,14,14,3,20,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

These markets present economists with special difficulties when estimating cartel overcharges. Conventional approaches often rely on temporal approaches, where pricing during the cartel period is compared with prices in a competitive period. In markets with a legal cartel history, a competitive price cannot be identified in the period preceding illegal collusion. Structural change also reduces data, and hence the robustness of temporal models. Spatial approaches, where prices are compared with those in other countries, offer a better alternative. The paper studies the performance of temporal and spatial approaches in estimating overcharge in the context of a bitumen price-fixing case. The results suggest that, while the bitumen cartel may have responded to cost and demand shocks in a similar way to how players in more competitive markets respond, it was still cushioned by a large monopoly premium: the long-run level of South African bitumen prices are higher than in comparable competitive markets. The findings have implications for the study of transition dynamics from legal to illegal cartel regimes and for the detection of cartels.","Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Boshoff, WH (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.",wimpie2@sun.ac.za,"Boshoff, Willem H./D-7182-2012","Boshoff, Willem/0000-0003-1520-3997",,,,,30,6,7,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

These shifts are endogenously driven by large return shocks (innovations), reflecting large pieces of market news. These shocks are identified from the data as being bigger in absolute terms than the values of two threshold parameters of the model: one for the negative shocks and one for the positive shocks. The model can be employed to investigate different sources of stock market volatility shifts driven by market news, without relying on exogenous information. In addition to this, it has a number of interesting features which enable us to study the effects of large return shocks on future levels of market volatility. The above properties of the model are shown based on a study for the US stock market volatility.

Conversely, the negative volatility effect of offshoring is found to occur mainly in EU15 and Other' countries, which consists of developed countries that are relatively intensive offshorers.

We use a unique hand-collected database that covers Islamic banks worldwide over the period of 2000 to 2005, identifying evidence that Islamic banking development favors macroeconomic efficiency. Furthermore, we provide support for a non-linear relation between efficiency and Islamic banking development, which is measured by credit or by deposits. Although increasing the development of Islamic banking enhances efficiency up to a certain point, the expansion of Islamic banking becomes detrimental to efficiency beyond this point.

Coase was to demonstrate how mainstream economics was based on a contradictory amalgam of costly physical inputs and free institutional resources, and to give origin to the economics of institutions: each institution is a mode of allocation and organization of economic resources that is to be investigated. In particular, none of the institutions (including the market) is a free lunch. The Coasian approach regards institutions as costly substitutes and provides a fundamental starting point for comparative institutional analysis. However, Coase neglected two issues deriving from the observation that institutions are not cost-free. First, when institutions are costly, one should not only consider their possible substitutes but also how complementary institutions affect their costs, as well as the costs of the possible institutional substitutes. Second, the economic analysis should also take into account that the transition from one institutional setup to another cannot occur in costless meta-institutions. The initial conditions may substantially affect the final institutional arrangements. Both the novelty of Coase's approach and its limits were grossly undervalued. In particular, the costly institutions assumption requires a view of economics as a historical discipline.","[Pagano, Ugo] Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, I-53100 Siena, Tuscany, Italy; [Vatiero, Massimiliano] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Law IDUSI, Brenno Galli Chair Law & Econ, Lugano, Ticino, Switzerland; [Vatiero, Massimiliano] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Econ IDEP, Lugano, Ticino, Switzerland",University of Siena; Universita della Svizzera Italiana; Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Pagano, U (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Laterina 8, I-53100 Siena, Tuscany, Italy.",pagano@unisi.it; vatierom@usi.ch,"Vatiero, Massimiliano/C-3820-2013; Vatiero, Massimiliano/ABF-6606-2020","Vatiero, Massimiliano/0000-0002-2886-9870; Pagano, Ugo/0000-0002-9917-5091",,,,,53,18,19,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

In doing so, I show transaction costs (TC) to be always necessary and sufficient to explain institutions, but only in the Slutsky-Hicks and Samuelson ordinal framework where expenditure functions replace utility functions and actors merely transact services and never control, nor own goods. Yet, if actors can purchase (and therefore control) resources, utility in use cannot be univocally deduced from purchasing behaviours; here ordinal exchange theory must be replaced by Austrian subjective cardinal value theory, where value in use and value in exchange do not coincide. To explain the allocation of activities among firms in this case, actors' subjective opportunity costs are thus always necessary (and possibly sufficient), while TC are never sufficient. This distinction has fundamental implications for at least two main developments of Coase's original insights: the relationship among competition, socialist planning and the nature of the firm, and the reinterpretation of the Austrian concept of asset specificity in contemporary institutional and organizational economics (OE).","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Management, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rossi, E (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Management, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",e.rossi@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,93,2,2,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

In this context, currencies' realignments are still proposed to ensure global macroeconomic stability. These realignments are based on equilibrium rates derived from equilibrium exchange rate models. Among these models, we have the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate model introduced by Williamson (1994). This approach is often labelled as normative mainly because the equilibrium is not uniquely determined. If the PEER is not related either in the short run or in the long run to the real exchange rates, we see no clear justification to intervene in foreign exchange markets based on these equilibrium rates. In this case, the FEER does not include any element of long run predictive value and should not be used to reduce global imbalances. This paper provides panel empirical evidences that the FEER is related to real exchange rate in the long run and thus could be a useful tool to prevent the resurgence of large global imbalances and associated risks.

However, large debt burdens have led many families to deleverage. Our study finds that deleveraging has been insufficient.

We verify the relevance of variables related to worker characteristics, firm characteristics, and the country in which the individual works. Among worker characteristics, education and employment status are the factors with the highest impact on job quality, while the economic sector is the most important firm characteristic. The results suggest the existence of important differences among groups regarding the magnitude of the impact of some factors. The highest dissimilarities are found between the group with better jobs (Nordic countries plus Belgium) and the group with lower quality jobs (Central and Eastern European countries plus Portugal and Greece).

Focusing on the social-environmental nexus of sustainable development, I consider the relationship between gender equity and the environment before turning to one of the most popular interventions for gender equity in the developing world, microfinance. Although microfinance typically is examined along the social-economic nexus (improving gender empowerment via earned income opportunities), I explore its relationship to environmental sustainability and make suggestions for improving the capacity of microfinance in this area.","[Warnecke, Tonia] Rollins Coll, Business & Social Entrepreneurship, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA; [Warnecke, Tonia] Rollins Coll, Ctr India & South Asia, Winter Pk, FL USA",Rollins College; Rollins College,"Warnecke, T (通讯作者)，Rollins Coll, Business & Social Entrepreneurship, Winter Pk, FL 32789 USA.",,,,,,,,42,13,13,5,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

To achieve this, we develop a theoretical model in which agents are heterogeneous in their initial stocks of human capital. Our model can generate three types of migration at the same time: permanent migration, immediate return migration, and return migration with international work experience. We then examine the effects of differential return subsidies in different contexts and find that in the presence of asymmetric information, it is possible for return subsidies to play a negative role in determining a developing country's aggregate and average human capital stock, and thus its economic growth.

We exploit the kink in individuals' budgets set created by the famous donut hole, where insurance becomes discontinuously much less generous on the margin, to provide descriptive evidence of the drug purchase response to a price increase. We then specify and estimate a simple dynamic model of drug use that allows us to quantify the spending response along the entire nonlinear budget set. We use the model for counterfactual analysis of the increase in spending from filling the donut hole, as will be required by 2020 under the Affordable Care Act. In our baseline model, which considers spending decisions within a single year, we estimate that filling the donut hole will increase annual drug spending by about $150, or about 8 percent. About one-quarter of this spending increase reflects anticipatory behavior, coming from beneficiaries whose spending prior to the policy change would leave them short of reaching the donut hole. We also present descriptive evidence of cross-year substitution of spending by individuals who reach the kink, which motivates a simple extension to our baseline model that allows-in a highly stylized way-for individuals to engage in such cross-year substitution. Our estimates from this extension suggest that a large share of the $150 drug spending increase could be attributed to cross-year substitution, and the net increase could be as little as $45 a year.","[Einav, Liran] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of British Columbia,"Einav, L (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,"Schrimpf, Paul/0000-0003-1188-1563",NIA [R01 AG032449],NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"We thank Larry Katz, Elhanan Helpman, five anonymous referees, Jason Abaluck, Raj Chetty, John Friedman, Ben Handel, Nathan Hendren, Day Manoli, Maria Polyakova, and many seminar participants for useful comments and helpful discussions, and Allyson Barnett, Ray Kluender, and Belinda Tang for extraordinary research assistance.

The paper modifies Melitz's (2003) model of trade with heterogeneous firms by introducing quality choice and credit constraints. The quality sorting model predicts that tighter credit constraints faced by a firm reduce its optimal prices due to its choice of lower-quality products. However, when quality cannot be chosen by a firm in an efficiency sorting model, there is an opposite prediction that prices increase as firms face tighter credit constraints. An empirical analysis using Chinese bank loans data and a merged sample of large trading firms based on Chinese firm-level data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC) and Chinese customs data strongly supports quality sorting and confirms the mechanism of quality adjustment: firms optimally choose to produce lower-quality products when facing tighter credit constraints. Moreover, the predictions of the efficiency sorting model are supported by using quality-adjusted prices in regression analysis and by using quality variation across firms within the same product.

Our method is based on the premise that company managers are the most likely to know how much business income and wages go unreported due to their unique position in dealing with both of these types of income. We use a range of survey design features to maximize the truthfulness of responses. Our method combines estimates of misreported business income, unregistered or hidden employees, and unreported wages, to arrive at an estimate of the size of a shadow economy as a percentage of GDP. This approach differs from most other studies of shadow economies, which largely focus on using macroindicators. We illustrate the application of our method to three new EU member countries. We also analyze the factors that influence companies' participation in the shadow economy. Journal of Comparative Economics 43 (2) (2015) 471-490.

It provides strong evidence for the value and momentum effects, simultaneously questioning the traditional size premium. Furthermore, the study indicates exceptionally high returns on microcaps. Except for the momentum and market risk premium, it reveals no correlation between local CEE pricing factors and global, or Western European, factors. Although both three-factor and four-factor models based on local factors outperform the models based on international factors, they fail to explain the abnormal returns observed in the case of microcaps.

This paper is an application of Pinkse and Tan in which they show that bids can be decreasing in the number of bidders in private value auctions provided that the bidders' private values are affiliated. They argue that the affiliation effect is also present in common value auctions. If the affiliation effect is substantial then a regression of bids on the number of bidders will not help in distinguishing between the common and private value paradigms. We use the Offshore Continental Shelf auction data-set to estimate these effects and find that the affiliation effect is smaller than the other two effects in terms of size. Therefore, at least in this application it appears unlikely that the affiliation effect would often offset the competition effect.","Korea Insurance Res Inst, Dept Insurance Trend Anal, Seoul, South Korea",,"Byun, HW (通讯作者)，Korea Insurance Res Inst, Dept Insurance Trend Anal, 35-4 Yoido, Seoul, South Korea.",hw.byun@kiri.or.kr,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

In contrast to the linear policy rule that generates negligible stabilization effect from responding to asset prices, the regime switching policy rule can significantly stabilize inflation-output volatilities. We then identify the range of parameter values that can generate stabilization effect for inflation and find that reacting to asset prices too aggressively can be inflation de-stabilizing. Given certain combinations of parameter values, the trade-off between the expected volatility of inflation and that of output, as demonstrated by the Taylor curve, substantially diminishes, thus considering non-linear policy rule expands the set of monetary policy choices available for monetary authority. Finally, there exists an optimal responsiveness to asset prices.","[Chen, Nan-Kuang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Cheng, Han-Liang] Chung Hua Inst Econ Res, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Chu, Hsiao-Lei] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Tsing Hua University,"Chen, NK (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",nankuang@ntu.edu.tw; d94323006@ntu.edu.tw; hlchu@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology [NSC 99-2410-H-002-047],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),Ministry of Science and Technology (NSC 99-2410-H-002-047 to N.K.),,26,12,12,3,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

To achieve this, it develops a two-period life-cycle model. The representative household maximises lifetime utility through its choice of optimal levels of consumption, housing and saving. A key feature of the approach is modelling the consumption of housing services as a separate good in retirement along with the implications for saving. Importantly, the model incorporates a government budget constraint involving a pay-as-you-go universal pension. In addition, the model allows for a compulsory private retirement savings scheme. Particular attention in the simulations is given to the potential impact on household saving rates of a range of policy changes. Typically the effect on saving rates is modest. In most instances, it would take very substantial changes in existing policy settings to induce significant increases in household saving rates. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, our approach is original in that we use disaggregated data. Such an approach distinguishes between the effects of non-equipment expenditure which crowds out investment and those of equipment expenditure which crowds in investment. As a result, we show that military equipment and private investment are complementary to one other. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

But debt is also reduced through financial repression (FR), a tax on bondholders and savers via negative or below-market real interest rates. After World War II, capital controls and regulatory restrictions created a captive audience for government debt, limiting tax-base erosion. FR is most successful in liquidating debt when accompanied by inflation. For the advanced economies, real interest rates were negative half of the time during 1945-80. Average annual interest expense savings for a 12-country sample range from about 1% to 5% of GDP for the full 1945-80 period.

This paper is the first to consider markets where learning occurs through these different sources simultaneously, which allows us to investigate the rich interplay and dynamics that can arise. Our work offers four main insights: (1) Without certification, market learning through reputation alone can get stuck at inefficient levels and high-quality agents may get forced out of the market. (2) Certification frees the reputation of agents, allowing good agents to keep working even after an unfortunate string of bad signals. (3) Certification can be both beneficial and harmful from a social perspective, so a social planner must choose the certification scheme carefully. In particular, the market will tend to demand more certification than socially optimal because the market does not bear the certification costs. (4) Certification and reputational learning can act as complementary forces so that the social welfare produced by certification can be increased by faster information revelation.","[Van Der Schaar, Mihaela] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Elect Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Zhang, Simpson] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Van Der Schaar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Elect Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",mihaela@ee.ucla.edu; simpsonzhang@ucla.edu,,"van der schaar, Mihaela/0000-0003-3933-6049",National Science Foundation [CCF-1218136],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The authors are deeply indebted to Moritz Meyer-ter-Vehn, Simon Board, Oren Louidor, and Bill Zame for their guidance.

The Gaussian copula's popularity stemmed not only from its link to the familiar normal distribution, but also from the fact that, unlike other copula-based models, it readily extends to higher dimensions. But the Gaussian copula has asymptotic independence, such that events, regardless of the strength of their correlation, become independent if one pushes far enough into the tails. Instead, this article forms multivariate models of housing price comovements using vine copulas. These more flexible models not only fit the data better, but they also uncover far stronger correlations between housing price movements, especially during extreme market swings.

I demonstrate the importance of these asymmetries in transnational households, where physical distance between family members can make information barriers especially acute. I implement an experiment among migrants in Washington, DC, and their families in El Salvador that examines how information asymmetries can have strategic and inadvertent impacts on remittance decisions. Migrants make an incentivized decision over how much of a cash windfall to remit, and recipients decide how they will spend a remittance. Migrants strategically send home less when their choice is not revealed to recipients. Recipients make spending choices closer to migrants' preferences when the migrants' preferences are shared, regardless of whether or not the spending choices are revealed to the migrants, suggesting that recipients' choices are inadvertently affected by imperfect information.

We examine the assumptions on consumer behavior, particularly about their inability to insure against the city-level productivity shocks, implicitly used in this literature. With either self-insurance or insurance markets, and either an arbitrarily small cost of moving or the assumption that consumers do not perfectly observe the shocks to firms' technologies, the agents will never move. Even without these frictions, our analysis yields another equilibrium with insurance where consumers never move. Thus, insurance is a substitute for movement. We propose an alternative class of models, involving extreme risk against which consumers will not insure.

We analyze ex-post implementable social choice functions where the dominant strategy of a bidder is to reveal his valuation. A result by Green and Laffont [8] implies that an efficient outcome can only be ex-post implemented by VCG payments. However, the VCG mechanism has well-known drawbacks, such as low revenue and computational intractability. Thus we seek alternatives by allowing approximate efficiency instead of full efficiency. We exhibit a new family of auctions: for every epsilon > 0 there exists an ex-post implementable social choice function of this family that is not of the VCG family, yet the value of the selected allocation is always within a multiplicative factor of (1 + epsilon) of the value of efficient allocation. We term these auctions triage auctions. We then proceed to characterizing ex-post implementable social choice functions that are approximately efficient. For the case of two-item two-bidder auctions, we show that triage auctions are the only scalable ex-post implementable social choice functions that always output a solution with value greater than half of the value of the efficient allocation. Scalable means that the allocation does not depend on the units (the currency) in which the valuations are measured. We use the two-item characterization to provide an almost complete description of all scalable ex-post implementable social choice functions for any number of items and show that they usually identify with triage auctions.

However, much less work has been done regarding judicial independence and how this affects, specifically, entrepreneurial activity. Therefore, this paper attempts to fill that gap by exploiting the differences in judicial independence that exist between the US states and empirically evaluating how this affects entrepreneurship. Overall, the results suggest that the method of selecting and retaining justices of both courts of last resort and intermediate appellate courts has a significant and direct effect on entrepreneurial activity, though the latter result is somewhat less robust. The presence of judicial nominating and retention commissions also has a significant and direct effect. Further, although somewhat weaker, the method of selecting the chief justice of a state court of last resort would also appear to have an impact on entrepreneurship. These results are robust to a number of specifications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

LIBOR is often used as a benchmark rate-meaning that the interest rates that consumers and businesses pay on trillions of dollars in loans adjust up and down contractually based on movements in LIBOR. Investors also rely on the difference between LIBOR and various risk-free interest rates as a gauge of stress in the banking system. Benchmarks such as LIBOR therefore play a central role in modern financial markets. Thus, news reports in 2008 revealing widespread manipulation of LIBOR threatened the integrity of this benchmark and lowered trust in financial markets. We begin with a discussion of the economic role of benchmarks in reducing market frictions. We explain how manipulation occurs in practice, and illustrate how benchmark definitions and fixing methods can mitigate manipulation. We then turn to an overall policy approach for reducing the susceptibility of LIBOR to manipulation before focusing on the practical problem of how to make an orderly transition to alternative reference rates without raising undue legal risks.","[Duffie, Darrell] Stanford Univ, Finance, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Duffie, Darrell] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Duffie, Darrell] Market Participants Grp Reforming Interest Rate B, Washington, DC USA; [Stein, Jeremy C.] Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stein, Jeremy C.] Official Sect Steering Grp Reference Rate Reform, Washington, DC USA",Stanford University; Stanford University; Harvard University,"Duffie, D (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Finance, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",duffie@stanford.edu; jeremy_stein@harvard.edu,"Stein, Jeremy/AAA-4003-2019",,,,,,20,60,65,0,15,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Specifically, we structurally test the network theory of electricity distribution of Dalgaard and Strulik (2011) using city level data for China. In their paper they argue that the relationship between the size of the economy, measured by capital per capita, and electricity consumption per capita is governed by a simple power law with capital having an exponent bounded between 1/2 and 3/4 depending on the efficiency of the network. We use data for 224 cities in China between 2002 and 2007 to observe whether structural estimates match those of Dalgaard and Strulik (2011) for 50 US states where they find the exponent in the power law connecting capital with electricity to be 2/3. Our results provide an estimate of the power law component to a little higher than the 2/3 found for the US which provides broad support for the model. When we look at different time periods we observe what appears to be a fall in the efficiency of the energy distribution network towards the end of our period. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A key contribution of our paper is to empirically examine the product quality effects of airline cooperation. Two common types of cooperation among airlines involve international alliances and antitrust immunity (ATI), where ATI allows for more extensive cooperation. Additionally, this paper examines the extent to which domestic mergers affect the quality of international air travel products. The results suggest that increases in the membership of a carrier's alliance or ATI partners and domestic mergers are associated with the carrier's own products having more travel-convenient routing quality.

We model the household decision-making process regarding health care utilisation in three steps: the perception of illness, choosing a treatment regime and health expenditure. In particular, we explain-at the individual level-the contraction of one of four diseases (malaria, digestive tract problems, respiratory infection and influenza). We then explain the choice of a treatment regime-home treatment or treatment at a public health facility-conditional upon the individual contracting a particular disease and estimate a health expenditure function conditional upon an individual contracting a particular disease and on the choice of treatment. Disease type is found to explain both treatment choice and health care expenditure with households more likely to opt for home treatment for influenza and with respiratory infection as the most expensive to treat. We also find that treatment at a public health facility implies much higher expenses. Our results also point to a gender bias with health care spending significantly higher for male household members. Further, asset poor households are more likely to opt for home treatment while migrants, as a source of information or even medication, reduce this likelihood.","[Wouterse, Fleur; Tankari, Mahamadou] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Wouterse, F (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",f.wouterse@cgiar.org,,"Tankari, Mahamadou/0000-0003-3586-8750; Wouterse, Fleur/0000-0001-7186-9270",,,,,58,5,5,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Patent invalidation leads to a 50% increase in citations to the focal patent, on average, but the impact is heterogeneous and depends on characteristics of the bargaining environment. Patent rights block downstream innovation in computers, electronics, and medical instruments, but not in drugs, chemicals, or mechanical technologies.

We show that one can embed payoff-irrelevant randomization devices in the private information of players and use these randomization devices to implement mixed strategies as deterministic functions of the private information. This approach gives rise to very short and intuitive proofs for a number of purification results that previously required sophisticated methods from functional analysis or nonstandard analysis. We use our methods to prove the first general purification theorem for games with private information in which a player's payoffs can depend in arbitrary ways on events in the private information of other players and in which we allow for shared information in a general way.,"[Greinecker, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Inst Wirtschaftstheorie, SOWI Gebaude, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Podczeck, Konrad] Univ Vienna, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre, A-1010 Vienna, Austria",University of Innsbruck; University of Vienna,"Greinecker, M (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Inst Wirtschaftstheorie, SOWI Gebaude, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",michael.greinecker@uibk.ac.at; konrad.podczeck@univie.ac.at,"Podczeck, Konrad/D-9281-2017","Podczeck, Konrad/0000-0003-2734-2206",,,,,46,7,7,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We interpret such allocations as patents that infringe one another as licensing through an ever growing patent pool and as randomization through litigation. We contrast the rate of technological progress under the optimal allocation with the outcome if sharing is prohibitively costly.

In this paper, we investigate whether changes in relative material standards of living between the SCs/STs and upper castes - as measured by the ratio of consumption expenditures of SCs/STs to that of upper castes - are associated with changes in the incidence of crimes against SCs/STs. Based on the hierarchical social structure implied by the caste system, we posit that an increase in the expenditure ratio is positively correlated with the incidence of crimes committed by the upper castes against the lower castes. Using official district level crime data for the period 2001-2010, we find a positive association between crimes and expenditure of SC/ST vis-a-vis the upper castes. Further, distinguishing between violent and non-violent crimes, we find it is the violent crimes that are responsive to changes in economic gaps. Moreover, this relationship is on account of changes in the upper castes' economic well-being rather than changes in the economic position of the SCs and STs.

We add to this literature in two ways. First, we separate out the index of informal institutions into its component parts to see which informal institutions are primary.

We propose to improve the description of the middle class using an innovative approach combining an economic approach (based on income) and a sociological approach (based on education and occupation). The empirical investigations conducted as part of this research are based on the China Health and Nutrition Survey (2009). First, we define the middle income class as households with an annual per capita income between 10,000 yuan and the 95th percentile. On this basis, approximately 50% of urban households may be said to belong to the middle class. Second, we use information on employment and education to characterise the heterogeneity of the middle income class. Using clustering methods, we identify four groups: (i) the elderly and the inactive middle class, mainly composed of pensioners; (ii) the old middle class, composed of self-employed workers; (iii) the marginal middle class, composed of skilled and unskilled workers; and (iv) the new middle class, composed of highly educated wage earners in the public sector.

This article looks at the impact of resource dependence on adjusted net savings (ANS) as an indicator of weak sustainability. Our results, based on a panel of 104 developing countries during the recent commodity price boom, confirm a negative relationship between resource extraction and sustainable development as measured by ANS. We further look at the specific role of armed conflict and armed violence as captured by the homicide rate. Armed conflict, which is positively associated with resource dependence, negatively affects ANS per capita according to both our OLS and instrumental variables (IV) estimates. Similarly, armed violence has a detrimental effect on sustainable development. Our IV estimate suggests that a one-point increase in the homicide rate decreases ANS per capita by $60. Since education expenditures are a critical ANS component, we further examine the impact of resource dependence and violence on human capital. Consistent with previous findings, resource-dependent countries underinvest in education but armed conflict and violence do not affect the instantaneous share of education expenditures, hinting at a detrimental effect working through physical and social capital rather than education.","[Carbonnier, Gilles] Grad Inst Int Dev Studies, Dev Studies Sect, Geneva, Switzerland; [Wagner, Natascha] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Carbonnier, G (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int Dev Studies, Dev Studies Sect, Geneva, Switzerland.",gilles.carbonnier@graduateinstitute.ch,"Wagner, Natascha/D-1285-2018","Wagner, Natascha/0000-0003-0830-6429",,,,,62,7,7,2,49,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

This reduced inequity is concentrated among those teams that were already experiencing relatively higher levels of inequality.

Compared with more standard measures of social capital and trust, our measure is available with a high level of disaggregation, and with annual frequency for a long time period. Following a panel data approach, our findings indicate that social capital has a positive impact on GDP per capita growth in the context of Spanish provinces, implying that 'social features' are important for explaining the differences in wealth that one might find across Spanish provinces.

The market efficiency has been topic of various studies, but the results are mixed. Although some of the studies confirmed efficiency of a market, another studies often rejected it. As a result, the adaptive market hypothesis was formulated. It says that the ability of share prices to reflect all the available information changes over time. This paper analyses the development of weak-form market efficiency of BRIC share markets. It shows that although the BRIC share markets are weak-form inefficient in the long-term, there are some shorter time periods of weak-form efficiency that alternate with periods of weak-form inefficiency. It means that technical and fundamental analysis can be used on BRIC share markets to generate returns superior to returns of the market portfolio.","[Arendas, Peter; Chovancova, Bozena] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Banking & Int Finance, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Arendás, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Banking & Int Finance, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",p.arendas@centrum.sk; bozena.chovancova@euba.sk,"Arendas, Peter/Q-4465-2017","Arendas, Peter/0000-0003-1413-2795",,,,,25,2,5,0,16,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

The 2007 Stern Review emphasised that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are the biggest market failure the world has seen. These are not ordinary localised externalities: impacts are likely to be large both in global terms and for future generations. In addition, planning energy infrastructure projects is complicated by risk and uncertainty. Given these market failures, clear and coherent government policies have a crucial role to play. Many governments are emphasising the importance of investment in renewable energy infrastructure but there has not been, as yet, any clear explanation of how these projects will be financed. The emphasis on austerity and disillusionment with public-private partnerships leaves private finance as the default solution but risk and uncertainty are likely to deter private sector investment unless innovative financing mechanisms can be found. Also, as more and more shale gas reserves are discovered with the potential for large profits for private sector investors, there is danger that the emphasis will shift back towards non-renewables. This paper will explore these problems of financing constraints, risk and uncertainty for the effective planning and construction of renewable energy infrastructure.","[Baddeley, Michelle] UCL Bartlett Sch Construct & Project Management, Econ & Finance Built Environm, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Baddeley, M (通讯作者)，UCL Bartlett Sch Construct & Project Management, Econ & Finance Built Environm, London, England.",,"Baddeley, Michelle/N-5821-2019","Baddeley, Michelle/0000-0001-7884-0374",,,,,99,0,0,0,8,PALGRAVE,BASINGSTOKE,"HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-137-44613-8; 978-1-137-44612-1,INT PAP POLIT ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,111,152,,,,,,42,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380488600004,0

What other effects might it have? We explore the answer to this question using semistructural vector autoregressions (VARs), where news is defined as the innovation in the expectation of total factor productivity (TFP) at a fixed horizon in the future. We find that systems incorporating a number of forward-looking variables, including stock prices, consumption, and consumer confidence and inflation robustly predict three outcomes. First, following a news shock, TFP rises for several years. Second, inflation falls immediately and substantially, and stays low, often for 10 quarters or more. Third, there is a sharp increase in a forward-looking measure of consumer confidence. Consumption typically rises following good news, but investment, consumer durables purchases, and hours worked typically fall on impact. All the quantity variables subsequently rise, as does TFP. Depending on the specification of the reduced form VAR, the activity variables may lead TFP to some extent-possibly lending some support to the hypothesis of news-driven business cycles-or they may move in lockstep with productivity. For the most part, the quantity and inflation responses are quite consistent with the predictions of a standard New Keynesian model augmented with real wage inertia.","[Barsky, Robert B.; Lee, Keyoung] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL USA; [Barsky, Robert B.; Basu, Susanto] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Basu, Susanto] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research; Boston College,"Barsky, RB (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL USA.",,,,,,,,40,30,32,1,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0889-3365,1537-2642,,NBER MACROECON ANNU,NBER Macroecon.

The impulse response functions reveal that oil price fluctuations do not impact the ASEAN-5 economies in the long run and much of its effect is absorbed within five to six quarters. The variance decomposition results further assert that with a few exceptions oil price shocks do not explain a significant variation in any of the variables under consideration.

This indicator is used to shed light on EU fiscal policies and estimate the average short-term output effects of fiscal policy. Results indicate that, with exceptions, fiscal policy has been conducted in a more stop and go and pro-cyclical fashion over the past decade than suggested by traditional indicators. The fiscal multiplier is estimated at around 0.75 on average, with higher (resp. lower) multipliers associated with expenditure (resp. revenue) shocks, and higher (resp. lower) multipliers in times of declining (resp. increasing) output gaps.","[Carnot, Nicolas; de Castro, Francisco] Commiss European Communities, DG ECFIN, CHAR 12-078, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium",,"Carnot, N (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, DG ECFIN, CHAR 12-078, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",nicolas.carnot@ec.europa.eu; francisco.de-Castro@ec.europa.eu,"de castro, francisco/JHU-5465-2023",,,,,,55,2,3,0,6,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2015,,215,,,,,63,94,,10.7866/HPE-RPE.15.4.3,0.0,,,32,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DM1RN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376124000003,0

The rise of the new economy, driven by information and knowledge, has led to an increased interest in intellectual capital theory, which aims to manage intangible assets of organizations. Firms belonging to technology and knowledge-based industries recognize intellectual capital as the key knowledge base that contributes to the creation of a competitive advantage for the firm. This paper aims to answer the question  How are Intellectual Capital (IC) and Information Technology (IT) related? through a systematic review based on four steps: 1) search conduction; 2) selection of papers based on their titles and abstracts; 3) content analysis of selected papers; 4) evidence mapping and discussions. The analyzed papers were categorized into five themes:  Statistical analysis or case study in IT companies from the Intellectual Capital perspective;  IT as a tool for Intellectual Capital Management;  Intellectual Capital or technology knowledge assets influencing innovation and development,  Intellectual Capital assets to evaluate a technology and  Intellectual Capital theory as a way to understand and share knowledge in IT projects. Our findings evidenced that the Human Capital was the main dimension studied by the authors, followed by Structural Capital and Relational Capital. We believe that this work may help to clarify on Intellectual Capital Management procedures into Information Technology projects, thus opening new topics for future research.","[Cunha, Livia; Cunha, Jose Adson; Thomaz, Joao] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Ctr Estudos Gestao, Lisbon, Portugal; [Cunha, Jose Adson] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Ctr Informat, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Matos, Florinda] Intellectual Capital Accreditat Assoc, ICLab, Santarem, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,"Cunha, L (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Ctr Estudos Gestao, Lisbon, Portugal.",livia.vasconcelos@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; jaogc@cin.ufpe.br; florinda.matos@icaa.pt; joao.thomaz@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Matos, Florinda/M-1189-2016","Matos, Florinda/0000-0002-9306-7313",,,,,19,3,3,0,12,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,53,62,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600007,0

We found that the for all but one country (namely Portugal) the stock return volatility is higher than the volatility of sovereign bond yield changes across all wavelet scales. The highest volatility in stock indices' returns and bond yield changes is captured by lower level MODWT wavelet coefficients (i.e., level 1 (j = 1) MODWT wavelet coefficients, associated with dynamics over 2 to 4 days and level 2 (j = 2) MODWT wavelet coefficients associated with dynamics over 4 to 8 days). A practical implication stemming from this finding is that investors with short investment horizons that want to efficiently manage the risk of their portfolio investments have to respond to every fluctuation in realized returns or bond yield changes, while for an investor with a much longer horizon, the need to do this is reduces, as long-run risk is significantly smaller as indicated by the variance. The results of the paper show also that the estimated wavelet correlation changes with the time scale and is mostly positive for all countries but Portugal. The statistical evidence against hypothesis of no multiscale dependence yet is weak. Thus we cannot statistically claim that the wavelet coefficients at higher scales are significantly different (either higher or lower) that those at lower scales. For the financial markets of Portugal and Germany we proved that the dependence between stock and sovereign bond market dynamics may not be just a multiscale phenomenon, but may also exhibits time dynamics across scales. The rolling-window wavelet correlation estimates show that at all scales correlation turned negative for Portugal at the start of 2010 - this is when the Eurozone debt crisis started which also hit hard the Portugal sovereign bond market - thus probably causing the. average. wavelet correlation for Portugal for the whole observed period to be negative.","Univ Maribor, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Dajcman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Razlagova 14, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",silvo.dajcman@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,34,9,9,1,16,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The article considers both a small GVAR model and a large GVAR model in determining the most appropriate model for forecasting South African variables. We compare the recursive out-of-sample forecasts for South African GDP and inflation from six types of models: a general 33 country (large) GVAR, a customized small GVAR for South Africa, a VECM for South Africa with weakly exogenous foreign variables, a BVAR model, autoregressive (AR) models and random walk models. The results show that the forecast performance of the large GVAR is generally superior to the performance of the customized small GVAR for South Africa. The forecasts of both the GVAR models tend to be better than the forecasts of the augmented VECM, especially at longer forecast horizons. Importantly, however, on average, the BVAR model performs the best when it comes to forecasting output, while the AR(1) model outperforms all the other models in predicting inflation. We also conduct ex ante forecasts from the BVAR and AR(1) models over 2010: Q1-2013:Q4 to highlight their ability to track turning points in output and inflation, respectively.","[De Waal, Annari; Van Eyden, Renee; Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",rangan.gupta@up.ac.za,"Van Eyden, Renee/AAO-3991-2021; de Waal, Annari/G-2118-2015","Van Eyden, Renee/0000-0002-6238-6215; de Waal, Annari/0000-0003-1190-7081",Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the UK; Cambridge Commonwealth Trust,Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the UK; Cambridge Commonwealth Trust,Annari de Waal acknowledges financial support from the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the UK and the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust.,,52,2,3,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We combine three approaches dealing with the consequences of monetary shocks. First, we adjust a state space version of the P-star type model employing money overhang as the driving force of inflation. Second, we identify the contemporaneous impact of monetary policy shocks by applying a sign restriction identification scheme to the reduced form given by the state space signal equations. Third, to ensure that our results are not distorted by the measurement error exhibited by the official monetary data, we employ the Divisia M4 monetary aggregate provided by the Center for Financial Stability. Our approach overcomes one of the major difficulties of previous models by using a data-driven identification of equilibrium velocity. Thus, we are able to show that a P-star model can fit U.S. data and money did indeed matter in the United States.","[El-Shagi, Makram; Giesen, Sebastian] Halle Inst Econ Res, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Kelly, Logan J.] Univ Wisconsin, River Falls, WI 54022 USA",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH); University of Wisconsin System,"El-Shagi, M (通讯作者)，Halle Inst Econ Res, Kleine Markerstr 8, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany.",Makram.El-Shagi@iwh-halle.de,,,,,,,48,5,5,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

German consumers exhibit a high degree of brand-loyalty in their preference for regionally crafted beers, and we exploit the regional brand-loyalty of German beer consumers to identify brand-level demand shocks for beers preferred by the home team's fans and visiting team's fans during Bundesliga game weeks. We find retailer price adjustments at the category level mask a considerably more nuanced pricing behavior at the brand level. Retailers in regions hosting Bundesliga games significantly increase beer prices at the category level during game weeks; however, at the brand level, we find retailers selectively discount prices on the home team's sponsored beers and systematically raise prices on the visiting team's sponsored beers. Our findings are consistent with a tourist-natives model of retail pricing during periods of increased demand in the German beer market.","[Empen, Janine] Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Hamilton, Stephen F.] Calif Polytech Univ, Dept Econ, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",University of Kiel; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Hamilton, SF (通讯作者)，Calif Polytech Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Grand Ave, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",jempen@ae.uni-kiel.de; shamilto@calpoly.edu,,,,,,,24,4,4,3,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

To test some basic qualitative properties of this literature, we develop a theoretical and empirical framework in the context of European professional soccer where (incumbent) teams and players sign binding contracts which, however, are frequently renegotiated when other teams (entrants) want to hire the player. Because they weaken entrants in renegotiations, long-term contracts are useful rent-seeking devices for the contracting parties. However, they reduce the likelihood of (mutually beneficial) transfers, which generates a trade-off in the spirit of Aghion and Bolton (1987).

I develop a model of inattentive consumption, derive equilibrium pricing when consumers are inattentive, and evaluate bill-shock regulation requiring firms to disclose information that substitutes for attention. When inattentive consumers are sophisticated but heterogeneous in their expected demand, bill-shock regulation reduces social welfare in fairly-competitive markets, which may be the effect of the Federal Communication Commission's recent bill-shock agreement. If some consumers are attentive while others naively fail to anticipate their own inattention, however, then bill-shock regulation increases social welfare and can benefit consumers. Hence, requiring zero-balance alerts in addition to the Federal Reserve's new opt-in rule for debit-card overdraft protection may benefit consumers.","Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",Boston College,"Grubb, MD (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.",,,"Grubb, Michael/0000-0001-9885-2225",,,,,53,63,74,1,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Aiming to provide a more realistic depiction of decision making, it generalizes the von Neumann-Morgenstern theory by including additional tiers of uncertainty. In this model, beliefs about the probabilities of events are ambiguous and their consequential utilities are vague; both are naturally formulated in the phantom space using phantom numbers. The degree of uncertainty, determined by the decision maker's beliefs, is distinguished from the attitude toward uncertainty, which is drawn from her preferences. Decision making under ambiguity is a particular case of our model in which probabilities are ambiguous, but resulting utilities of events are knowable.","[Izhakian, Yehuda] CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Izhakian, Zur] Univ Bremen, Dept Math, Off MZH 6060, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY); University of Bremen,"Izhakian, Y (通讯作者)，CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, 55 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10010 USA.",yud@tau.ac.il; zzur@math.biu.ac.il,,,,,,,75,3,3,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

In order to investigate the impact of the latter, we break our sample down into two sub-periods: a pre-crisis period and a post-crisis period, using a structural break test that has the advantage of endogenously testing for further breaks in the data. Unlike previous studies that have frequently investigated this issue using low frequency data, our article makes use of intraday data. Accordingly, using Threshold generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model estimations, we find weak evidence of volatility transmission between the two regions before the Subprime crisis. However, during the post-crisis period, we record returns and volatility spillover from US to European markets and vice versa at different times of the trading day, indicating that the two regions became more dependent during the recent Subprime crisis, a finding that supports the contagion hypothesis between the US and European stock markets.","[Jawadi, Fredj] Univ Evry, Evry, France; [Louhichi, Wael] ESSCA Sch Management, Angers, France; [Cheffou, Abdoulkarim Idi] EDC Paris Business Sch, Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay; ESSCA School of Management,"Louhichi, W (通讯作者)，ESSCA Sch Management, Angers, France.",Wael.LOUHICHI@essca.fr,,"JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391",,,,,35,20,22,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

One of the recent changes faced by firms is the introduction of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Although several empirical studies analyse the links between ICT use, innovative work practices and firm performance, employee-level analyses are scarce. Using data from the European Working Condition Survey (EWCS), this article investigates the relationships between use of the Internet and computers and positive attitudes among employees (social support, job satisfaction, extra effort) in the European context. Our empirical results are based on data for more than 9500 employees from 16 European countries in 2005, and more than 14 000 in 2010. Among the different effects of ICT use, based on the results for the 2005, 2010 and the pooled 2005-2010 sample, and in a within-cohorts change analysis, we find that Internet use is positively related to employees' job satisfaction and extra effort. We find that computer use is not related to employees' behaviours.

There are three macroeconomics factors: foreign economic condition, gross national product (GNP) correlation between countries and the level of the economic development of a target country. A random sample of 165 international mergers and acquisitions by Malaysian bidding MNCs in 22 countries around the world in the period of 2000-2010 was recruited for this study. A negative relationship between the foreign economic condition and the wealth effect and a positive relationship between the level of economic development of target country and the wealth effect has been found through this study. This implies that the foreign economic condition and level of economic development of the target country significantly determine the value creation of the Malaysian cross-border acquisitions. Therefore, Malaysian MNCs, which intend to use the acquisition mode of entry as the way to venture abroad, should take into consideration these macroeconomic factors in order to increase their foreign investment value.","[Noordin, Bany Ariffin Amin; Kamarudin, Fakarudin; Anwar, Nazratul Aina Mohamad] Univ Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Selangor Darul, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Noordin, BAA (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Serdang 43400, Selangor Darul, Malaysia.",bany@upm.edu.my; fakarudin@upm.edu.my; nazratulaina84@gmail.com,"Kamarudin, Fakarudin/AAB-8395-2021; A.N., Bany-Ariffin/AAO-1400-2020; Kamarudin, Fakarudin/AAL-8942-2020; Anwar, Nazratul Aina Mohamad/AFS-7324-2022","Anwar, Nazratul Aina Mohamad/0000-0003-2327-1201; Kamarudin, Fakarudin/0000-0001-8180-1173",,,,,38,3,3,1,18,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This paper develops a quantitative model in order to shed light on the sources of low labor productivity in African agriculture. The model provides a vehicle for understanding the mechanisms leading to low agricultural labor productivity, in particular, how the interactions between factor endowments, government investment and technology adoption may have culminated in agricultural stagnation. I calibrate the model to data for four Sub-Saharan African economies, and use this calibrated model to provide insight into policy aimed at increasing agricultural productivity in these four countries. Policies aimed at improving rural infrastructure or productivity in the non-agricultural sectors, or allowing for land transferability, would be most effective for increasing agricultural labor productivity, and would further bring increases in household welfare for each of the countries I calibrate to.","Univ Winnipeg, Econ, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada",University of Winnipeg,"O'Gorman, M (通讯作者)，Univ Winnipeg, Econ, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada.",m.ogorman@uwinnipeg.ca,,,,,,,75,6,6,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

The article presents only the statistical analysis of psychometric features of the formed questionnaire without elaborating on the results of the empirical research on the intensity of mobbing expression in employees' relationships in Lithuanian organisations. The advantage of the questionnaire is that it is relatively short; however, it covers all features which are characteristic of the mobbing phenomenon and provides the opportunity to analyse the attack that does not fall under the definition of mobbing. It can be used both for mass and local research at the level of single organisations.

A literature review and empirical findings for state-dependent multipliers confirm that there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the size of the short-term multiplier. Notably, multipliers may be larger in deep recessions or financial crises, but the negative impact of fiscal consolidation is mitigated when public finances are weak. Using a stylised framework and a range of plausible values for the fiscal multiplier, simulations suggest that an increase in the debt ratio following episodes of fiscal consolidation is likely to be short-lived. Even in a macroeconomic context in which multipliers are high, a frontloaded fiscal consolidation reduces the total consolidation effort and implies a faster stabilisation of the debt ratio. In general, backloading is subject to higher implementation risks, most notably in the light of political economy considerations. Overall, when determining the fiscal adjustment path, both the short-term costs and the longer-term benefits need to be taken into account. Particular attention should be paid to the composition of consolidation packages, with well-designed adjustments likely to imply a faster stabilisation of the debt ratio.","[Warmedinger, Thomas; Checherita-Westphal, Cristina] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Hernandez de Cos, Pablo] Banco Espana, Madrid, Spain",European Central Bank; Banco de Espana,"Warmedinger, T (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",Thomas.Warmedinger@ecb.int; Cristina.Checherita-Westphal@ecb.int; Pablo.hernandez_de_cos@bde.es,,,,,,,68,2,2,1,5,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2015,,215,,,,,139,167,,10.7866/HPE-RPE.15.4.6,0.0,,,29,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DM1RN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376124000006,0

However, several other types of contributions such as donations to political organizations are not tax deductible. This paper investigates the spillover effects of charitable subsidies on political giving using five cross-sectional surveys of charitable and political giving in the United States conducted from 1990 to 2001. The results show that charitable and political giving are complements. Compared with non-donors, charitable donors are more likely to donate and give more to political organizations. Increasing the price of charitable giving decreases not only charitable giving but also the probability of giving and the amount of donations to political organizations. This effect is robust under different specifications and highlights the externalities created by charitable subsidies.","SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, Albany, NY 12222 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Yörük, BK (通讯作者)，SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, 1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",byoruk@albany.edu,,,,,,,42,5,6,1,31,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The stock returns are non-monotonically related to a systematic component of risk and negatively related to an idiosyncratic component of risk. The top beta stocks underperform the market, while the portfolios with a low VaR or idiosyncratic volatility have positive abnormal returns, but some of the outperformance is explained by the momentum phenomenon.

The GARCH models of Engle (1982) and Bollerslev (1986) are employed to model the volatility of macroeconomic uncertainty. The dynamic panel model estimation of Arellano and Bond (1991) and Blundell and Bond (1998) is used to analyze the relationship between foreign direct investment and the volatility of the macroeconomic variables. We find that macroeconomic uncertainty adversely affects the flow of FDI, while institutional quality also increases the flow of FDI in the presence of other control variables.

Most of the previous literature has paid little attention to the time dimension of this distinction, but most of the studies that have found profit led results have used methodologies that emphasize short-run cyclical relationships. This paper argues that demand is more likely to be profit-led in the short run and more likely to be wage-led in the longer term, because the positive effects of lower labor costs on investment and net exports are likely to be strongest in the short run, while the positive effects of a higher wage share on consumption are likely to be strongest in the longer term, at least in the US case (other countries may differ).","[Blecker, Robert A.] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Blecker, RA (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",,,,,,,,65,94,110,1,11,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

This modest $9.5 billion gain in social welfare is consistent with our observation that overall consumption does not increase after entrygeneric sales displace branded sales, shifting surplus downstream from producers to consumers, insurance companies, and retailers.

We find that an increase in a given contributor i's risk associated with the aggregate contribution level of the other contributors (i.e., an increase in social uncertainty) induces that contributor to increase his own contribution level if and only if the uncertainty's incremental effect on the expected value of his net marginal utility is negative. Contributor i's welfare likewise increases when a closely related condition is met, namely that the uncertainty's marginal effect on his expected marginal utility value of the public good exceeds its countervailing effect on the numeraire. Further, the corresponding aggregate contribution to the public good increases in the presence of free-riding if and only if the incremental effect of contributor i's contribution on the aggregate expected value of all other contributors' net marginal utilities is small-enough positive. We derive similar conditions for the case of private uncertainty, where the increase in contributor i's risk is associated with his own marginal valuation of the public good. A simple example illustrates these conceptual results. Numerical analysis demonstrates that an increase in private uncertainty can have a nonmonotonic impact on contributor i's welfare.","[Caplan, Arthur J.] Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 4835 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Caplan, AJ (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 4835 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",arthur.caplan@usu.edu,,,Utah Agricultural Experiment Station (UAES) [UTAO-1074],Utah Agricultural Experiment Station (UAES),"Funding for this study was provided by the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station (UAES), grant number UTAO-1074.",,15,5,5,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Calibration-based overprecision is evaluated in a forecasting by confidence intervals task. This study takes a closer look at the interrelations of these different types. Moreover, as the main focus, it considers the effect of cognitive abilities on overconfidence. These are quantified in a cognitive reflection test. I find that cognitive skills are substantially interrelated with subjects' confidence levels. Although overconfidence in absolute terms (overestimation) is not affected by cognitive abilities, the effect on overconfidence in relative terms (overplacement) is positive and significant. Overprecision, the calibration-based type of overconfidence, is found to be significantly affected by cognitive capacity as well. Interval forecasts of cognitively more able subjects were much better calibrated than those of their peers who displayed substantial overconfidence in the precision of their forecasts.","[Duttle, Kai] Univ Duisburg Essen, Duisburg, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Duttle, K (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, Inst East Asian Studies, Forsthausweg 2, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany.",,,,German Science Foundation (DFG) within the Research Training Group 1613,German Science Foundation (DFG) within the Research Training Group 1613,"I want to thank Jeannette Brosig-Koch, Werner Pascha, Holger Herz, and three anonymous referees for their advice and valuable feedback.

This article stems from the idea of investigating how decision-makers, abandoning their traditional economic models and focusing on innovative components of evolutionary economics instead, can achieve better performance results in organizing and optimizing an economic system based on fiscal federalism. For this purpose, fiscal federalism must be understood as a dense network of economic relationships between different complex adaptive and co-evolving systems, the jurisdictions, linked by strong interdependencies. A better understanding of the links between interdependence will be provided by Stuart Kauffman's NK model. The relevance of the NK model in the study of economic organizations has been noted in the relevant literature.

In a between person field experiment, we sell two types of freshly prepared sweet treats. In the first experimental condition, we supply waffles under PWYW and crepes at a posted price. In the second condition, we reverse the allocation of the pricing methods to the two focal treats. Our sweet snacks stand attracts 125 different customers in the first and additional 163 buyers in the second experimental condition. Overall, we find that the customer share opting in favor of a product among all buyers acquired in an experiment is not significantly influenced by the pricing mechanism used in selling the item. The probability that customers choose the PWYW offer increases as they like the underlying product more than the posted price substitute. Several price-related buyer attitudes are also significantly related to customer choice of a PWYW offer. The more customers are concerned about their social image in the context of their payment method choice and behaviors, the more they appreciate to actively participate in price setting and the less difficulty they experience in figuring out a reasonable product price the more probable it is that they opt for a PWYW offer. The results imply that practitioners should carefully reflect consumer attitudes evoked by the PWYW mechanism in case of considering its introduction and in designing its details. In addition, the findings suggest that we need more research on the influence of various product- and price related cognitions of consumers on their acceptance or rejection of PWYW offers. This holds in particular for goods with higher price levels than the product categories covered in our experiment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Economy and Competitiveness Ministry, Spain, 2015) new regulation for financial product labeling. We design and conduct an economic experiment where subjects make risky investment decisions under three different treatments: a control group where subjects have only objective information about the key features of the products they must select and two treatment groups introducing visual labels resembling the labels required under the new Spanish regulation. The results of the experiment are analyzed within the framework of rank-dependent utility theory. While visual labels do not change the utility function of the subjects, they do significantly affect the subjects' weighting functions. The introduction of numerical and color-coded labels significantly increases the concavity of the weighting functions and increases pessimism and risk-aversion in cases where the probability of obtaining the best outcome is high. Labels widen the difference between real subjects' behavior and that of the perfectly rational agents described by expected utility theory. Consequently, our empirical findings raise doubts as to whether the new regulation actually achieves its objectives. The regulation seeks to empower retail investors by enhancing their understanding of financial products. Introducing the visual labels, however, seemingly increases the differences between actual risk levels and the decision weights applied by subjects when making decisions. Moreover, labels increase investors' pessimism and risk-aversion when the best outcome is likely and fail to alter investors' risk-aversion when the worst outcome is likely.","[Gomez, Y.; Martinez-Moles, V.; Vila, J.] Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Vila, J (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain.",yolanda.gomez-gonzalez@uv.es; victor.martinez-moles@uv.es; jose.e.vila@uv.es,"Martínez-Molés, Víctor/G-3559-2015; Gomez, Yolanda/Z-5778-2019; Vila, Jose/AAA-2706-2019","Gomez, Yolanda/0000-0002-4008-9084; Vila, Jose/0000-0002-5841-1115",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [CO2013-46550-R],Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),This work is supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad under project CO2013-46550-R.,,61,4,4,2,22,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

One of the two banking marketization indicators, namely the proportion of deposits taken by non-stateowned commercial banks to total deposits, has a significant positive impact on bank stability; in contrast, the other indicator, the proportion of loans issued to non-state-owned hybrid-sector firms to total loans in China's banking sector, is negatively associated with bank stability.

These reforms fostered financial development, which in turn may have reduced income poverty, as emphasized by several theoretical arguments in the literature. This study aims at estimating the contribution of financial development to poverty alleviation in the CFA Franc Zone. Results based on a panel of CFA Franc Zone countries show that financial development is associated with a drop in the proportion of poor population. Next, financial development reduces the extent to which the income of individuals falls below the poverty line. Moreover, in some cases, the effect of financial development on poverty may be subject to nonlinearities. Finally, financial instability or unstable financial development leading to crises may mitigate the favourable effect of financial development on poverty reduction. These findings are robust to the use of alternative measures of financial development and hold after controlling for a potential simultaneity and a small sample biases.","[Kiendrebeogo, Youssouf] World Bank, Off Chief Economist MNA, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Minea, Alexandru] Univ Auvergne, CERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Minea, Alexandru] Univ Auvergne, Sch Econ, Clermont Ferrand, France",The World Bank; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Kiendrebeogo, Y (通讯作者)，World Bank, Off Chief Economist MNA, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",ykiendrebeogo@worldbank.org,,,FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International); ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) [ANR-10-LABX-14-01],FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International); ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We are indebted to the Editor (Mark Taylor), to two anonymous referees and to Kangni Kpodar for very helpful comments on a previous version.

Therefore, an online choice experiment was used to determine U.S. consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for imported and GM labeled bagged sugar and sugar in soft drinks. The choice experiments included two treatments: one serving as the control and one to test the impact of policy consequentiality. Results from both treatments indicate that consumers prefer bags of sugar and sugar in soft drinks from Canada and the United States compared to unlabeled sugar and sugar from Mexico, Brazil and the Philippines. Consumers also prefer non-GM labeled sugar compared to unlabeled and GM labeled sugar. The results regarding the use of policy consequentiality in an online choice experiment suggest that the application of consequentiality may increase participants' likelihood of choosing one of the product options presented in the choice set rather than choosing the none of these option. Furthermore, participants who saw the consequentiality script had a higher level of belief that their survey responses would be consequential (p <0.05). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We found that the NHI premium rate for workers should be increased by 3.7 percentage points between 2015 and 2060 to finance the augmented burden of the NHI program as a result of the aging population. Within the same period, the aggregate labor would be decreased by 30.9 percent despite the increase in employment ratio by 2.2 percentage points while the aggregate output was decreased by 18.3 percent. To make distinction between the population aging effect and the effect from the increased NHI premium rate, we conducted an experiment where the NHI premium rate for workers was held constant at the level of 2015 along the transition path. The experiment showed that the distortion effect of the increased NHI premium rate would be only minor compared to the direct effect of population aging.","[Lim, Taejun] KIRI, 35-4 Yoido Dong, Seoul 150606, South Korea",,"Lim, T (通讯作者)，KIRI, 35-4 Yoido Dong, Seoul 150606, South Korea.",limtaejun@gmail.com,,"Lim, Taejun/0000-0002-8659-0907",,,,,16,7,7,0,5,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

Instead of linking oil product pricing only with rise and fall of crude price, this article analyzes the effect of crude price fluctuations by decomposing the crude price changes in quantiles by holding multiple thresholds. Use of multiple threshold nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (MTNARDL) model improves precision in estimating the asymmetric effect of the crude price changes on oil product prices over that of the single threshold NARDL model. It is observed that the asymmetric price transmission is high across all oil products, when higher and lower quantiles of crude price fluctuations are compared. This shows that the price of oil products increases when crude prices go up; however, the advantage of the sharp fall of crude prices is not fully transmitted to the oil products.

We find that both types of functions generate interior pure strategy Nash equilibria unlike Baik and Che and Gale with characteristics different to existing literature. For one type of function, we find that the reaction function of each player is flat and nonresponsive to the level of resources devoted by the rival so that the preemption effect as defined by Che and Gale is absent. Further, the equilibrium is invariant to the sequencing of moves. For the second type of function, which applies when there is asymmetry among contestants with regard to the quality of evidence, we find that the reaction functions of the stronger and weaker players have gradients with opposite signs relative to Dixit and therefore their incentive to precommit expenditures in a sequential move game is also different. For both types of functions, the extent of rent dissipation is partial. From the equilibrium analysis, we are also able to establish the potential effects of some specific factors affecting persuasion such as evidence potency, the degree of truth, and bias on aggregate resource expenditures and welfare.","[Skaperdas, Stergios] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Toukan, Amjad] Lebanese Amer Univ Beirut, Dept Econ, POB 13-5053, Beirut 11022801, Lebanon; [Vaidya, Samarth] Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Dept Econ, Geelong, Vic, Australia",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Lebanese American University; Deakin University,"Skaperdas, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",sskaperd@uci.edu; amjad.toukan@lau.edu.lb; samarth.vaidya@deakin.edu.au,,"Vaidya, Samarth/0000-0001-8366-6796",,,,,40,4,4,0,2,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

While previous studies have demonstrated that context can shape preferences, we consider whether people endogenously shape their own preferences by choosing their context. Using a one-shot game, we explore whether dictators actively seek or avoid information regarding the deservingness of their recipient.. We find that four out of five dictators endogenously choose to close the social distance gap by finding out the deservingness level of their recipients, and they act on that frame - the deserving get more, the undeserving get less.

Using a general spatial autocorrelation model that extends the traditional Feldstein-Horioka (FH) test, we analyze Chinese provincial data for the periods before and after 1993, and show that the FH coefficients differ to those in the existing literature. During China's period of reform and opening up between 1979 and 1992, the FH coefficient is significantly negative or not statistically significant. However, for the period after 1994, the FH coefficient is significantly higher than that shown in prior studies. This study explains this phenomenon from the perspective of Chinese-style decentralization. The FH test is an indirect method of showing regional capital mobility. Therefore, we need some form of direct measurement. Thus, we use the rate of the proportional change in physical capital stock as a proxy variable to demonstrate capital mobility directly, and use it to analyze various factors affecting Chinese provincial capital mobility. When investigating these factors, and to establish a realistic foundation on which the spatial effects take place, we devise four spatial weight matrices from the perspectives of geographical features and economic characteristics. Lastly, in order to promote regional capital mobility in China, the Chinese central government needs to take urgent measures to change local governments' strong preferences for GDP under the pressure of political promotion.

We find that the Korean economy is 'financially vulnerable', which means that the risk premium increases when the domestic currency depreciates. As a result, depreciation could cause recession, rather than expansion, when there exist substantial amount of foreign debt or financial frictions. A simulation shows that the Korean business cycle would suffer less volatility with a lower steady-state level of foreign debt or no financial frictions.","[Yie, Myung-Soo] Bank Korea, Econ Res Inst, Seoul 100794, South Korea; [Yoo, Byoung Hark] Soongsil Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Bank of Korea; Soongsil University,"Yoo, BH (通讯作者)，Soongsil Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",yie@bok.or.kr; harkyoo@ssu.ac.kr,,,Bank of Korea,Bank of Korea,"We thank Roberto Chang, Bruce Mizrach, John Landon-Lane, Jae Won Lee, Yoon Suk Lee, In Huh, Insu Kim and seminar participants at the Bank of Korea, 2011 Winter Meeting of the Korean Econometric Society, Rutgers University, and 2011 Asian Meeting of the Econometric Society for helpful comments.

J,"Benlialper, A; Cömert, H",,,,"Benlialper, Ahmet; Comert, Hasan",,,Implicit asymmetric exchange rate peg under inflation targeting regimes: the case of Turkey,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Inflation targeting; Central banking; Developing countries; Exchange rates,,"Especially after the 2000s, many developing countries let exchange rates float and began implementing inflation targeting (IT) regimes based on mainly manipulation of expectations and aggregate demand. However, most developing countries implementing IT regimes experienced considerable appreciation trends in their currencies. Might have exchange rates been utilised as implicit tools even under IT regimes in developing countries? To answer this question and investigate the determinants of inflation under an IT regime, as a case study, this article analyses the Turkish experience with IT between 2002 and 2008. There are two main findings. First, the evidence from a vector autoregressive (VAR) model suggests that the main determinants of inflation in Turkey during this period are supply-side factors, such as international commodity prices and the variation in exchange rate, rather than demand-side factors. Since the Turkish lira (TL) was considerably over-appreciated during this period, it is apparent that the Turkish Central Bank benefited from the appreciation of the TL in its fight against inflation during this period. Second, our findings suggest that the appreciation of the TL is related to the deliberate asymmetric policy stance of the bank with respect to the exchange rate. Both the econometric analysis from a VAR model and descriptive statistics indicate that appreciation of the TL was tolerated during the period under investigation, whereas depreciation was responded aggressively by the bank. We call this policy stance under IT regimes 'implicit asymmetric exchange rate peg'. The Turkish experience indicates that as opposed to the rhetoric of central banks in developing countries, IT developing countries may have an asymmetric stance towards exchange rates and favour appreciation of their currencies to hit their inflation targets. In this sense, IT seems to contribute to the ignorance of dangers regarding over-appreciation of currencies in developing countries.","[Benlialper, Ahmet] Ipek Univ, Ankara, Turkey; [Comert, Hasan] Middle East Tech Univ, Ankara, Turkey",Ipek University; Middle East Technical University,"Cömert, H (通讯作者)，Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Econ, A-205 Univ Mahallesi,Dumlupinar Bulvari 1, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",hcomert@metu.edu.tr,"Cömert, Hasan/ABA-3525-2020","Cömert, Hasan/0000-0002-1523-9423",,,,,46,12,13,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

It can simulate changes in household consumption behavior when exogenous stimulus policies lead to higher disposable income levels. It is useful for quantifying the short-run effects of fiscal stimuli on GDP and its industry-level value added components. We illustrate the use of the model by estimating the short-run effect of the 4 trillion yuan stimulus package on China's GDP. Our results show that this stimulus package might have led to an increase in GDP of more than 3 trillion yuan, which is 9.5% of China's GDP in 2008. This result compares well to actual changes in GDP as observed in the years immediately after the introduction of the package. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The disenfranchised are imperfectly informed about the economy's productive capacity, an asymmetry which the elite may exploit to implement distortionary economic regulations to create rent in excess of that which can be generated in a relatively more efficient manner. Our main result is that, the manner in which the elite will extract rent depends on the economy's level of development. We demonstrate that below a threshold development level the elite choose relatively inefficient regulation and above the threshold development level the elite choose relatively efficient taxation.

We address two issues that arise from this approach. We first show that even in simple environments with ample feedback and repetition, agents fail to reach non-truthtelling equilibria. We offer another way forward: implementing truth-telling as an ordinal Bayes-Nash equilibrium rather than as a dominant strategy equilibrium. We show that this weaker solution concept can allow for more efficient mechanisms in theory and provide experimental evidence that this is also the case in practice. In fact, truth-telling rates are basically the same whether truthtelling is implemented as an ordinal Bayes-Nash equilibrium or a dominant strategy equilibrium. This provides a proof-of-concept that ordinal Bayes-Nash design might provide a middle path, achieving efficiency gains over strategy-proof mechanisms without relying on real-life agents playing a non-truth-telling equilibrium.

An important question is whether disclosing physicians' performance can contribute to achieving these goals. Due to the asymmetric information inherent in medical markets, one may argue that changes in the information structure are likely to influence the environment in which health care providers operate. In a laboratory experiment with medical students that mimics a physician decision-making environment we analyze the effect of disclosing performance information to peers. Our results suggest that the information structure does influence the individual physician's supply of medical services. Under performance disclosure, choices that are in accordance with the medical norm or maximize the joint benefit become more frequent. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike the extensive theoretical literature, little empirical evidence exists on these relationships. First, we analyze cartel compliance and find that players are more likely to comply when cost is symmetric and own cost is high. Next, based on a structural model and counterfactual experiments, we show that a cartel price that satisfies all cartel members does not exist. This result indicates an inherent difficulty of sustaining collusion in retail markets with heterogeneous players. We also show that firm heterogeneities, especially product differentiation rather than cost asymmetries, hinder collusion more. Finally, we derive the level of patience (or the discount factor) required for cartel sustainability when firms split profits based on the Shapley value. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In our experiments, employees first choose a remuneration scheme (competitive tournament vs. piece rate) and then conduct a real-effort task. Employers know the pie size the employee has generated, the remuneration scheme chosen, and the employee's gender. Employers then decide how the pie will be split, as in a dictator game. Whereas employers do not discriminate by gender when tournaments are chosen, they take substantially and significantly more from female employees who choose piece-rate remuneration. A discriminatory wage gap occurs which cannot be attributed to employees' performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We show that regardless of the structure of the coalition (i.e., full or partial tax coordination), whether partial tax harmonization is sustainable or not crucially depends on the extent to which the capital endowment of the medium-sized country is similar to that of the large or small country. The most noteworthy finding is that the closer the capital endowment of the median country is to the average one, the less likely the tax harmonization including the median country is to prevail and the more likely the partial tax harmonization excluding the median country is to prevail. We also show that partial tax harmonization makes the member countries of the tax union better off and non-member countries worse off, which stands in sharpe contrast with previous studies, such as Konrad and Schjelderup (1999) and Bucovetsky (2009).","[Itaya, Jun-ichi] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Business Adm, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Itaya, Jun-ichi] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Okamura, Makoto] Gakushuin Univ, Dept Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Yamaguchi, Chikara] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci, Hiroshima, Japan",Hokkaido University; Ifo Institut; Gakushuin University; Hiroshima University,"Yamaguchi, C (通讯作者)，Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci, Hiroshima, Japan.",chikaray@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,"Yamaguchi, Chikara/W-1050-2017","Yamaguchi, Chikara/0000-0001-8069-4572","JSPS KAKENHI [2153029, 20330052, 20730226, 24530379]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03693, 24530379, 26380340, 20730226, 20330052, 15K03436, 15K03492] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are indebted to two anonymous referees and journal co-editor Josh Ederington, whose extremely valuable and constructive comments significantly improved the paper.

Results of the experiment indicate that an informational message had a positive impact at the beginning of the experiment, but this treatment effect slowly wore off over time. The results also suggest subjects' donation decisions in the experiment were highly associated with their donor registration status in real life. Subjects who are registered donors in real life were more likely to register in the experiment than those who are not donors, while this gap was perfectly closed when the informational message was introduced.

The setting is a large population coordination game, the Language Game of Neary (2012), in which actions are strategic complements and two homogeneous groups have differing preferences over equilibria. We find that subject behaviour is highly consistent with the myopic best response learning rule with deviations from this rule that are (i) dependent on the myopic best-response payoff but not on the deviation payoff, and (ii) directed in the sense of being group-dependent. We also find a time trend to deviations, with the magnitude tapering off as time progresses. This is in contrast to much of the theoretical literature that supposes a variety of other specifications of learning rules and both time-independent and payoff dependent explanations for deviations.

Next, in order to estimate ETI in the presence of cash and in-kind transfers, Brazilian population surveys (Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicilios [PNAD]) are used to explore a limited tax reform that was implemented between 1997 and 1998. This reform only affected the higher income tax bracket. Our findings suggest that in-kind (cash) transfers are positively (negatively) associated with reported taxable income and precise estimation of ETI requires estimates of both types of transfers. Last, we estimate the ETI for Brazil in the range from 0.4 to 1.3 not different from those that maximize income tax revenues.","[Mattos, Enlinson] Getulio Vargas Fdn, Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Terra, Rafael] Univ Brasilia, Econ, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Getulio Vargas Foundation; Universidade de Brasilia,"Mattos, E (通讯作者)，Getulio Vargas Fdn, Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",Enlinson.Mattos@fgv.br,,,,,,,43,2,2,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Yet, in many countries, including the United States, all workers face identical benefit schedules, which are a function of one's labor market history, making it difficult to separate the effect of the benefit level from the effect of unobserved preferences for work on individuals' claiming decisions. To circumvent this problem, we exploit exogenous variation in DI benefits in Austria arising from several reforms to its DI and old age pension system in the 1990s and 2000s. We use comprehensive administrative social security records data on the universe of Austrian workers to compute benefit levels under six different regimes, allowing us to identify and precisely estimate the elasticity of DI claiming with respect to benefit generosity. We find that, over this time period, a 1% increase in potential DI benefits was associated with a 1.2% increase in DI claiming. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the role of oil price shocks and volatility on six REIT categories: Residential, Hotel, Healthcare, Retail, Mortgage and Warehouse/Industrial REITs for the January 2005-December 2013 period. In addition, a new causality approach is proposed by augmenting the Toda-Yamamoto method with a Fourier approximation. This approach is capable of capturing gradual or smooth shifts and does not require a prior knowledge regarding the number, dates, and form of structural breaks. The so-called Fourier Toda-Yamamoto causality (mean spillover) test finds uni-directional causality running from oil prices to all REITs, except for the mortgage REITs. In the latter case, the causality is reversed. In addition, the relatively new and simple causality-in-variance test shows that there is bi-directional volatility transmission between the oil market and all REITs. Our results have important implications for REIT managers and investors. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Nazlioglu, Saban] Pamukkale Univ, Dept Econometr, Denizli, Turkey; [Gormus, N.

Applying the index to the period 1990-2009, we find that macroeconomic performance has improved in OECD overall and in the majority of countries, and that there has been a convergence of performance within the OECD. We then present evidence that OECD countries' performance, as measured, is positively related to institutional change towards more trade openness and better institutional quality. We argue that both increased openness and improved institutional quality are correlates of economic and political integration and conclude that international integration has enhanced SWB by improving OECD countries' national macroeconomic performance.","[Welsch, Heinz; Kuehling, Jan] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Welsch, H (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany.",welsch@uni-oldenburg.de,,,,,,,33,6,7,1,14,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

This paper contributes to closing this gap, shedding light on the role played by labour regulation and financial development in shaping the distribution of firm growth. Using unique harmonised micro-aggregated data for eleven countries, we look beyond differences in average growth rates and examine the impact that institutional factors have across the distribution of firms, showing that improvements in a country's institutional framework create both winners and losers, even when the economy as a whole benefits. Specifically, our results are twofold. First, we find that stringent employment protection legislation is linked to a less dynamic firm growth distribution in sectors which are labour and research intensive. This is reflected in a higher share of stable firms, as well as in slower growth and contraction at the extremes of the distribution. Second, a well-functioning financial system is associated with a more dynamic firm growth distribution in finance-dependent sectors. This is driven by faster growth among the best performing firms, faster contraction of under-performing ones, and a smaller share of stable firms in the middle. Overall, these results suggest that framework conditions have a heterogeneous impact along the distribution of firm growth.","[Bravo-Biosca, Albert] Nesta, London, England; Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; OECD, Paris, France; CEP LSE, London, England; SERC LSE, London, England",Barcelona School of Economics; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Bravo-Biosca, A (通讯作者)，Nesta, London, England.",,"Menon, Carlo/AAL-3158-2020","Menon, Carlo/0000-0003-0678-0434",,,,,62,28,36,1,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

We consider two policy dimensions: a) the number of migrants allowed into the country and b) whether to discourage remittances by migrants. The inflow of migrant workers leads to a wage decline that harms citizen workers, while capitalists and oil rent earners benefit. When foreign exchange is remitted out of the economy, the real exchange rate depreciates. The remittance outflow benefits oil rent earners, while capitalists and workers lose. The autocratic ruler chooses a migration policy mix and an oil-rent redistribution scheme to maintain critical political support to avoid public rage. Our results explain differences in migration policies and redistribution schemes across Gulf countries. The model also offers predictions regarding the development of migration policies if these countries were to become more democratic.","[Mehlum, Halvor] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, POB 1095, NO-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Ostenstad, Gry] Univ Coll Southeast Norway, POB 235, NO-3603 Kongsberg, Norway",University of Oslo; University College of Southeast Norway,"Mehlum, H (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, POB 1095, NO-0317 Oslo, Norway.",halvor.mehlum@econ.uio.no; gry.ostenstad@hbv.no,"mehlum, halvor/HSH-3292-2023",,"Centre of Equality, Social Organization and Performance (ESOP), University of Oslo; Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence funding scheme [179552]","Centre of Equality, Social Organization and Performance (ESOP), University of Oslo; Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence funding scheme(Research Council of Norway)","This work was supported by the Centre of Equality, Social Organization and Performance (ESOP), University of Oslo, funded by the Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence funding scheme [179552].",,26,1,1,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Students attending registered madrasahs fare worse in maths and English than students attending non-madrasah schools. However, failure to account for non-random sorting overestimates the negative influence of madrasahs on student's achievement. Evidence on the magnitude of this bias is presented. Once selection effect is taken into account, the madrasah's disadvantage in English is small while that in maths becomes insignificant. Given the overall low level of achievement, this suggests that madrasah students perform just as poorly as those from non-madrasah schools in rural Bangladesh.","[Asadullah, M.

Distributions of fiscal limits, which measure a government's capacity to service its debt, are simulated based on macroeconomic uncertainty and fiscal policy. The analysis shows that expected future revenue plays an important role in explaining the low fiscal limits of developing countries, relative to those of developed countries. Large devaluation of real exchange rates can significantly reduce a government's capacity to service its debt and lower the fiscal limits. Temporary disturbances, therefore, can shift the distribution of fiscal limits and suddenly change perceptions about fiscal sustainability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We investigate this issue using second-price common-value auctions. Theoretically, we find that the symmetric bidding equilibrium is unique unless returns are free, and when returns are free there exist multiple equilibria with different implications for sellers. Moreover, more generous return policies mitigate the winner's curse, but also push the bids higher, thus hurting bidders by eroding their surplus. In the experiment, bids increase and bidders' earnings decrease with more generous return policies as predicted. With free returns, many bidders bid above the highest possible value, subsequently returning the item regardless of value.

Based on a unique dataset at a very detailed spatial level, we estimate a Poisson model to explain the heterogeneity in adoption rates. We obtain the following findings. First, local policies have a robust and significant impact on PV adoption. Second, there is a strong unconditional income effect, implying a Matthew effect in the subsidization of PVs. Our third finding is however that this income effect is largely driven by the fact that wealthier households are more likely to adopt because they tend to be higher users, are more frequent house owners, or own houses that are better suited for PV. In several extensions, we consider the determinants of the average size of installed PVs, and the differential impact of certain variables over time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

I extend Weber's theory by arguing that states with predominantly Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Muslim populations have had a stronger inclination toward underdevelopment and dictatorship than states with Protestant or Jewish majorities. This is the case because their respective religious collectives (monastery, tariqa) promote the hierarchical provision of common goods at the expense of market incentives. I define the aforementioned three religions as collectivist, in contrast to Protestantism and Judaism, which I define as individualist. I provide a historical overview that designates the Jewish kibbutz as the collective of democracy and the Eastern Orthodox monastery as the collective of dictatorship. Focusing on collectivist economies, I find that modernization, as a credible commitment to the improved future provision of public goods, occurs when the threat of a radical government is imminent and when the leader has high extraction of tents from the economy. The emergence of radical governments is more likely in collectivist than in individualist economies. Historical illustrations from collectivist economies include the Russian Revolution, the Islamic Revolution in Iran, and the postwar welfare state in Western Europe.

The probability of job termination has an effect on the relative profitability of different intellectual property rights regimes. Weak intellectual property rights may make it more attractive for skilled workers to join the firm, which will increase its profits while employing workers. However, when a job match is terminated the firm is left with the ownership of intellectual property only under a strong intellectual property rights regime. Based on the institutional complementarities approach we develop a simple model that analyses this trade-off, in which multiple organisational equilibria exist. We show that when intellectual property rights are taken into account, expectations such as increase in the skill and knowledge content of work are not inevitable in the knowledge economy.","[Gurpinar, Erkan] Ankara Univ, Dept Econ, Social Sci, Ankara, Turkey",Ankara University,"Gürpinar, E (通讯作者)，Ankara Univ, Dept Econ, Social Sci, Ankara, Turkey.",erkan.gurpinar@asbu.edu.tr,"GURPINAR, Erkan/JJG-2135-2023","GURPINAR, Erkan/0000-0002-0419-1276",,,,,39,4,4,2,43,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Analysis encompasses cases in which the domestic MC sector is able to expand or contract flexibly, or is constrained to be of fixed size. In the former case domestic protection can bring gains by increasing the number of product varieties on offer; these gains (and the corresponding rates of domestic subsidy or of import tariffs) are reduced by heterogeneity of foreign exporters some of whom may withdraw from the market. In the latter case gains from protection arise from terms-of-trade effects; since various margins of substitution are switched off, only the relative values of domestic taxes, import tariffs and export taxes matter. In general, policies work through both a terms-of-trade and a variety effect, and the paper shows how the relative importance of each depends on the structure of the economy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This differential in the marginal effect of pregnancy is in addition to a general decrease in satisfaction for Black women, independent of being pregnant. The results cannot be explained by differences in other demographics such age, income, education, or physical health status. Within each racial/ethnic group, the results are consistent across different categories for all these characteristics. Racial and ethnic differences in the effects of pregnancy on support from others can partly explain this result.

From observation of yield curves over the same period, we filter the evolution of risk premiums of supply and demand processes. Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of implied volatilities of caplets to parameters defining thelevel of mutual-excitation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our model allows the insurer to have different levels of ambiguity aversion (rather than only consider the extremely ambiguity-averse attitude as in the literature). The insurer can purchase proportional reinsurance and also invest the surplus in a financial market consisting of a risk-free asset and a risky asset, whose dynamics is correlated with the insurance surplus. Closed-form equilibrium reinsurance-investment strategy is derived by solving the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Our results show that the equilibrium reinsurance strategy is always more conservative if the insurer is more ambiguity-averse. When the dependence between insurance and financial risks are weak, the equilibrium investment strategy is also more conservative if the insurer is more ambiguity-averse. However, in order to diversify the portfolio, a more ambiguity-averse insurer may adopt a more aggressive investment strategy if the insurance market is very ambiguous. For an ambiguity-neutral insurer, the investment strategy is identical to the non-robust investment strategy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, we find supporting evidence of humped shaped age profiles for the elasticity of consumption with respect to income and the importance of financial wealth for those aged 60+.

The hypothesis that economies of scale are a typical feature of the generation market in Brazil and, in general, are not exhausted at lower levels of production is not rejected. This result supports the vision that indivisibilities restrict efficiency gains from free-market competition in the Brazilian electricity generation and most of the last restructuring in the industry regulation was based on this assumption. Furthermore, over the sample period, technological progress led to cost reductions in electric power supply. These technological improvements take the form of both a neutral technological effect as well as a non-neutral fuel effect, which prevails over the capital and labor saving technical changes.

We build up an original database on the personal background of 932 politicians who were at the head of the executive power in a developing country over the 1960-2004 period. These data reveal the existence of a positive correlation between the fact that leaders studied abroad and the change in the score of democracy in their country during their tenure, for leaders who reach power in initially autocratic settings. This correlation notably appears to be driven by leaders who studied in high income OECD countries. The main finding, confirmed by various robustness tests, adds up to the recent literature on the effects of the characteristics of political leaders. It also suggests a new channel through which migration may shape development and politics in the sending countries namely, the political elites. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We use data on natural gas prices and shipping costs to analyze the distribution of trade benefits within the LNG value chain when shipping costs are endogenous to price spread developments. Our empirical analysis suggests that for the 2006-2014 period, the LNG shipping sector has had an implied scarcity rent on LNG shipping capacity of $0.14/MMBtu for the EU/US spread, $0.32/MMBtu for the Asia/EU spread, and $0.42/MMBtu for the Asia/US spread. We highlight in a counter-factual analysis that this distributional effect is not economically negligible. We investigate how including endogenous transportation costs affects the measured degree of price convergence between regional natural gas markets. We find that price convergence is stronger when we control for variations in transportation costs rather than implicitly assuming fixed or exogenous costs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Focusing on the last four decades, we show that the mix of immigrants to rich countries has been, overall, rather balanced between college and non-college educated. The growth of immigration has been driven by immigrants from nonrich countries. The economic impact of immigration on receiving economies needs to be understood by analyzing the specific skills brought by immigrants. The complementarity and substitutability between immigrants and natives in employment, and the response of receiving economies in terms of specialization and technological choices, are important when considering the general equilibrium effects of immigration. In the United States, a balanced composition of immigrants between college and noncollege educated, together with the adjustment of demand and technology, imply that general equilibrium effects on relative and absolute wages have been small.","[Peri, Giovanni] Univ Calif Davis, Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Peri, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",gperi@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,69,101,120,5,61,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Using a novel approach, we find that firms in regions with a more developed transport infrastructure are better placed to benefit from positive growth opportunities than those in regions with a less well-developed transport network. This advantage is most pronounced in times of economic slack-making a better transport network a key ingredient for economic recovery.

The structural decomposition analysis (SDA) was further applied to shed light on the driving forces behind the changes in their embodied emissions over the entire time period. This empirical study confirms the importance of using the extended model for analyzing the trade-related embodiment, especially for processing exports. The embodied emissions in both normal and processing exports first increased from 2006 to 2008, then dropped during the global financial crisis (2008-2009), and then rose again after 2009. The embodied emissions as a percentage of total CO2 emissions were quite stable before and after the global financial crisis, at around 24% over the 2006-2008 period, and 18% over the 2010-2012 period. From 2006 to 2012, emission intensity played the key role in reducing the embodied emissions (around 595 Mt CO2), while the total export effect contributed the most to the increase in embodied emissions (around 552 Mt CO2). Similar analysis can be applied to other indicators, such as energy, water, GHG emissions, pollutants and materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, I investigate theoretically the sources of discrepancies in these empirical results. Using a formal job search framework, I derive an equilibrium wage distribution which reveals that informal search yields for some groups higher and for some others lower wages than formal search. The key result is the existence of non-monotonicities in wage offers. Two potential sources of these non-monotonicities exist: peer effects and unobserved worker heterogeneity in terms of the inherent cost of maintaining connections within a productive informal network. The model predicts that a greater degree of unobserved heterogeneity tilts the estimates toward producing a positive correlation between informal search and higher wages, whereas stronger peer influences tend to yield a negative correlation. This conclusion informs the empirical research in the sense that identification of the true correlation between job contact methods and wage offers requires a careful assessment of the unobserved heterogeneity and peer influences in the relevant sample.","[Tumen, Semih] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Tumen, S (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey.",semih.tumen@tcmb.gov.tr,"Tumen, Semih/S-3412-2019","Tumen, Semih/0000-0002-8841-2290",,,,,59,4,4,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

However, Hatton and Leigh (2011) showed that immigrants integrate to their host country as communities, not as individuals; hence, group characteristics play as much of a role as individual characteristics in terms of adaptation. This paper introduces another dimension to the immigrant adaptation proxies that reflect community-based characteristics. The fundamental assertion of this paper is that inequality can be used as a proxy of adaptation within immigrant groups. Immigrant groups that exhibit income and education distributions similar to those of the natives can be regarded as well-adapted groups, while those who exhibit vastly different distributions should be considered to be groups with limited adaptation. Using the American Community Survey (ACS) 2010 cohort, this paper presents the initial findings of the within-group inequality of immigrants. Then, a cross-sectional regression analysis is employed to analyze the determinants of inequality across these immigrant groups. The results suggest that immigrant community-based characteristics, such as average income, education, and number of years that the immigrants have spent in the US, can indeed explain most of the variation in inequality.","[Yaya, Mehmet E.] Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, 703 M Pray Harrold Hall, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA",Eastern Michigan University,"Yaya, ME (通讯作者)，Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, 703 M Pray Harrold Hall, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA.",myaya@emich.edu,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Specifically, we examine the following questions: Does moral concern curb people from cheating to benefit a member of their own in-group? Is the moral burden of cheating as strong a deterrent for such cheating for others as it is for purely selfish cheating? We find evidence of dishonesty to benefit not only oneself but also one's in-group. In particular, we find that some people lie to increase the payoff of an in-group member even though such a lie does not affect their own monetary payoff. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Agents face idiosyncratic investment risks and meet financial intermediaries in competitive search markets. Asset liquidity is determined by the search friction and the cost of operating the financial intermediaries, and it drives the financing constraints of entrepreneurs (those who have investment projects) and their ability to invest. In contrast to private assets, government bonds are fully liquid and can be accumulated in anticipation of future opportunities to invest. A higher level of real government debt enhances the liquidity of entrepreneurs' portfolios and raises investment. However, the issuance of debt also raises the cost of financing government expenditures: a higher level of distortionary taxation and/or a higher real interest rate. A long-run optimal supply of government debt emerges. I also show that a proper mix of monetary and fiscal policies can avoid a deep financial recession. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Using Reinhard Selten's impulse response dynamics, we derive a proposition that provides a theoretical ranking of contribution levels in the weakest link games. We show that the predicted ranking of treatment outcomes is fully consistent with the observed data. In addition, we demonstrate that the impulse response dynamics perform well in tracking average contributions over time. We conclude that Reinhard Selten's impulse response dynamics provide an extremely valuable behavioral approach that is not only capable of resolving the indecisiveness of static approaches in games with many equilibria, but that can also be used to track the development of choices over time in games with repeated interaction.","[Goerg, Sebastian J.] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Neugebauer, Tibor] Univ Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Sadrieh, Abdolkarim] Univ Magdeburg, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; University of Luxembourg; Otto von Guericke University,"Sadrieh, A (通讯作者)，Univ Magdeburg, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany.",sadrieh@ovgu.de,"Sadrieh, Abdolkarim/C-7858-2013; Goerg, Sebastian J./AAL-4475-2020","Sadrieh, Abdolkarim/0000-0002-9322-4729; Goerg, Sebastian J./0000-0002-1740-6870; Neugebauer, Tibor/0000-0002-1183-7979",,,,,24,4,4,1,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

In India, where we observe quality directly, e-procurement improves road quality, and in Indonesia, e-procurement reduces delays.

When the formal sector can circumvent costly regulations by outsourcing polluting intermediate goods from the informal sector, stricter regulations increase (when the composition effect of regulation dominates its scale effect) or decrease total pollution, and may even have a non-monotonic impact. We identify conditions under which a partially compliant informal sector acts as a source of leakage, and examine implications for optimal enforcement policy. Further, we show that price discrimination by the formal sector, when it purchases the intermediate goods from the informal sector, can worsen regulatory compliance by the informal sector and lead to more pollution.

The games differ from each other in terms of the size of the cost asymmetry that induces a systematic variation in the difference between the firms' marginal costs. While the standard theory requires the low-cost firm to set a price just equal to the high-cost firm's marginal cost, which is identical across all three games, and win the entire market, intuition suggests that market price may increase with a decrease in the absolute difference between the two marginal costs.

A panel dataset of 283 prefecture or higher-level cities from 2003-2013 is used for the empirical analysis. The estimation shows that proximities to government expenditure on science and technology, to professionals in science and technology, and to the domestic and foreign markets all contribute to urban manufacturing growth, while concentrations of specialized labor force and producer services in neighboring cities have negative effects. The spatial effects of factor proximities and market potentials differ in China's three regions. Surprisingly, cities in the central region have the most significant gain from spillovers of factor supply, and cities in the eastern and western regions benefit substantially from the domestic and foreign markets.

In this paper I develop a model of conspicuous consumption in which a consumer cares not only about the direct utility she receives from consumption, but also about the way her consumption pattern affects her peer group's belief about her well-being. Estimating the model on American and Chinese data, I find that a Chinese consumer cares 20% more than an American consumer about peer beliefs. I use the estimated model in several experiments related to tax incidence. I find that the 1990-2002 American luxury tax on automobiles led to widespread but small welfare gains, and that the stronger Chinese motive for conspicuous consumption leads to fewer households harmed and larger median welfare gains from a 10% tobacco excise tax.

We argue that flexibility in labour markets (i.e. easier firing and higher labour turnover) damages trust, loyalty and commitment. This requires more management and control.

Models in this class are characterized by a known mapping between a point identified reduced-form parameter mu and the identified set for a partially identified parameter theta. The approach maps posterior inference about mu to various posterior inference statements concerning the identified set for theta, without the specification of a prior for theta. Many posterior inference statements are considered, including the posterior probability that a particular parameter value (or a set of parameter values) is in the identified set. The approach applies also to functions of theta. The paper develops general results on large sample approximations, which illustrate how the posterior probabilities over the identified set are revised by the data, and establishes conditions under which the Bayesian credible sets also are valid frequentist confidence sets. The approach is computationally attractive even in high-dimensional models, in that the approach avoids an exhaustive search over the parameter space. The performance of the approach is illustrated via Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical application to a binary entry game involving airlines.","[Kline, Brendan] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Tamer, Elie] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Harvard University,"Kline, B (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",brendan.kline@austin.utexas.edu; elietamer@fas.harvard.edu,"Kline, Brendan/JVD-9448-2023","Kline, Brendan/0009-0004-8484-0302",,,,,56,43,44,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

The regression analysis shows that between 1990 and 2011, food price increases are associated with higher levels of violence. Moving from low to high values in the price index corresponds, after controlling for economic, social, and political factors, to an increase in violence intensity of 1.3 incidents. This effect is predominantly driven by imports of low-value-added primary products. Despite the statistically significant results, the predictive power of food prices is relatively low, both in and out of sample. Using 2012 data for out-of-sample forecast shows that food prices are a relatively poor predictor of violence.","[van Weezel, Stijn] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Econ, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"van Weezel, S (通讯作者)，Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Econ, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",stijn.vanweezel.2011@live.rhul.ac.uk,,"van Weezel, Stijn/0000-0002-7145-3854",,,,,76,11,13,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Present risk governance is based primarily on two institutions insurance markets and public risk governance - supported by a powerful theory: the expected utility approach to risk. New systemic risks like those of nuclear war, pandemics, climate change and global financial breakdowns call for further progress. Such progress is feasible because recent research has developed ways to address the basic difficulties of expected utility without loosing its valuable insights. They involve three major advances. First, to introduce a risk function that generalizes expected utility so as to overcome well-known difficulties like the Allais paradox. Second, to embed expected utility in a framework of iterated network games so as to take into account the social learning processes that are essential for real world risk governance. And third, to accommodate the logic of complementary descriptions called for by the new systemic risks. The coming breakthrough in risk research may best be achieved by bringing these advances to bear on practical efforts aiming at integrated risk governance.","[Jaeger, Carlo] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Jaeger, Carlo] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ USA; [Jaeger, Carlo] Global Climate Forum, Berlin, Germany",Beijing Normal University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Jaeger, C (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Jaeger, C (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ USA.;Jaeger, C (通讯作者)，Global Climate Forum, Berlin, Germany.",carlo.jaeger@globalclimateforum.org,,,,,,,41,2,3,0,7,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 27,2016,10.0,,,,,,,,201616.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2016-16,0.0,,,29,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DP7IY,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378673600001,0

The empirical model is estimated for the G7 countries during the period between 1994 and 2011. The findings show that budget deficit and savings gap have important role in current account deficit in terms of estimator results. Moreover, bi-directional causality between the current account deficit and the savings gap and between the budget deficit and the savings gap are determined. So, especially the savings gap has an important effect on the current account deficit and the budget deficit. That is, triplet deficit hypothesis is valid in G7. Moreover, traditional approach is also valid since the causality is found between the current account deficit and budget deficit.

This results in lower average firm productivity and total factor productivity. The distributions of employment by firm size across steady states are consistent with the empirical observation that poor countries have a higher fraction of employment in small firms than rich countries.

We then investigate the quantitative implications of imperfect fiscal policy information using a medium-scale DSGE model. We find that when the government seeks to implement a persistent change in expected public spending, the existence of noise (as estimated using actual data) implies a sizable difference in fiscal multipliers compared to the perfect fiscal foresight case.

By separating the asymmetric effects that how upward and downward coal price changes pass through to the economy, this paper reexamines the relationship between coal price and general price level in China. The asymmetric effects are investigated via vector autoregression models, Granger Causality tests, and impulse response function analyses using the monthly time series data from Jun-98 to Sep-14. Results show negative coal price change presents more significant impact on inflation than positive one. The inflation responses very abruptly to coal price shock in the short run, but the impact regresses rapidly along time. Accumulatively, a 1% increase of coal price will push CPI and PPI up by 0.04% and 0.12%, while a 1% decrease of coal price will pull them down by 0.08% and 0.17%, respectively. The linkage among coal price change, PPI, and CPI is demonstrated as the main transmission channel of price shock. The inflationary effect is strong in the initial stage, but will be weakened in the later stage since the pass through effect from PPI to CPI is tiny, which confirms PPI is more responsive than CPI to coal price change. For policy implications, how to avoid extreme volatility in general price level is a major concern of recent agendas such as reforming energy market and building green fiscal system.

Using a comprehensive set of administrative data 20,000 synthetic life-cycle paths of household income and long-term care costs are constructed using the nearest neighbor resampling method. We show that the distribution of these costs is less skewed when measured over the life-cycle than on a cross-sectional basis. This may provide an argument for self-insurance by smoothing these costs over the life-cycle. Yet costs are concentrated at older ages, which limits the scope for self-insurance. Furthermore, the paper investigates the relation between long-term care expenditures, household composition, and income over the life-cycle. The expenditures on a lifetime basis from the age of 65 are higher for low income households, and (single) women.","[Hussem, Arjen] PGGM, POB 117, NL-3700 AC Zeist, Netherlands; [van Ewijk, Casper] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [ter Rele, Harry] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands; [Wong, Albert] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, Dept Stat Informat & Math Modelling, Bilthoven, Netherlands",PGGM; University of Amsterdam; CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment,"Hussem, A (通讯作者)，PGGM, POB 117, NL-3700 AC Zeist, Netherlands.",arjen.hussem@pggm.nl; c.vanewijk@uva.nl; h.j.m.ter.rele@cpb.nl; albert.wong@rivm.nl,"van Ewijk, Casper/AAE-2017-2022","van Ewijk, Casper/0000-0002-5924-0856",,,,,39,1,1,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,JUN,2016,164.0,2,,,,,209,234,,10.1007/s10645-016-9270-7,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DU2EH,,"Green Submitted, hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382023300005,0

Foreign firm entry is confirmed to be significantly tougher than domestic firm entry in terms of its reallocation forces. Accounting for the competing nature of shutdown and merger risk, the results for Slovenian manufacturing firms during the later stage of Slovenia's transition show that the entry of foreign firms via either FDI or exports increases the relative probability of incumbents deciding to shut down, while the incentive to react by merging is present only when foreign firms enter via a greenfield investment within the same region. While a shutdown decision is detected as the principal response in case of import competition, no predominance can be identified in incumbents' reactions to FDI entry. Furthermore, firms with foreign owner(s) proved less likely to be a target of takeovers/mergers, although they tend to close down more easily than locally owned rivals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Against this background our paper analyses how a tradable/non-tradable production quota influences firm entry and exit in the agricultural industry. To this end we develop a dynamic stochastic equilibrium framework considering that a release of production capacity by exiting firms affects the investment options for entrants. Firms' investment and exit decisions depend on future output and quota prices, which in turn will be affected by the evolution of industry structures. Contrary to static models, we find that a quota system does not necessarily reduce the speed of adjustment within the industry since a tradable quota increases the liquidation value and provides an incentive for inefficient firms to cease production.

However, the impact of GDP on attracting FDI inflows to Poland is stronger than that of FDI on GDP growth.

In addition, Japan's high-technology firms are likely to prefer urban locations so that they can enjoy the externalities of business services.","[Lee, Ki-Dong] Keimyung Univ, Dept Int Commerce, 1095 Dalgubeol Daero, Daegu 42601, South Korea; [Hwang, Seok-Joon] Kyungpook Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, 80 Daehak Ro, Daegu 42601, South Korea",Keimyung University,"Lee, KD (通讯作者)，Keimyung Univ, Dept Int Commerce, 1095 Dalgubeol Daero, Daegu 42601, South Korea.",kdlee@kmu.ac.kr; sxh219@knu.ac.kr,"Hwang, Seok-Joon/R-6225-2019; Lee, Ki-Dong/L-4195-2017","Lee, Ki-Dong/0000-0002-2660-2806",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2014-S1A3A2044643],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2014-S1A3A2044643).,,28,2,4,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Towards this goal a trade weighted real effective (rather than the bilateral) exchange rate and three different measures of volatility, i.e. obtained from an ARCH model, a GARCH model and a moving-average standard deviation measure are used in this study. Specifically, the export flows between six Asian countries and the rest of the world are investigated rather than focusing on trade with only one country. Our findings reveal that the exchange rate volatility has a significant impact on export flows in the short run as well as in the long run for all the countries in the sample. The impact in the long run is predominantly negative with the exception of Singapore, but in the short run the impact varies across countries. Moreover, our results are robust to the alternative measures of volatility used and most of the findings in the long run and short run are also robust to the crisis period.","[Pino, Gabriel] Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Negocios, Talca, Chile; [Tas, Dilara] Off Management & Budget, New York, NY USA; [Sharma, Subhash C.] Southern Illinois Univ Carbondale, Dept Econ, Carbondale, IL USA",Universidad de Talca; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University,"Pino, G (通讯作者)，Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Negocios, Talca, Chile.",gpino@utalca.cl,,,,,,,45,13,13,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Here, we explore the robustness of this linkage by applying a range of econometric models to panel data collected in Kenya, using maize as an example because of its importance as a major food crop among smallholder farmers. We test the relationship between rates of fertilizer use and three types of off-farm earnings (labour on other farms, known as farm kibarua); income from self-employment and informal businesses and earnings from regular employment (salaries, pensions or wages). Consistent with previous research, we find a strong, negative linkage between non-farm work and rates of fertiliser use in maize production, indicating trade-offs in labour allocation and farm investments. However, the relationship between fertiliser use in maize production and earnings from farm kibarua appears to be positive, illustrating the role this type of work can play in easing cash constraints for destitute households. Adding to previous research, model comparisons illustrate the sensitivity of some estimated parameters to modelling assumptions. Further, the application of the general propensity score matching demonstrates that the magnitude of the marginal effects of non-farm income on fertiliser use rates varies as income changes. In the case of non-farm earnings, the response of fertiliser to additional income is negative at lower income levels, but positive at higher levels.","[Smale, Melinda] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kusunose, Yoko; Alia, Didier] Univ Kentucky, Dept Agr Engn, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Mathenge, Mary K.] Egerton Univ, Tegemeo Inst Agr Policy & Dev, Nairobi, Kenya",Michigan State University; University of Kentucky; Egerton University,"Smale, M (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",msmale@msu.edu,,"Alia, Didier/0000-0001-9792-4557",United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Egerton University; Michigan State University (MSU); University of Kentucky,United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Egerton University; Michigan State University (MSU); University of Kentucky,The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Egerton University; Michigan State University (MSU) and the University of Kentucky.,,29,10,11,1,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The testing methodology is based on the sample of cross-correlation functions that are computed from the standardized residuals of a GARCH process. Our results show that the influence is not uniform across the equity sectors. The oil return shocks significantly impact the Financials and the Services sectors, while its effect is insignificant on the Industrials sector. This result is more pronounced in the period that follows the Arab Uprisings. In terms of risk transfer, we find that oil is a negligible risk factor. However, there is still a significant evidence of risk transmission to the Industrials sector particularly during the Arab Uprisings period.

The goal of this paper is to assess to what extent the educational expectations of students are correlated with dropout behavior at the junior high school level in China. Using panel data, this research finds that the cumulative dropout rate is high among grade 7 and 8 students within our sample (as high as 19.5 percent, which implies a 3-year dropout rate of around 25 percent). Importantly, we find that this high rate of dropout is significantly correlated with students' educational expectations. Specifically, students who reported their expected level of education is less than high school or less than college are five times and four times more likely to drop out during junior high school than their peers, respectively.","[Chang, Fang; Min, Wenbin; Shi, Yaojiang] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Peoples R China; [Kenny, Kaleigh; Loyalka, Prashant] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Shaanxi Normal University; Stanford University,"Shi, YJ (通讯作者)，Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Peoples R China.",changfang4421@163.com; minwenbincee@163.com; shiyaojiang7@gmail.com; kaleigh.kenny@gmail.com; prashantstanford9@gmail.com,"Loyalka, Prashant/Y-6174-2018",,111 Project [B16031]; National Social Science Fund Youth Project [15CJL005],"111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project); National Social Science Fund Youth Project",The authors acknowledge the financial assistance of the 111 Project (Grant No. B16031) and the National Social Science Fund Youth Project (Grant No. 15CJL005).,,38,16,19,3,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2016,24.0,3,,,SI,,67,85,,10.1111/cwe.12159,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DR5QJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379957200006,0

We calculate hourly market power measures such as the Lerner Index and the Residual Supplier Index, which are utilized in a Cournot competition model to structurally estimate price elasticity of demand during peak hours of days, seasons and years. We find that price elasticities are small and statistically significant, and they exhibit large variations over the times of days/seasons and show differences over the years. For instance, while the elasticity estimates fall into the range [0.021, 0.133] in 2007, they are in the interval of [0,013, 0.053] in 2008. We also extend the study period to include 2006 (during which extreme weather conditions occurred) and 2009 (when the economic crisis hit and natural gas prices plummeted) to measure the demand responses to irregular price movements and find that price elasticities during the economic crisis were higher than a year earlier. Comparing high demand winter hours to high demand summer hours indicates that consumers' price responsiveness is lower in summer than in winter during 2006-2009. Moreover, we employ these indices along with the estimated price elasticities to project the likely impact of interconnection capacity expansions on market prices. Our calibrations show that even a small amount of transmission investment (and hence trade activity) can result in substantial market price reductions. In addition, we discuss how our approach could be used to estimate price elasticities for other goods such as crude oil and gasoline. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Kaufmann, RK",,,,"Kaufmann, Robert K.",,,Price differences among crude oils: The private costs of supply disruptions,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Oil prices; Supply disruption; Country risk; Unified market,MARKET,"I quantify the causes for price differences among crude oils that are set by the law of one price with a special emphasis on country risk For crude oils that are part of the same market, I estimate cointegrating relations, which represent their long-run relation, and error correction models, which represent the rate at which the market eliminates disequilibrium in their prices. Results indicate that positive values of country risk impose a $0.51 price penalty on a barrel of crude oil from an unreliable supplier that increases with the variance in risk and the price of crude oil. These price penalties are the first empirical estimates for how the market values the private costs of oil supply disruptions. Beyond country risk, the price effects of sulfur content, density, distance between supply ports, and OPEC membership confirm the importance of oil supply choke points, OPEC's ability to influence prices, and differences in refinery technology. Because private costs of a supply disruption attach only to nations with a non-zero country risk, previous estimates for the social costs of a supply disruption may be too large.

A threshold cointegration technique is used, with regime switches being triggered by the size of the markup margin. There is consistent evidence of band-TAR in which the crude, rack and retail prices are free to diverge until the markup margin is squeezed or stretched beyond a lower or upper critical threshold. This finding indicates that abnormally high markup margins cannot be sustained, which provides evidence against market power exertion. The threshold error correction models indicate that there is no systematic relationship between the speed of adjustment back to the long-run relationship and the markup margin, which rules out the existence of rockets and feathers.","[Mann, Janelle] Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Mann, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",janelle.mann@umanitoba.ca,,,SSHRC Doctoral Fellowship; Ontario Graduate Scholarship,SSHRC Doctoral Fellowship(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Ontario Graduate Scholarship(Ontario Graduate Scholarship),"I am grateful for the comments and suggestions from the anonymous reviewers and participants at the Canadian Economics Association Annual Conference, Canadian Agricultural Economics Society Annual Meeting, NCCC-134 Conference on Commodity Price Analysis, Forecasting, and Market Risk Management, seminars at Industry Canada, Queen's University, University of Alberta, University of Guelph, University of Winnipeg and University of Manitoba and Dr. Peter Sephton.

They are also less likely to work past retirement age. The estimated effects are large, despite the evidence that adult children from larger families are less educated and earn significantly less.

In this paper, we compare the outcomes of boarding to those of non-boarding students using a large, aggregate dataset that includes 59 rural counties across five provinces in China. We find that for all outcomes boarding students perform worse than non-boarding students.

We are unable to reject the null that there is a statistically significant appreciating effect of remittances on real exchange rate.

This paper studies economic growth in the presence of two environmental externalities. The first one is local and gives account of the marginal damage from the emissions flow. The second one is aggregate, or global, and relates to the extreme damage which may happen if the accumulated stock of pollutants is on the threshold of a worldwide catastrophe. In this context, the decentralized equilibrium is inefficient and economic growth unsustainable. However, we find and completely characterize the socially optimal equilibrium, which shows that sustained growth is feasible along the balanced path. Efficiency alone is not sufficient for sustainability, but Pareto optimality is necessary to produce sustainable outcomes. According to our results, the sustainability of the optimal sustained long-run growth depends on environmental constraints, production and abatement technologies, individual preferences, and population dynamics. This means that government has a clear incentive for intervention by means of direct and indirect policies. These ones cover the usual Pigouvian taxes and subsidies, the setting of emission standards, and the public provision of abatement. Moreover, the government can promote eco-efficiency in the use of materials, implement information campaigns that influence social preferences for environmental conservation, or even put into action population controls and other measures that encourage the demographic transition.

Although low growth in MFP in services was due to declining real user cost, particularly in real estate services, the lack of convergence itself was due to variation in wage growth.

This literature can be broadly divided into four groups that focus on: (1) the statistical properties of revisions in fiscal data; (2) the political and institutional determinants of projection errors by governments; (3) the reaction of fiscal policies to the business cycle and (4) the use of real-time fiscal data in structural vector autoregression (VAR) models. It emerges that, first, fiscal revisions are large and initial releases are biased estimates of final values. Secondly, strong fiscal rules and institutions lead to more accurate releases of fiscal data and smaller deviations of fiscal outcomes from government plans. Thirdly, the cyclical stance of fiscal policies is estimated to be more counter-cyclical' when real-time data are used instead of ex post data. Fourthly, real-time data can be useful for the identification of fiscal shocks. Finally, it is shown that existing real-time fiscal data sets cover only a limited number of countries and variables. For example, real-time data for developing countries are generally unavailable. In addition, real-time data on European countries are often missing, especially with respect to government revenues and expenditures.

The analysis reveals both the growth-enhancing and deteriorating effects of corruption that transmit through the income and productivity channels, and shows how income uncertainty caused by corruption interacts with both of these effects. In particular, it is found that an increase in bribe rates and the probability of corruption that reduces the burden of regulations generate counteracting effects on income and productivity, where both effects are further aggravated by corruption-induced income uncertainty. On the other hand, a higher burden of bribes imposed by extortive bureaucrats hampers growth unambiguously. However, in a highly corrupt environment, an increase in the incidence of extortive behaviour can be growth enhancing as it reduces income uncertainty, while if corruption levels are relatively low, then a further increase in the incidence of such behaviour deteriorates growth. These findings give us a new insight into why the overall growth effect of corruption is ambiguous.","[Dzhumashev, Ratbek] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, 100 Clyde Rd, Beriwck, Vic 3806, Australia",Monash University,"Dzhumashev, R (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, 100 Clyde Rd, Beriwck, Vic 3806, Australia.",Ratbek.Dzhumashev@monash.edu,"Dzhumashev, Ratbek/H-9207-2019","Dzhumashev, Ratbek/0000-0003-2428-2762",,,,,88,15,15,1,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

In a model where individual units like firms and workers produce more if they have a larger network, but where they have to break up with existing links within their network in order to upgrade technologically, we find endogenous network cycles. In the upswing part of the cycle, productive units increase their links allowing them to specialise more completely at current technologies, whilst in the downward part of the cycle, some units deliberate down-size in order to upgrade their technology, but this leads to a recession due to the negative externality on trading partners. We argue that network collapse is likely to have been an element of three major downturns (the Great Depression in the US of the 1930s, the collapse of the Russian economy following the reforms in 1990, and the downturn in the Indonesian economy after the Asian crisis in 1997). Simulations show that various features of downturns are replicable with the basic model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For the postwar U.S. economy, we harness wavelet methods to examine whether there actually exists an opportunistic political business cycle in monetary policy. Our results indicate an inclination of the Federal Reserve to cut the funds rate prior to presidential elections except for the 1990s, Such political manipulation is shown to significantly affect output in not only the famous Burns-Nixon era but also the Volcker-Reagan era. Moreover, central bank independence is shown to have relatively strengthened in the last three decades. The outcomes are robust even when the effects of government spending are controlled for. Further, we argue that it is likely that such evidence can be explained by changes in preferences of voters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Considering that estimations using non-stationary data may yield spurious results, unlike many prior STIRPAT studies, we explore integration and cointegration properties of the data and then estimate long- and short-run elastidties as well as speed of adjustment coefficients. Since our time series analysis covers only 23 observations (1990-2012), as a robustness check, we also conduct panel data analysis by pooling the mentioned countries data with that for members of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. We apply the Autoregressive Distributed Lags Bounds Testing approach in the time series analysis and Pooled Mean Group estimator in the panel analysis, both are superior in small samples. The findings from the time series analysis are supported by those from the panel data analysis. According to the results, there is cointegrated relationship among the variables. The age groups together with affluence and oil prices have statistically significant impacts on the per capita energy use in the selected countries. Moreover, we find the speed of adjustments exhibiting different magnitudes for different countries depending on which population age group is considered. The findings suggest that policymakers should pay special attention to the population age groups of 35-49 and 50-64, as they have a large effect on per capita energy use. Since these groups are the main part of the working age population, increase in their energy consumption is likely to lead to economic growth. Furthermore, the policymakers should take into consideration the finding that speed of adjustments towards an equilibrium path is quite high. It implies that any policy related shocks to the per capita energy use relationship could disappear within a year or even sooner. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We address this issue in the context of a model with two distinct groups of agents: citizens and politicians. Citizens decide the fraction of their income for which they evade taxes. Politicians decide the fraction of the public budget that they peculate. We show that multiple self-fulfilling equilibria with different levels of corruption can emerge based on the existence of strategic complementarities, indicating that corruption may corrupt. Furthermore, we find that standard deterrence policies cannot eliminate the multiplicity of equilibria. Instead, policies that impose a strong moral cost on tax evaders and corrupt politicians can lead to a unique equilibrium. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our strategy for identifying causality is based on star power effects: increases in old movie demand caused by recent success of movies with a similar cast and/or director.,"[Cabral, Luis] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Natividad, Gabriel] Univ Piura, Piura, Peru",New York University; Universidad de Piura,"Cabral, L (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",lcabral@stern.nyu.edu; gabriel.natividad@udep.pe,,"Natividad, Gabriel/0000-0001-6568-8561",,,,,24,5,6,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

In this paper, we study how individuals learn from potentially biased statistics using data from both a natural experiment and a survey experiment during a period (2007-15) when the government of Argentina was manipulating official inflation statistics. This period is interesting because attention was being given to inflation information and both official and unofficial statistics were available. Our evidence suggests that, rather than ignoring biased statistics or naively accepting them, households react in a sophisticated way, as predicted by a Bayesian learning model. We also find evidence of an asymmetric reaction to inflation signals, with expectations changing more when the inflation rate rises than when it falls. These results could also be useful for understanding the formation of inflation expectations in less extreme contexts than Argentina, such as the United States and Europe, where experts may agree that statistics are unbiased but households are not.","[Cavallo, Alberto] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Cruces, Guillermo] Univ Nacl La Plata, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National University of La Plata,"Cavallo, A (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Perez-Truglia, Ricardo/E-6791-2018","Perez-Truglia, Ricardo/0000-0002-5141-8349; Cruces, Guillermo/0000-0002-1965-5897","MIT Sloan School of Management; Center for Distributive, Labor, and Social Studies (Centro de Estudios Distributivos, Laborales, y Sociales) at the National University of La Plata School of Economics","MIT Sloan School of Management; Center for Distributive, Labor, and Social Studies (Centro de Estudios Distributivos, Laborales, y Sociales) at the National University of La Plata School of Economics","We thank the editors, Janice Eberly and James Stock, for their guidance in revising this paper.

We demonstrate the extent of temporary migrations in population movements. We show how temporariness can affect the various economic choices and how better data have improved both the measurement of nonpermanent migrations and the analyses of various aspects of migrant behavior. We propose a general theoretical framework for modeling temporary migration decisions, based on which we outline the various motives for temporariness while simultaneously reviewing related literature and available data sources.

Price-level targeting introduces a new constraint on optimal forward guidance that restricts the credible amount of overshooting. With this constraint, the zero lower bound may be binding even after the shock has abated. We characterize conditions when the commitment to hold nominal rates at zero for an extended period is optimal.

The comparison is based on a synthetic index of overall euro area monetary conditions (MCI) obtained by factor analysis, and specifically on two sub-components of the MCI, one tracking the conventional and the other the unconventional policy of the ECB. A standard monetary VAR shows that the transmission of unconventional monetary policy in the euro area is quite different: prices react more quickly, but the response of output is delayed and weaker. A block-restricted VAR is then used to measure the spillover of ECB policy abroad. The importance of euro area monetary policy for macroeconomic developments is confirmed for all six countries. A conventional monetary shock affects inflation and output in largely the same way as within the euro area. Unconventional measures have generated a variety of responses.

I would like to propose an alternative explanation, based on the work of Pierre Bourdieu, who links cultural capital to risk-taking. His concept of cultural capital has a very broad meaning, as it encompasses technical skills, aesthetic preferences, verbal facility, general cultural awareness, educational credentials, and artistic competencies. On theoretical grounds, one can assume that a high level of cultural capital enables the taming of uncertainty and allows for temporal horizons that cover longer terms. I test this hypothesis by conducting and analyzing a survey of 307 entrepreneurs. I define risk-taking in two ways: (i) in a somewhat mainstream way, on the basis of expected utility, and (ii) in a heterodox way, in a qualitative, context-dependent setting. I find that, in both cases, there seems to be a link between cultural capital and risk-taking. Furthermore, it seems to make financing issues more salient. I conclude by opening a discussion about the heterogeneity of entrepreneurs and their animal spirits.","[Laine, Michael] Bordeaux Univ, Econ, Pessac, France",,"Lainé, M (通讯作者)，Bordeaux Univ, Econ, Pessac, France.",,,,,,,,74,2,4,2,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We show that trade-related redistribution as presently constituted-modestly increases the political viability of free trade in the US. We do so by assessing the causal effect of expected redistribution associated with the US Trade Adjustment Assistance program on US Congressional voting behavior on eleven Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) between 2003 and 2011. We find that a one standard deviation increase in expected redistribution leads to an average increase in the probability of voting in favor of an FTA of 1.8 percentage points. Although this is a modest impact on average, we find significant heterogeneities; in particular, the effect is larger when a representative's constituents are more at risk or the representative faces greater re-election risk.

We use advanced estimation techniques to overcome problems of non-stationarity, omitted variables, endogeneity and reverse causality by applying fully modified OLS, panel cointegration and System GMM. Estimation results suggest that the impact of infrastructure and ICT is rather strong.

The conflict surrounds the prospect of widespread hydraulic fracturing in NB, one of Canada's Maritime provinces on the east coast of the country. The hydraulic fracturing technique, used for mining natural gas trapped in shale rock formations, has recently received much attention. The process is strongly opposed by some groups, including the Elsipogtog First Nation, primarily due to the potential environmental impacts associated with the technique. Through the application of the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution, it is found that the status quo at the time of the conflict was the most likely outcome in this conflict. The previous Conservative New Brunswick government had a great deal of power in this conflict and it had demonstrated its intention to develop the shale gas in the province in the face of much civil unrest. It is discovered, however, that there is a potential resolution to the conflict that will appease the residents of NB, if a moratorium is issued concerning hydraulic fracturing.

This is an important topic to study because an oil shock can affect a country's terms of trade which can affect its competitiveness. We detect significant exchange rate appreciation pressures in oil exporting economies after oil demand shocks. We find limited evidence that oil supply shocks affect exchange rates. Global economic demand shocks affect exchange rates in both oil exporting and importing countries, though there is no systematic pattern of appreciating and depreciating real exchange rates.

We present a simple theoretical framework that shows how a lump-sum transfer stimulates the marginal expenditures of a recipient government through an income effect and a price effect. We then test the prediction of this model using Canadian provincial data and exploit the discontinuity in the equalization grants allocation formula to identify the effects of grants. Our results indicate that the stimulative effects of lump-sum grants on spending increase with the provincial government's marginal cost of public funds (MCF). One policy implication of our results is that higher intergovernmental transfers may be welfare improving if the federal government has a lower MCF than the provinces.,"[Dahlby, Bev] Univ Calgary, Sch Publ Policy, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Dahlby, Bev] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Ferede, Ergete] MacEwan Univ, Dept Econ, 10700-104 Ave, Edmonton, AB T5J 4S2, Canada",University of Calgary; University of Calgary,"Ferede, E (通讯作者)，MacEwan Univ, Dept Econ, 10700-104 Ave, Edmonton, AB T5J 4S2, Canada.",FeredeE@macewan.ca,,,,,,,38,13,15,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We exploit Germany's 2009 tax reform, which introduced a final withholding tax on interest income with a flat rate 18 percentage points below the unchanged tax rate on income from unincorporated businesses, as a quasi-experiment.

With new methodologies and a new measure of the degree of market efficiency, we examine whether the US stock market evolves over time. In particular, a time-varying autoregressive (TV-AR) model is employed. Our main findings are: (i) the US stock market has evolved over time and the degree of market efficiency has cyclical fluctuations with a considerably long periodicity, from 30 to 40years; and (ii) the US stock market has been efficient with the exception of four times in our sample period: during the long recession of 1873-1879; the recession of 1902-1904; the New Deal era; and the recession of 1957-1958 and soon after it.

We focus specifically on rents because they can explain the drive for integration even in the absence of a positive effect on welfare. Whether they are meant to foster rent-seeking or to suppress it, the level of corruption is posited to have a positive effect on the willingness to enter into RIAs. However, empirical studies into this effect have come to contradictory conclusions. We find that corruption has a positive effect on the willingness of African countries to join trade agreements. This result remains significant when controlling for endogeneity and heteroskedasticity, as well as the indicator of corruption used. While small, the effect of corruption outperforms most economic variables. Nevertheless, distance and other geographical factors remain the strongest explanatory forces of African integration.","[Standaert, Samuel; Rayp, Glenn] Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Standaert, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Samuel.Standaert@UGent.be; Glenn.Rayp@UGent.be,"Rayp, Glenn/AAF-8330-2020","Standaert, Samuel/0000-0003-0903-8972",Research Foundation - Flanders; Belgian National Bank,Research Foundation - Flanders(FWO); Belgian National Bank,We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their feedback in addition to professors Aniruddha Dasgupta and John R.

I employ insurer-level panel data for 2005 and 2010 and adopt stochastic frontier cost and production models to overcome analytical problems encountered in previous studies. The cost frontier estimates indicate that adverse effects on efficiency are associated with aging of the insured population, soft budget constraints due to government subsidies, insurer contributions to the elder care systems, and an increase in care provider densities. A positive effect on efficiency is associated with an expansion in insurer scale. The production frontier estimates suggest that cost inefficiencies decreased by roughly 15 percent between 2005 and 2010. The correlation between cost inefficiency and technical inefficiency is not particularly strong, whereas the correlation between cost inefficiency and allocative inefficiency is strong and positive.

This paper addresses the problem of house price volatility from the perspective of investors in the real estate market and constructs a demand function by maximizing the investor's wealth utility. Combined with the price adjustment rule of excess demand of the discounted dynamic behavior of suppliers, we propose a model for heterogeneous agents in the housing market. In the model we show how heterogeneous expectation and beliefs evolution affect the house price volatility. Meanwhile, the comparative static analysis on the difference between heterogeneous expectation and the rate of beliefs evolution is provided by numerical simulation. These results show that the change of fundamentalists' expectation on the house price will influence the frequency of the house price volatility, while the change of chartists' expectation which increases with the acceleration of beliefs in evolution will influence the range of the volatility.

The CRESH index function allows for age-specific elasticities of substitution that are implied by a proper choice of CRESH parameters. The ability to generate plausible optimal age-wage profiles can be useful in, for example, calibrating demographic macroeconomic models. The CRESH analysis also provides one explanation for the well-established divergence of actual relative wages by age from the relative age-specific intensity parameters of a simple additive labour index. Moreover, CRESH labour index may explain the increasing relative wages for middle-aged workers as a result of employing larger numbers of older workers (population aging).","[Guest, Ross] Griffith Univ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Jensen, Bjarne S.] Univ Southern Denmark, Esjberg, Denmark",Griffith University; University of Southern Denmark,"Guest, R (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",r.guest@griffith.edu.au,"Jensen, Bjarne Sloth/AAE-1747-2020","Jensen, Bjarne Sloth/0000-0001-7669-0122; Guest, Ross/0000-0002-7171-3054",,,,,11,2,2,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

These countries were chosen for this research because they are the world's three largest oil consumers. The main objective of this study is to see whether these economies are still reactive to oil price movements. The results obtained suggest that the impact of oil price fluctuations on developed oil importers' GDP growth is much lower than on the GDP growth of an emerging economy. The main reasons for this lie in fuel substitution (higher use of nuclear energy, gas, and renewables), a declining population (for Japan), the shale gas revolution (for the United States), and strategic oil stocks and government-mandated energy efficiency targets in developed economies. All of these factors make developed economies more resistant to oil shocks. On the other hand, the impact of oil price movements on the PRC's inflation rate was found to be milder than in the two developed countries that were examined. The main cause for this is that the PRC experiences a larger forward shift in its aggregate supply due to higher growth, which allows it to avoid a massive increase in price levels following oil price shocks.","[Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farhad] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Yoshino, Naoyuki] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Abadi, Majid Mohammadi Hossein; Farboudmanesh, Rosa] Minist Petr IR Iran, Inst Int Energy Studies, Tehran, Iran",Keio University,"Taghizadeh-Hesary, F (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",farhadth@gmail.com,"Farboudmanesh, Rosa/JDN-0087-2023; Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farhad/R-5136-2018","Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farhad/0000-0001-5446-7093; Yoshino, Naoyuki/0000-0001-8060-5314",,,,,8,45,45,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

We present a simple behavioral 2-type heuristics switching model explaining individual as well as aggregate behavior in the experiment. Based on relative performance, agents switch between a simple trend following and an anchor and adjustment heuristic that differ in how much weight is given to the long run average price level. The nonlinear switching model exhibits path dependence through co-existence of a locally stable fundamental steady state and a stable (quasi-)periodic orbit, created via a so-called Chenciner bifurcation. Depending on initial states, agents coordinate individual expectations either on a stable fundamental steady state path or on almost self-fulfilling persistent price fluctuations around the fundamental steady state.

Our analysis demonstrates the importance of matching the terms of the job contract to the technology. Such issues would be especially important in service industries and in the knowledge-based economy where discretionary effort tends to play a greater role. We show that the production technology needs to be characterized by at least two parameters: one parameter which measures output independent of the worker's effort and a second parameter which measures the effect of the effort. We solve for the Renegotiation-Proof Nash Equilibrium. We show that there can be a tension between increasing expected productivity and controlling costs per worker. Our analysis also adds to the growing interest in operational risk, which is associated with human actions. The closed form solutions provided by our model provide a natural way to consider the impact and possibility of this type of risk. Our analysis demonstrates why the effect of a negative event should be considered relative to a concept of normal which is based on an equilibrium, that uncertainty in the external environment enables (but does not cause) operational risk events and that both the equilibrium and the effects vary with the production technology.","[Anglin, Paul] Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Gao, Yanmin] City Univ Hong Kong, Coll Business, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Guelph; City University of Hong Kong,"Anglin, P (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",panglin@uoguelph.ca; yanmigao@cityu.edu.hk,,,City University of Hong Kong,City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong),"This paper has benefited from discussions with Tom Ross, Xiaopeng Yin, Kam Yu, seminar audiences at the University of Alberta, University of British Columbia, University of California- Los Angeles, University of Illinois- Urbana Champaign, Peking University, University of Toronto, the CAAA Annual Conference, the Canadian Economics Association Annual Meeting and the AAA FARS Midyear Conference and the comments of two referees.

It also investigates whether the effects of the programme are heterogeneous across different farm types using the propensity score matching technique to address the self-selection bias in the farm-level data set. We found that the programme enhanced the economic performance less than hoped for. Overall, the programme was estimated to improve the net direct farm income for participating farms by $ 175.12-$ 194.82 per hectare. Taking into account the heterogeneous effects of the programme across farm types, we calculated that the greatest effects may be realized by farmers within the small farms subsample, at $ 404.41-$ 439.85 per hectare, but only $ 139.80-$ 213.36 per hectare for midsize farms, and $ 138.82-$ 173.34 per hectare for large farms. With regard to the economic viability of the programme, we discovered that it had an insignificant effect on farm modernization investment initiatives. Thus, future strategies incorporated into the programme that better control increases in production costs, improve small farmers' access to the programme and require participating farms to spend a portion of the money received on farm modernization may improve long-run benefits of the programme.","[Attavanich, W.] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Bangkok, Thailand",Kasetsart University,"Attavanich, W (通讯作者)，Kasetsart Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Bangkok, Thailand.",attavanich.witsanu@gmail.com,"Attavanich, Witsanu/ABC-5376-2021","Attavanich, Witsanu/0000-0003-1502-5406","Department of Economics, Faculty of Economics, Kasetsart University [23/2014]; Thailand Research Fund [RDG5720017]","Department of Economics, Faculty of Economics, Kasetsart University; Thailand Research Fund(Thailand Research Fund (TRF))","This work was supported by the Department of Economics, Faculty of Economics, Kasetsart University [grant number 23/2014] and the Thailand Research Fund [grant number RDG5720017].",,29,8,8,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

As in the US dollars or war-of-attrition, players in penny auctions commit higher non-refundable costs as the auction continues and only win if all other players stop bidding. I first show that, in any equilibria that does not end immediately, players bid probabilistically such that the expected profit from every bid is zero. Then, using two large data sets covering 166,000 auctions, I calculate that average profit margins actually exceed 50%. To explain this deviation, I incorporate a sunk-cost fallacy into the theoretical model to generate a set of predictions about hazard rates and player behaviour, which I confirm empirically. While players do (slowly) learn to correct this bias and there are few obvious barriers to competition, activity in the market is rising and concentration remains relatively high.","[Augenblick, Ned] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,,,,,George P.

Examination of this relationship has only begun to be explored. Using a tailored representative survey of 1,354 immigrants in the Greater Dublin Area, Ireland, we find a positive and significant relationship between risk aversion and migrant remittances. Risk-averse individuals are more likely to send remittances home and are, on average, likely to remit a higher amount, after controlling for a broad range of individual and group characteristics. The evidence we obtain, that more remittances are sent by riskaverse immigrants who face higher wage risks and to individuals with more financial resources, is consistent with self-insurance although we cannot, with our data, rule out other exchange motives.","[Batista, Catia] Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal; [Batista, Catia] Univ Nova Lisboa, NOVAFRICA, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal; [Umblijs, Janis] Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, Oslo, Norway",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Batista, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal.;Batista, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, NOVAFRICA, P-1200 Lisbon, Portugal.;Umblijs, J (通讯作者)，Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, Oslo, Norway.",catia.batista@novasbe.pt; janis.umblijs@frisch.uio.no,,"Batista, Catia/0000-0001-9057-0397",Irish Research Council (IRC); Trinity College Dublin; Nova Forum at the Nova School of Business and Economics; EU NORFACE Programme on International Migration,"Irish Research Council (IRC)(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); Trinity College Dublin; Nova Forum at the Nova School of Business and Economics; EU NORFACE Programme on International Migration","This work was supported by the Irish Research Council (IRC), Trinity College Dublin, and Nova Forum at the Nova School of Business and Economics.

During the first phase, the default probability is estimated using both methods separately, and subsequently, the default probability of the structural model is integrated at each point in time in the non-structural model as an additional explanatory variable. The appeal of the hybrid model allows the default probability to be continuously updated by integrating market information via the probabilities of default extracted from the structural model. Our results indicate that default probabilities extracted from the structural model contribute significantly in explaining default risk when included in a hybrid model with accounting variables.

The Treaty on European Union (the Maastricht Treaty) adjusts the convergence criteria, which the candidate country has to fulfil if it wants to join the Eurozone. These five economic criteria assess the suitability of applicant countries for the membership and they are evaluated every year in the Convergence Report. On the other hand, the OCA index is based on the optimum currency area theory and its criteria. This index includes variables that are important in deciding the country's entry into the monetary union. In this case, the OCA index is computed by using a panel regression method, while the original equation of Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1997), who estimated the OCA index first, is used.

We review some recent work studying identification in a broad class of such models. This work shows that the parametric functional forms and distributional assumptions commonly used for estimation are not essential for identification. Rather, identification relies primarily on the standard requirement that instruments be available for the endogenous variables-here, typically, prices and quantities. We discuss the types of instruments that can suffice, as well as how instrumental variables requirements can be relaxed by the availability of individual-level data or through restrictions on preferences. We also review new results on discrimination between alternative models of oligopoly competition. Together, these results reveal a strong nonparametric foundation for a broad applied literature, provide practical guidance for applied work, and may suggest new approaches to estimation and testing.","[Berry, Steven] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University; Yale University,"Berry, S (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",steven.berry@yale.edu; philip.haile@yale.edu,"Berry, Steven/AAD-9621-2021",,,,,,80,27,44,0,24,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4608-9,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

One such technology is lecture capture, which allows a live lecture to be recorded and packaged with classroom media and delivered online to many more students than a traditional face-to-face class. This article studies the selection process and educational outcome differences between students enrolled in a lecture capture and a face-to-face course in economic principles. Students could select either course format, both with the same instructor and course requirements, without capacity restrictions. We find that students' attitudes toward online learning are the chief determinant of their choice of class over demographics, opportunity cost measures, or past online experiences. Additionally, our findings suggest that lecture capture students perform as well as those who take a face-to-face course when not accounting for self-selection. When selection is taken into account, lecture capture is not significantly worse than face-to-face.","[Bosshardt, William] Florida Atlantic Univ, Ctr Econ Educ, Dept Econ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Chiang, Eric P.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Econ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University,"Bosshardt, W (通讯作者)，Florida Atlantic Univ, Ctr Econ Educ, Dept Econ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",wbosshar@fau.edu; chiang@fau.edu,,,FAU College of Business Summer Research Grant,FAU College of Business Summer Research Grant,"We thank the editor (Laura Razzolini) and two referees, as well as John Siegfried, Jack Hou, Michael Watts, Michael Salemi, Abdullah Al-Bahrani, and Kristen Collett-Schmitt for valuable comments on earlier drafts.

The purpose of this paper is to develop an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy ELECTRE (IVIF-ELECTRE) method and apply it to multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) involving the multiple criteria evaluation/selection of alternatives. Using interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) sets with an inclusion comparison approach, concordance and discordance sets are identified for each pair of alternatives. Next, concordance and discordance indices are determined using an aggregate importance weight score function and a generalised distance measurement between weighted evaluative ratings, respectively. Based on the concordance and discordance dominance matrices, two IVIF-ELECTRE ranking procedures are developed for the partial and complete ranking of the alternatives. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods are illustrated with a multiple criteria decision-making problem of watershed site selection. A comparative analysis of other MCDA methods is conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed IVIF-ELECTRE methods. Finally, an empirical study of job choices is implemented to validate the effectiveness of the current methods in the real world.","[Chen, Ting-Yu] Chang Gung Univ 259, Grad Inst Business & Management, Dept Ind & Business Management, Coll Management, Wen Hwa 1st Rd, Taoyuan 333, Taiwan",,"Chen, TY (通讯作者)，Chang Gung Univ 259, Grad Inst Business & Management, Dept Ind & Business Management, Coll Management, Wen Hwa 1st Rd, Taoyuan 333, Taiwan.",tychen@mail.cgu.edu.tw,", Ting-Yu/AAC-7043-2019",", Ting-Yu/0000-0002-2171-4139",Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 102-2410-H-182-013-MY3]; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital [BMRP 574],Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital(Chang Gung Memorial Hospital),"The author is very grateful to the respected editor and the anonymous referees for their insightful and constructive comments, which helped to improve the overall quality of the paper.

The results are compared with those obtained within the well-known exogenous growth framework. In both cases, pay-as-you-go social security enhances welfare if the growth rate is larger than the interest rate at the laissez-faire. However, with endogenous growth, pay-as-you-go social security may also increase welfare even if the growth rate of the economy is less than the interest rate. Education subsidies have an ambiguous impact because they simultaneously transfer resources across generations and change the relative price of investing in human capital. Overall, the paper shows the existence of important non-monotonicities associated with the welfare effects of modifying the tax parameters in an endogenous growth framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It does this by institutionalising both the incentives and means for countries to enhance their performance in these areas.

Accordingly, effects of business service offshoring are completely different and more diverse than those of material offshoring, with the effects inter alia depending on whether triggered by trade integration or ICT.","[Dluhosch, Barbara] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Univ FAF Hamburg, Dept Econ, Hamburg, Germany; [Hens, Thorsten] Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hens, Thorsten] NHH, Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway",Helmut Schmidt University; University of Zurich; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Hens, T (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, Zurich, Switzerland.;Hens, T (通讯作者)，NHH, Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway.",thorsten.hens@bf.uzh.ch,,"Hens, Thorsten/0000-0002-0266-1561; Dluhosch, Barbara/0000-0003-3419-0415",,,,,49,4,4,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Crisis in Republic of Croatia is the result of a local version of the crisis, because before global crisis Croatia had problems with high rate of unemployment and public debt. Because of all this, it is necessary to make an economic turnaround and create strategies that will change the present situation. However, it is impossible to talk about strategy, without analysis of competitive advantage. Strategy is set of activities that enterprise should implement in order to achieve its objectives. The goal of any enterprise is a success, and achieving of competitive advantage. It is necessary to create a meaningful strategy for enterprise, which should be aligned with corporate objectives. Often, enterprises create a strategy just because others have it, but in reality do not operate in accordance to strategy. Croatia has 21 counties (20 counties and the city of Zagreb, which has the status of a county). Brodsko posavska county (BPC) is one of the least developed regions in the Republic of Croatia. It is characterized by: one of the highest rates of unemployment, low share of investment, a small number of successful enterprises, small share of GDP, etc. Historically, this county had highly developed industry: metal processing industry, agriculture and wood industry. However, these industries have been destroyed due to badly conducted privatization, which is not yet completed. At the national level, the manufacturing industry is one of most developed with production increment of 7-8%, as well as growth of exports. The aim of this paper is to analyze the structure of enterprises in the manufacturing industry in the BPC, sector C according to NKD (NKD - National Classification of Activities). The aim is to analyze the enterprises according to each sub-sector, size of enterprise, number of employees, business performance, in order to see the impact on the economy. The research is conducted by a survey based on the analysis of financial ratios of 20 enterprises in manufacturing industry in 2015 in the BPC.","[Duspara, Lena; Knezevic, Sanja] Veleuciliste Slavonskom Brodu, Dr Mile Budaka 1, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia; [Duspara, Miroslav] Strojarski Fak Slavonskom Brodu, Trg Ivane Brlic Mazuranic 2, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia",University of Slavonski Brod; University of Slavonski Brod,"Duspara, L (通讯作者)，Veleuciliste Slavonskom Brodu, Dr Mile Budaka 1, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia.",lena.duspara@vusb.hr; sanja.knezevic@vusb.hr; miroslav.duspara@sfsb.hr,"Knezevic Kusljic, Sanja/ABB-6174-2021","Knezevic Kusljic, Sanja/0000-0003-1298-4281",,,,,2,2,2,1,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,155,162,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600014,0

We find evidence of substantial deviations from the law of one price - product price differences between the cities averaged 76% over the period - a result that is consistent with the presence of large barriers to trade in the continent. Mean price differences across cities fell by close to a quarter over the period, but the decline was concentrated in the early 1990s with little progress subsequently, despite the regional trade policies implemented by the countries. Gravity-style estimates reveal that reductions in external tariffs and global trends towards price convergence in the early 1990s are the key contributors to the trend in price integration amongst the African cities.","[Edwards, Lawrence] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Rankin, Neil] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa",University of Cape Town; Stellenbosch University,"Edwards, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",Lawrence.Edwards@uct.ac.za,"Edwards, R.

This paper first presents the impacting mechanisms of the joint-stock reform of commercial banks on the effectiveness of monetary policy and then constructs an empirical model to test those impacts.

We accomplished this by combining the internal input variables (e.g., market value and return') with exogenous variables (e.g., interest income', depreciation', cost of goods', employees' and net sales') into a Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) model. The TE of the PSI-20 (Portuguese Stock Index) was estimated using factors that affect efficiency variability. The main advantage of using the SFA approach is its potential to discriminate between measurement error and systematic inefficiencies in the estimation process. The results demonstrated that TE is higher for enterprises in the industrial, construction and distribution sectors, whereas the commercial banking sector has the lowest TE scores.

Federal government officials noted a wide variety of impacts that the shutdown had on economic activity, including a reduction in the admission fees collected by the National Park Service and losses of visitor spending in 'gateway communities' located near national parks and monuments. This article examines the effects of the October 2013 federal government shutdown on Acadia National Park's gateway community of Bar Harbor, Maine. Regression results show that the 16-day shutdown is associated with a 76% reduction in Acadia visitation in October 2013 and a 13% reduction in tourism-related sales. This suggests that an estimated 17% of the potential visitors impacted by the Acadia closure cancelled their trips to Bar Harbor.

The values of the industrial heritage of the metal giant from Slavonski Brod, founded on February 17, 1921 under the name First Southern Slave Wagon, Machine and Bridge Works Ltd. Brod n/S, have potential but are exposed to a number of factors that affect its endangerment and slow but immanent disappearance. The concept of industrial heritage includes artefacts of human labour and ingenuity that in our history have the same significance as religious or other artefacts that has so far been paid much more attention. In addition, it is not only applied to the period of the industrial revolution until today, but it exists in all the phases of the development of human civilization. Council of the European Union declared 2015 the year of the European industrial and technical heritage (European Industrial and Technical Heritage Year 2015), based on the resolution adopted in March 2013. The industrial heritage cannot be seen only as a subject of economic activity, but it became a part of the scientific and professional research and again, as amended, subject to new and different economic activities. The issue of sustainable conservation of industrial heritage is complex, and as the biggest obstacles, we see an unfavourable economic situation that discourages firms to invest funds in this form of investment, lack of recognition of industrial heritage as an opportunity, dispersion of material and general lack of organization and lack of concern especially in eastern Croatia. Industrial heritage is more seriously discussed only in the last thirty years or so in the world, and in Croatia just for the last fifteen years and covers small number of sites or industries while Eastern Croatia is in this perspective also least developed region. Activation of these resources could encourage new economic activities to raise awareness of the importance of industrial heritage and contribute to the tourist offer of selected number of sites. The crucial goal is to formulate an economically reasonable model for sustainable conservation of the industrial heritage of the Eastern Croatian metal industry on the example of Duro Dakovic industry from Slavonski Brod.","[Galzina, Vjekoslav; Matanovic, Damir; Kolar, Emina Berbic] Univ Josip Juraj Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Educ, Cara Hadrijana 10, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Galzina, Vjekoslav; Matanovic, Damir; Kolar, Emina Berbic] Gunduliceva 20, Slavonski Brod, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Galzina, V (通讯作者)，Univ Josip Juraj Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Educ, Cara Hadrijana 10, Osijek 31000, Croatia.;Galzina, V (通讯作者)，Gunduliceva 20, Slavonski Brod, Croatia.",vgalzina@foozos.hr; dmatanovic@foozos.hr; eberbic@foozos.hr,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,6,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,24,30,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600001,0

An analysis of the number of active entrepreneurial units was done by means of internal sources of Czech Statistical Office, which are not available to the public and can shed light on the recent trend in Czech business. Comparative analysis and trend analysis were used to monitor individual regions at the CZ-NUTS 2, CZ-NUTS 3 levels, or at the district level as for the number of established and closed businesses and by means of net balance and the average annual rate of growth regions with the highest business activity were determined. The main conclusions suggest that the number of entrepreneurial units in the Czech Republic grows annually on average by 20 per cent. The region the Capital City of Prague differs from the other regions as the average annual growth rate is 28.5 per cent. During the monitored period the number of entrepreneurial units in several districts even decreased. It is important to highlight these discrepancies and to recommend how to prevent these decreases from happening.","[Hamplova, Eva; Kovarnik, Jaroslav] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Econ, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Hamplová, E (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Econ, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic.",eva.hamplova@uhk.cz; jaroslav.kovarnik@uhk.cz,"Hamplova, Eva/N-8218-2017","Hamplova, Eva/0000-0002-4314-873X",,,,,9,6,6,0,3,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,226,232,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-28,0.0,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500029,0

As in the one-sector model, on-the-job search generates wage dispersion among homogeneous workers. The analysis of the two-sector model uncovers a property called constant tension that is responsible for analytical tractability. We characterize the steady state in all cases with constant tension. When time discounting vanishes, constant tension yields the endogenous separation rate in each sector as a linear function of the present value for a worker. The one-sector economy automatically satisfies constant tension, in which case the linear separation rate implies that equilibrium offers of the worker value are uniformly distributed. Constant tension also has strong predictions for worker transitions and value wage dispersion, both within a sector and between the two sectors. When constant tension does not hold, we compute the steady state numerically and illustrate its properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We address the question for five different measures of leverage-household leverage, nonfinancial firm leverage, commercial bank leverage, broker-dealer leverage, and shadow bank leverage-making a distinction between traditional banks and shadow banks, the latter being a consequence of financial innovation and deregulation in the financial services industry over the past 30 years. We investigate whether the relationship between leverage and the level of economic activity is nonlinear and asymmetric using slope-based tests as well as tests of the null hypothesis of symmetric impulse responses. Our results inform policymakers about the important distinction between traditional banks and the market-based financial intermediaries that have been at the center of the global financial crisis of 2007-2009.

The calibrated model is able to generate reasonable predictions for net tax rates, the corruption associated with public investment projects, and the negative correlation between corruption and tax revenue. The presence of corruption and evasion is shown to have significant, but not large, negative effects on economic growth. The relatively moderate effects help explain the absence of a robust negative correlation between growth and corruption in cross-country data.

Entrepreneurial attitude orientation consists of innovation, personal control, self-esteem and achievement. Strategic thinking capability refers to the ability to use: reframing, reflecting, and system thinking. We start from the idea that strategic thinking capability largely influences entrepreneurial attitude orientation. The aim of the study is to show that by improving the strategic thinking process it is possible to improve the entrepreneurial attitude orientation and therefore improve the level of entrepreneurial activity in general. Assuming that strategic thinking capability depends not only on innate individual characteristics, but also on acquired knowledge and competencies, it seems that entrepreneurial orientation could be improved through an appropriate selection of education and training programs. The study sample comprised five important industries in the Republic of Croatia (n= 286). The results demonstrate that strategic thinking capability explains 14% of the variances in entrepreneurial attitude orientation. The three strategic thinking capability dimensions were significantly related to attitudes regarding achievement and change and personal control. However, one dimension, system thinking, seems to explain the largest part of the variance. We concluded that strategic thinking capability and entrepreneurial attitude orientation are not just linked but rather interrelated in a variety of ways. This finding is important for the entrepreneurial development since attitudes appear to be responsive to education and training policies. Hence, an emphasis on improving strategic thinking capability could lead to stronger entrepreneurial attitude orientation.","[Jelenc, Lara; Ivancic, Valentina] Fac Econ Rijeka, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia; [Pisapia, John] Florida Atlantic Univ, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",University of Rijeka; State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University,"Jelenc, L (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Rijeka, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",ljelenc@efri.hr; jpisapia@fau.edu; vivancic@efri.hr,"Jelenc, Lara/AAH-4801-2019; Jelenc, Lara/S-3323-2018; Ivančić, Valentina/AAP-9824-2021","Jelenc, Lara/0000-0002-7052-6206; Jelenc, Lara/0000-0002-7052-6206;",,,,,39,0,0,2,5,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,207,215,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600020,0

It rests on the theoretical model of Bhaduri and Marglin (1990) to see if an increase in the labor income share has a sufficient positive effect on consumption to offset a negative effect on investment and export demand. In order to investigate the question empirically we adopt and develop the approach of Stockhammer, Onaran, and Ederer (2009). Several measures of the labor income share are calculated to take into account the fact that wage labor represents only half of the total labor force and check the robustness of our results. We also introduce a new treatment of external trade to better integrate the price competitiveness of Thailand. The econometric investigation shows that the growth regime is profit-led over the period 1970-2011, which shows that rebalancing the Thai economy will be difficult and requires an overall change of strategy going beyond a simple prolabor policy.","[Jetin, Bruno] Univ Brunei Darussalam, Gadong, Brunei; [Jetin, Bruno; Kurt, Ozan Ekin] Univ Paris 13, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France",University Brunei Darussalam; Universite Paris 13,"Jetin, B (通讯作者)，Univ Brunei Darussalam, Gadong, Brunei.;Jetin, B (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France.",,"Jetin, Bruno/GXW-1017-2022; Kurt, Ozan Ekin/IZQ-0289-2023","Kurt, Ozan Ekin/0000-0003-4943-5681; Jetin, Bruno/0000-0002-1354-5291",,,,,37,9,9,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Due to these social costs, policymakers are increasingly trying to understand the determinants of consumer payment choices as documented by the European Central Bank's regular publications. This article contributes to this understanding by investigating the role of perceived risk. Based on an original survey of French consumers, we measure the effects of perceived risk on the decisions to hold and use the main retail payment instruments: cash, card and cheque. We point to the sequential dependence of the decisions to hold and use a payment instrument, and study jointly both decisions. The bivariate analysis based on risk factors shows that unavailability risk and time risk have the greatest transverse influence on holding and using payment instruments. Our results, robust to controlling for consumer characteristics, confirm their propensity for a quickto-use and constantly available payment instrument. We discuss the relevance of our results for policy making purposes.","[Karoubi, Bruno] Univ Paris Est Creteil, ERUDITE, Paris, France; [Chenavaz, Regis] CNRS & EHESS, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, KEDGE Business Sch, Marseille, France; [Paraschiv, Corina] Paris Descartes Univ, CEDAG, Paris, France; [Paraschiv, Corina] IUF, Paris, France",Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Kedge Business School; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Universite Paris Cite,"Chenavaz, R (通讯作者)，CNRS & EHESS, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, KEDGE Business Sch, Marseille, France.",regis.chenavaz@kedgebs.com,"; Chenavaz, Regis Y./T-1210-2017","Paraschiv, Corina/0000-0001-8762-9482; Karoubi, Bruno/0000-0001-8866-3260; Chenavaz, Regis Y./0000-0002-5911-2045",,,,,59,8,8,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article deals with the analysis of foreign trade development since 2000, because export and import of goods and services are crucial for sustainable development for almost all countries around the world, and it is also part of GDP formula in every open economy. The aim is to analyse the development of foreign trade in Visegrad Four contries and verify whether this development is similar or not. In all analysed countries, significant increase in the terms of export of goods and services has been observed. However, the analysis of export of services shows relatively unexpected development, where the share of this export on total export have been decreasing in all analysed countries. Moreover, one of the basic indicators for evaluation of foreign trade is the export / import ratio, where this indicator describes the ability of the country to cover its import needs by its own export. The analysis shows that even all analysed countries have this share currently over 100%, the development is far from steady. This irregularity of development can be understand as a proof that the export has only autonomous part in GDP formula, while import has autonomous and indigenous parts.","[Kovarnik, Jaroslav; Hamplova, Eva] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Econ, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Kovárník, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Econ, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic.",jaroslav.kovarnik@uhk.cz; eva.hamplova@uhk.cz,"Hamplova, Eva/N-8218-2017","Hamplova, Eva/0000-0002-4314-873X",,,,,12,7,7,1,5,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,240,246,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-30,0.0,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500031,0

Thus, the estate of Friedrich Habsburg went to Kingdom of SHS, and later to Yugoslavia. The provisions of the Trianon Agreement, signed between Hungary and the Triple Entente, stoped the Serbian occupation of Baranja (until Pecs) and Baranja is divided into two parts, northern, which remains part of Hungary and south, assigned to Kingdom of SHS. Consequently, comes to casualties of estates that are lying on the boundary line established by paragraph 27 of the Trianon contract.

Furthermore, by signing of the Trianon peace treaty, Baranja, by then a single entity, was divided into two parts, so the authors are explaining the legal status of Baranja, originally designated by administrative organization in 1922, then the division of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in, banovine 1929 and finally incorporation of the territory of Baranja in the composition of the Republic of Croatia after 1991.

In addition, the natural and heritage-related resources for leisure tourism are limited and not reproducible. This notion has a significant implication for the relationship between the growth effects of leisure tourism and the level of economic development. Thus, the current study focuses on leisure tourism and controls for the effects of business tourism. As an economy grows, the growth effects of leisure tourism are expected to diminish due to a lack of continued productivity improvement in the tourism industry.

A company has to pay for using capital especially in two forms, i.e. in the form of interests (for debts) and dividends (for use of equity). The costs determine the size of profit or loss of the company. That is why all the companies try to minimize the costs paid for using the capital. There are several possibilities to optimize the capital structure. This contribution uses WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital). It really focuses on the two parts of capital debt and equity. We know the price for using debt and equity. However, the rate of equity and rate of debt change according to the size of the company's debt. The general truth is that if debt grows the rate of debt grows and rate of equity also grows. The investors suppose higher profit for higher risk. On the other hand, it is necessary to point out that the relation of the development of debt, rate of debt and rate of equity is not linear. The main objective of the paper is to predict the rate of debt and rate of equity according to the proportion of debt in the case of a specific company. The artificial neural networks are used for setting a regression model, concretely multi-layer perceptron neural networks and radial basis function neural networks. The results are in the shape of two curves. In both cases the independent value is the size of debt. The independent values are rate of debt and rate of equity.","[Petrach, Filip] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Branisovska 1645-31a, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Vochozka, Marek] Insitute Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Okruzni 10, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Vochozka, M (通讯作者)，Insitute Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Okruzni 10, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",petrach@ef.jcu.cz; vochozka@mail.vstecb.cz,"Petrach, Filip/JEJ-7219-2023; Vochozka, Marek/L-3154-2019","Vochozka, Marek/0000-0001-9923-7814",,,,,18,4,4,0,10,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1696,1703,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800210,0

The analysis was based on the data from Central Statistical Office of Poland. It was assumed that the phenomenon of socio-economic sustainability at regional level should be considered as a multivariate latent variable. As a result, it was measured with application of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The proposed model was based on eight observable variables that are often pointed in the literature as measures of socio-economic development and human welfare. Application of SEM model allowed to verify the usefulness of the observable variables for analysis of the phenomenon of sustainable development in Poland at regional level. The conducted research confirmed serious disparities at regional level in the sphere of socio-economic sustainability that must be the subject of special interest and counteractions of Polish government.","[Pietrzak, Michal Bernard] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Econometr & Stat, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Balcerzak, Adam P.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Econ, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Pietrzak, MB (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Econometr & Stat, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",michal.pietrzak@umk.pl; adam.balcerzak@umk.pl,"Balcerzak, Adam/D-7224-2016; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/I-4919-2014","Balcerzak, Adam/0000-0003-0352-1373; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/0000-0002-9263-4478",,,,,27,16,16,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1704,+,,,,,,4,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800211,0

In doing so, we distinguish between two different types of scientific institutions: universities and governmental research institutes. For the econometric analyses, we use data from the German Community Innovation Survey. In total, data from up to 560 German service and manufacturing firms are available for the difference-in-difference analyses.

Many countries use creative and cultural industries to stimulate economic development and to strengthen competitiveness. World trade in goods and services in the frame of creative and cultural industries has recorded a steady growth. The highest growth rates of creative and cultural industries were registered in developing countries, as opposed to the transition countries where growth rates were very low. The Croatian Cluster Competitiveness of Creative and Cultural Industries was formed in 2013, based on the initiative of the Ministry of Economy of Croatia. Creative and cultural industries in Croatia were formed according to the principle of the Quadruple Helix model - economy, public administration, academic research institutions and civil society. Creative and cultural industries are based on knowledge, ideas and skills that affect innovation and competitiveness by using new technologies. During the last two decades, restructuring processes in connection with liberalization and privatization took place in the global energy sector, with the implementation of the policy of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, primarily by increasing energy efficiency and the share of renewables in electricity production. Modern energetics is faced with new challenges related to economic, social and environmental impacts on the sustainable quality of life. Nowadays, the principles of creative and cultural industries are used in all industry sectors, including the energy sector - which is of utmost importance for a society.

We argue that this relationship between risk aversion and bargaining toughness is both highly fragile, and more nuanced than previously articulated. In the Nash and Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining frameworks, we establish that when a bargainer is compared with a second who is almost globally more risk averse than the first, the supposedly immutable relationship between bargaining effectiveness and risk aversion evaporates. Specifically, we identify an upper-hemicontinuity failure of a correspondence which maps the power set of all lotteries to those utility pairs that satisfy our almost global comparative risk aversion relation on these subsets. We trace the consensus view that tougher bargainers are less risk-averse to an exclusive focus on precisely the point at which this correspondence implodes. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The study aims to contribute to the literature by connecting these theories and provides the following main conclusions. First, the LTF incorporates aspects of the FIH, as the theories share several key elements, particularly the presence of fundamental uncertainty, the constraint of liquidity, and the necessity for governments to act as lenders of last resort. Second, the liquidity concept used in the LTF can be better comprehended with the use of Keynesian and post Keynesian literature on the topic. Third, the LTF aims to advance and update certain aspects of Minsky's theory, particularly with regard to the globalization of markets, power relations, and the interdependencies of the political economy of finance. The study concludes that the theories are more complementary than divergent and future studies should create an analytical framework that integrates the theories' most insightful aspects.","[Reis, Marcos] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Vasconcelos, Daniel] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Econ & Int Affairs, Econ, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),"Reis, M (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,,"de Santana Vasconcelos, Daniel/0000-0001-9569-2991",,,,,44,2,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Setting prices according to individual valuations, however, generates adverse consumer reaction unless consumers are invited to participate in the price-formation process. Consumer perceptions of price fairness are key to the sustainability of any discriminatory pricing regime. Perceptions of price fairness, in turn, are hypothesized to be shaped by self-interested inequity aversion in which prices tend to be regarded as unfair, and purchase probabilities fall, if others are perceived to pay a lower price, while prices tend to be regarded as more fair, and consumers more likely to purchase, if inequity is in the buyers favor. Our experimental data also shows that the implications of inequity aversion for sellers can be at least partially reversed if consumers are allowed to participate in the price-formation process by negotiating the price they pay. The primary implication of our findings is that, in order to be viable, any system of discriminatory pricing for consumer goods should invite consumers to have a stake in the price they pay. Such participatory pricing may provide one way out of the current trap of Hi-Lo, or promotional, pricing that neither retailers nor manufacturers regard as sustainable.

In most countries, the costs of electricity distribution operators are regulated by the government. However, the cost regulation may create adverse incentives to compromise the quality of service. To avoid this, cost regulation is often amended with quality incentives. This study applies theory and methods of productivity analysis to model the frontier of service quality. A semi-nonparametric estimation method is developed, which does not assume any particular functional form for the quality frontier, but can accommodate stochastic noise and heteroscedasticity. The empirical part of our paper examines how underground cabling and location affect the interruption costs. As expected, higher proportion of underground cabling decreases the level of interruption costs. The effects of cabling and location on the variance of performance are also considered. Especially the location is found to be a significant source of heteroscedasticity in the interruption costs. Finally, the proposed quality frontier benchmark is compared to the current practice of Finnish regulation system. The proposed quality frontier is found to provide more meaningful and stable basis for setting quality targets than the average practice benchmarks currently in use. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The increasing emphasis on NIE is reflected in a wide range of works by international financial institutions and scholars. However, the NIE approach retains fundamental limitations due to its narrow interpretation of institutions, its over-reliance on analysis of transactions costs and property rights, and its ahistorical attachment to markets and private sector firms as major engines of development. Furthermore, NIE typically fails to look inside institutions to identify the complex cultural factors that shape the interests and behaviors of the members of institutions. This paper engages in a critique of NIE analysis of Sub-Saharan Africa's economic development, and suggests the need for a nuanced analysis of property rights and culture, along with development programs to address inequality and poverty and to foster state-led development.","[Schneider, Geoffrey; Nega, Berhanu] Bucknell Univ, Econ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA",Bucknell University,"Schneider, G (通讯作者)，Bucknell Univ, Econ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA.",,"Schneider, Geoffrey/ABB-6945-2021",,,,,,24,10,13,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

However, in standard two-sector models with staggered nondurable goods prices and flexible durable goods prices, consumption of durables rises whereas that of nondurables falls in response to a contractionary policy shock. To resolve this co-movement problem, I extend the model to include a realistic financial friction that firms must pay for their productive inputs prior to production, i.e., working capital, along with habit formation in nondurable goods consumption. Following a positive interest rate shock, the working capital channel raises production costs, thereby discouraging production of both durable and nondurable goods. Furthermore, habit formation induces households to smooth the growth rate of nondurable goods consumption, and hence mitigates the fall in the nondurable goods sector. The model solves the co-movement problem and successfully generates a more sensitive response in the durable goods sector, as observed in the data.","[Tsai, Yi-Chan] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei 100, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Tsai, YC (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, 21 Hsu Chow Rd, Taipei 100, Taiwan.",yichantsai@ntu.edu.tw,"Tsai, Yi-Chan/R-1839-2019","Tsai, Yi-Chan/0000-0002-8803-244X",Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation,Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation,"I would like to thank two anonymous referees, Bill Dupor, Aubhik Khan, Julia Thomas, Paul Evans, Masao Ogaki, Nan Li, Yuko Imura, Jang-Ting Guo, and seminar participants at 2009 MEA Meeting, 4th Annual Dynare Conference, Ohio State University, Cleveland State University, and University of California, Riverside for helpful discussions and comments.

An important impediment has been the lack of comparable data. To a large extent, this study remedies the shortcomings of earlier studies. Our contribution is twofold. First, the current higher education policy of contraction and economizing, common to most European countries, make knowledge of potential efficiency gains crucial. Second, a unique database allows us to study a broad diversity of organizations as well as organizations located in a number of different European countries. The study suggests evaluating higher education institution (HEI) performance in a production theory context, applying the well-known data envelopment analysis (DEA) method to a cross section of 944 HEIs in 17 European countries. The DEA approach is particularly suitable in this context where little is known about production technologies and economic behaviour of the HEIs. On average, provision of education is found to be most efficient in the Slovak Republic followed by Belgium and Latvia, while Denmark and Norway display the lowest efficiency. The study also indicates a positive relation between efficiency and HEI size and efficiency and research intensity. Furthermore, the study points to the importance of continued data collection.","[Veiderpass, Ann] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [McKelvey, Maureen] Univ Gothenburg, Inst Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Dept Econ & Soc, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg; University of Gothenburg,"Veiderpass, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden.",Ann.Veiderpass@economics.gu.se,,,Sten A Olsson Foundation for Research and Culture,Sten A Olsson Foundation for Research and Culture,We acknowledge and thank the Sten A Olsson Foundation for Research and Culture for supporting this research.,,41,15,15,0,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper studies the Hotelling-Downs model considering that each voter is allowed to vote for up to k candidates and demonstrates that an equilibrium exists for a non-degenerate class of distributions of voters' ideal policies - which includes all log-concave distributions - if and only if k >= 2. That is, the plurality rule (k = 1) is shown to be the unique k-vote rule which generically precludes stability in electoral competition. Regarding the features of k-vote rules' equilibria, first, we show that there is no convergent equilibrium and, then, we fully characterize all divergent equilibria. We study comprehensively the simplest kind of divergent equilibria (two-location ones) and we argue that, apart from existing for quite a general class of distributions when k >= 2, they have further attractive properties among others, they are robust to free-entry and to candidates' being uncertain about voters' preferences.

The article is dedicated to the issue of independent regulators and requirements for their efficient functioning. We explain several dimensions of the term independence such as functional and political independence, de jure and de facto independence. De jure and de facto independence are not necessarily identical, because a country may have a formal legislative framework effectively set but this does not necessarily translate into the real decision- making of the regulator. Based on the knowledge gathered from research work in this field and our own research, we try to identify relevant parameters of the de political and functional independence of the Slovak competition authority. Afterwards, these parameters are compared with a similar regulatory institution abroad (UK). On the basis of the analysis and comparison we indicate possibilities for improvements. We propose to introduce an open selection procedure for the post of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Anti-Monopoly Office and to cancel the possibility to renew the mandate. We propose amending the monocratic first instance decision-making system to a collective system. In the second-instance proceedings decisions are taken by the Council, but it is necessary to change the method of board members selection. Next, we propose launching of a notification system of management and decision makers meetings with politicians, businessmen in particular if those are in proceedings before the Office. In addition to the issue of independence, it is important to pay attention also to the accountability of the regulator.","[Zemanovicova, Daniela] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia; [Vasakova, Livia] European Commiss, Representat Bratislava, Palisady 29, Bratislava 81106, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Zemanovicová, D (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia.;Vasáková, L (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Representat Bratislava, Palisady 29, Bratislava 81106, Slovakia.",daniela.zemanovicova@fm.uniba.sk; Livia.Vasakova@ec.europa.eu,,,project Efektivnost' pravnej upravy ochrany hospodarskej sut'aze v kontexte jej aplikacie v praxi [APVV-0158-12],project Efektivnost' pravnej upravy ochrany hospodarskej sut'aze v kontexte jej aplikacie v praxi,This paper is an output of the science project APVV-0158-12 Efektivnost' pravnej upravy ochrany hospodarskej sut'aze v kontexte jej aplikacie v praxi.,,21,3,3,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2498,2504,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800310,0

Complex generators' offers bring non-convexities into the efficient auctions due to e.g. start-up costs and times. This paper focused on the responsive demands, introducing simple, yet adequate linear constraints into a multi-period bid/offer-based optimal power flow (OPF DC) model. As the standard locational marginal prices (LMPs) may not support the auction outcomes due to non convexities, uplifts are needed to reduce generators' loss. Previous work has developed a minimum-uplift pricing model that directly optimizes prices, so that uplifts arising from generators' profit-suboptimality and simple, elastic demands' benefit-suboptimality are minimized. This work extended the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation of the previous model to incorporate new linear constraints defining benefit-suboptimality of demand shifting bids. Furthermore, the transmission constrained market was attempted. As a result, the buyers were protected against over-curtailment; moreover, prices complemented with minimum uplifts were fair for both generators and demands. The models were validated on the literature-based cases, including IEEE RTS 24-node 24-hour system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The regions compete with one another using Cournot conjectures and international trade is hindered by import quotas. Our results can help the country to determine the optimal import quotas and the best way to allocate import permits between regions. We find three mains results. First we show how the world price, the difference in production costs between regions and the relative market size determine the allocation of import quotas, the interregional trade and the rent of import permits holders. Second, we show that in the presence of interregional trade in both directions, the region with the largest market size will obtain the largest share of imports while in the absence of trade, the allocation of import permits between regions also depends on the production cost asymmetry. Third, when only the most efficient region exports to the least efficient one, production cost asymmetry, transaction costs and world price determine whether the smaller or larger region obtains the larger share of importations allowed under import quotas.

In their selection of product safety levels, producers seek to maximize profits, neglecting the fact that higher investment in product safety increases consumer welfare; the discrepancy between private and social safety incentives can be remedied by setting damages multipliers to values greater than one. We show that the optimal damages multiplier depends on the characteristics of competition, such as the number of firms, the degree of substitutability or complementarity when products are heterogeneous, firms' cost structures, and the mode of competition.

Accounting simultaneously for the decision upon in-house production versus international outsourcing and the decision upon exporting versus horizontal foreign investment, the analysis points to a crucial role of labour market frictions for the interaction of vertical and horizontal aspects of firm integration strategies in a general equilibrium environment. Beyond that, the analysis sheds light on the consequences of integrating developing countries into the global market, thereby pointing to hitherto unexplored effects arising from adjustments of firm integration strategies. In a welfare analysis, we show that the existence of gains from trade crucially depends on whether firm integration strategies are endogenous or not.","[Egger, Hartmut] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Econ, Bayreuth, Germany; [Egger, Hartmut; Egger, Peter; Seidel, Tobias] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Egger, Hartmut; Egger, Peter] GEP, Nottingham, England; [Egger, Hartmut] IfW, Kiel, Germany; [Egger, Peter] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Egger, Peter] CEPR, London, England; [Seidel, Tobias] Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Econ, Essen, Germany",University of Bayreuth; Ifo Institut; University of Nottingham; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Duisburg Essen,"Egger, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Dept Econ, Bayreuth, Germany.",hartmut.egger@uni-bayreuth.de,,"Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",Austrian Science Fund [P17713-G05]; Fritz-Thyssen-Foundation; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P17713] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF),Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Fritz-Thyssen-Foundation; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"We would like to thank two anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

Furthermore, the welfare-maximizing tax rate is lower than the growth-maximizing tax rate, whereas the welfare maximizing share of productive government expenditure is greater than the growth maximizing share.

The trend estimate of the terms of trade is measured using a novel econometric method due to Perron and Yabu (2009a) that is robust to the presence or absence of a unit root in the data. A further novel econometric procedure due to Perron and Yabu (2009b) for detecting a structural break is carried out allowing one to be completely agnostic to the underlying order of integration of the data.

A balanced government budget gives a unique saddle point stable growth path. With a rule-based policy, two saddle point stable balanced growth paths can occur, depending on the intertemporal elasticity of substitution of consumption and on the primary surplus policy.

Only one out of the twelve applicants who applied for housing refurbishment was subsidized in Kaohsiung; the required subsidy rate for Taipei was also low, 38%. This paper focuses on the performance analysis of the housing refurbishment policy. This paper will use the FANP method to find the factors that could influenced the performance of the housing refurbishment. Through empirical analysis, it was found that the success of the housing refurbishment projects are heavily affected by the factors of economic benefit and policy deliverables.

A genuine and honest leader is a key success factor in maintaining organizational running. Authentic leadership is regarded as the foundation of business success. An authentic leader applies positive morality and has the highmorality and value behaviors and languages be the paradigm. It is considered in this study that a non-profit organization could effectively affect the first-line administrators and organizational volunteers, through a leader's authentic leadership style, transform the degree of psychological capital and knowledge sharing intention and further enhance the operating performance of the non-profit organization. The leaders and administrators in China Association for NGO Cooperation, as the research samples, are distributed the questionnaires, and 428 valid copies are retrieved, with the retrieval rate 71%. The research results are summarized as following. 1. Authentic leadership shows significant correlations with psychological capital. 2. Psychological capital reveals remarkable correlations with knowledge sharing. 3. Authentic leadership presents notable correlations with knowledge sharing. 4. Psychological capital appears mediating effects on the relation between authentic leadership and knowledge sharing. This study intends to discuss whether authentic leaders in non-profit organizations could enhance the employees willing to actively share knowledge through psychological capital, provide reference opinions for the practical operation of non-profit organizations, and propose suggestions for possible directions.","[Lu Mingyuan; Li Geng] Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Tianjin University,"Lu, MY (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ, Coll Management & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",lmygh002@163.com; 60216@163.com,"Lu, Mingyuan/N-4229-2017",,,,,,19,2,3,0,72,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

New modeling challenges brought about by intermittent renewable energy sources, however, require a careful review of existing tools. This paper presents an overview of TO modeling approaches for incorporating renewable energy and describes in detail one approach, using the MIT USREP model, to identify critical parameters and assumptions underlying the general equilibrium formulation. We then quantitatively assess its performance regarding the ability to correctly estimate the participation of intermittent renewables in the electricity sector as predicted by a bottom-up electricity sector model, which is designed to analyze the expansion and operation of a system with a large penetration of wind and which is integrated within an economy-wide general equilibrium framework. We find that a properly specified TO approach to modeling intermittent renewable energy is capable of roughly replicating the results from the benchmark model. We argue, however, that the general equilibrium approach is highly sensitive to key parameters which are a priori typically unknown or at least highly uncertain. Our analysis suggests that traditional TO simulation tools have to be enhanced to avoid potentially misrepresenting the implications of future climate policies where presumably renewable energy could participate at large scale. Detailed power system models that capture system reliability and adequacy constraints are needed to properly assess the potential of renewable energy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Testing the hypothesis derived by Bustos (2011) by the use of a nonparametric test for differences in stochastic productivity distributions, see Delgado et al. (2002); it is found that the productivity distribution of exporting business services firms dominates the productivity distribution of nonexporting firms who do not invest in R&D. Except for 2007, this result holds for all the years included in the sample, i.e. 2007-2010. Exporting firms that are R&D active are more productive than nonexporting firms without R&D in all years between 2007 and 2010. This result is in accordance with Vogel and Wagner (2013) who test the Bustos model with German data for business services firms. The results are mixed when testing productivity differences for non-R&D active exporting firms with exporting firms that are R&D active. In this case the Bustos hypothesis holds only for 2009. Export of services has become increasingly important in foreign trade for developed countries. And the results add to the sparse empirical evidence on the interplay between R&D, export and productivity for firms in the business services industry.","[Dilling-Hansen, Mogens; Smith, Valdemar] Aarhus Univ, Tuborg Res Ctr Globalisat & Firms, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Dilling-Hansen, Mogens] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business Adm, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Smith, Valdemar] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",Aarhus University; Aarhus University; Aarhus University,"Smith, V (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Tuborg Res Ctr Globalisat & Firms, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",VSmith@asb.dk,,"Smith, Valdemar/0000-0003-3779-7677",,,,,18,3,3,0,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The concept is a result of a reaction of many specialists in this field. The efficient concept of avoidable mortality that consists of treatable and preventable mortality components should provide prominent information that is not directly absorbed in the metrics of general mortality rate traditionally used for measuring the healthcare systems' outputs. Permanent evaluation of the concept is based on confrontation of actual and relevant facts and supported by significant evidence from analytical outputs. This evaluation may help to form an efficient tool for measuring the amenable mortality with system connections as within health care system so in social policy, long-term health care policy, etc. The aim of this article is an analysis and evaluation of avoidable mortality development at conceptual and evaluative level and a specification of advantages and limitations that result from this concept.

To quantify excessive peer punishment, I conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment with actual microcredit borrowers in rural India. I design a repayment coordination game with strategic default and the possibility of acquiring information about a peer's investment return (peer peeking) and of sanctioning a peer (peer punishment). I observe loan repayment of over 90% and punishment of around 85%. Punishment is classified as excessive compared to a game-theoretically derived benchmark of zero punishment and a behaviorally-rooted benchmark of unjust punishment. This gives solid support to the anecdotal evidence and manifests the concern of excessive peer pressure in microcredit group lending. The most promising explanation is that borrowers have internalized the mission indoctrination of the microlender of what constitutes a good borrower, namely repaying loans and disciplining peers.

After full convergence has taken place, interest rate differentials became stationary. The applied econometric approach allows us to estimate the exact dates of full convergence endogenously. Our empirical results suggest remarkable differences in the estimated convergence dates for Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Italy which are highly related to steps of European integration policies.

Broadcasters face a trade-off between increasing the number of viewers by sending content that is highly valued by viewers, and increasing the price of advertising by choosing advertiser friendly content. A cap on advertising drives the per-viewer price of ads up; thus, content improves for viewers. Therefore, the cap can be welfare enhancing, even when viewers are not ad averse. Competition among broadcasters makes it more likely that a cap on advertising improves welfare. Thus, there is a complementarity between regulation and competition on this market. We also show that a tax on advertising revenues has quite different effects than a cap on advertising quantity. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Long-run negative external effects of extraction are understudied and often ignored in (social) cost-benefit analyses. One important example is that natural gas extraction leads to soil subsidence and subsequent induced earthquakes that may occur only after a couple of decades. We show that induced earthquakes that are noticeable to residents generate substantial nonmonetary economic effects, as measured by their effects on house prices, also when house owners are fully compensated for damage to their houses. To address the issue that earthquakes do not occur randomly over space, we use temporal variation in the occurrence of noticeable earthquakes while controlling for the occurrence of earthquakes that cannot be felt by house owners. We find that earthquakes that are noticeable with peak ground velocities of above half a cm/s lead to price decreases of 1.9 percent. The total nonmonetary costs of induced earthquakes for Groningen are about is an element of 170 million (about 600 per household). These results indicate that the non-monetary costs are in the same order of magnitude as the monetary damage costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Koster, Hans R.

The median confidence interval on return on investment is over 100 percentage points wide. Detailed sales data show that relative to the per capita cost of the advertising, individual-level sales are very volatile; a coefficient of variation of 10 is common. Hence, informative advertising experiments can easily require more than 10 million person-weeks, making experiments costly and potentially infeasible for many firms. Despite these unfavorable economics, randomized control trials represent progress by injecting new, unbiased information into the market. The inference challenges revealed in the field experiments also show that selection bias, due to the targeted nature of advertising, is a crippling concern for widely employed observational methods.","[Lewis, Randall A.] Google, Menlo Pk, CA USA",Google Incorporated,"Lewis, RA (通讯作者)，Google, Menlo Pk, CA USA.",,,,,,,,29,112,136,5,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

This paper investigates the robustness of team reasoning as an explanation for cooperative behavior, by assessing its long-run viability. We consider an evolutionary game theoretic model in which the population consists of team reasoners and conventional' individual reasoners. We find that changes in the ludic environment can affect evolutionary outcomes, and that in many circumstances, team reasoning may thrive, even under conditions that, at first glance, may seem unfavorable. We also pursue several extensions that augment the basic account, and conclude that team reasoning is an evolutionarily viable mechanism with the potential to explain behavior in a range of human interactions.","[Amadae, S.

Its application and empirical testing has been, generally, focalized on a temporal perspective. A spatial perspective it is also interesting for economic analysis because it allows for making comparisons of COLs across geographical units. This spatial approach, however, it is not so frequent in the literature. The aim of this paper is to calculate a spatial COL index for the regions of Spain. For this purpose, we use microdata from the 2010 Households Budget Survey (HBS, Encuesta de Presupuestos Familiares) provided by the Spanish Statistical Institute (INE, Instituto Nacional de Estadistica). We will denominate this index spatial cost of living index (SCOL). We use a microeconomic approach that keeps the level of utility of households constant across space but allows for substitution among different baskets of goods. The results reveal large differences in COL across the Spanish regions. The estimates of the SCOL index allows for reconsidering regional comparisons in terms of average wages. Even when nominal monetary figures from official Regional Accounts show huge regional disparities, regional differences are largely moderated when the wage figures are corrected by our SCOL index.","[Lasarte Navamuel, Elena; Fernandez Vazquez, Esteban] Univ Oviedo, REGIOLab, Oviedo, Spain; [Lasarte Navamuel, Elena; Paredes Araya, Dusan] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Econ, IDEAR, Antofagasta, Chile",University of Oviedo; Universidad Catolica del Norte,"Navamuel, EL (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, REGIOLab, Oviedo, Spain.",elena.lasartenavamuel@gmail.com,"Fernández-Vázquez, Esteban/L-8372-2019; Paredes, Dusan/G-9432-2012; Lasarte, Elena/AEJ-6324-2022","Fernández-Vázquez, Esteban/0000-0001-9192-8901; Paredes, Dusan/0000-0002-7090-5919; Lasarte, Elena/0000-0002-5667-3832",,,,,27,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

Using a calibrated version of the Barro-Becker model, I derive and estimate measures of effective quantity of life and of relative well-being for representative individuals of 116 countries between 1970 and 2005. I find that the gains in effective quantity of life arising from longevity improvements were on average more than offset by the losses due to fertility reductions. Effective quantity of life in the world fell by more than 7 percent during the period 1970-2005. Contrary to previous estimates, I find that the effective growth rate of well-being in the world, taking into account quantity and quality of life, was significantly below the growth rate of per-capita consumption.

Generally, polls lead to (more) asymmetric behavior. Under a majority rule, there always exists an equilibrium in which the initially more popular candidate invests more in the campaign and thereby increases her lead in expectation: polls create momentum. When campaigning is very effective and the race is very close, a second type of equilibrium may exist: The trailing candidate outspends and overtakes his opponent. Regardless of the type of equilibrium, polls have a tendency to decrease expected total campaigning expenditures by amplifying ex-ante asymmetries between candidates and thus defusing competition. When candidates care also for their vote share in addition to having the majority, candidates' incentives crucially depend on the distribution of voters' candidate preferences. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we offer a statistically sound characterization of how order flow conveys non-public information to such exchange rate and through which specific channels, order flow impulses contribute to mapping the relevant information. In order to do so, we use a cointegrated SVAR model to show that including order flow in a standard monetary model specification increases the explanatory power and forecast precision, but more importantly to demonstrate that order flow is informative about fundamentals and is associated with transitory exchange rate movements generated by monetary policy news. Our tests on the underlying long run and short run mechanisms confirm that the relation between the exchange rate and order flow is consistent with the macro approach to exchange rate determination, as suggested by Bilson's version of the monetary model, and that transitory monetary shocks are, to some extent, transmitted to the nominal exchange rate through order flow in Mexico.","[Sanchez Vargas, Armando] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Econ, Coordinac Anal Macroecon Prospect, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Arenas Diaz, Guillermo] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Villarespe Reyes, Veronica] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Vargas, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Econ, Coordinac Anal Macroecon Prospect, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",asanchez@vt.edu; memoare20@gmail.com; reyesvv@unam.mx,"Vargas, Armando Sanchez/AAQ-8927-2021",,,,,,30,0,0,0,2,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

High initial public debt is found to be significantly associated with slower subsequent growth. Non-linearities, currency denomination of debt and differences between advanced and emerging market economies are explored. The adverse effect largely reflects a slowdown in labour productivity growth mainly due to slower capital accumulation.

We analyze analytically how omission of various mean terms affects the value of the ARCH parameter in the simple ARCH(1) model. We focus on the following terms missing from the mean equation when they are in fact present: a constant, a seasonal dummy, an autoregressive term, and a time-varying risk premium. We track how the relative distortion in the value of the ARCH parameter depends on amount of misspecification, and calibrate it to actual daily and monthly returns. It turns out that the effect on the variance equation of missing elements in the mean equation tends to be quite benign. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study tests for the presence of the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle in nine European countries by employing the Markov switching model in order to characterize the time-varying behavior of the saving retention coefficient The econometric methodology allows us to distinguish periods for which the FHP holds from those for which the FHP does not hold. It is found that, based on the results from the Markov switching regression, there is a shift in the saving retention coefficients from high to low values, meaning that regime switching has taken place from the high correlation regime (low capital mobility) to the low correlation regime (high capital mobility) for Denmark, Germany, Norway, and Sweden. This evidence suggests that the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle holds for a particular period of time and depends upon the regime shifts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We use a microconsistent CGE model with 20 urban and rural households to model the actual characteristics of the food and energy subsidy reforms as implemented by the Iranian Government, calibrated to econometrically estimated income elasticities, and accounting for variations in sources of income and family size across households. Results suggest that food and energy subsidy reforms accompanied by lump-sum payments to households could result in aggregate welfare gains of over 45 per cent, with low income households experiencing welfare gains of well over 100 per cent. Reforms are accompanied by an increase in real government revenue of over 30 per cent. So while the subsidy reform programme is likely responsible for at least some of the inflationary pressures currently being experienced by the Iranian economy, it should not be seen as being responsible for the Iranian government's current fiscal difficulties, nor should it be blamed for the recent contraction of the Iranian economy, both of which are more likely due to the effects of international sanctions and the steep decline in the value of the Iranian Rial.

Interest rate pass through running from wholesale to retail rates is found to be both partial and heterogeneous across banks. This suggests that the effectiveness of monetary policy is limited. Further investigation reveals that the behaviour of retail deposit rates appears consistent with collusive behaviour between banks insofar as interest rates are more rapidly adjusted downwards than upwards. In the case of retail lending rates, it appears that banks more rapidly reduce than increase rates.

The factors that we examine include: productivity differential, fiscal policy, consumption/saving choice, and real and nominal demand side factors comprising monetary policy, and reserve accumulation. On average, technology shocks are found to play a dominant role in explaining the trade balance movement between China and the U.S. However, in the particular period of 2004-07 when global imbalances peaked, we find that demand shocks played an unusually large role. This contrast between the average tendency and the rather abnormal development in the mid-2000s provides general equilibrium evidence for several theories of current account (trade) balance imbalance. But it also shows that the experience of the mid-2000s does not have to repeat itself, given that it was an atypical development different from the average tendency.

We parsimoniously characterize the dynamics of the economy and study the optimal regulation of the money supply as a function of the state under commitment. The optimal policy prescribes monetary expansions in recessions, when insurance is most needed by the cash-poor unproductive agents.

In this line, we propose a selection principle called Equity (EQ), which selects the equilibrium in pure strategies minimizing the difference between the highest and smallest money payoff, if only one such equilibrium exists. Using a within-subjects experimental design, furthermore, we study the relative performance of EQin twelve simple 2 x 2 coordination games. In many of these games, we find that EQ explains individual behavior better than a large range of alternative theories, including theories of bounded rationality and several other equilibrium selection principles. Yet we also observe that the frequency of EQ play depends on the payoff structure of the game. For instance, EQ play diminishes when the alternative equilibrium is socially efficient and not very unfair (compared with the EQequilibrium). Our data suggests that equilibrium selection is affected by several factors and that subjects are heterogeneous in this respect, but also that equity is often a crucial factor to understand coordination.

Drawing on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we use an instrumental variables (IV) approach to distinguish between these hypotheses. IV estimates suggest that body weight leads to decreased self-esteem and increased depressive symptomatology among female, but not male, respondents. In addition, we find that body weight is negatively related to female academic achievement. Finally, we explore the degree to which the relationship between body weight and female academic achievement is explained by psychological wellbeing. We find that psychological wellbeing accounts for up to 30 % of this relationship.","[Sabia, Joseph J.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Rees, Daniel I.] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80217 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Sabia, JJ (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",jsabia@mail.sdsu.edu; Daniel.Rees@ucdenver.edu,,,National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P01-HD31921],National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"The authors thank participants at the 2010 Southern Economic Association meetings for useful comments and suggestions on an earlier draft of this paper.

The conditional and unconditional exit rates that we estimate are within the range of values reported for developed countries in the literature. That the income eventsbut not transfersdominate both poverty entries and exits is indicative of the major role labor markets play in the lives of the poor.

This paper analyzes select characteristics of Singapore's PFM strategy and prospects for their continuation. An underlying theme has been ensuring that PFM is consistent with and enables Singapore's location-based growth strategy. Other characteristics include conducting economic activities outside the conventional government budget giving rise to a much larger role for the public sector than reflected in the budget; extensive use of non-conventional sources of revenue such as from the lease of land, creating property and usage rights to generate tax-like revenue; and limited social risk pooling in financing national spending on healthcare and pensions. As Singapore's business-location-based strategy reaches its limits, and an affluent and ageing population aspires for greater economic and social security, transparency, and effective participation in public policies, current PFM practices will need to undergo significant changes towards a more citizen-centric governance focus. Policymakers' response will not be constrained by lack of fiscal resources, or by institutional and organizational capacities.","[Asher, Mukul G.] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Bali, Azad Singh] Murdoch Univ, Sch Management & Governance, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; [Bali, Azad Singh] Natl Univ Singapore, LKY Sch Publ Policy, Singapore 117548, Singapore",National University of Singapore; Murdoch University; National University of Singapore,"Asher, MG (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore 117548, Singapore.",sppasher@nus.edu.sg; a.bali@murdoch.edu.au; cykwan@e.ntu.edu.sg,,"Bali, Azad Singh/0000-0001-6430-2997; Kwan, Chang Yee/0000-0003-3966-4843",,,,,34,12,12,0,40,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Our theoretical model predicts that the likelihood of public sector employment increases with a worker's altruism, and increases or decreases with a worker's laziness depending on his altruism. Using questionnaire data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, we find that public sector employees are significantly more altruistic and lazy than observationally equivalent private sector employees. A series of robustness checks show that these patterns are stronger among higher educated workers; that the sorting of altruistic people to the public sector takes place only within the caring industries; and that the difference in altruism is already present at the start of people's career, while the difference in laziness is only present for employees with sufficiently long work experience.","[Dur, Robert] Erasmus Univ, Tinbergen Inst, CESifo, IZA, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Zoutenbier, Robin] Erasmus Univ, Tinbergen Inst, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Tinbergen Institute; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Dur, R (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, Tinbergen Inst, CESifo, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",dur@ese.eur.nl,"Dur, Robert/J-4142-2012","Dur, Robert/0000-0001-9081-4179",,,,,51,33,37,1,46,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

Intermediaries with a history of being honest earn higher premiums. The frequency of corrupt transactions is inversely related to income levels. When the government increases the fraction of profits that it extracts from entrepreneurs, intermediation intensifies, as entrepreneurs are reluctant to obtain licenses through legal means.

In nonpartisan elections, where party affiliation is not on the ballot, party has a much smaller influence on voting behavior and candidate quality has a substantial effect on outcomes. If the primary task of public officials is not to represent voters' ideology and their decisions have little variability across parties, then we need to seriously consider the potential cost of partisan competition. To the extent that partisan voting behavior crowds out the influence of candidate quality on voting outcomes, the desirability of the partisan election system should be carefully assessed.

Brock and Hommes demonstrate that fixed-point dynamics may turn into increasingly complex dynamics as the firms' intensity of choice increases. We show that policy-makers are able to manage such rational routes to randomness by adjusting profit taxes. In particular, policy-makers should increase (decrease) profit taxes if destabilizing expectations generate higher (lower) profits than stabilizing expectations to alter the composition of applied expectation rules and thereby to promote market stability.

I incorporate a firm's choice of risk level into a model of firm dynamics with real business cycle features to explain this empirical finding both qualitatively and quantitatively. In the model, in every period, each firm chooses the investment amount and the risk level associated with a production project every period. All projects available to each firm have the same expected flow return, determined by the aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks to the firm's productivity, and differ from one another only in their risk. The endogenous option of exiting the market and the limited funding for new investment jointly play an important role in motivating firms' risk-taking behavior. The model predicts that, in each period; relatively small firms are more likely to take risk and hence exhibit a higher exit rate, and that the cross-sectional productivity dispersion, measured as the standard deviation of the realized individual component of productivity, is larger in recessions.

Individual developers contribute to developing the software, but do not hold the copyright to appropriate its value. This raises questions regarding motives behind such effort. We provide an integrated model of developers' incentives to describe OSS development and compare restrictive OSS licenses that force all modifications to be kept open with non-restrictive OSS licenses that allow proprietary ownership of modified works. Different incentives govern effort provision at different stages of the software development process. We show that open-source licenses can provide socially valuable software when a proprietary license fails to do so. We also show that restrictive OSS licenses generate greater effort provision in the design stage of software development relative to non-restrictive licenses. Endogenizing licensing choice, we find that a project leader chooses a non-restrictive OSS license if reputational concerns drive developers' incentives, a proprietary license when there is a large population of users in the market and a restrictive OSS license if user population is small but reputational benefit is high. Our results resonate well with empirical findings and suggest additional testable implications about the relationship between licensing and software project characteristics. Finally, we also find that the market under-provides restrictive OSS licenses relative to the efficient level, suggesting the need for subsidizing restrictive licenses in some cases.","[Atal, Vidya] Montclair State Univ, Econ & Finance, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA; [Shankar, Kameshwari] CUNY, City Coll New York, Econ & Business, New York, NY 10021 USA",Montclair State University; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY),"Atal, V (通讯作者)，Montclair State Univ, Econ & Finance, 1 Normal Ave Partridge Hall 427, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA.",atalv@mail.montclair.edu; kshankar@ccny.cuny.edu,"Atal, Vidya/F-7074-2012",,,,,,26,2,5,0,25,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Using both static pooled regressions and a dynamic panel GMM estimator on a panel data of 53 countries, we examine whether stronger foreign IPR protection stimulates US international transactions. The empirical results suggest that foreign countries that strengthen their IPR protection, especially those with strong imitative ability, can attract more international transactions from the USA.","[Awokuse, Titus O.] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19717 USA; [Gu, Weishi Grace] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of Delaware; Cornell University,"Awokuse, TO (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19717 USA.",kuse@udel.edu,"Awokuse, Titus/AAQ-5902-2020",,,,,,23,4,4,2,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

We examine whether people decide to engage in risky sexual behavior due to low income and low life expectancy. Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by conditions that significantly reduce life expectancy such as unsanitary conditions prevalent in poverty stricken areas, inaccessibility to health care, and dangerous working conditions such as those in very poor mining regions. Moreover, since income per capita in these countries is very low, the opportunity cost associated with dying from AIDS and foregoing future consumption is very low. We examine how a government provided life insurance benefit may be an effective means of deterring risky sexual behavior. To evaluate this policy prescription we develop a life-cycle model with personal and family consumption and endogenous probability of survival. In the model, agents can receive life insurance benefits if their death is not the result of AIDS. We demonstrate that excessive risky behavior does result from low life expectancy and low levels of income and illustrate the conditions for which the life insurance benefit can replicate the effects of higher income and life expectancy, deterring risky sexual behavior and reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS.

It applies a framework of rational inattention to study the pricing strategies of a monopolistic seller facing a consumer with limited information capacity. The consumer needs to process information about the realized price, while the seller is perfectly attentive. The seller chooses to price rigidly, i.e. prices respond to changes in the unit input cost less than if the consumer was perfectly attentive. The rigidity is sometimes manifested by discreteness of prices the seller charges a finite set of different prices even for a continuous range of unit input costs. The seller does so to provide the consumer with easily observable prices, which stimulates her to consume more and increases the seller's profit. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The model is estimated across 110 227 farmers in Peru. The results show that both temperature and precipitation affect the selection crops. The study estimates that climate change would reduce the expected revenue per hectare in the range of 8% and 13% depending on the climate scenario. Climate change induces a reduction of conditional income for alfalfa, rice, coffee and maize (durum) and increases for potato, starchy maize, bananas and grapes for both climate models, with results mixed for cassava depending on the climate model. Rice and coffee are the crops with the greatest losses, while the native potato is the crop with the highest gain. Also, the probability of choice of maize and banana increases as temperature and precipitation increases.",,,,luismiguel.galindo@cepal.org; joseeduardoalatorre@cepal.org; orlando.reyes@cepal.org,,,,,,,31,4,4,0,29,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

We first study the determinants of the optimal principal-agent contract with and without performance transparency.

This article's argument for the inclusion of culture is twofold. First, culturally distinct groups may view the desirability of freedom in general and economic freedom in particular differently. Second, the inclusion of culture may explain some of the results presented in the existing research, such as positive contributions of freedom to SWB being confined to mostly developed countries. In this article, the respondent-based results use the World Values Survey (WVS) data with over 180 000 subjects in 86 countries and indicate that freedom of choice felt by individuals is an important determinant of SWB along with health and satisfaction with finances. While the respondent-based estimations do not show any variation in the effect of freedom of choice on SWB among different religious affiliations, the cross-section data-set that contains the same countries as in the WVS data yields different results. When the latter data-set is used, the interaction terms between economic freedom and religious affiliations indicate that higher economic freedom increases SWB in mainly Christian countries, while this effect is negative for mainly Muslim and Buddhist/Hindu countries.","So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville,"Evrensel, AY (通讯作者)，So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA.",aevrens@siue.edu,,,,,,,14,2,2,0,59,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

By comparing PLS and standard savings products in a controlled way, we find strong evidence that a PLS payment option leads to greater rates of payment deferral than does a straightforward interest payment option of the same expected value. The appeal of the PLS option is strongest among men and self-reported lottery players. We use the results of our experiment to structurally estimate the parameters of the decision problem governing time preference, risk aversion, and probability weighting.

In particular, empirical evidence suggests that people making choices under uncertainty do not have a unique certainty equivalent when single-stage games are turned into multistage games, even if the likelihood of outcomes remains unchanged. We show analytically why a violation of the independence axiom is not inconsistent with random-utility models and data obtained from discrete-choice experiments. Results from a health care application are used to demonstrate the feasibility of estimating certainty-equivalent functions that can be used to test the validity of the independence axiom by modeling data from choice-experiment surveys. Further, we show how estimating certainty-equivalent functions with a simple survival model can also help us understand choice-experiment respondents' implicit perceptions of the likelihood of future outcomes. This information is particularly valuable when only part of the risk details in a multistage game can be provided to respondents who complete a discrete-choice experiment either because the actual risk levels are unknown or because risk levels vary significantly from person to person, neither one of which is uncommon in health applications.

We pursue a more generalized explanation. We offer an infinite-period litigation model with uncertainty which reflects the reality more consistently.

Next, we calibrate the model to the wireless industry and use it to evaluate the impacts of changes in spectrum allocation on consumer welfare and profits. Simulations of the model show that when one firm acquires more spectrum, consumer welfare at all firms increases due to congestion externality effects. We find that a transfer of spectrum from one firm to another can either raise or lower consumer welfare at the firms not involved in the transaction, again due to externality effects.

His theoretical innovation was not derived from economics, and seemed irrelevant to contemporary issues of economic theory and policy; only his much later perception of an apparently unrelated problem - the incoherent treatment of social cost as market failure - showed how the concept of transaction costs could illuminate two major areas of economics. The inadequate treatment by economists of the transaction costs of markets is linked to the neglect of processes, and especially the processes of organising the growth and use of knowledge - key concerns of Smith and Marshall. The curious relationship between Coase's explanation of firms and Austin Robinson's analysis of competitive industry leads to a reflection on the scarce resource of human cognition and the role (and fallibility) of institutions.","Univ Stirling, Dept Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Loasby, BJ (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Dept Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",b.j.loasby@stir.ac.uk,,,,,,,44,6,9,0,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Results indicate that foreign investors place considerable value on the appointment of independent directors. An increase in foreign ownership, associated with an improvement in the corporate governance system, occurred after controlling home bias and firm size. Further, the positive effect of an outside director system on foreign ownership was greater for independent firms than it was for conglomerates (chaebols) and their affiliates. The results are robust under a range of endogeneity tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Coase's ideas about transaction costs, the nature of the firm, the role of government, and the problem of social cost have been hugely influential. Throughout his long life, he also worked to change the conduct of economics, urging economists to ground their conclusions in careful study of empirical reality rather than theories that work only on the blackboard. Less well known, perhaps, is his work to nurture and shape the emerging fields of law and economics and new institutional economics, or his support to young scholars studying institutional issues around the world. In his final years, he was preoccupied by the rapid transformation of China and the institutional structure of production. This article summarizes Coase's significant intellectual contributions to economics, pointing out along the way some of the traits that made him such a powerful thinker and exceptionally influential scholar.","[Shirley, Mary M.; Wang, Ning] Ronald Coase Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Wang, Ning] Zhejiang Univ, Ronald Coase Ctr Study Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Menard, Claude] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Zhejiang University; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Shirley, MM (通讯作者)，Ronald Coase Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",mshirley@coase.org; nwang1952@gmail.com; claude.menard@univ-paris1.fr,"Wang, Ning/AAD-7576-2019; Shirley, Mary M/JFL-0991-2023",,,,,,51,9,12,0,33,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Atsu",,,Regime spoiler or regime pawn: The military and distributional conflict in non-democracies,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Autocracy; Continuation value; Military; Markov equilibrium; Revolution,RESOURCE WEALTH; OIL,"I consider a model in which an autocrat can be removed from power either through a military coup or a revolution by the citizens. In the event of a revolt by the citizens, the military may choose to support the autocrat to crush the revolt or play a passive role. The autocrat determines the distribution of the,country's wealth among himself, the military, and the citizens. I find that, under certain conditions, there exists a unique Markov perfect equilibrium in which there are no coups, the citizens revolt in each period, and the military fights on behalf of the autocrat. Under a different set of conditions, there is another equilibrium in which there are no coups, the citizens always revolt, but the military does not fight the revolt. However, peace (no revolts) is also an equilibrium of the model. The model is consistent with the persistence of social unrest or civil wars in certain countries and the different roles played by the military in different countries. Surprisingly, I find that if the citizens' outside option (i.e., payoff in a democracy) improves, this is likely to make them worse off. Furthermore, an increase in natural resources is likely to make the citizens worse off because it reduces the probability of a transition to democracy or the prospect of good governance in autocracy. I discuss other implications of the model and relate it to real-world events. Journal of Comparative Economics 43 (2) (2015) 491-502.

We find that public enforcement facilitates small firm security issuance, while private enforcement benefits large firms more than small firms. However, once small firms access equity markets, private enforcement enhances the amount of equity capital raised in domestic markets. Stronger public enforcement gives rise to larger firms raising capital internationally. Comprehensively, results suggest that public (private) enforcement is more (less) consequential to firm-level access to capital than previously believed.

We find that there has been faster growth in employment in both high-and low-paying occupations than those in the middle since 1981. However, up to 2005, the wage pattern reflects a simple increase in inequality with greater growth in high-paid than middle-paid occupations and greater growth in middle than low-paid occupations. Since 2005, there has been some polarization but this is present only in some parts of the country and seems to be related more to the resource boom than technological change. We present results for the US to provide a benchmark. The Canadian patterns fit with those in the US and other countries apart from the 1990s when the US undergoes wage polarization not seen elsewhere. We argue that the Canadian data do not fit with the standard technological change model of polarization developed for the US.","[Green, David A.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Sand, Benjamin M.] York Univ, Dept Econ, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",University of British Columbia; York University - Canada,"Green, DA (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",david.green@ubc.ca,,,,,,,40,31,36,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Mapping out the known unknowns of global shale gas production potential,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Shale gas; Extraction cost curve; Global; ERR,,"To assess the global production costs of shale gas, we combine global top-down data with detailed bottom-up information. Studies solely based on top-down approaches do not adequately account for the heterogeneity of shale gas deposits and hence, are unlikely to appropriately capture the extraction costs of shale gas. We design and provide an expedient bottom-up method based on publicly available US data to compute the levelized costs of shale gas extraction. Our results indicate the existence of economically attractive areas but also reveal a dramatic cost increase as lower-quality reservoirs are exploited. At the global level, our best estimate suggests that, at a cost of 6 US$/GJ, only 39% of the technically recoverable resources reported in top-down studies should be considered economically recoverable. This estimate increases to about 77% when considering an optimistic recovery of resources but could be lower than 12% when considering pessimistic ones. The current lack of information on the heterogeneity of shale gas deposits as well as on the development of future production technologies leads to significant uncertainties regarding recovery rates and production costs. Much of this uncertainty may be inherent, but for energy-system planning purposes, with or without climate change mitigation policies, it is crucial to recognize the full ranges of recoverable quantities and costs.

J,"Horesh, N",,,,"Horesh, Niv",,,Gerschenkron Redux? Analysing New Evidence on Joint-Stock Enterprise in Pre-War Shanghai,ASIAN-PACIFIC ECONOMIC LITERATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMIC-GROWTH; FIRM; MARKETS; CHINA; LAW,"Alexander Gerschenkron (1904-78) famously postulated that the more backward an economy was at the outset of industrialisation, the more reliant it would be on state-backed banks as a means of directing investment. Gerschenkron thereby implied that impersonal equity markets were likely to play a less significant role in countries aiming to catch up with the West. This article is aimed at examining Gerschenkron's thesis primarily through an analysis of shareholding in 1930s Shanghai. Drawing on newly discovered archival material as well as on recent studies, the paper clarifies the magnitude of joint-stock enterprise and the ubiquity of stock-exchange trade in a city that was by far China's most important economic hub. The pattern of joint-stock enterprise in pre-war China is compared with that of Japan, the first non-Western society to become fully industrialised. The argument advanced is that Gerschenkron's thesis incorrectly played down the significance of impersonal equity markets to pre-war Japan's successful industrialisation and to the limited nature of pre-war China's industrialisation. Japan could sustain its industrialisation thrust in the early 20th century on a nation-wide scale partly because of the growing vitality of its equity markets in Tokyo and Osaka. By contrast, China's pre-war industrialisation was much less extensive because its equity markets were more limited.","Univ Nottingham, Chinese Studies, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Horesh, Niv] Univ Nottingham, China Policy Inst, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Horesh, N (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Chinese Studies, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,,"Horesh, Niv/0000-0002-2204-0017",,,,,83,3,3,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

The method is based on a multi-sector Eaton-Kortum model, embodying labor mobility friction across provinces. We find that the implied migration barriers are high and asymmetric. This asymmetry of migration barriers contributes to the expansion of provincial manufacturing labor share among all the provinces. Moreover, in a country with structural change, rich provinces gain less from inter-provincial trade than poor provinces. Journal of Comparative Economics 43 (2) (2015) 257-273.

There is no uncertainty about economic fundamentals. Banking bubbles can emerge through a positive feedback loop mechanism. Changes in household confidence can cause the bubbles to burst, resulting in a financial crisis. Credit policy can mitigate economic downturns. The welfare gain is larger when the government interventions are more front loaded, given that the government injects the same amount of liquidity in terms of present value. Bank capital requirements can prevent the formation of banking bubbles by limiting leverage, but if too restrictive will lead to less lending and hence lower production. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

I then test for this effect using data from 5,500 auctions for Chevrolet Corvettes. To address potential endogeneity of the level of competition, I introduce an instrument which takes advantage of the unique features of eBay. Results indicate that an additional competitor leads to a 6% reduction in the final transacted price ($960 for the average car). Further, I provide evidence that this effect is due to the thinning of the bidder market rather than dynamic bidding. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We found that people with higher cognitive abilities are more willing to sacrifice private gain for the public good in FP, CP, and EP experiment; They also imposed more pro-social punishment (spending time and energy to punish unfair actions, even though there's nothing to be gained by these actions for themselves), and less antisocial punishment (punishing the high contributors as much as they punished the low contributors).","[Zhang, Su; Gao, Wei] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fan, Binbin] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, S (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangsu@cufe.edu.cn,"Fan, Bin/HKN-3438-2023",,,,,,21,2,3,0,13,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

After reviewing the relevant literature the authors draw on the surveys of the European Values Study of 1991, 1999 and 2008 to describe the trends in life satisfaction in 13 Western and 11 Eastern countries. The analysis finds that life satisfaction levels in transition countries have come to approach those in the West: the 'rather unhappy' 1990s were followed by the 'rather happy' 2000s. The strengthening correlation between life satisfaction and GDP reflects this process of convergence. The characteristics of respondents, however, are more important than the national GDP, and a regression of life satisfaction with basic demographic and stratification variables shows their reinforcing effect, especially in Eastern countries. The findings of other surveys reporting on developments of attitudes since 2008 vary but are far from proving a uniform negative impact of economic recession on life satisfaction.","[Vecernik, Jiri; Mysikova, Martina] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Sociol, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Sociology of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Vecerník, J (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Sociol, Prague, Czech Republic.",jiri.vecernik@soc.cas.cz,"Večerník, Jiří/HNP-8514-2023; Mysíková, Martina/B-9175-2014; Večerník, Jiří/B-7929-2014","Večerník, Jiří/0000-0002-0535-3118; Mysíková, Martina/0000-0002-6340-4753; Večerník, Jiří/0000-0002-0535-3118",Czech Grant Agency [14-15008S],Czech Grant Agency(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This work was supported by the Czech Grant Agency under grant 14-15008S 'Changing work and job values in the Czech Republic in a comparative perspective'.,,27,2,2,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,APR 3,2015,27.0,2,,,,,170,187,,10.1080/14631377.2015.1026687,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CI6LW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354871800003,0

This article examines the validity of this claim in an optimal income tax framework. Contrary to the recommendation of the review, our theoretical results imply that even if all goods other than the good needed for working are separable from leisure, the optimal tax on these goods should not be uniform. Instead, commodity taxes should discourage consumption of goods with large expenditure elasticities. Our results imply that the optimal commodity tax system is dependent on the expenditure side of the government. For instance, if the government fully subsidizes the cost of the good needed for working, then commodity taxation is uniform under the standard separability assumption. Calibration exercises suggest that these results can be quantitatively important.","[Bastani, Spencer; Blomquist, Soren] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala Ctr Fiscal Studies, Uppsala, Sweden; [Pirttila, Jukka] Univ Tampere, UNU WIDER, Tampere 33014, Finland; [Pirttila, Jukka] Univ Tampere, Sch Econ, Tampere 33014, Finland",Uppsala University; Tampere University; Tampere University,"Bastani, S (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala Ctr Fiscal Studies, Uppsala, Sweden.",jukka.pirttila@uta.fi,,"Blomquist, Soren/0000-0001-8527-1501","Riksbankens Jubileumsfond [S2007-1304:1-E, RS10-1276:1]; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation [W2012-0438:1]; Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences [S2007-1304:1-E, RS10-1276:1] Funding Source: Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences",Riksbankens Jubileumsfond(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences); Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences),"Riksbankens Jubileumsfond (S2007-1304:1-E, RS10-1276:1) and the Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation (W2012-0438:1).",,21,7,7,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

This paper studies a specific context of this by estimating the effect of Somali piracy attacks on shipping costs using data on shipping contracts in the dry bulk market. To estimate the effect of piracy, we look at shipping routes whose shortest path exposes them to piracy and find that the increase in attacks in 2008 led to around an 8% to 12% increase in costs. From this we calculate the welfare loss imposed by piracy. We estimate that generating around 120 USD million of revenue for Somali pirates led to a welfare loss in excess of 630 USD million, making piracy an expensive way of making transfers.","[Besley, Timothy; Fetzer, Thiemo] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Besley, Timothy] CIFAR, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Fetzer, Thiemo] STICERD, London, England; [Mueller, Hannes] Inst Anal Econ CSIC, Barcelona, Spain; [Mueller, Hannes] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Barcelona School of Economics,"Besley, T (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",t.besley@lse.ac.uk; thiemo.fetzer@gmail.com; h.mueller.uni@gmail.com,"Mueller, Hannes/ABC-1470-2020","Mueller, Hannes/0000-0001-7667-3971",International Growth Centre (IGC) at LSE; CIFAR; Konrad Adenauer Foundation; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centers of Exellence in RD [SEV-2011-0075]; Ramon y Cajal programme; [ECO2012-37857]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI,International Growth Centre (IGC) at LSE; CIFAR(Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)); Konrad Adenauer Foundation; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centers of Exellence in RD; Ramon y Cajal programme(Spanish Government); ; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful to the editor, referees, Daron Acemoglu, Elhanan Helpman, Marit Rehavi and a number of seminar participants for useful comments and advice.

One explanation put forward for increasing absence rates is that a tougher labour market represents a health hazard. A competing hypothesis is that loss of job security works as a disciplinary device. We use a financial shock that hit the public sector in Norway in 2007 in some, but not all, municipalities to identify the effect of reduced job security on sickness absence. Public sector workers in municipalities that were not affected are used as a control group in a difference-in-differences analysis. In addition, trends in sickness absence of public and private sector employees are compared, in a triple difference-in-differences analysis. We find that sickness absence among public employees decreased considerably in the year after the shock in the affected municipalities. The results survive a number of robustness checks. The evidence is strongest for women, and consistent with a hypothesis that reduced job security has a disciplining effect. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Firms can sign long-term contracts with their workers which give them incentives to maximize the joint surplus associated with their relationship. When the firm hires a new worker, the terms of the contract are determined by bargaining over the marginal surplus. Long-term contracts solve the over-hiring problem identified by previous authors. However, the equilibrium is still not constrained efficient because large, low productivity firms search too intensively relative to small, high productivity firms. This potentially provides a novel justification for subsidizing vacancy creation by young, small firms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we investigate whether these two fiscal policies alleviated the shock generated by the 2008 financial crisis on Taiwan's economy and unemployment. The findings provide that the economic and employment effects generated by the public work investment project were the most substantial in the public sector. By contrast, the economic and employment effects generated by the consumption vouchers policy were the largest in the service sector. These outcomes are closely related to Taiwan's industry structure. The fiscal multiplier of the public investment project and consumer vouchers distribution was 1.94 and 1.47.

Fundamentalists form expectations on the return and risk of a risky asset and maximize their constant relative risk aversion expected utility with respect to their allocation on the risky asset versus the risk-free asset. Chartists are subjected to social imitation and follow momentum trading. Allowing for random time-varying herding propensity, we are able to reproduce several well-known stylized facts of financial markets such as a fat-tail distribution of returns and volatility clustering. In particular, we observe transient faster-than-exponential bubble growth with approximate log-periodic behavior and give analytical arguments why this follows from our framework. The model accounts well for the behavior of traders and for the price dynamics that developed during the dotcom bubble in 1995-2000. Momentum strategies are shown to be transiently profitable, supporting these strategies as enhancing herding behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We show that under non-unitary elasticity of factor substitution, the Schmitt-Grohe-Uribe indeterminacy result can be altered. Using the two-step normalization procedure, we highlight two opposing effects of factor substitution, namely, the efficiency effect and the distribution effect, on aggregate stability. With endogenous distortionary taxes and gross substitutability between capital and labor, the existing literature overlooks the distribution effect and finds that balanced-budget rules are likely to deliver indeterminacy. However, if capital stock is relatively more abundant, a higher elasticity of substitution generates a source of stability due to the distribution effect. Our calibration shows that the distribution effect is always the dominating force.","[Xue, Jianpo] Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Sch Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Yip, Chong K.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Xue, JP (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Sch Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",jpxue@ruc.edu.cn; chong-keeyip@cuhk.edu.hk,"XUE, Jianpo/JGD-3964-2023; YIP, Chong/AAU-7049-2020","Yip, CHONG KEE/0000-0003-2950-2461; Xue, Jianpo/0000-0002-8567-5685","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71103187]; Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [CUHK 458311]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(Hong Kong Research Grants Council)","We are grateful to two anonymous referees whose suggestions greatly improved the exposition of the paper.

Our evidence is consistent with the notion that poor governance results in a wider divergence between the stock's market price and the fundamental value.

In this article, we study the antecedents of deal duration for a sample of 1150 M&As between listed US companies during 1994-2011. Not surprisingly, deal complexity critically affects time to completion. Stock offers, deal hostility, mergers and larger deals are characterized by a lengthier acquisition duration. Strong and clear shareholder support accelerates deal completion, as does the likelihood of overpayment.

Despite this, experiments have shown that groups struggle to coordinate on one of the many efficient equilibria. We apply a mechanism used successfully in continuous public goods games, the Hired Gun Mechanism (Andreoni and Gee in J. Public Econ. 96(11-12):1036-1046, 2012), to see if it can successfully get subjects across the threshold. When we use the mechanism to eliminate only inefficient equilibria, without addressing coordination, there is a modest but statistically insignificant improvement with the mechanism. However, when we hone the mechanism to eliminate all but one of the provision-point equilibria, thereby addressing the coordination issue, the mechanism moves all subjects to the desired efficient outcome almost immediately. In fact, after only one round using the hired gun mechanism, all subject are coordinating on the chosen equilibrium. The mechanism can be applied in settings where a group (1) has a plan for public good provision, (2) can measure contributions, (3) can fine members and (4) has an agreed upon standard for expected contributions. In these settings simple punishments, when focused on solving coordination as well as free riding, can greatly improve efficiency.","[Andreoni, James] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Andreoni, James] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gee, Laura K.] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; National Bureau of Economic Research; Tufts University,"Gee, LK (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",laura.gee@tufts.edu,"Gee, Laura/S-6537-2019; Andreoni, James/ABD-4433-2021","Gee, Laura/0000-0002-3715-7445; Andreoni, James/0000-0003-0679-2371","National Science Foundation [SES-1024683]; Science of Generousity Initiative; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1427355] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Science of Generousity Initiative; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Andreoni would like to thank the National Science Foundation (SES-1024683), and the Science of Generousity Initiative for financial support.

In view of data constraints, the present empirical analysis focuses on Alan Greenspan's chairmanship. Individual Taylor-type reaction functions for the Federal Reserve Districts are estimated using Presidents' interest rate preferences voiced during the second round of the internal FOMC discussions and real-time data. They show that the Federal Reserve Bank Presidents did not systematically deviate from the Chairman's reaction function. In addition, a bootstrap analysis finds that the second-round preferences of these members appear to have been influenced by a consensus enhancing factor.

It then uses data from the Israeli Central Bureau, of Statistics to determine the optimal allocation of the community's budget. Our main result is that the local expenditures on education are most effective in improving residents' wellbeing. In addition, the expenditures on recreation, gardening and public cleaning, and water and sewerage also have a significant impact on the residents' wellbeing. Finally, we demonstrate that given the decreasing marginal utility of each service, the optimal allocation might be a simultaneous investment in these various services.

In consequence, people's failure to anticipate hedonic adaptation to adverse health changes leads them to save more if consumption and health are Edgeworth complements, but to save less if they are Edgeworth substitutes. When we add a zero-mean risk on future health, a new effect occurs. Since underestimating hedonic adaptation to health change also increases the individual's sensitivity to health risk, cross-prudence, which corresponds to the willingness to accumulate wealth in the face of future health risks may, depending on the case in question, amplify but also limit the change in savings. These effects add another source of variability among observed saving behaviors. They also singularly complicate the estimation of the health state dependence of the utility function.","Inst Catholique Lille, F-59016 Lille, France",Universite Catholique de Lille,"Macé, S (通讯作者)，Inst Catholique Lille, 60 Blvd Vauban, F-59016 Lille, France.",serge.mace@icl-lille.fr,,,,,,,40,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Exponential growth, fat tails, Pareto-Levy distributed upper tails, and upper value outliers, are associated with increasing returns to scale and innovation. At the same time, properties such as bifurcated research investment strategies, bimodal returns to innovation, and Laplace distributed firm growth rates are products of competition. We build an agent-based model of endogenous technical change in which heterogeneous investments in patented knowledge and increasing returns to scale emerge these distributional properties within a competitive market. The combination of heterogeneous agents, costly information, and patents allow for a competitive landscape to persist amidst increasing returns. The ability of model to foster a coexistence of competition and increasing returns underlies the observed distributional properties.","[Makowsky, Michael D.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Levy, David M.] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Johns Hopkins University; George Mason University,"Makowsky, MD (通讯作者)，5801 Smith Ave,Davis Bldg,Suite 3220, Baltimore, MD 21209 USA.",mmakowsky@jhu.edu,"Levy, David/GPS-4945-2022",,"Towson College of Business and Economics; Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health [DP1OD003874]","Towson College of Business and Economics; Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Office of the Director)","We would like to thank Robert Axtell, seminar participants in the Department of Social Complexity, George Mason University, participants in the Legatum Institute's 2012 Charles Street Symposium, and two anonymous referees.

We find evidence that they stemmed gold outflows in the year following their imposition; however, time-shifted, difference-in-differences (DD) estimates of industrial production, prices, and exports suggest that capital controls did not accelerate macroeconomic recovery relative to countries that went off gold and floated. Countries imposing capital controls also appear to perform similar to the gold bloc countries once the latter group of countries finally abandoned gold.

This article seeks to extend our understanding, through the interaction between labour segmentation, regulation content and regulation distance, the last referring to the extent to which employment of particular workers is (un) regulated, including by collective agreements, legislation or other instruments. Regulation distance encompasses a continuum from 'regulation proximity' to 'market proximity'. A greater reliance on the 'market' does not necessarily remove pay distortions; rather, it might increase their impact through the mechanism of gendered norms. Empirical evidence is drawn from studies in several countries, most commonly Australia. This approach more clearly specifies the roles of under-valuation, labour segmentation, group norms and human and social capital; illuminates public sector and union effects; explains why the gender gap is greatest for a group of women with the most labour market power; and illustrates some non-pay aspects of gendered experience at work.","[Peetz, David] Griffith Univ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Peetz, D (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Employment Relat & Human Resources, Griffith Business Sch, Nathan Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",d.peetz@griffith.edu.au,,,,,,,84,17,18,1,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Using the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions for 8 countries, we first show that country differences in terms of intergenerational inequality concern residual background correlations and then decompose these correlations using changes in relative social positions. In immobile countries, we find that significant residual correlations are mainly driven by penalisation of upward mobility in the UK (glass ceiling) and by an insurance against downward mobility in Spain and Italy (parachute). In mobile countries, insignificant residual correlations mask heterogeneous returns to social mobility.

The model displays two types of long run behavior, depending on policies and initial conditions. One is sustained growth, where the economy keeps pace with the technology frontier. The other is stagnation, where the economy converges to a minimal technology level that is independent of the world frontier. In a calibrated version of the model, transition paths after a policy change can display rapid growth, as in modern growth 'miracles.' In these economies policies that promote technology inflows are much more effective than subsidies to human capital accumulation in accelerating growth.

Our findings confirm the importance of Argentina's inclusive industrial relations system in narrowing gender pay differences to a greater extent than Chile. Nevertheless, Chile's industrial relations institutions are not wholly exclusive; its high-level statutory minimum wage has played a strongly distributive role in the 2000s and compressed wages in the lower half of the wage distribution.

Both strategic interactions and endogenous business creation strengthen the nominal rigidities. Price adjusters change their prices less when there are more direct competitors that do not adjust, which reduces the slope of the Phillips curve. Current and future firms entering in the markets decrease current inflation because they reduce markups and the welfare-based price index. Endogenous entry amplifies the impact of both monetary and supply shocks. We also characterize the optimal social planner allocation, that can be replicated with a labor subsidy and a dividend tax (both decreasing in the number of firms) and zero producer price inflation.

Firm-specific capital improves the fit of DSGE models to the data (as shown by a large increase in the value of the log marginal likelihood). This results from a lower implied estimate of the NKPC slope for a given degree of price stickiness. Firm-specific capital leads to a better fit to the volatilities of macro variables and a greater persistence of inflation. It is also shown that firm-specific capital reduces the dependence of New Keynesian models on price markup shocks and that it increases the persistence of output to monetary shocks.

The estimates indicate that a 10% increase in facilities lowers a county's drug-induced mortality rate by 2%.

The main finding of this article suggests a positive trade-off between military spending and two types of social welfare expenditures (i.e. education and health spending). One of the reasons may be that the OECD countries are more supportive of the social welfare programs; therefore, when the military spending is increased (e.g. military personnel and conscripts), the government may raise the health and education spending as well.","[Lin, Eric S.; Lu, Yu-Lung] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Ali, Hamid E.] Amer Univ Cairo, Dept Publ Policy & Adm, Cairo, Egypt",National Tsing Hua University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); American University Cairo,"Lin, ES (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Econ, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",slin@mx.nthu.edu.tw,,,,,,,39,35,36,0,42,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Aggregate results reveal that immigrants have a positive effect on income that works primarily through total factor productivity (TFP). We further construct a novel dataset from censuses and labor force surveys to explore the information on the age of immigrants. Contrasting income effects are found across age groups: a higher share of immigrants among the youth has a negative impact on aggregate income, while a higher share of immigrants among prime-aged workers has a positive effect. We interpret this disparity as short-term versus medium-term effects. Adjustments over time involve changes in TFP but also in the human capital of the native-born.

Previous studies have found that most of the gap remains unexplained by personal and job characteristics. However, key job characteristics, occupation and industry, are usually imprecisely measured, leading to the question of whether all relevant characteristics have been properly taken into account in the decompositions. In this paper, we perform the decomposition of the wage gap to see how much of the wage gap remains unexplained after using more detailed data than has been common in previous studies (the Estonian Structure of Earnings Study data set), and discuss the related methodological challenges. Using a non-parametric method that takes into account differences in supports of distributions of male and female workers' characteristics, we find that using more detailed data does not eliminate the unexplained wage gap: about half of the wage gap remains unexplained even using the full set of available variables.","[Anspal, Sten] Estonian Ctr Appl Res CENTAR, Nunne 5-3, EE-10133 Tallinn, Estonia; [Anspal, Sten] Univ Tartu, Fac Econ & Business Adm, EE-50090 Tartu, Estonia",University of Tartu,"Anspal, S (通讯作者)，Estonian Ctr Appl Res CENTAR, Nunne 5-3, EE-10133 Tallinn, Estonia.",sten.anspal@centar.ee,,,Doctoral School of Economics and Innovation University of Tartu under European Social Fund,Doctoral School of Economics and Innovation University of Tartu under European Social Fund,The publication of this article is granted by the Doctoral School of Economics and Innovation University of Tartu created under the auspices of European Social Fund.,,18,10,10,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

We consider three different cases: first, we characterize equilibrium when firms face boundedly rational consumers with the fixed irrationality parameter lambda; second, we discuss the case of obfuscating oligopoly, when firms can invest in order to confuse consumers, i.e. to increase their lambda; and third, we consider educating oligopoly, when firms can choose to invest to decrease lambda. We show that while it is worthwhile for the firms to confuse the consumers, it is only optimal to educate them if they are sufficiently rational at default.

The behavioural approach explores the role of time preferences on household debt maturity in a theoretical model and a numerical analysis. We derive a positive relationship between the long-term discount factor delta and the optimal maturity of household loans. The cultural approach examines whether national culture is a reasonable predictor for household debt maturity. We show that culture is an important factor for households' borrowing decisions and has even more predictive power than time preferences. Countries with higher scores on the Hofstede dimension of long-term orientation tend to have shorter household debt maturity. Time preferences incur a primarily mediating role, because the effect of national culture on the borrowing decision is reduced, as the long-term discount factor delta increases.","[Breuer, Wolfgang; Salzmann, Astrid Juliane] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Finance, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Hens, Thorsten] Univ Zurich, Inst Banking & Finance, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Wang, Mei] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Chair Behav Finance, D-56179 Vallendar, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; University of Zurich; WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management,"Salzmann, AJ (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Finance, D-52056 Aachen, Germany.",astrid.salzmann@bfw.rwth-aachen.de,"Salzmann, Astrid/ABA-4628-2020","Salzmann, Astrid/0000-0002-8291-5225; Hens, Thorsten/0000-0002-0266-1561",,,,,51,8,8,3,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The linear regression method has been used to analyze a sample of 207 countries, 25 receiving countries and 182 sending countries from 6 different regions (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Central and South America and Oceania). A global analysis including all the countries of the sample and a partial analysis by each world region of origin has been performed. The results at global level showed that migration networks and the prestige of academic institution explain the number of highly skilled immigrants very well. In this sense, prestigious academic institutions of receiving countries imply economic incentives and benefits for skilled migrants. Further, relationships and linkages become an important help for highly skilled migrants. Thus, both would act like external and internal networks attracting highly skilled migrants. Regarding the partial analysis, these factors were also relevant for explaining highly skilled migration, but the results varied depending on each region. In case of Africa and Central & South America, the relevant factor explaining the highly-skilled migration was the prestige of academic institutions of the receiving countries. However, in the regions of Europe, North America, and Oceania results were similar to the global analysis.

Different trade regimes imply different costs of such disputes in terms of arming. Depending on world prices, free trade can intensify arming to such an extent that the additional security costs it brings swamp the traditional gains from trade and thus render autarky more desirable for one or all rival states. Free trade, though, is always an equilibrium, and sometimes is a dominant one with features of a prisoner's dilemma outcome. Furthermore, contestation of resources can reverse a country's apparent comparative advantage relative to its comparative advantage in the absence of conflict. And, where such conflict is present, comparisons of autarkic prices to world prices could be inaccurate predictors of trade patterns. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The paper shows that this framework accounts for both the importance of context and time-specific expectations put forward by existing post Keynesian exchange rate theory, and for the hierarchic and structured nature of the international monetary system that is crucial to understanding exchange rate movements in developing and emerging countries (DECs). To analyze these currency hierarchies, the paper presents a novel Minskyan approach that emphasizes the structural determinants of these hierarchies and currency positions in international debtor-creditor relations. This approach can better account for DECs' continued monetary subordination and points to the endogenous and self-perpetuating nature of international monetary hierarchies.","[Kaltenbrunner, Annina] Univ Leeds, Business Sch LUBS, Div Econ, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Kaltenbrunner, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Business Sch LUBS, Div Econ, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",,,,,,,,73,72,79,3,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Although they met at Harvard only one year before Schumpeter died, they had the opportunity to interact frequently and Sylos attended both the graduate courses taught by the Austrian economist during the 1948-49 academic year. They had very different personalities and political attitudes. Nevertheless, Schumpeter's intellectual influence on Sylos was very significant. Its analysis is structured here along Schumpeter's three most important contributions to social sciences: an evaluation of past economic theories, a theory of economic development, and a few contributions to a theory of social and institutional change. Even if Sylos had a different conception of economics as a discipline, he caught fire from Schumpeter's teachings, whose imprint is self-evident in most of his important contributions.","Univ Pisa, Dept Polit Sci, Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Labini, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Polit Sci, Pisa, Italy.",mauro.syloslabini@sp.unipi.it,,"SYLOS LABINI, MAURO/0000-0001-9362-1313",,,,,35,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

But market competition had always had an intangible dimension due to the fact that every company tries to gain competitive advantages and to become the best in its field. Some researchers focused on analyzing the relationship between knowledge and competitiveness while others concentrated on determining the dimensions of corporate reputation (CR). Still, CR involves creating, disseminating and using knowledge; it reflects the image of a company, based on stakeholder's experiences, and it influences its market-value and its ability to attract and retain talented people. Some attempts have been made in order to link CR and intellectual capital (IC) but the focus was mainly on the characteristics of the second concept. As a result, the first one was described as a component of relational capital. But CR means more than just a reflection of firm's relationships with its stakeholders. It involves the development of employees' competencies, skills and abilities (defined as human capital) and an efficient use of routines, processes and technology (described as structural capital). Based on these assumptions, we aim to analyze the relationships between CR and IC. As a starting point, we use the results generated by the Competitiveness Intellectual Capital Index (CICI) for the Romanian companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE). We develop a case study strategy and we discuss the possible links between CR and each IC component in the cases of the two best Romanian firms, according to CICIs value during 2009-2012. The research findings have both theoretical and managerial implications. At the theoretical level, we emphasize the relationships between CR and IC and we highlight the mediating role of the organizational values. At the practical level, we offer a direction for decision makers. They may increase their CR and IC performance if they support values like responsibility, communication, cooperation, collaboration and self-confidence.","[Leon, Ramona-Diana; Pinzaru, Florina; Zbuchea, Alexandra] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Coll Management, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Leon, RD (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Coll Management, Bucharest, Romania.",ramona.leon@facultateademanagement.ro; florina.pinzaru@facultateademanagement.ro; alexandra.zbuchea@facultateademanagement.ro,"Zbuchea, Alexandra/A-2771-2011; Leon, Ramona D./G-1091-2015; Pinzaru, Florina/ABC-5633-2021","Zbuchea, Alexandra/0000-0002-5341-7622; Leon, Ramona D./0000-0002-1448-0522; Pinzaru, Florina/0000-0002-8371-5284",,,,,56,3,3,0,9,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,227,236,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600027,0

For instance, we show that Hilferding's conception of economic development has striking similarities with Schumpeter's respective thesis. Also, Hilferding expressed the thesis that 'the size and technical equipment of the monopolistic combination ensure its superiority' which has striking similarities with the so-called Schumpeterian Hypothesis. Furthermore, Hilferding made a distinction between the entrepreneur who is in charge of the use of capital in production and the capitalist who advances his capital and bears the risk. There, Hilferding identified another personality who has similar tasks to those of an innovative manager. It is exactly this separation of roles which is at the core of Schumpeter's famous analysis. Moreover, regarding credit, for both theoreticians, it is determined by its demand side i.e. creation of credit money resulting from the demand for investment funds and is indispensable for the functioning of capitalism. In this context, their views on economic instability have further similarities, since for both theorists, development presupposes an innovation, which enables the firm to earn an extra profit and stimulates the demand for credit in order to finance new investments through credit creation. As for socialism, Hilferding regarded it as the organization of production not by and for the benefit of capitalist magnates but by and for society as a whole, whereas for Schumpeter socialism is an institutional arrangement that vests the management of the productive forces with some public authority. Finally, regarding imperialism, Schumpeter differentiated himself from Hilferding and considered it to be an 'old' inheritance from pre-modern capitalist eras, which was bound to disappear contrarily to Hilferding, who regarded imperialism as a 'new', characteristic of capitalism in its 'latest' stage. In brief, some of Schumpeter's ideas are probably not quite as unique as they appeared to be, since many of them could be described as a reworking of Hilferding's views. Apparently, Schumpeter's originality is, at least partly, based on the approaches on which he built his oeuvre.","[Michaelides, Panayotis G.; Milios, John G.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Appl Math & Phys, Dept Humanit Social Sci & Law, Lab Theoret & Appl Econ, Athens 15780, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,"Michaelides, PG (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Appl Math & Phys, Dept Humanit Social Sci & Law, Lab Theoret & Appl Econ, Heroon Polytech 9, Athens 15780, Greece.",pmichael@central.ntua.gr,"Milios, John/ABG-3322-2020",,,,,,51,1,1,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Spillovers from the use of such policies are likely, but are not an argument against their use, per se. Nevertheless, when policy interventions themselves carry costs, coordination is likely to enhance global economic welfare, and may well need to include both source and recipient countries.","[Ostry, Jonathan D.] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept RES, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Ostry, JD (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept RES, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,3,PALGRAVE,BASINGSTOKE,"HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, ENGLAND",,,978-1-137-42768-7; 978-1-137-42766-3,INT ECON ASSOC SERIE,,,2015,154.0,,,,,,171,196,,10.1057/9781137427687.0014,0.0,,,26,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF4AA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380610700008,0

Using a panel data set consisting of all states with legal commercial casino gambling from 1998 to 2009, a 2SLS fixed-effect model that also uses aggregate and sin-based excise taxes as instruments is estimated. We find that maximum casino tax rates negatively affect casino employment with an inelastic average effect of -0.6. We estimate state tax revenue changes per employee from a 1% increase in the gross gaming revenue tax, finding that states with comparatively low tax rates could increase public revenue with relatively small losses in employment. Nevada, New Jersey, and South Dakota each with maximum tax rates currently below 10% could increase tax revenue by more than $430,000 per estimated employee lost from the tax change.

Previous studies usually use the mean-variance criterion to compare the return-risk profiles of the yields of different property sizes in the United States. However, this criterion has a few shortcomings. This article provides the first attempt to use a stochastic dominance approach to analyse this issue. We adopt two powerful stochastic dominance tests to compare the yields of five property size classes in the Hong Kong residential property market. In our study, we analyse two possible investment outcomes: (1) investors could not rent out their properties, and thus they would gain/lose from the appreciation/depreciation of residential property prices; (2) investors could also gain from rental incomes. Our empirical results provide strong evidence to show that the yields of smaller property classes stochastically dominate the yields of bigger property classes, suggesting that buying smaller properties is a better investment choice in the Hong Kong residential property market.","[Qiao, Zhuo] Univ Macau, Dept Finance & Business Econ, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China; [Wong, Wing-Keung] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Econ, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Macau; Hong Kong Baptist University,"Qiao, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Dept Finance & Business Econ, Ave Univ, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China.",zhuoqiao@umac.mo,"Wong, Wing-Keung/AAI-9296-2020; Wong, Wing-Keung/JCN-7787-2023","Wong, Wing-Keung/0000-0001-6755-572X;",,,,,47,15,15,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Well-known decision models are axiomatized under the premise that agents can randomize. Under a reversal of order assumption, this convexifies choice sets, and even after imposing the weak axiom of revealed preference and nonemptiness of choice correspondences, the preferences directly revealed by choice may be incomplete or cyclical. Choice correspondence characterizations of (von Neumann-Morgenstern) expected utility, (Anscombe-Aumann) subjective expected utility, (Gilboa-Schmeidler) maxmin expected utility, (Schmeidler) Choquet expected utility, (Wald-Milnor) maximin utility, and (Bewley) multiple prior preferences can be established nonetheless by assuming nonempty choice, the weak axiom of revealed preference or weakenings thereof (but avoiding the strong axiom throughout), and choice correspondence analogs of relevant preference axioms. Two salient applications are to games, where agents' ability to randomize is usually presumed, and to statistical decision theory, where agents (i.e., statisticians) randomize in reality.

This paper analyzes what gains drive the expansion of international research collaboration and what costs prevent it, with a special focus on the incidence of international co-inventions (ICIs) in Asia and major Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. The major findings are as follows. ICIs become more prevalent in those technology sectors where scientific literature becomes important as prior art, inventor team size increases, and the relative inventor resources of the own country in the world declines. Thus, ICIs allow a country to exploit more efficiently the world stock of new knowledge and to realize the gains from combining diverse sources of knowledge and skills. Moreover, the results of estimating a gravity model centered on the USA and Great Britain suggest that language differences measured by Test of English as a Foreign Language scores matter significantly. The results also suggest that exporting from these two countries are significantly and positively associated with ICIs.","[Tsukada, Naotoshi] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan; [Nagaoka, Sadao] Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies; Hitotsubashi University,"Tsukada, N (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan.",n_tsukada@grips.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25780182] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,27,14,14,5,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

The reference turning point chronology elaborated by the OECD for 23 industrial countries for the post-1956 period was used. The sample included 258 expansions and 267 contraction spells. The widespread belief that the length of expansions has, on average, become longer and that of contractions has become shorter over time was not supported in our sample. There is sufficient evidence of monotonically increasing hazard rates for both contraction and expansion durations; i.e., the spells are positively duration-dependent. Regarding the impacts of covariates on the hazard rate of contractions, the saving rate, openness, productivity growth, and size (depth) were found to have significant positive impacts, whereas the real interest rates have a negative effect. Inflation, oil prices, and length of previous expansion period have no significant impact on contraction durations.","[Yildirim, Nuri] Univ Izmir, Dept Int Trade & Finance, Izmir, Turkey",Izmir University,"Yildirim, N (通讯作者)，Univ Izmir, Dept Int Trade & Finance, Izmir, Turkey.",,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,16,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2015,62.0,5,,,,,557,579,,10.2298/PAN1505557Y,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CZ9JV,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367414800002,0

J,"Baldwin, R",,,,"Baldwin, Richard",,,The World Trade Organization and the Future of Multilateralism,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,REGIONALISM,"When the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was signed by 23 nations in 1947, the goal was to establish a rules-based world trading system and to facilitate mutually advantageous trade liberalization. As the GATT evolved over time and morphed into the World Trade Organization in 1993, both goals have largely been achieved. The WTO presides over a rule-based trading system based on norms that are almost universally accepted and respected by its 163 members. Tariffs today are below 5 percent on most trade, and zero for a very large share of imports. Despite its manifest success, the WTO is widely regarded as suffering from a deep malaise. The main reason is that the latest WTO negotiation, the Doha Round, has staggered between failures, flops, and false dawns since it was launched in 2001. But the Doha logjam has not inhibited tariff liberalization far from it. During the last 15 years, most WTO members have massively lowered barriers to trade, investment, and services bilaterally, regionally, and unilaterally-indeed, everywhere except through the WTO. For today's offshoring-linked international commerce, the trade rules that matter are less about tariffs and more about protection of investments and intellectual property, along with legal and regulatory steps to assure that the two-way flows of goods, services, investment, and people will not be impeded. It's possible to imagine a hypothetical WTO that would incorporate these rules. But the most likely outcome for the future governance of international trade is a two-pillar structure in which the WTO continues to govern with its 1994-era rules while the new rules for international production networks are set by a decentralized process of sometimes overlapping and inconsistent mega-regional agreements.","[Baldwin, Richard] Grad Inst, Int Econ, Geneva, Switzerland; [Baldwin, Richard] CEPR, London, England",Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Baldwin, R (通讯作者)，Grad Inst, Int Econ, Geneva, Switzerland.",rbaldwin@cepr.org,,"baldwin, richard/0000-0002-1965-4157",,,,,25,63,77,5,48,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The philosophical approach has been identified as critical of economics, leading in turn to the innovative response that by viewing the market as mutually beneficial exchange, economic practice is in fact defendable on virtue ethics grounds. This defends economics using arguments drawn from virtue ethics, but there is a need also to explore space for virtue ethics within economic theory. Examining key contributions of Kenneth J. Arrow, Amartya Sen and Elinor Ostrom, the article notes that virtue ethics' appreciation of persons' communicability of ends is increasingly being relied upon within economics, though sometimes under different names. Its strength to interdisciplinary work between economics and philosophy lies in presenting a methodology able to capture how human beings are capable of, though not fixated on, cooperation.","[Burbidge, Dominic] Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Burbidge, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England.",dominic.burbidge@politics.ox.ac.uk,,"Burbidge, Dominic/0000-0003-3732-2049",,,,,51,3,4,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

We aim to answer these questions in a stylized simple New Keynesian model where agents' beliefs are not homogeneous. Assuming that a fraction of agents can form their expectations by some adaptive or extrapolative schemes, we focus on an optimal monetary policy by second-order approximation of the policy objective from the consumers' utility function. We find that the introduction of bounded rationality in the New Keynesian framework matters. The presence of heterogeneous agents adds a new dimension to the central bank's optimization problem consumption inequality. Optimal policies must be designed to stabilize the cross-variability of heterogeneous expectations. In fact, as long as different individual consumption plans depend on different expectation paths, a central bank aiming to reduce consumption inequality should minimize the cross-sectional variability of expectations. Moreover, the traditional trade-off between the price dispersion and aggregate consumption variability is also quantitatively affected by heterogeneity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study experimentally investigates the time preferences of German farmers and students by comparing two methods of discount rate elicitation. The first method is based on the elicitation of time preference and risk attitude using two multiple price lists. Afterward, the discount rate is estimated by taking the risk attitude into account. The second method also uses a multiple price list approach; however, in contrast to the first method, probability discounting is applied for eliciting time preference. In this case, the individual risk attitude is not elicited separately, and no assumptions regarding the shape of the utility function are necessary. Both methods are conducted in two magnitude treatments, using 100 and 300 as a baseline. The results reveal that the ascertained discount rates of both methods are different for farmers in both magnitude treatments and for students in the 300 treatment. This result contradicts previous findings on the comparison of these two methods. Furthermore, only the method based on the measurement of time preference and risk attitude separately reveals significant responsiveness to the magnitude of the experimental payout.

East Asia's regional housing price cycles co-move strongly with the world housing price cycle in the long run, but relatively weak co-movement is found in the short run. Housing cycles in Greater China (China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) and Singapore co-move with Northeast Asia's regional housing price cycle in the long run, but this tendency fails to show up in the short run. Both domestic monetary and business-cycle effects are important in accounting for housing price cycles in China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan, while credit supply is crucial for Korea.

By eliminating the possibility of discrimination, net neutrality can reduce such distortion in the content market, and induce more efficient product choices.

However, recently the debate on the relative importance of private vis-a-vis social returns has been reinforced by contributions in two emerging fields of the applied econometric literature, namely spatial panel modeling and the common factor approach, which stress the role of cross-sectional dependence as a source for a potential estimation bias linked to the measurement of returns to R&D. In this paper, we account for these methodical advances when estimating sectoral knowledge production functions for OECD countries under weak and strong cross-sectional dependence. By doing so, we are able to uncover technology and trade-related R&D spillover channels associated with social returns to R&D, while effectively controlling for other types of productivity spillovers and latent macroeconomic shocks. Our results highlight the role played by international-intersectoral R&D spillovers for the social rate of return to R&D, while we get limited evidence for private returns to R&D once cross-sectional dependence is properly accounted for.

Given this popularity, in the related literature it is often claimed that the only open question left is an empirical one: to assess econometrically whether a particular economy is wage- or profit-led. In this essay, I will argue that some theoretical issues, related to this model and to the literature inspired by it, can nonetheless be raised. In particular, the treatment of investment appears to be the least convincing aspect of the approach a la Marglin-Bhaduri. More specifically, it seems possible to raise some doubts about an independent long-run influence of the profit rate or of the profit share on investment, an influence that is not in general justified or explained in detail by this literature and that to some extent is simply taken for granted. It will be shown that, if the Marglin-Bhaduri model is integrated with an explicit consideration of the autonomous components of demand, income distribution does not exert any permanent influence on the rate of growth of the economy and on the rate of accumulation. Matching this result with the usual assumption, made in post-Keynesian models of growth and distribution, that capacity utilization is the adjusting variable in equilibrating investment and savings leads to paradoxical results that question the plausibility of an accumulation function like the one used in the Marglin-Bhaduri model.","[Pariboni, Riccardo] Roma Tre Univ, Dipartimento Econ, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Pariboni, R (通讯作者)，Roma Tre Univ, Dipartimento Econ, Rome, Italy.",riccardo.pariboni@uniroma3.it,"Pariboni, Riccardo/AAP-3182-2020; PARIBONI, RICCARDO/AAD-6401-2021","PARIBONI, RICCARDO/0000-0002-5275-9559",,,,,39,16,17,1,4,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

A post-Keynesian view,REVIEW OF KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,inflation; Taylor rule,MONETARY-POLICY; MACROECONOMIC STABILITY; TIME,"Several explanations of the 'great inflation moderation' (1982-2006) have been put forth, the most popular being that inflation was tamed due to good monetary policy, good luck (exogenous shocks such as oil prices), or structural changes such as inventory management techniques. Drawing from post-Keynesian and structuralist theories of inflation, this paper uses a vector autoregression with a post-Keynesian identification strategy to show that the decline in the inflation rate and inflation volatility was due primarily to (i) wage declines and (ii) falling import prices caused by international competition and exchange-rate effects. The paper uses a graphical analysis, impulse response functions, and variance decompositions to support the argument that the decline in inflation has in fact been a wage and import price moderation. A Taylor rule differential variable was also used to test the 'good policy' hypothesis. The results show that the Taylor rule differential has a smaller effect on inflation, controlling for other factors.","[Perry, Nathan] Colorado Mesa Univ, Dept Business, Grand Junction, CO USA; [Cline, Nathaniel] Univ Redlands, Dept Econ, Redlands, CA 92373 USA",,"Perry, N (通讯作者)，Colorado Mesa Univ, Dept Business, Grand Junction, CO USA.",,,,,,,,57,8,9,1,12,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Regarding household decision process as a cooperative, simultaneous game between husband and wife, the empirical results show that spousal access to EPHI is negatively related to own EPHI access, indicating that household members as a unit prefer single EPHI access to dual access. Using family income share as a proxy for individual indirect utility, this study shows that the husband's incremental disutility of having spousal EPHI access is greater than that of the wife.","[Shiu, Ji-Liang] Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tang, Meng-Chi] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Chiayi 621, Taiwan",Renmin University of China; National Chung Cheng University,"Shiu, JL (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,"Tang, Meng-Chi/0000-0002-7175-7241",,,,,30,1,1,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

We find that the security of property varies with the experimentally available institutions and country-level indicators such as trust and quality of government. Subjects from countries with higher levels of trust are more likely to abstain initially from theft, devote more resources to production and support funding public protection of property through taxation.

Yet, a consensus still has not evolved on the issue. This paper explores the argument that the adverse distributional impact of remittances obtained by a number of studies could partially be due to the failure to control for existing differentials in the ability to migrate. We test the impact of remittances on household expenditures using data from the Kenyan Migration Household Survey and employing an instrumental variable quantile regression model to control for the unequal access to migration of rich and poor households. Our results indicate that while remittances increase household expenditure at all levels of the expenditure distribution, the impact is unambiguously greatest for poorer households. Hence, remittances, in and of themselves, improve both poverty and the distribution of income. This suggests that if remittances are to provide an impetus to development, recipient economies need to alleviate the credit constraints that restrict access to migration for the poor and the ability to send money home once the access bar has been overcome.

J,"Chaney, T",,,,"Chaney, Thomas",,,Liquidity constrained exporters,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL,,,English,Article,,,,,,International trade; Liquidity constraint; Heterogeneous firms,TRADE,"I propose a model of international trade with liquidity constraints. If firms must pay a fixed entry cost in order to access foreign markets, and if they face liquidity constraints to finance these costs, only those firms that have sufficient liquidity are able to export. A set of firms could profitably export, but are prevented from doing so because they lack sufficient liquidity. More productive firms that generate large liquidity from their domestic sales, and wealthier firms that inherit a large amount of liquidity, are more likely to export. This model offers a potential explanation for the apparent lack of sensitivity of exports to exchange rate fluctuations. When the exchange rate appreciates, existing exporters lose competitiveness abroad, and are forced to reduce their exports. At the same time, the value of domestic assets owned by potential exporters increases. Some liquidity constrained exporters start exporting. This dampens the anti-competitiveness impact of a currency appreciation. Under some conditions, it may reverse it altogether and increase aggregate exports. In this sense, the model is able to rationalize the co-existence of competitive devaluations and competitive revaluations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The bundled payment mechanism generates the largest reduction in patient length of stay (LOS) without altering the probability of readmission.

Our primary argument is that Williamson's work on public governance reflects an underdeveloped framework, mostly focusing on sovereign administration, and is not suitable for application to a host of other public services. It has the potential to corroborate any governance form that limits the usefulness of transaction cost theory (TCT) as an instrument of analysis and prediction. Although Williamson characterises TCT as an empirical success story, our application of it to the public-private dilemma for the water and sanitation sector finds very little historical and contemporary validity in this view.","[Dagdeviren, Hulya; Robertson, Simon A.] Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Dagdeviren, H (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Sch Business, Coll Lane, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",h.dagdeviren@herts.ac.uk,"Dagdeviren, Hulya/C-1679-2016","Dagdeviren, Hulya/0000-0002-4606-2042",,,,,106,8,11,0,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

When formal contracts are not enforceable, such efficiency-enhancing cooperations can be established via informal agreements, but relational contracts have been largely ignored in the literature on the international organization of value chains. In this paper, we develop a dynamic property rights model of global sourcing. A domestic headquarter collaborates with a foreign input supplier and makes two decisions in every period: i) whether to engage in a costly search for a better partner, and ii) whether to make a non-binding offer to overcome hold-up problems. Our key result is that the possibility to switch partners crucially affects the contractual nature of buyer-supplier relationships. In particular, some patient firms do not immediately establish a relational contract, but only when they decide to stop searching and thus launch a long-term collaboration with their supplier. Using firm-product-level data of fresh Chinese exporters to the US, we obtain empirical evidence in line with the predictions of our theory. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In standard theory, greater financial integration facilitates international borrowing and lending, helping to reduce the sensitivity of consumption growth to fluctuations in income. We examine the empirical validity of this prediction using an array of indicators of financial integration for a large sample of advanced and developing countries over the period 1960-2011. We report two main results. First, the sensitivity of consumption to income has declined over time as the degree of financial integration has risen. The decline has been more pronounced in advanced economies than in developing ones. Second, our regression analysis indicates that a higher degree of financial integration is associated with a lower sensitivity of consumption to income. This finding is robust to the use of a wide range of empirical specifications, country-specific characteristics and other controls, such as interest rates and outcome-based measures of financial integration. We also discuss other potential sources of the temporal changes in the sensitivity of consumption to income. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Islamaj, Ergys; Kose, M.

In this paper, we investigate the effects of intermediate input tariff reduction on the innovation activities of domestic firms. Input tariff reduction has two opposite effects on the innovation decision of a firm: it may promote innovation because the cost of innovation activities decreases, but it may also result in a decrease in innovation because foreign technologies become cheaper. We use Chinese firm-level data from 1998 to 2007, which features a drastic input tariff cut in 2002 because of China's WTO accession, and find that input tariff cut results in less innovation undertaken by Chinese firms. The findings are obtained using the difference-in-differences technique and are robust to various specifications checks of the model.

We find that differences in models' theoretical construct and assumptions can lead to divergences in their predictions about the consequences of U.S. shale gas boom. In general, models find that US. High Shale Gas scenario leads to increased U.S. production, lower global gas prices, and lower gas production in non-U.S. regions. Gas demand in Asia alone has little effects on U.S. production; but together with the shale gas boom, the U.S. can have a large export advantage. Overall, models find U.S. exports level range from 0.06 to 13.7 trillion cubic feet (TCF) in 2040. The comparison of supply, demand, and price changes in response to shocks reveals important differences among models. First is how the demand shocks were implemented and how the model responds to shocks: static and elastic within each time period vs. endogenous to the long-term gross domestic product (GDP) growth.

This is the first study to present a specific investigation on the decoupling of CO2 emissions and industrial growth in China from 1993 to 2013. Using an extended logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) model focusing on both energy-related and process-related CO2 emissions and introducing three novel investment factors, i.e., investment scale, investment share, and investment efficiency, we highlight and explore the remarkable role of investment in the mitigation and decoupling of CO2 emissions with industrial growth. The results show that China's industrial sector experienced the weak decoupling during 1993-2013. The investment scale is the most important factor responsible for the increase in CO2 emissions and the inhibition of the decoupling. The investment efficiency effect has a volatile trend and overall, it plays the most significant role in reducing CO2 emissions, followed by the energy intensity effect and process carbon intensity effect, whereas the energy mix, carbon coefficient, and investment share have marginal effects. Among 36 industrial sub sectors, the seven factors of RCMCP (raw chemical materials and chemical products), NMP (nonmetal mineral products), and SPFM (smelting and pressing of ferrous metals) have significant effects on the decoupling. Thus, the three sub-sectors should be among the top concerns for abating CO2 emissions. Finally, we provide policy recommendations considering both conventional and investment factors for China's industrial sector to realize emission reduction targets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We obtain linear equilibrium bidding strategies for both firms and a unique equilibrium of the auction, which is optimal ex-post for the dominant firm. Under specific distributional assumptions we conclude that the auction always awards less permits to the dominant firm than the cost-effective amount. Our results serve as a warning about the properties of auctioning under market power. Under interior solution the auction allocation is dominated by grandfathering in terms of aggregated cost with probability one. As a policy implication, the specific design of the auction turns out to be crucial for cost-effectiveness. The chances of the auction to outperform grandfathering require that the former is capable of diluting the market power that is present in the secondary market.","[Alvarez, Francisco; Andre, Francisco J.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Econ Anal, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"André, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Econ Anal, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",andre@ccee.ucm.es; fralvare@ccee.ucm.es,"Alvarez, Francisco/ABH-2320-2020; Andre, Francisco J./H-4613-2015","Alvarez, Francisco/0000-0003-0472-5255; Andre, Francisco J./0000-0002-6406-3305","Spanish Ministry of Science [ECO2012-39553-C04-01]; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF [ECO2012-39553-C04-01]; Andalusian Regional Government [SEJ 04992, SEJ-6882]","Spanish Ministry of Science(Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF(European Union (EU)); Andalusian Regional Government","This paper has greatly benefited from comments and fruitful discussion with Michael Finus and Carmen Arguedas.

If current-account disequilibria threaten the stability of the global economy, their origin can be found in internal imbalances and exchange-rate misalignments: positive output-gap shocks as well as currency overvaluation deepen current-account deficits. In addition, although variations in external imbalances mainly result from exchange-rate misalignments in the euro area, they are mostly explained by output gaps for non-eurozone members.","[Gnimassoun, Blaise; Mignon, Valerie] Univ Paris Ouest, Econ CNRS, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Mignon, Valerie] CEPII, Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay,"Mignon, V (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest, Econ CNRS, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",valerie.mignon@u-paris10.fr,,,,,,,60,19,19,1,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We match information about the ACUPCC to the US Department of Education IPEDS database to examine the impact of signing on student applications, admissions, and enrollment. We mainly utilize a difference-in-difference approach to identify the effects of interest but confirm results with an interrupted time series model. We find that signing the ACUPCC increases applications and admitted students by 2.5-3.5 %. However, the evidence regarding enrollment is weaker with only some specifications finding increases of around 1-2 %. Overall, there is considerable heterogeneity across sectors and selectivity of the institutions.

To test this perception, we use the case of India to establish in a standard SVAR model that global food prices influence aggregate prices and food prices in India. To further analyze these empirical results, we specify a small open economy New-Keynesian model including oil and food prices and estimate it using observed data over the period 1996Q2 to 2013Q2 by applying Bayesian estimation techniques. The results suggest that a big part of the variation in inflation in India is due to cost-push shocks and, mainly during the years 2008 and 2010, also to global food price shocks, after having controlled for exogenous rainfall shocks. We conclude that the inflationary supply shocks (cost-push, oil price, domestic food price and global food price shocks) are important contributors to inflation in India. Since the monetary authority responds to these supply shocks with a higher interest rate which tends to slow growth, this raises concerns about how such output losses can be prevented by reducing exposure to commodity price shocks.

Households' ability to self-insure against these shocks depends on how they affect local interest rates. In the United States, most borrowing occurs through the mortgage market and is influenced by the presence of government-sponsored enterprises (GSE). We establish that despite large regional variation in predictable default risk, GSE mortgage rates for otherwise identical loans do not vary spatially. In contrast, the private market does set interest rates which vary with local risk.

Trade liberalization in goods, if not accompanied by the liberalization of foreign direct investment (FDI) in services, induces the domestic firm to establish service facilities for repairing the foreign firm's products. This weakens the firms' competition in the product market, and the resulting anti-competitive effect hurts consumers and reduces world welfare. Despite the anti-competitive effect, trade liberalization may also hurt the foreign firm because the repairs reduce the sales of the imported good in the product market. Liberalization of service FDI helps resolve the problem because it induces the foreign firm to establish service facilities for its own products.","[Ishikawa, Jota] Hitotsubashi Univ, Fac Econ, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan; [Ishikawa, Jota] RIETI, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1008901, Japan; [Morita, Hodaka] Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Mukunoki, Hiroshi] Gakushuin Univ, Fac Econ, Toshima Ku, Mejiro 1-5-1, Tokyo 1718588, Japan",Hitotsubashi University; University of New South Wales Sydney; Gakushuin University,"Ishikawa, J (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Fac Econ, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.;Ishikawa, J (通讯作者)，RIETI, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1008901, Japan.",jota@econ.hit-u.ac.jp,"Mukunoki, Hiroshi/AAA-1210-2021","Mukunoki, Hiroshi/0000-0002-1390-6341; Morita, Hodaka/0000-0001-5996-008X","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [26220503, 24243034, 26380310]; Australian Research Council; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26220503] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We wish to thank two anonymous referees for insightful comments and suggestions.

Using household surveys from Mexico and 17 other Latin American countries, we separate the trend in the rate of informal employment into three effects: i) differences in years of education of successive generations of workers; ii) transitions between formality and informality during the working life of each generation; and labor market characteristics. We find that in Latin America there has been a slight reduction in labor informality, associated mainly with the first effect: recent generations of workers with more schooling have lower informality rates than previous ones. In the case of Mexico we also observe that younger generations of workers have more years of schooling than previous ones; however, this has not translated into lower informal employment due to adverse labor market characteristics. Thus, even though Mexico has experienced faster educational progress than the average of the region, its progress in reducing informality has been nil.","[Levy, Santiago] Banco Interamer Desarrollo, Washington, DC 20577 USA; [Szekely, Miguel] Ctr Estudios Educ & Sociales, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Inter-American Development Bank,"Levy, S (通讯作者)，Banco Interamer Desarrollo, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",SLEVY@iadb.org; mszekely@prodigy.net.mx,,,,,,,47,7,7,2,10,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Our approach is more generalized than the existing literature. When capital is sector-specific (i.e., it is in the short run), an increase in the degree of partial privatization will raise the unemployment rate, but the change of social welfare is conditional on the market share of the public firm and the relative degree of partial privatization. When capital is sector-mobile (i.e., it is in the long run), an increase in the degree of partial privatization will reduce the unemployment rate, but the change of social welfare is also dependent on the market share of the public firm and the relative degree of partial privatization.

We analyze a monopoly's optimal policy mix of price, advertising intensity, and referral fee when buyers choose to what extent to refer other consumers to the firm. When the referral fee can be optimally set by the firm, it will charge the standard monopoly price. The firm always advertises less when it uses referrals. We extend the analysis to the case where consumers can target their referrals. In particular, we show that referral targeting could be detrimental for consumers in a low-valuation group.

To analyze the source of performance gains, we decompose the predictive joint density into its marginals and a copula term capturing the dependence structure across countries. The GVAR outperforms forecasts based on country-specific models. This performance is solely driven by superior predictions for the dependence structure across countries, whereas the GVAR does not yield better predictive marginal densities.

We show that random utility models with idiosyncratic taste shocks driven by standard noise distributions produce, in large markets, robustly high equilibrium markups that are insensitive to the degree of competition. For example, with Gaussian noise and n firms, markups are asymptotically proportional to 1/root In n; consequently, a hundred-fold increase inn, from 10 to 1000 competing firms, only halves the equilibrium markup. The elasticity of the markup with respect to n asymptotically equals the distribution's tail exponent from extreme value theory. Only noise distributions with very thin tails have negative asymptotic markup elasticities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The paper shows that a model linking the price level to the process of structural transformation captures the non-monotonic pattern of the data. This provides additional understanding of real exchange rate determinants in developing countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The model predicts that the nominal wages of the trading countries exhibit stronger positive comovements when the countries fix their bilateral exchange rates, while comovements of real wages are not affected by exchange rate regimes. Our numerical experiments suggest that a reduction in trade costs increases both nominal and real wage comovements, regardless of regimes. When downward nominal wage rigidity is introduced, nominal wage comovements under the fixed regime remain stronger than under the flexible regime and the difference is smaller on the shorter time horizon, while a slight difference in real wage comovements between the two regimes shows up and is larger on the shorter time horizon. When we consider membership in the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union as a fixed exchange rate regime, panel regression results based on data from OECD countries are broadly consistent with our model and numerical experiments.

This study will address the problem of modelling residential relocation choice by estimating a logit-link class model. The proposed model estimates the probability of an event which triggers household relocation. The attributes considered in this study are: requirement for bedrooms, employment status, income status, household characteristics, and tenure (i.e. duration living at the current location). Accurate prediction of household relocations for population units should rely on real world observations. In this study, a longitudinal survey data gathered in the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) program is used for modelling purposes. The HILDA dataset includes socio-demographic information such as general health situation and well-being, lifestyle changes, residential mobility, income and welfare dynamics, and labour market dynamics collected from the sampled individuals and households. The technique presented in this paper links possible changes in households' socio-demographic characteristics to the probability of residential relocation by developing a mixed effects discrete-choice logit model (MEDCLM) for longitudinal binary data using the HILDA dataset.

We show that equilibrium donations are concentrated around a social norm. Despite a higher level of the public good, relatively poor and/or low altruism givers fare worse under social pressure and would avoid the solicitor at a cost. Aggregate donor welfare improves to the extent that the added social motive alleviates the underprovision of the public good; however, overprovision may result. Our theory therefore predicts a light-handed regulation for charitable solicitations, which is consistent with their exemption from the popular Do Not Call list in the U.S. We further show that contrary to pure altruism, a more equal income distribution may produce more of the public good. In fundraising campaigns where a social norm is not apparent, one may emerge endogenously if donors are not too heterogeneous. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Using first-born twins as an instrument for fertility, I find that, in Brazil, an additional child reduces the migration rate by 6 percent. The effect is stronger among women with younger children: a 20 percent reduction in the migration rate. Consistent with previous studies, fertility has a negative impact on women's labor supply and wages. Finally, two-stage least squares estimates reveal that migrant women are more likely to work and earn more than nonmigrant women, suggesting that the migration-deterrent effects of fertility might be one of the explanations for the inverse fertility-income relationship.","[Oliveira, Jaqueline] Rhodes Coll, Memphis, TN 38112 USA",,"Oliveira, J (通讯作者)，Rhodes Coll, Memphis, TN 38112 USA.",,,,,,,,41,1,6,2,16,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1932-8575,1932-8664,,J HUM CAPITAL,J.

We demonstrate that China's rural financial policy in the 1980s was quite liberal in employing market mechanisms, supporting entrepreneurship, and encouraging competition. These policies were abandoned in the early 1990s and replaced by ubiquitous government interferences that shifted resource and policy priorities to benefit political incumbents. A large panel of survey data confirms that rural household access to finance decreased dramatically in the 1990s and that the statistical significance of economic entrepreneurial factors in determining credit allocation also fell. Further empirical analyses show that market economic conditions are not sufficient to explain these changes and the evidence is consistent with a political entrenchment motive during the political regime after the turmoil in the year 1989. Given the connection between entrenchment and underdevelopment, our findings raise the concern that China's political institutions' insufficient limits on the government could be a challenge for China to sustain its economic success.

Using UK household data on food consumption, we estimate the Euler equation implied by a life-cycle model incorporating relative concerns for the consumption of rich households. According to both our OLS and GMM estimates, for the population of non-rich households as a whole, there is no evidence of such relative concerns. We also examine an alternative model of relative concerns in which households overconsume when exposed to higher reference group consumption, and find correlational evidence that this may be the case for food consumed away from home. Finally, we investigate the presence of heterogeneous relative concerns (across county and household characteristics) in both models, finding evidence of relative concerns (for consumption at the top) in counties with relatively low income inequality. This mechanism seems to operate for food consumed away from home. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The consequences of this revolution are felt even today. In Making Money: Coin, Currency, and the Coming of Capitalism, Christine Desan argues that this legendary transformation was not a one-off event, but a culmination of long-standing trends within the English monetary tradition. This review concedes Desan's point, but calls attention to other factors that were equally critical to the Bank's success: exceptional business and political acumen, active suppression of competitors, and lots of good luck. The importance of these factors is evidenced by the failure of attempted copycat institutions in other countries.","[Roberds, William] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta,"Roberds, W (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA.",,,,,,,,57,0,0,0,7,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Cultural theory hypothesizes that trust in political institutions originates in deeply rooted and long-standing cultural norms, which are transmitted through early-life socialization and thus are exogenous to political institutions. By contrast, institutional theory views political trust as a direct consequence of institutional performance. This paper studies political trust in Europe within a quasi-experimental framework of migration. Results using European Social Survey data by itself or merged with the Integrated Values Surveys suggest that Russian-born migrants exposed to Western European institutions have higher probability of political trust than Russian-born migrants in Eastern Europe.","[Shaleva, Anna E.] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Shaleva, AE (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy.",anna.shaleva@jrc.ec.europa.eu,,,"European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC)","European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC)(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre)","Funding from the European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), is gratefully acknowledged.",,25,1,1,0,21,J C B MOHR,TUBINGEN,"POSTFACH 2040, W-7400 TUBINGEN, GERMANY",0932-4569,1614-0559,,J INST THEOR ECON,J.

The literature has, however, lacked a detailed analysis of the effects of exchange rates on firms' survival behavior in emerging markets due to a scarcity of firm-level information. Using a firm-level dataset, we investigate the impact of currency appreciation on the survival behavior of Turkish firms in the manufacturing industries for 2002-2009. Our results suggest that real exchange rate appreciation decreases the probability of survival in the manufacturing industries. We also find that high-productivity firms have a higher probability of survival than low productivity firms following an appreciation of the exchange rate. Our findings indicate that the negative effect of a 1% real appreciation of the domestic currency on the survival probability of a given firm ranges from 4.5 to 9%, providing evidence for the vulnerability of developing countries to exchange rate movements. This evidence indicates that, especially for emerging market economies, economic events and policies leading to an appreciation in the domestic currency should be managed cautiously.

Variation declined temporarily for industrial factors, but not for agricultural factors. Sixteen factors displayed many city-specific price components, suggesting that they may have been subject to domestic trade restrictions.

By employing a data set covering two decades and encompassing more than 4700 individuals between ages 18 and 25, we find that, on average, the program increased the completed grades of education of rural youth by 1.1 years. Moreover, the effect was highly heterogeneous across gender and age of exposure. Rural girls benefited from water treatment more than rural boys such that the water treatment program completely eliminated the gender gap in education in treated villages. Young rural people with access to treated water in early childhood experienced significantly higher gains in schooling attainment (i.e., by more than a year) than those that gained access at later stages of life.

The combination of high-quality goods being relatively skill intensive with the Washington apples effect implies that countries at a larger distance from their trading partners display a higher skill premium.

We present a simple model that can account for the observed effects of financial globalization. The model emphasizes the role of imperfect enforcement of domestic debts and the interactions between domestic and foreign debts. Financial globalization can lead to a variety of outcomes: (i) domestic capital flight and ambiguous effects on net capital flows, investment, and growth; (ii) capital inflows and higher investment and growth; or (iii) volatile capital flows and unstable domestic financial markets. The model shows how the effects of financial globalization depend on the level of development, productivity, domestic savings, and the quality of institutions.","[Broner, Fernando; Ventura, Jaume] Univ Pompeu Fabra, CREI, Barcelona, Spain; [Broner, Fernando; Ventura, Jaume] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain",Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI); Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics,"Broner, F (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, CREI, Barcelona, Spain.;Broner, F (通讯作者)，Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain.",fbroner@crei.cat,"Broner, Fernando/A-8904-2013; Ventura, Jaume/F-7874-2013","Broner, Fernando/0000-0002-5507-9823; Ventura, Jaume/0000-0001-5566-9615",International Growth Centre; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2008-01666]; European Research Council [ERC263846-KFEM],International Growth Centre; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"Previous versions of this article circulated under the title Rethinking the Effects of Financial Liberalization.

We estimate models in both levels and growth rates and use our estimates to sectorally decompose the aggregate energy-GDP elasticity. Our estimates show that residential energy use is very inelastic to GDP if primary solid biofuels are counted in energy use tallies, especially at low income levels. Residential use of electricity is more tightly linked to GDP, as is energy use by the transportation, industrial, and services sectors. Agriculture typically accounts for a small share of energy use and has a modest energy-GDP elasticity. The aggregate energy-GDP elasticity tends to be higher for countries at higher income levels, in large part because traditional use of primary solid biofuels is less important. Gasoline prices, winter temperature, population, and land area are among other factors influencing sectoral energy use. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

More specifically, we employ Kalman filtering state-space models to gauge the relative importance of permanent and transitory components in China's overall foreign direct investment (FDI), equity, bond, other investment and bank credit flows. Our results show that only in the case of FDI are both gross inflow and net flow dominated by a permanent stochastic level, suggesting that this source of capital is largely permanent. Incorporating covariates into the state-space models, we find that a larger difference between onshore and offshore renminbi interest rates encourages capital inflows that are dominated by a transitory component. Greater global risk perception, proxied by S&P 500's volatility index, in contrast, discourages them. These covariates imply that capital control may not be effective in stemming volatile and speculative flows. Our results on bilateral capital flows between China and the USA also suggest that these flows are less persistent and more volatile during 1998-2014 than previously found based on 1988-1997 data. Our results bear important policy implications as China engages in further reforms in its domestic financial system and greater integration with the world financial system.","[Cai, Tao] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Dang, Vinh Q.

Making use of the existing correlations in international tourism demand to all seventeen regions of Spain, the performance of the proposed model is assessed in a multiple-step-ahead forecasting comparison. The results of the experiment in a multivariate setting show that the Gaussian process regression model significantly improves the forecasting accuracy of a multi-layer perceptron neural network used as a benchmark. The results reveal that incorporating the connections between different markets in the modelling process may prove very useful to refine predictions at a regional level.","[Claveria, Oscar] Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA Inst Appl Econ Res, Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Monte, Enric] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Signal Theory & Commun, Jordi Girona 1-3, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Torra, Salvador] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr & Stat, Riskctr IREA, Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Claveria, Oscar] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr, Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Claveria, O (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA Inst Appl Econ Res, Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.;Claveria, O (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr, Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",oclaveria@ub.edu; enric.monte@upc.edu; storra@ub.edu,"Claveria, Oscar/G-6741-2014; Torra, Salvador/A-3601-2015","Claveria, Oscar/0000-0001-9740-1852; Torra, Salvador/0000-0002-8786-8800",,,,,76,6,6,0,19,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

In the early stages of development, income inequality is beneficial for the formation of entrepreneurs through alleviating the credit constraints. In the later stages of development, however, it is income equality which stimulates the formation of entrepreneurs through alleviating the credit constraints. By the data of China's provinces over the period 2003-2012, this paper estimates the impact of income inequality on the formation of entrepreneurs using the system Generalized Method of Moments approach.

In this paper, we use a variety of empirical gravity models to estimate the currency union effect on trade and exports, using recent data which includes the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). We have three findings. First, our assumption of symmetry between the effects of entering and leaving a currency union seems reasonable in the data. Second, our preferred methodology indicates that EMU has boosted exports by around 50%. While other estimation techniques yield different results, a panel approach with both time-varying country and dyadic fixed effects on a large span of data (across both countries and time) seems to deliver insensitive and reliable results.

This study analyzes consumers' preferences for sustainable products as indicated by water and carbon footprint labels, enabling a rare cross-cultural comparison. We conduct discrete choice experiments in Canada and Germany to identify possible cross-cultural effects. Four products were considered contrasting food and non-food staple products, plant-based and animal based foods, and processed and unprocessed food items. Results from mixed logit models suggest that each national group of consumers is - irrespective of their cultural background - highly heterogeneous in the discounts required for them to purchase products with larger carbon footprints. The non-food product is discounted most with regard to water usage, followed by the plant product, suggesting that consumers make major category distinctions in their evaluations. German consumers are found to have stronger preferences overall for products with lower footprints than Canadian consumers. The nature of the significant differences in results across product categories and countries could aid industry and policy stakeholders in designing targeted footprint labeling initiatives.

It reports on the results of a discrete choice experiment conducted with a representative sample of the Dutch population consisting of 4986 participants. Under some conservative assumptions, we find that applied only to recorded music, a mandatory CCS could increase the welfare of rights holders and users in the Netherlands by over a,not sign600 million per year (over a,not sign35 per capita). This far exceeds current rights holder revenues from the market of recorded music of ca. a,not sign144 million per year. A monthly CCS fee of ca. a,not sign1.74 as a surcharge on Dutch Internet subscriptions would raise the same amount of revenues to rights holders as the current market for recorded music. With a voluntary CCS, the estimated welfare gains to users and rights holders are even greater for CCS fees below a,not sign20 on the user side. A voluntary CCS would also perform better in the long run, as it could retain a greater extent of market coordination. The results of our choice experiment indicate that a well-designed CCS for recorded music would simultaneously make users and rights holders better off. This result holds even if we correct for frequently observed rates of overestimation in contingent valuation studies.","[Handke, Christian] Erasmus Univ, ESHCC, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Handke, Christian; Balazs, Bodo; Vallbe, Joan-Josep] Univ Amsterdam, IViR, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of Amsterdam,"Handke, C (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, ESHCC, Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Handke, C (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, IViR, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",handke@eshcc.eur.nl; b.bodo@uva.nl; jjvallbe@uva.nl,"Vallbé, Joan-Josep/I-8070-2015; Bodo, Balazs/AHD-9878-2022; Handke, Christian/ABA-3208-2022","Vallbé, Joan-Josep/0000-0001-8327-7774; Bodo, Balazs/0000-0001-5623-5448; Handke, Christian/0000-0002-3976-0272",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [407-11-050],Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO; project number 407-11-050) and indispensable support by CentERdata, the administrator of the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel.

A broad interpretation of these findings is that the renminbi will likely be attractive to investors from high-income economies and fund-raisers from emerging market economies.","[He, Dong] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Luk, Paul] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wenlang] CITICS Secur, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China",International Monetary Fund; Hong Kong Baptist University,"Luk, P (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Econ, WLB 530,Wing Lung Bank Bldg Business Studies, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",paulskluk@hkbu.edu.hk,"Luk, Paul/AAW-7865-2020","Luk, Paul/0000-0002-5591-5211",,,,,24,2,2,2,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

As companies such as Netflix and Hulu increase their activities in this sphere, there are many unanswered questions about the impacts of this transition. In this paper, we attempt to foretell the impact of Internet-induced increased variety on the amount of time individuals devote to viewing television. We use cable and satellite television's impact on viewing as a proxy for the likely impact that future Internet transmission of programs will have. Using country-based panel data going back to the mid-1990s, we find that the increased variety brought about by cable and satellite has had virtually no impact on the amount of time devoted to television viewing.

The contract involves penalty interest rates after default, and favorable rates after success. Under some conditions, it also charges first-time borrowers higher rates than repeat borrowers, as in relationship lending, because the lender is constrained to keep borrowing attractive while using revealed information to price for risk. We compare the efficiency of a group lending contract (of the kind popularized by the microcredit movement) to the dynamic, individual contract. Both types of contracts reveal the same information, but the contracts face different constraints on using the information to improve risk-pricing. As a result, either type of contract can lead to greater efficiency depending on specifics of the environment - opening the possibility that dynamic lending has played a role comparable to that of group lending in the success of microcredit. We also characterize the optimal dynamic group contract when both lending techniques are feasible, and find that it combines both approaches, but with varying emphases. A recurrent theme is that in more marginal environments, dynamic lending performs relatively better than, and is prioritized over, group lending. We also discuss a number of extensions, including (spatially and serially) correlated risk and the effect of competition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this model of 'reciprocal load smoothing,' international trade provides insurance. As electricity demand is stochastic and correlated across jurisdictions, electric utilities can reduce their cost during peak periods by importing cheaper off-peak electricity from neighbouring jurisdictions. Two-way trade emerges in the presence of strongly convex marginal costs. Observed trade between Canadian provinces and US states strongly supports the theoretical model. Reciprocal load smoothing provides an economic rationale for integrating North America's fragmented interconnections into a continental 'supergrid' if technological progress in long-distance bulk transmission continues to reduce costs.

We use the empirical factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) method, which enables us to incorporate a wide range of economic activity factors into the analysis. The consumer confidence index (CCI) is chosen as the principal variable that is presumed to represent the degree of optimism on the state of economic activity. The results show that consumer confidence and economic activity are strongly correlated for manufacturing-related factors, such as industrial production and inventories.

We discuss the factors that influence selective sorting behaviour, and the most appropriate policies for their promotion. Based on the works analysed, our survey shows the original features of waste as an environmental problem requiring regulation. The traditional approach in which decisions respond to rational behaviour, particularly cost savings, has some limits. Although not all public policies seem justified, we argue that there might be a need for specific policies to promote recycling, preferably based on the provision of information to consumers or on behavioural instruments. Indeed, personal factors specific to each individual - such as emotions and the influence of social interaction - should be taken into account in the development of public policies. We review the literature related to different rationales and identify some avenues for future research.","[Kirakozian, Ankinee] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, F-06189 Nice, France; [Kirakozian, Ankinee] CNRS, GREDEG, F-75700 Paris, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur,"Kirakozian, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, F-06189 Nice, France.;Kirakozian, A (通讯作者)，CNRS, GREDEG, F-75700 Paris, France.",ankinee.kirakozian@gmail.com,,,,,,,100,30,32,3,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We formulate homogeneity tests of (i) the conditional choice and state transition probabilities, (ii) the steady-state distribution, and (iii) the conditional state distribution given an initial state. The null hypotheses of these homogeneity tests are necessary conditions (or maintained assumptions) for poolability of the data. Thus rejections of these null imply that the data cannot be pooled across markets. Acceptances of these null are considered as supporting evidences for the maintained assumptions of estimation using pooled data. In a Monte Carlo study we find that the test based on the steady-state distribution performs well and has high power even with small numbers of markets and time periods. We apply the tests to the empirical study of Ryan (2012) that analyzes dynamics of the U.S. Portland cement industry and assess if the data across markets can be pooled.","[Otsu, Taisuke; Pesendorfer, Martin] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London, England; [Takahashi, Yuya] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Johns Hopkins University,"Otsu, T (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, London, England.",t.otsu@lse.ac.uk; m.pesendorfer@lse.ac.uk; ytakahashi@jhu.edu,"Takahashi, Yuya/AAK-7135-2020","Pesendorfer, Martin/0000-0002-0547-8711",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB/TR 15],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank Stephen Ryan, Pierre Dubois, conference participants of the 14th CEPR-JIE Applied IO Conference, and seminar audiences in Alicante, Barcelona (Pompeu Fabra and Autonoma), Johns Hopkins, Kyoto, NYU, Paris School of Economics, Princeton, Texas Austin, UCL, UBC, and Wisconsin for thoughtful comments.

Analytically, it identifies two main channels by which learning-by-doing alters the optimal tax policy. First, learning-by-doing creates a motive for the government to use age-dependent labor income taxes. If the government cannot condition taxes on age, then a capital tax or progressive regressive labor income tax can be used in order to mimic age-dependent taxes. Second, a progressive/regressive labor income tax is potentially more distortionary in a model with learning by -doing since the distortion is propagated through the additional intertemporal link between current labor and future human capital. Quantitatively, I find that both of these channels are important for the optimal tax policy. Adding learning-by-doing leads to a notably flatter optimal labor income tax due to the second channel. Moreover, including learning-by-doing causes an increase in the optimal capital tax due to the first channel. I find that when solving for the optimal tax policy in the learning-by-doing model, the welfare consequences of not accounting for endogenous human capital accumulation are equivalent to around one percent of expected lifetime consumption, a majority of which are due to adopting too progressive of a tax policy.

We study how the endogenous structural transformation that results from subsistence affects the dynamics of the economy, the design of monetary policy, and the properties of inflation at different levels of development. A\ calibrated version of the model encompasses both rich and poor countries and broadly replicates the properties of inflation across the development spectrum, including the dominant role played by changes in the relative price of food in poor countries. We derive a welfare-based loss function for the monetary authority and show that optimal policy calls for complete (in some cases near-complete) stabilization of sticky-price non-food inflation, despite the presence of a food-subsistence threshold. Subsistence amplifies the welfare losses of policy mistakes, however, raising the stakes for monetary policy at earlier stages of development.","[Portillo, Rafael; Zanna, Luis-Felipe] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Portillo, Rafael] Joint Vienna Inst, Vienna, Austria; [O'Connell, Stephen] Swarthmore Coll, Econ, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA; [Peck, Richard] Innovat Poverty Act, New York, NY USA",International Monetary Fund; Swarthmore College; Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA),"Portillo, R (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.;Portillo, R (通讯作者)，Joint Vienna Inst, Vienna, Austria.",rmpeck@poverty-action.org; FZanna@imf.org; soconne1@swarthmore.edu; rmpeck@poverty-action.org,,,UK's Department for International Development [60925],UK's Department for International Development,This work was supported by the UK's Department for International Development [grant number 60925].,,38,4,5,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

This study compares these two methods based on the magnitude of their estimation bias of the disaggregated technical coefficient matrix. From simulations of the disaggregated Leontief matrix, this work calculates linkages and multipliers for common sectors derived from using either the Wolsky (1984) sectoral disaggregation or the Barrera-Lozano et al.

Our study shows that, if a competitive economy is sufficiently fair and free, a spontaneous economic order will emerge in long-run competitive equilibria so that social members spontaneously occupy an unplanned distribution of income. Despite this, the spontaneous order may degenerate in the form of economic crises whenever an equilibrium economy approaches the extreme competition. Remarkably, such a theoretical framework of spontaneous order provides a bridge linking Austrian economics and neoclassical economics, where a truth begins to emerge: Freedom promotes technological progress.","[Tao, Yong] Southwest Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China",Southwest University - China,"Tao, Y (通讯作者)，Southwest Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.",taoyingyong@yahoo.com,,,Ministry of Education of China [0903005109081-019]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [SWU1409444],"Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)",This article is dedicated to my mother.

However, very different policies ranging from presavings to indexation of retirement ages have been justified in this way. We develop an overlapping-generations model in continuous time that encompasses different generations with different mortality rates and thus longevity. Allowing for trend increases in both longevity and productivity, we address the normative issue of intergenerational equity under a utilitarian criterion when future generations are better off in terms of both material and nonmaterial well-being. Increases in productivity and longevity are shown to have very different implications for intergenerational distribution. Further, the socially optimal retirement age, dependency ratio, and intergenerational burden sharing in the case of a trend increase in longevity are shown to depend on how individuals' utility for time/leisure is affected by age and longevity.","[Andersen, Torben M.] Aarhus Univ, CEPR, CESifo, Aarhus, Denmark; [Andersen, Torben M.] IZA, Munich, Germany; [Gestsson, Marias H.] Univ Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland",Aarhus University; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Iceland,"Gestsson, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Inst Econ Studies, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.;Gestsson, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Dept Econ, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",marias@hi.is,,,,,,,40,4,4,1,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Statistical evidence strongly suggests that the US pork processing sector has a Hicksian Cobb-Douglas slaughtered pork demand that arises from applying Shephard's lemma to the sector's cost function and that US pork processors treat slaughtered pork and related futures positions as close factor substitutes. In the wake of major and ongoing futures market events and trends, this study establishes and statistically tests a theoretical link between futures price movements and impacts on the underlying slaughtered pork market through monthly formation of US pork processors' factor demand for slaughtered pork. Evidence suggests that demand agents shift between demands for the two substitutes based on movements in the slaughter/futures price ratio that results in a market-stabilizing cushion against sharp pork price movements such as those observed in the late-1990s. Statistical and diagnostic evidence suggests that our modelled non-experimental data and estimated Hicksian demand that arose from the cointegrated VAR model's cointegration space met Haavelmo's setting of passive variables and associated ceteris paribus conditions.","[Babula, Ronald A.] Keimyung Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Daegu, South Korea; [Miljkovic, Dragan] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58105 USA",Keimyung University; North Dakota State University Fargo,"Babula, RA (通讯作者)，Keimyung Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Daegu, South Korea.",dragan.miljkovic@ndsu.edu,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using longitudinal Belgian data and adjusting for family background and educational sorting, we find that second-generation immigrants, especially Turks and Moroccans, lag behind natives. In particular, we observe that immigrant students are less likely to finish secondary education or begin tertiary education on time. They are also less likely to transition into work successfully. These performance gaps are substantially larger for female immigrants. In addition, we study demographic behaviors to test the hypothesis that attributes the gender differences in educational and economic ethnic gaps to cultural differences between immigrants and natives.","[Baert, Stijn] Univ Ghent, Sint Pieterspl 6, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Baert, Stijn] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium; [Baert, Stijn] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain, Belgium; [Baert, Stijn] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Heiland, Frank W.; Korenman, Sanders] CUNY, Baruch Coll, Sch Publ Affairs, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Heiland, Frank W.; Korenman, Sanders] CUNY, Inst Demog Res, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Heiland, Frank W.] CUNY Inst Demog Res, Grad Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Korenman, Sanders] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Ghent University; University of Antwerp; Universite Catholique Louvain; IZA Institute Labor Economics; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System; City University of New York (CUNY) System; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Baert, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Sint Pieterspl 6, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.;Baert, S (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.;Baert, S (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain, Belgium.;Baert, S (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",Stijn.Baert@UGent.be,,"Baert, Stijn/0000-0002-1660-5165",,,,,48,16,16,4,50,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,JUN,2016,164.0,2,,,,,159,186,,10.1007/s10645-016-9273-4,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DU2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382023300003,0

The estimated threshold parameters suggest that this relationship changes when the unemployment rate transitions between regimes defined by 5.61% and 7.63%. During mild recessions and their subsequent recoveries, the time-varying estimates of the model indicate a negative relationship between both variables, consistent with the implications of a wage Phillips curve (WPC) derived from the standard New Keynesian model with staggered wage setting in Gall (2011). However, we find that this relationship breaks down during deep recessions and their recovery periods, which explains the difference between wage inflation predicted by standard New Keynesian models and the observed low wage growth in the aftermath of the 'Great Recession'. This finding and the fact that statistical tests strongly favor our three-regime model suggest that linear and two-regime models are insufficient to account for all the variability in the relationship between wage inflation and unemployment.

Buyers can privately observe the price only by paying a fee, and every time an agent does so, the price falls by a predetermined amount. We show that if the number of participants, n, is common knowledge, then in equilibrium a PRA replicates the outcome of a posted price mechanism. In particular, at most one buyer observes the price and the auction immediately finishes. In contrast, multiple entries can occur and profitability is enhanced when agents are uncertain about n. Under some conditions, a PRA may even yield higher expected revenues than standard auction formats.","[Gallice, Andrea] Univ Turin, ESOMAS Dept, Turin, Italy; [Gallice, Andrea] Coll Carlo Alberto, Via Real Coll 30, Moncalieri, Italy",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Gallice, A (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, ESOMAS Dept, Turin, Italy.;Gallice, A (通讯作者)，Coll Carlo Alberto, Via Real Coll 30, Moncalieri, Italy.",andrea.gallice@unito.it,"Gallice, Andrea/AAF-6465-2020","Gallice, Andrea/0000-0003-0250-9508",,,,,22,2,2,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.
