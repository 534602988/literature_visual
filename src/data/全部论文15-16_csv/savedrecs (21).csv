There have been found two basic factors of stakeholder trust -these are corporate reputation and organizational trustworthiness. Such factors as emotions, propensity to trust, experience with the organization and sociocultural factors, same as inborn factors or acquired during growth; factors related with the environment where the person lives or other factors are the secondary. It is suggested to divide the trust factors into controllable and uncontrollable by the organization. Finally, supposed two propositions were expressed: 1) controllable factors have a direct impact on every stakeholder's trust; 2) uncontrollable factors have an indirect impact on a consumer's trust. These propositions were reflected in a developed theoretical model of the impact of the trust factors on stakeholder trust. (C) 2015 The Authors.

It has been proposed that Six Sigma implementations enhance technological innovation of the SMEs; however, they are beneficial for companies in stable environments. Since Six Sigma programs are focused on variance reduction and efficiency, these initiatives are not very effective in dynamic environments, where the rate of technological change is dramatic. With their emphasis on variance-reduction and efficiency Six Sigma programs can be effective in enhancing incremental innovation. In addition, due to the focus of Six Sigma implementations on existing customers, they may impede innovation for new customers. Accordingly, implementing Six Sigma programs in fast pace environments with high level of innovation and change may be a challenge, and may not result in the expected outcome.

Several studies have highlighted the crucial role of human resource management and justice perceptions on employee turnover intention. The study will investigate the impact of performance appraisal justice on employees' turnover intentions under the influence of engagement and trust conceptualized in a moderated-mediation model. The use of a survey (quantitative) method with questionnaires is proposed as the option for data collection.

Do 'ethnicity-innovation' channels exist elsewhere? Ethnicity could influence innovation via production complementarities from diverse inventor communities, co-ethnic network externalities or individual 'stars'. I explore these issues using new UK patents microdata and a novel name-classification system. UK minority ethnic inventors are spatially concentrated, as in the USA, but have different characteristics reflecting UK-specific geography and history. I find that the diversity of inventor communities helps raise individual patenting, with suggestive influence of East Asian-origin stars. Majority inventors may benefit from multiplier effects.","[Nathan, Max] London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Nathan, Max] Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, London SW1P 3HE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Nathan, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Spatial Econ Res Ctr, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.a.nathan@lse.ac.uk,,"Nathan, Max/0000-0002-4617-4300",UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG); ESRC; DCLG; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); DCLG; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This paper draws on PHD research funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the Department of Communities and Local Government (DCLG).

Moreover, the spatial coherence of EU Cohesion policy and Czech national regional policy is as well considered. The empirical results do not provide evidence in support of this match. EU Cohesion policy funding does not compensate for the structural disadvantage of Czech micro-regions. Moreover, the spatial coherence of EU Cohesion policy and Czech national regional policy is missing. The territories, the support of which is regarded as desirable for the balanced territorial development by Czech national regional policy, do not show evidence of higher EU Cohesion policy funding.

The study involved two phases. In the first, the existence of data required for the application of the index in the cities was investigated, considering two criteria: data availability and data quality. Next, an extensive data collection procedure was conducted and the index values were calculated. The availability of the mobility information needed for the construction of the Index was used to explore which were the domains with missing information in each city or how the information was collected in the different cities. The mobility conditions in the selected cities were also compared so that the aspects that might drive some of them towards sustainable mobility could be identified. In general, the cities located in the wealthier part of the country performed better. The city sizes also seem to have affected their performance:The differences regarding the context are also among the highlighted aspects, given the marked regional dissimilarities among the cities that affect the availability and quality of the data.

The paper discusses the national public passenger transport or, more precisely, the public line transport and urban public transport (the trolleybus transport and the tram transport are governed by Railway Act No. 266/2004 Sb.). Passenger public transport is an integral part of the national economy and fulfils the important function -to ensure transportation of passengers and goods. It requires a good quality transport infrastructure, suitable means of transport, labour, fuel and energy. The performance and contribution of the passenger public transport must be monitored both financially and technically, technologically and, last but not least, environmentally. In doing so, not only the financial accounting, but especially the management accounting can be helpful. The paper presents the basic legislative rules, method of calculation of the provable loss and adequate profit in accordance with the Act on Public Transport, Subsidy System and the Method of Financing Provable Loss from the Public Budget. The accounting issue of passenger public transport in the double-entry accounting will also be analyzed. The calculation of the demonstrated loss and adequate profit will be exemplified on the report on costs and sales in the public line transport as well as based on the deficiencies of the explanatory power of this report. Then, the structure of costs in the internal accounting and the basic structure of sales in the public line transport will be analyzed. Finally, the paper draws attention to the removal of the above deficiencies which are valid in the new regulation on the procedures for establishing the financial model and determining the maximum amount of compensation. The new regulation suggests more detailed structure of the report of costs and revenues coming from transport activities; the basic report for calculation of provable loss and adequate profit is, however, the same. Some changes to this structure will be recommended. This paper is a part of the doctoral thesis which is being prepared. The presented part focuses on the review of the applicable legislation in the course of time and in relation to the trends, worsening or improvement of the explanatory power of the reported values for the financial analysis. It specifically concerns the economic issues in the national public passenger transport, the accounting issue, the method of calculation of the provable loss and the adequate profit upon the statement of costs and revenues from the transport activities. Then, the insufficient explanatory power of this statement is pointed out. Finally, the attention is paid to the elimination of drawbacks which stem from the new regulation.

This inconsistent and relatively low demand for management consulting services is generated by both the unacknowledged professionalism of those who provide consulting services in Romania and by the lack of proper promotion. For the study we used several sources and research tools such as questionnaire, interview and observation. Approximately 43.48 % of interviewed entrepreneurs and managers do not know the possibilities of the consultants, hence the lack of a proper promotion of the management consulting services.

Even though ISO/IEC 17025 specifies some requirements on laboratory work, they are not directly applicable for digital forensic laboratory, because digital investigation differs significantly from conventional laboratory work Nowadays emerging standards ISO/IEC 27041:2015, ISO/IEC 27042:2015 and ISO/IEC 27043:2015 are focused on digital evidence analysis procedures. These procedures are the main activities of digital forensic laboratories; however such procedures might also be conducted in other organizations. Standards listed above describe best practices of digital investigation in certain level of detail. Deploying these standards should improve communication with other parties involved in digital investigation and also improve quality of analysis of digital evidence. It is however a challenge to put these new standards into practice.

We have designed BPMN process map, which covers not only the main process (digital evidence analysis) but also secondary process (digital evidence analysis method construction).

It is employed, for example, as a basis for decisions within the European Union's subsidy policy. CBA enables to express the comprehensive effect of a project or a governmental regulation on social welfare and thereby to introduce expertise to political decision-making. However, its practical applications face many problems. Different methodological choices in performing CBA enable to obtain diametrically opposite conclusions. Moreover, the way how investors apply for EU Fund subsidies encourages CBA performers to adjust CBA results to requirements of subsidy applicants. The unavoidable consequence is frequently mendacious, unreliable and misleading CBA. The paper brings an overview of the flexibility in CBA methodological choices. It further focuses on analysing the CBA performance practice in the area of CBA project appraisal for the purposes of applying for EU funding. We examine the reasons for manipulating results using a theoretical analysis and support our findings by our own empirical survey among CBA performers. As our survey among commercial CBA performers uncovers, many entities performing CBA lack expert background for CBA performance and performed CBA are often biased and misleading. Our theoretical analysis shows its main reason: The person choosing and remunerating the CBA performer for the purposes of a project appraisal for EU funding is at the same time the subsidy applicant and thus with a clear interest in the optimistic result of the CBA. CBA performers are happy to oblige their customers. The remedy to this situation is to get rid of this unintentional alliance among CBA performers and subsidy applicants.","[Vejchodska, Eliska] Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies VYCERRO, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Vejchodská, E (通讯作者)，Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies VYCERRO, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.",eliska.vejchodska@seznam.cz,"Vejchodská, Eliška/AAL-7491-2020","Vejchodská, Eliška/0000-0002-2270-3589",,,,,30,5,6,1,10,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

When assessing the potential of benchmarking we need to take into account new technologies, broader social networking opportunities as well as issues such as social and environmental trends and changing natural characteristics.","[Zemanova, Barbora] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Zemanová, B (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",barbora.zemanova@upce.cz,"Zemanová, Barbora/JNE-8293-2023","Zemanová, Barbora/0000-0002-1015-1078",,,,,30,1,1,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,2794.0,2803,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700289,0

This paper contributes by using a trust framework to delimitate how stakeholders may influence managers' environmental decisions even if they are not focused on financial objectives. Specifically, we analyse how perceptions of academic department heads about their stakeholders' ability and benevolence influence the head's willingness to integrate sustainability issues into the syllabus of the courses. We also investigate the direct and moderating role of the heads' interest in financial aims and the direct influence of the school environmental proactivity. Our analysis includes a sample of 74 deans in 46 different business and engineering schools and a sample of 95 department heads in the field of management studies of 25 Spanish universities. The hierarchical moderated regression results confirm the positive influence of the ability and benevolence of the stakeholders and the heads' interest in the financial aims, but not the moderating effects and the influence of the school proactivity. The paper provides research implications on the stakeholders' dimensions influencing environmental decisions and practical implications showing that managers of organisations who wish to advance their environmental approaches may use partnerships with their stakeholders based upon trust.","[Delgado-Marquez, Blanca L.] Univ Granada, Dept Int & Spanish Econ, Campus Cartuja SN, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Alberto Aragon-Correa, J.] Univ Surrey, Surrey Business Sch, Fac Business Econ & Law, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Cordon-Pozo, Eulogio] Univ Granada, Dept Management, Campus Cartuja SN, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Enrique Pedauga, Luis] Univ Granada, Dept Econ, Campus Cartuja SN, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada; University of Surrey; University of Granada; University of Granada,"Delgado-Márquez, BL (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Int & Spanish Econ, Campus Cartuja SN, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",bdelgado@ugr.es; j.aragon@surrey.ac.uk; ecordon@ugr.es; pedauga@ugr.es,"Cordon-Pozo, Eulogio/AAE-4140-2021; Aragon-Correa, J.

One of the main ideas of the socialist market economic system which was set up in 1978 in China is 'those becoming rich earlier bring along other people, all achieving the common richer eventually'. However, after several decades, having performed a series of balanced development strategies and policies, is this purpose true or not? How about the outcome of regional level of planning strategies under the socialist-market system? This paper focus on the intra provincial development, and uses per capita GDP of Guangdong, one of the most developed provinces in China to analyse the economic development of prefecture-level cities from 1978 to 2013 with a new exploratory space-time method. Three conclusions can be drawn as follows: first, the degree of regional economic development is gradually deepening along with rapid economic development in Guangdong province and the per capita GDP difference is gradually widening between the Pearl River Delta region and the non-Pearl River Delta region. The core-periphery relation is clear within the provincial level's development. Second, the trend and position of space-time paths are different across regions. Third, the space-time paths have not intersected across poor and rich regions during the last 33 years. Widening uneven development is concealed by the 'fast growth' economic phenomenon. The macro-economic environment has had some effects on different regions, with the effect on fast growing areas, such as the core region of the Pearl River Delta the most obvious. There is a lag effect on other undeveloped areas. At the same time, under the socialist market economic system, the market is the main motivation behind regional discrepancies, and some policies and strategies aimed at narrowing the gap have had limited success.","[Gu, Jie] Urban Planning & Design Inst Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518028, Peoples R China; [Gu, Jie; Zhou, Suhong] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Suhong] Guangdong Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ye, Xinyue] Kent State Univ, Dept Geog, Kent, OH 44242 USA",Sun Yat Sen University; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kent State University Kent,"Zhou, SH (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Zhou, SH (通讯作者)，Guangdong Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",gujie198410@sina.com; eeszsh@mail.sysu.edu.cn; xye5@kent.edu,"ye, xinyue/A-7677-2011","ye, xinyue/0000-0001-8838-9476","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41271166, 41522104]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [15lgjc24]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This research has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41271166; 41522104) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (15lgjc24).,,44,6,8,4,45,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Many have proposed that this pattern reflects, relative to their heterosexual counterparts, higher levels of household labor among gay men and lower levels of household labor among lesbian women. Results show that gay men, parents in particular, spend more time in household production than heterosexual men. We find evidence of different time-use patterns for lesbians, but they are driven by characteristics not sexual orientation.

Bibliometric indicators, network citation, key-route path methods and term co-occurrence methods are used. The results show that the theory of international competitiveness starts not from neoclassical theories of international trade, but from models of competition, even though competitiveness is mostly measured using trade/export performance. Krugman's work on imperfect competitive markets and increasing returns of scale plays a most important role in knowledge diffusion on international competitiveness. The scientific development of analyzed concept is connected with six topics: trade performance, technology, liberalization, environmental regulations, location and productivity.

A firm can either offer a low price to attract new consumers and build future market share or a firm can offer a high price to exploit the partial lock-in of their existing consumers. This paper develops a theory of competition when overlapping generations of consumers have switching costs and firms produce differentiated products. Competition takes place over an infinite horizon with any number of firms. This paper shows that the relationship between the level of switching costs, firms' discount rate, and the number of firms determines whether firms offer low or high prices. Similar to previous duopoly studies, switching costs are likely to facilitate lower (higher) equilibrium prices when switching costs are small (large) or when a firm's discount rate is large (small). Unlike previous studies, this paper demonstrates that the number of firms also determines whether switching costs are pro- or anticompetitive, and with a sufficiently large (small) number of firms switching costs are pro- (anti-) competitive.","[Pearcy, Jason] Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Pearcy, J (通讯作者)，Montana State Univ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",jason.a.pearcy@gmail.com,,,Committee on Research Summer Fellowship; Research Enhancement Fund at Tulane University,Committee on Research Summer Fellowship; Research Enhancement Fund at Tulane University,"I thank Daniel Spulber (the editor), a coeditor, two reviewers, Stefano Barbieri, Michael Baye, Keith Finlay, Eric Rasmusen, Jay Shimshack, seminar participants at Tulane University, Montana State University, Purdue University, Quinnipiac University, Indiana University (BEPP), IUPUI, the Spring 2009 Midwest Economic Theory Conference, and the 2010 IIOC for helpful comments and suggestions.

I focus both on what is known about the genealogy as a data source, and what are the open questions for future research. Chinese genealogies contain records at the individual level. With the publication of new catalogs and efforts to collect genealogies, the number of genealogies is even larger than previously thought, with most dating to the late Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) Dynasties. These records contain a rich source of information about the Chinese population history, over a period for which there is no alternative source of information. Yet, the source still remains largely unexploited. Although the work of transcribing the data is significant, and selection biases need to be carefully considered, preliminary analysis of the data for a sample of married men for Tongcheng County in Anhui Province suggests these data are a rich source of information for demographic and economics research.","[Shiue, Carol H.] Univ Colorado, NBER, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Shiue, Carol H.] Univ Colorado, CEPR, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Shiue, CH (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, NBER, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Shiue, CH (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, CEPR, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",shiue@colorado.edu,,"SHIUE, CAROL/0000-0003-1890-318X",NICHD,NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"Thanks to Matthew Butner, Murat Iyigun, and Wolfgang Keller for comments and suggestions.

This paper uses New Institutional Economic theory to identify the key organizational features and potential inherent weaknesses of CFEs. NIE theory focuses on arguments of economic efficiency, specifically transaction cost reductions that serve as incentives for collective action by groups of owners. Examples are given to show how the organization of CFEs reduced transaction costs stemming from interactions with industrial loggers and service providers. However, the creation of these community enterprises goes beyond simple transaction cost reductions and economic justifications. Additional unquantifiable benefits, such as self-determination, control over resources that communities have historically used, application of acquired skills, political representation, and application of acquired skills to name a few, are also secured through community ownership. These benefits however do not come without a cost. As enterprises where ownership rights are incomplete or ill-defined and which do not operate with the incentives of investor-owned firms, CFEs have little to no initial capital pool and experience considerable investment limitations due to limited wealth, horizon problems, and unsolved issues with moral hazard vis-a-vis banks. CFEs also face important management and collective decision-making challenges. In spite of their institutional weaknesses, it is apparent that many societies have decided that the benefits of community ownership far outweigh their ownership costs. State intervention and policy have played an important role in building the necessary supportive framework for the development of these enterprises. NIE as a dominant model for understanding alternative entrepreneurial forms was useful for identifying some important aspects of CFEs that, in a profit-driven economy, can constitute weaknesses that place them at a disadvantage with investor-owned firms. This analysis informs where policy should be targeted if CFEs are to be supported and fostered. (C) 2016 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea.

ACE-protected farmland had a positive impact on nearby property values in one study county but a negative impact in the other. The paper also looks at the impact of forest land use, and discovers that preserved forest land had a positive impact on the nearby property values in both counties. House prices showed strong spatial correlation in both counties, and a spatial error components (SEC) model fit the data better than the OLS model, a spatial-lag model (SLM), or a spatial autoregressive error model (SEM). Geographically weighted regression (GWR) showed that the impact of ACE-protected farmland on nearby property values varied within one of the two study counties, with positive impacts in some parts of the county and negative impacts in other parts. The impact of forest cover on property values also varied, with positive impacts within both counties. A new hybrid GWR-SEC model is introduced that incorporates both spatial correlation in prices and spatial heterogeneity in the model parameters. Statistical goodness of fit measures showed that the GWR-SEC model fit better than the GWR model or a hybrid GWR-SEM model.

In Italy it has been long discussed to encourage the use of local public transport (LPT) through improvements to LPT quality after historically supporting it with the low price allowed by heavy subsidies and the design of urban mobility as a whole has been neglected, missing the goal of increasing the number of passengers. This paper intends to build an Index of perceived quality of LPT and investigate its relations with the use and satisfaction with ticket price in the twenty Italian Regions. The study also presents an analysis of the subsisting correlations between the Index of perceived quality, the use of LPT and satisfaction with the price paid for the service provided by public transport companies. This work takes into account both objective and subjective aspects of the service, through user perceptions (customer-based approach), because the assessment of the quality of the service through the user's eyes is considered essential for the implementation of any strategy aimed at increasing or consolidating the use of LPT. In order to measure the quality perceived by users recourse is made to an index constructed on the basis of selected variables from the latest Istat Multi-purpose Survey Aspects of daily life.' The index is obtained through the aggregation of individual indicators and by comparing the methodology known in the literature as the Borda index and factor analysis. The results confirm a low correlation between LPT quality and its utilization, although Italian LPT policies seem to neglect this evidence. The research shows: (i) a low correlation between the perceived quality of LPT and its utilization; (ii) the user satisfaction for the ticket price is however quite varied at the national level and does not seem to respond to particular spatial criteria (North/South) or to size; (iii) the improve of the performance of LPT by improving LPT alone is an ineffective endeavour.","[Burlando, Claudia; Musso, Enrico] Univ Genoa, Dept Econ, Via Vivaldi 5, I-16126 Genoa, Italy; [Ivaldi, Enrico] Univ Genoa, Dept Polit Sci, Genoa, Italy",University of Genoa; University of Genoa,"Burlando, C (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dept Econ, Via Vivaldi 5, I-16126 Genoa, Italy.",burlando@economia.unige.it,"Ivaldi, Enrico/AAI-7178-2020","Ivaldi, Enrico/0000-0001-6687-9378",,,,,45,7,7,2,13,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

By analyzing single-family and multi-family property sale transactions in Los Angeles (CA) during 2003 and 2004, this spatial hedonic study examines how the property value effects of rail transit can become volatile depending on housing markets, rail transit technologies, near-station land uses and transit development phases. By contrasting results from the spatial Durbin models and the Geographically Weighted Regression models with those from the conventional Ordinary Least Squares approach, the study shows the estimation accuracy can be improved considerably by controlling for the spatial dependence effect. Proximity to mature rail transit stations generally benefits multi -family property values, but the effect is negative for single-family properties. Residents (especially those from single-family households) seem to favor proximity to heavy rail transit more than light rail services. The premiums for rail transit accessibility also largely depend on different development phases and can be heavily discounted by the existence of Park-and-Ride facilities. This study provides policy makers with new empirical evidence and analytical tools to revisit value capture as a financing alternative and to reform investment strategies for rail transit services.

Hypothesis of our paper is that transition had a positive impact on the growth rate of TFP and its share in the GDP growth. We employ growth accounting methodology to estimate TFP and structural break tests to estimate total number and location(s) of structural break(s) in the estimated TFP series. In order to test for the robustness of our results we combine different sets of assumptions and derive 18 different TFP series. The fundamental results of the paper imply that transition had a positive effect on the TFP growth rate, but it did not have statistically significant effect on the relative importance (share) of TFP in GDP growth rate. Structural break tests have indicated two statistically significant break locations in the TFP growth rate data. The first break in 1979 is closely connected with overall slowdown of growth, while the second break location in 1993 can be attributed to the transition reforms. Estimated locations of the structural breaks are robust over all 18 estimated TFP series. The basic conclusion from this research is that transition reforms have managed to spark the growth of the overall economy as well as TFP, but the relative importance of the TFP vis a vis other growth factors such as human or physical capital did not significantly change.","[Kristic, Irena Raguz; Druzic, Ivo; Tica, Josip] Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, JF Kennedy Sq 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Kristic, IR (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, JF Kennedy Sq 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",iraguzkristic@efzg.hr; idruzic@efzg.hr; jtica@efzg.hr,"; Tica, Josip/B-7628-2013","Druzic, Ivo/0000-0003-4976-1938; Tica, Josip/0000-0001-7937-1573; Raguz Kristic, Irena/0000-0002-1422-9282",Croatian Science Foundation [7031],Croatian Science Foundation,"This work is supported by the Croatian Science Foundation, project number 7031.

In our statistical analysis we examined the legal situation of bouncing checks in three periods: before 2009 when the issuance of bad checks was subject to imprisonment, between 2009 and 2012 when a partial decriminalization took place and between 2012 and 2014 when the issuance of bouncing checks was fully decriminalized and penalties were reduced to only administrative fines. We test the hypotheses that partial or full decriminalization led to a rise in the number of bad checks in Turkey. We find that there is no statistical evidence for an association between the first, modest step of the decriminalization process (Law No. 5941) and the frequency with which checks bounced in Turkey. However, full decriminalization of bouncing checks (Law No. 6273) led to an increase in the frequency of bad checks. We also find that the establishment of a Risk Center by the Bank Association of Turkey helped to identify customers not worthy of credit and was successful in decreasing the frequency of bad checks. We conclude that in the case of Turkish check law imprisonment was more effective in deterring writers of bad checks than the administrative and civil sanctions that are now in place. Nonetheless, private credit screening efforts also promoted the targeted policy goal of limiting the number of bad checks in Turkey.","[Babaoglu, Basak; Wulf, Alexander J.] Univ Hamburg, Inst Law & Econ, Hamburg, Germany; [Wulf, Alexander J.] SRH Hsch Berlin, Ernst Reuter Pl 10, D-10587 Berlin, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Wulf, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Law & Econ, Hamburg, Germany.;Wulf, AJ (通讯作者)，SRH Hsch Berlin, Ernst Reuter Pl 10, D-10587 Berlin, Germany.",basakbabaoglu@gmail.com; alexander.wulf@srh-hochschule-berlin.de,,"Wulf, Alexander J./0000-0001-6477-2761",,,,,27,3,3,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

With this in mind and the steadily increasing electricity generation from renewable energy sources in Germany, electrically driven vehicles can be an attractive option to reach the climate targets of the EU and the German government. The target of the German government to have at least one million electric vehicles registered by 2020 seems currently far from realisation. For this reason, this article analyses the total cost of ownership (TCO) of electric passenger vehicles in Germany on a component-based approach and gives an estimation about the further development until 2050. To represent the German market, we investigate different vehicle sizes, user types and drive technologies. Furthermore, we show the CO2 abatement potential offered by different types of electric vehicles. Finally, we analyse buyer's premiums as an incentive to accelerate the uptake of electric vehicles on German roads. In result, even without governmental subsidies, full and mild hybrid electric vehicles are already an economic option for a wide range of vehicle sizes and user types. To achieve nowadays cost competitiveness for full electric vehicle powertrains, considerable buyer's premiums are necessary. For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles, the premiums range from about 8,600 to 32,400 EUR2010/vehicle depending on the vehicle size and user type. Eventually, following the future cost estimations, full electric vehicles can reach economic viability from 2030 onwards for many of the investigated vehicles and users. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

I construct a simple model of malicious litigation, wherein malice is defined by the plaintiff's obtaining some utility whenever the defendant incurs costs. When plaintiffs are malicious, they are more likely to file even non-meritorious suits; both probability of filing and the plaintiff's settlement payoff increase in the plaintiff's malice. However, if the defendant is also malicious, obtaining utility when the plaintiff incurs litigation expenses, settlements may fail even with complete information. Two-sided malice deters filing over a certain parameter range; outside it, it raises the ratio of cases that go to trial instead of being resolved through settlement. Giving the defendant the right to call for a bar on settlement is less effective at deterring malicious lawsuits relative to non-malicious negative-expected-value (NEV) or nuisance suits. However, combining the optional settlement bar with a commitment requirement stipulating that the plaintiff commit to going to trial (rather than withdraw) whenever the defendant opts to defend discourages malicious litigation for a wider range of parameters.

Our paper analyzes the impact of the oil refinery acquisition, a backward integration strategy, on the airline's financial and operational performance, for the period Q1 2010 to Q2 2015, and we argue that the resource dependence theory best explains Delta Air Lines' acquisition. The methodology involves descriptive statistics and short-term stock performance as well as an econometric model that estimates the impact of the oil refinery acquisition on Delta Air Lines' net income using quarterly financial and airline operating metrics data. The results indicate that it is too early to ascertain whether Delta Air Lines' oil refinery acquisition has any positive impact on its financial performance since the variable of interest is insignificant in predicting the airline's net income. Despite the apparent lack of positive impact of its oil refinery acquisition, however, the stock market has rewarded Delta Air Lines' strategy resulting in its share prices outperforming the S&P 500 and the XAL, an index of major airline stocks, in the 60-trading day period following the announcement of its acquisition.

One such context, little explored by social choice theorists, is metaethical. Ideal-advisor' accounts, which have played a major role in metaethics, propose that moral facts are constituted by the idealized preferences of a community of advisors. Such accounts give rise to a preference-aggregation problem: namely, aggregating the advisors' moral preferences. Do we have reason to believe that the advisors, albeit idealized, can still diverge in their rankings of a given set of alternatives? If so, what are the moral facts (in particular, the comparative moral goodness of the alternatives) when the advisors do diverge? These questions are investigated here using the tools of Arrovian social choice theory.","[Adler, Matthew D.] Duke Law Sch, 210 Sci Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Adler, MD (通讯作者)，Duke Law Sch, 210 Sci Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",adler@law.duke.edu,,,,,,,47,2,2,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

This paper examines the effects of the Black Death in England. Specifically, did it merely change relative factor prices, or did it lead to lasting gains in the efficiency of the economy after 1348? Extensive wage and price data from England 1210-1800 suggest that the population losses of the Black Death were associated with a surprising increase in economic efficiency, despite the decline in the scale of the economy. But this efficiency gain disappeared when population rose again in the 16th century. There is no sign of a connection between a labor scarce economy, and a switch to faster long run economic growth through technological advance.","[Clark, Gregory] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Clark, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",gclark@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,78,10,12,0,30,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

We find significantly negative stock price responses of almost -5% around the dawn raid and -2% around the final decision, and a significantly positive response of up to 4% around a successful appeal. These numbers correspond to a total market value loss of (sic)24 billion around the raid and the decision, of which roughly 75% cannot be explained by fines and legal costs. The stock market thus anticipates a decrease in profitability and reputational damage. The magnitude of the market response depends on the fine, infringement duration, and in particular firm size and media attention. Small firms suffer more from an infringement decision. Greater newspaper coverage is associated with a more pronounced response, suggesting the importance of reputational effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

As is well known, with independent projects the economic efficiency of the entire investment plan is maximised if projects are selected according to their benefit-cost ratio until the budget is exhausted. Often, however, the planning of a project involves a stage where a set of alternative concepts or designs are considered. A best alternative is chosen, and the plan is composed from the pool of all such best alternatives. This procedure violates the assumptions underlying the benefit-cost ratio criterion. In this paper, we set out the correct criterion to use. A real-life example from Norwegian transport planning is provided to show how the global setting into which the project is going to compete, matters for the selection criterion to be used.

Based upon the Behavioral Perspective Model, the present research proposed that consumers maximize utility as a function of the level of utilitarian (functional) and informational (social) reinforcement offered by brands. A model of consumer choice, which applied a Cobb-Douglas utility function to the parameters that constitute the Behavioral Perspective Model, was constructed and data from a consumer panel, including information from more than 1200 consumers purchasing four food products during 52 weeks, were used to test the model. The model fits the data well, showing consistent parameters and stable individual differences in utility across time.

The few published studies mostly consist of indirect (attitudinal) measures of behavior instead of a direct measurement of the actual variables of interest-consumer economic choice. Furthermore, published research does not focus on motivational operations despite marketing's emphasis on needs, wants, and personalized marketing. In the current paper, we extend the examination of the Behavioral Perspective Model as a conceptual system for managerial decision making in e-mail marketing. The experiment tested the applicability of motivational operations and utilitarian and informational contingencies for e-mail marketing for a hardware and home improvement chain selling bicycle helmets. A motivational-segmentation analysis of the marketing database was performed prior to the experiment based on the target product appropriateness for consumers. After the segmentation, different types of e-mails based on altered utilitarian contingencies or a combination of utilitarian and informational contingencies were sent to two groups from the same marketing database of registered consumers interested in receiving special offers. The results showed that the e-mail marketing's effectiveness were greatest when motivational-based segmentation and economical (utilitarian) contingencies were applied.

In the case of urban bus systems, priority, operational and control measures are aimed to elevate bus services to buses with high level of service (BHLS). Even though there is an explosive growth in design and operational measures implementation and growing research interest in investigating their impact on performance indicators, there is lack of a systematic evaluation of their benefits. We present an evaluation framework and a detail sequence of steps for quantifying the impacts of public transport design and operational measures. The effects of service performance on travel times and costs are assessed by accounting for relations between reliability and waiting times, crowding and perceived travel times, and vehicle scheduling and operational costs. The evaluation integrates the implications of reliability on generalized passenger travel costs and operational costs. We deploy the proposed evaluation framework to a field experiment in Stockholm where a series of measures were implemented on the busiest bus line. The results suggest that the total passenger and operator benefits amount to 36.8 million Swedish crowns on an annual basis. The overall assessment of the impacts of design and operational measures enables the comparison of different implementations, assess their effectiveness, prioritize alternative measures and provide a sound basis for motivating investments.

They considered the introduction of this scheme an exogenous policy change and because they could distinguish a control group (both non-subsidized vehicles and the same vehicles in Slovenia) and a treatment group (subsidized vehicles), before and after the introduction of the Plan, the authors were able to carry out their analysis as a quasi-natural experiment. The study reveals that manufacturers increased vehicle prices by 600 on average. In terms of sales, econometric estimations revealed that the Plan would not cause any increase in sales. With regard to environmental efficiency, comparing the costs (invested quantity of money) and the benefits of the program (reductions in polluting emissions and additional fiscal revenues) and it has been found that the Plan would only be beneficial if it boosted demand by at least 30%.

JSY provides a cash incentive to socioeconomically disadvantaged women for childbirth at health facilities. This study explores some unintended consequences of JSY. Using data from two large household surveys, we examine a policy variation that exploits the differential incentive structure under JSY across states and population subgroups. We find that JSY may have resulted in a 2.5-3.5 percentage point rise in the probability of childbirth or pregnancy over a 3-year period in states already experiencing high population growth.","[Nandi, Arindam; Laxminarayan, Ramanan] Ctr Dis Dynam Econ & Policy, 1400 Eye NW,Ste 500, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Nandi, Arindam; Laxminarayan, Ramanan] Publ Hlth Fdn India, Gurgaon, India; [Laxminarayan, Ramanan] Princeton Univ, Princeton Environm Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Public Health Foundation of India; Princeton University,"Nandi, A (通讯作者)，Ctr Dis Dynam Econ & Policy, 1400 Eye NW,Ste 500, Washington, DC 20005 USA.;Nandi, A (通讯作者)，Publ Hlth Fdn India, Gurgaon, India.",nandi@cddep.org,"Laxminarayan, Ramanan/ABD-5050-2021","Nandi, Arindam/0000-0002-3967-2424",,,,,46,20,24,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

This paper discusses a macro variable forecasting methodology that combines model uncertainty and regime switching simultaneously. The proposed predictive regression specification permits both regime switching of the regression parameters and uncertainty about the inclusion of forecasting variables by employing Bayesian model averaging. In an empirical exercise involving quarterly US inflation, we observed that our Bayesian model averaging with regime switching leads to substantial improvements in forecast performance, particularly in the medium horizon (two to four quarters).

However, much less attention has been directed to the inland sea at Europe's northern edge: the Arctic. Increasingly, as the Arctic becomes attractive to non-Arctic European capitals as a potential site of investment and (in)security, European states, and perhaps the EU as a whole, are seeking to construct the Arctic, like the Mediterranean, as a space that is both marginal and central to the continent's future. This paper seeks to investigate the extent to which the Arctic is, to paraphrase Viljhalmur Stefansson, Europe's Polar Mediterranean' and what this means for Europe as it constructs institutions and identities that, as in the Mediterranean, use the concept of the inland sea to both incorporate and differentiate its internal and external others.'","[Steinberg, Philip E.] Durham Univ Lower Mountjoy, Dept Geog, S Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England",,"Steinberg, PE (通讯作者)，Durham Univ Lower Mountjoy, Dept Geog, S Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",Philip.steinberg@durham.ac.uk,,,Geography and Spatial Science and Arctic Social Science programmes of the US National Science Foundation ('Territorial Imaginaries and Arctic Sovereignty Claims') [BCS-0921436]; European Union' Marie Curie International Incoming Fellows programme ('Global Alternatives for an Interconnected Arctic') [IIF-GA-2010-275846],Geography and Spatial Science and Arctic Social Science programmes of the US National Science Foundation ('Territorial Imaginaries and Arctic Sovereignty Claims'); European Union' Marie Curie International Incoming Fellows programme ('Global Alternatives for an Interconnected Arctic'),Parts of this paper are based on research funded by the Geography and Spatial Science and Arctic Social Science programmes of the US National Science Foundation ('Territorial Imaginaries and Arctic Sovereignty Claims' - grant number BCS-0921436) and the European Union' Marie Curie International Incoming Fellows programme ('Global Alternatives for an Interconnected Arctic' - grant number IIF-GA-2010-275846).,,56,8,8,1,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

This study considers whether and how poor test ratings might induce anti-consumption behaviors, out of fear of poor product performance. In contrast with previous research, the focus for this study is not intrinsic reasons for anti-consumption but rather actual purchasing, or non-purchasing, behavior. With panel data representing 30,000 households, the authors show that the market shares of national brands and private labels considerably decline after the publication of poor test ratings, suggesting high customer churn and anti-consumption behavior. The use of price promotions for national brands also declines, leading to increasing average paid prices. Among private labels, though, poor test ratings affect the use of price promotions and paid prices only to a small extent. These findings in turn suggest implications for manufacturers, retailers, consumers, and scholars.","[Olbrich, Rainer; Jansen, Hans Christian; Teller, Benedikt] Univ Hagen, Chair Mkt, Hagen, Germany",Fern University Hagen,"Olbrich, R; Jansen, HC; Teller, B (通讯作者)，Univ Hagen, Chair Mkt, Hagen, Germany.",rainer.olbrich@fernuni-hagen.de; hans.jansen@fernuni-hagen.de; benedikt.teller@fernuni-hagen.de,,,,,,,59,6,6,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

Yet how borrowers respond to such regulations remains largely unknown. Drawing on both administrative and survey data, we exploit variation in payday-lending laws to study the effect of payday loan restrictions on consumer borrowing. We find that although such policies are effective at reducing payday lending, consumers respond by shifting to other forms of high-interest credit (for example, pawnshop loans) rather than traditional credit instruments (for example, credit cards). Such shifting is present, but less pronounced, for the lowest-income payday loan users. Our results suggest that policies that target payday lending in isolation may be ineffective at reducing consumers' reliance on high-interest credit.","[Bhutta, Neil] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Goldin, Jacob] Stanford Law Sch, Stanford, CA USA; [Homonoff, Tatiana] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Stanford University; Cornell University,"Bhutta, N (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",,,,,,,,38,38,51,0,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Therefore new approaches for vocational education and training (VET) governance are being introduced and tested by Latvian public administrators responsible for the implementation of the VET reform. The role of co-operation between the local governments, the local entrepreneurs and VET providers is the key aspect in the new governance approach aiming at improved labour market training with closer links between the worlds of education and work. The aim of the research is to study the opinions of local stakeholders regarding new approaches in the implementation of the VET reform and VET governance for improved labour market training. The research is based on an empirical study implemented in Latvia - a survey among public administrators and employers, as well as a focus group discussion with social partners at local level. Research methods applied: studies of scientific publications and policy documents; a survey and focus group discussions. The conclusions have been drawn based on the analysis and comparison of the opinions of local public administrators and entrepreneurs regarding the introduction of new approaches in VET provision and VET governance at local level. The key finding: the VET systems should be more integrated into the local/regional administrative, economic, employment and societal contexts. This implies a close coordination between the public administrations, the education, training and employment providers. This also implies the new role of local public administrations in potentially taking the lead in developing locally/regionally more integrated VET approaches - taking into consideration that VET in Latvia is primarily under the supervision of the centralised government. Consequently, the development of novel VET governance models in compliance with the improved legal framework and corresponding to the local characteristics is needed.","[Buligina, Ilze; Sloka, Biruta] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Buligina, I (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",ilze.buligina@gmail.com,"Sloka, Biruta/K-5043-2017",,,,,,11,2,2,1,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,136.0,146,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200011,0

It is a form of additional higher education in management, because it provides knowledge and skills that enable students to master business processes more easily, and to adapt to globalisation processes (more) quickly and painlessly. Managers run companies and projects with the purpose of achieving maximum business results through the direct control of labour performance and considerable financial resources. For someone to become a good manager or project manager it is not enough to be talented for the job or to have a wish to do it. Those are no more than good motivations for a person to embark on the challenging journey of acquiring the variety of knowledge and skills without which they cannot expect to do the demanding and responsible managerial work successfully.

One way to develop these skills and proactively manage conflict is by understanding and assessing the outcomes of channel members' behaviors, orientations, and structural ties. There is a need for empirical investigations into understanding conflict implications within new organizational forms. This research fills this need through an empirical investigation of how conflict resolution unfolds within relationships, how episodic specific conflict can impact performance outcomes, and how exit barriers affect/change perceptions/outcomes within the conflict-resolution process.

One such area of growing importance for today's organizations is project management. This approach plays an important role in a dynamic, complex and uncertain environment, providing a response to accelerated competition, increased economic pressures, and rapid technological change. Use the project management by small and medium-sized enterprises enables cost reduction and facilitates the introduction of new products and services to the market, primarily including innovative solutions in response to individual and changing client requirements. However, project management should be implemented with consideration for the individual needs and possibilities of specific business entities, including SMEs.

The paper is based on a questionnaire survey/analysis with sample of 179 TMTs from high-tech firms in China. The conclusion exhibits that TMT task-related diversity has a strong effect on a firm's strategic focus on ambidextrous innovation through strategic decision-making activities. The findings suggest that the TMT debate and decision comprehensiveness can mediate the relationship between TMT task-related diversity and a firm's strategic focus on ambidextrous innovation. Overall, these results suggest that involvement in debate and comprehensiveness of strategic decision activities may bring out the potential of a TMT's diversity in enabling them to focus on ambidextrous innovation strategy.","[Li, Ci-Rong; Liu, Yan-Yan; Ma, Hong-Jia] Jilin Univ, Sch Management, Changchun 130023, Peoples R China; [Lin, Chen-Ju] Tzu Chi Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mkt & Distribut Management, Hualien, Taiwan",Jilin University; Tzu Chi University of Science & Technology,"Liu, YY (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Sch Management, Changchun 130023, Peoples R China.",j2015242005@gmail.com,,,"Training Program on Major Research Project of Social Science Foundation of Jilin University, China [2015ZDPY19]; Humanity and Social Science on Youth Fund of the Ministry of Education [15YJCZH084]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China [2015R0031]; Ministry of Science and Technology Individual Research Grant of Taiwan [MOST 103-2410-H-002-SSS]","Training Program on Major Research Project of Social Science Foundation of Jilin University, China; Humanity and Social Science on Youth Fund of the Ministry of Education; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); Ministry of Science and Technology Individual Research Grant of Taiwan","This work was supported by the Training Program on Major Research Project of Social Science Foundation of Jilin University, China [grant number 2015ZDPY19]; Humanity and Social Science on Youth Fund of the Ministry of Education [grant number 15YJCZH084]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China [grant number 2015R0031]; partially supported by Ministry of Science and Technology Individual Research Grant of Taiwan [grant number MOST 103-2410-H-002-SSS].",,55,26,30,6,196,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Also, they present a strikingly different set of challenges and opportunities in their pedestrian environments. The need to enhance our understanding of environmental attributes, which encourage pedestrians to participate (or not) in walking and walking-related activities, has prompted this pedestrian-scale face-to-face questionnaire survey on one developing city. This paper has three aims, namely: examine the pedestrian decision making process, apply the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to empirically define the hierarchy of pedestrian needs (criteria), and examine the relative priorities of environmental attributes (alternatives) that satisfy the pedestrian needs, with the end goal of realising a positive walking environment. A total of 70 respondents were collected via face-to-face questionnaire survey which was rolled out in the Quiapo District (Manila, Philippines). Results of this study demonstrated the feasibility of AHP in supporting an evidence-based approach to defining the pedestrian need hierarchy. Moreover, it established that the most important criteria is protection rather than mobility. Traditionally, the design of pedestrian facilities (e.g. sidewalks/pathways) was premised on the need to move. Moreover, based on the survey, the relative priority of the criteria in the order of most important to least important priority is: protection, ease, equitable access, mobility, identity and enjoyment. This comprises the pedestrian need-hierarchy, which served as the theoretical framework of this paper. This paper presents an alternative approach at quantifying qualitative criteria and attributes that served relevant to the pedestrian decision-making process. Moreover, this research sheds light on the importance of a user-centred needs-assessment approach to better understand pedestrian decision-making and behaviour.

The statistical data show a significantly different pace and level of economic development in rural areas in Latvia, including Vidzeme Planning Region. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the factors determining the differences mentioned above. Koceni and Mazsalaca Counties were selected for an expanded research in Vidzeme Region. The goal of this research is to identify the factors influencing the differences of economic development among counties, thus serving as the basis for creating a model of balanced and sustainable rural and regional development in the context of smart development. In order to identify the factors that determine the level and pace of the development in the research area and affect their performance, the authors have used the monographic method, carried out a statistical data analysis and interviewed focus groups of municipal staff, entrepreneurs and representatives of non-governmental organizations. The article examines theoretical concepts of sustainable and smart spatial development, depicts comparative analysis of economic development indicators in Koceni and Mazsalaca Counties in the context of sustainable development of rural areas. In the course of analysis, the main groups of factors influencing economic growth in rural areas were identified. The most important factors influencing performance of the area are: geographical location; entrepreneurial capabilities of residents; municipality's attitude and support to entrepreneurship; intensity of cooperation among the municipality, entrepreneurs and non-governmental organizations. The theoretical and practical results of the research will be used in the process of selecting indicators for creating a sustainable development model of rural areas and regions, as well as for defining proposals for the municipalities' policy performance in the context of development of smart territories.","[Melbarde, Vija; Ore, Maira] Vidzeme Univ Appl Sci, Riga, Latvia",Vidzeme University of Applied Sciences,"Melbarde, V (通讯作者)，Vidzeme Univ Appl Sci, Riga, Latvia.",vija.melbarde@va.lv,,,,,,,12,2,2,1,6,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,484.0,495,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200041,0

Some sites lost their functional use while others were redeveloped or newly developed. Site-specific factors were crucially important for particular sites to succeed. Therefore, this paper explores associations between selected theoretically substantiated site-specific factors and four types of development sites, namely brownfields, stable sites, redeveloped sites and newly developed greenfield sites, in the Ostrava metropolitan area in the late 2000s. The results indicate that ownership structure, transport accessibility and threat of environmental burden were statistically significant discriminating factors between the four types of development sites. Further insights into the associations were gained from decision rules induced by using the rough-set method. Typical combinations of site-specific factors that classified sites as one of the four types of development sites were revealed, creating a typology of development sites in the model area.","[Nekolova, Jana; Hajek, Oldrich; Novosak, Jiri] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Publ Sect Adm & Law, Dept Reg Dev, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Nekolova, J (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Publ Sect Adm & Law, Dept Reg Dev, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",nekolova@fame.utb.cz; hajek@fame.utb.cz; novosak@fame.utb.cz,"Hájek, Oldřich/H-6464-2012",,"Czech Science Foundation [16-22141S, IGA/FaME/2016/010]",Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"The authors are thankful for grant No. 16-22141S provided by the Czech Science Foundation for financial support to carry out this research, and also for grant No. IGA/FaME/2016/010 which provided financial support for this research.",,47,5,5,0,7,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Its core part delivers four case studies summarising existing published examples of practical problems connected with efficiency performance measurement. The first example shows that in the Czech conditions the prevalence of economy to efficiency in public tendering evaluation creates important problems. Second and third cases demonstrate visible pervasive effects connected with performance financing. The last case shows existing gaps in the Czech practice of performance measurement performance appraisal for public employees and especially the fact that salaries and bonuses are not at all linked to performance.","[Nemec, Juraj] Masaryk Univ, Lipova 507-41a, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Nemec, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Lipova 507-41a, Brno, Czech Republic.",juraj.nemec@umb.sk,"Nemec, Juraj/M-5467-2013",,,,,,13,1,1,1,12,NEWTON COLL AS,PRAHA 1,"POLITICKYCH VEZNU 10, PRAHA 1, 110 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87325-06-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,134.0,143,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF3UG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380582900015,0

Our overriding objective of this study was to explore critically the contribution of customers' brand orientation as well as other vital constructs such as social media engagement, (e)vendor reputation and (e)WoM on repeat purchasing intention amongst cosmopolitan consumers in eMarketplace context. Data were collected through a non-probabilistic sampling technique from cosmopolitan consumers in one of the EU-27 countries, Slovakia. Data was analysed using the Partial Least Squares structural equation modelling. This study modelled online consumers' repeat purchasing decision using constructs such as brand orientation, vendor reputation, vendors' social media site engagement. The study found that brand orientation leads to a higher perception of vendors' reputation online. The findings showed that a positive and significant relationship exists between brand orientation and consumers engagement with vendors' social media site. Furthermore, this study found that vendors' reputation has a significant effect on (e) WoM. Importantly, this study confirmed the substantial effect of (e) WoM on repurchase intentions. These findings imply that online retail brands should 'push' their product offerings via some of the popular social networking sites (SNSs) and, importantly, endeavour to keep track of those online users in the social media community who most likely have affinity towards their brands and/or other similar brands. By and large, the paper has demonstrated that the studied constructs are key in consumers' decision making online. Hopefully, the findings of the research will assist the online retail vendor in its execution of (robust) customer friendly policies.","[Osakwe, Christian Nedu; Chovancova, Miloslava] Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management & Mkt, Zlin, Czech Republic; [Boateng, Henry] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Commun, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Popa, Simona; Soto-Acosta, Pedro] Univ Murcia, Dept Management & Finance, E-30001 Murcia, Spain",Tomas Bata University Zlin; University of Technology Sydney; University of Murcia,"Osakwe, CN (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management & Mkt, Zlin, Czech Republic.",osakwe@fame.utb.cz; Henry.Boateng@student.uts.edu.au; sp.popa@um.es; chovancova@fame.utb.cz; psoto@um.es,"Popa, Simona Petronela/AAK-7598-2021; Osakwe, Chris N./AAN-6706-2020; Osakwe, Christian Nedu/E-2558-2015; Popa, Simona/H-8292-2015; Chovancova, Miloslava/H-6542-2012; Soto-Acosta, Pedro/B-3927-2011","Popa, Simona/0000-0003-3161-1106; Chovancova, Miloslava/0000-0002-9244-9563; Soto-Acosta, Pedro/0000-0003-4308-9781",TBU in Zlin [IGA/FaME/2015/039]; Fundacion Cajamurcia,TBU in Zlin; Fundacion Cajamurcia,This work was to a degree supported by an internal grant from TBU in Zlin (IGA/FaME/2015/039) and by Fundacion Cajamurcia.,,85,8,8,1,54,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Looking at the methodology's subdisciplines, we notice significant differences in their adoption in practice. While subdiscipline continuous data assurance and continuous controls monitoring appear to be rather popular, continuous risk monitoring and assessment seems to be implemented rather seldom. As decisive differentiator, continuous risk monitoring and assessment makes use of key risk indicators, while the other two subdisciplines use key performance indicators instead. We therefore hypothesize that the low adoption rate of continuous risk monitoring and assessment is effected by the popularity of key risk indicators. In a field study, we carried out interviews with auditors of eight German companies from five different industries to learn about their understanding of key risk indicators in general, as well as of perceived advantages, preconditions, and weaknesses of key risk indicators. We find that auditors have a slight pessimistic attitude towards continuous risk monitoring and assessment and key risk indicators. This is mostly attributable to the interviewees' perception of key risk indicators being imprecise and of continuous risk monitoring and assessment requiring additional resources for proper functioning. Also, key risk indicators are seen as sound supplement, but not as substitute for traditional risk identification activities.","[Wagner, Johannes Martin] Univ West Hungary, Fac Econ, Sopron, Hungary; [Wagner, Johannes Martin] Business Bros GmbH, Dusseldorf, Germany",,"Wagner, JM (通讯作者)，Univ West Hungary, Fac Econ, Sopron, Hungary.;Wagner, JM (通讯作者)，Business Bros GmbH, Dusseldorf, Germany.",jmwagner@businessbrothers.de,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,3573.0,3577,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700360,0

Hence, information asymmetry within vertical hierarchies may increase social welfare by inducing them to sell products that appeal to a larger number of consumers.

Under the assumption that the cartel-induced share on turnover is representative for the entire cartel period and for all affected markets, the overall consumer damage would even sum up to about 315 million euros. Our results further suggest that the retailers reacted to the price increases of the cartel firms via price increases for their own detergent products, resulting in significant umbrella effects. We quantify the damage due to this umbrella pricing to a total of about 7.34 million euros. With respect to the discussion whether special procedures for bringing collective actions should be available in the EU, our results are important in that we show how consumer associations can use consumer panel data in order to claim damages before national courts and thereby actively fulfill their mandate of consumer protection.","[Laitenberger, Ulrich; Smuda, Florian] Competit & Regulat Res Grp, ZEW Ctr European Econ Res, Leuven, Belgium; [Laitenberger, Ulrich; Smuda, Florian] MaCCI Mannheim Ctr Competit & Innovat, Mannheim, Germany; [Laitenberger, Ulrich] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Laitenberger, U (通讯作者)，Competit & Regulat Res Grp, ZEW Ctr European Econ Res, Leuven, Belgium.",laitenberger@zew.de; florian.smuda@.gmail,,"Laitenberger, Ulrich/0000-0002-7009-0190",,,,,18,7,8,3,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

First, trade today is shaped as much by the exchange of components as finished goods. Second, low-wage country imports into advanced economies like the US have risen dramatically since the early 1990s. We pay special attention to the timing of trade impacts. Consistent with prior work, technological change is confirmed as the key driver of inequality before 1990. After 1990 the growth of wage inequality is primarily a consequence of rising import competition from low-wage economies. We account for the growing fragmentation of production using a panel model focusing on within rather than between-industry shifts in inequality. Lags of key variables are used as instruments, and our results appear robust to broad concerns with endogeneity and to different measures of skill-biased technological change.","[Rigby, David; Cooke, Abigail] UCLA Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Kemeny, Tom] London Sch Econ Geog & Environm, London, England",,"Rigby, D (通讯作者)，UCLA Geog, 1255 Bunche Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",rigby@geog.ucla.edu; tomkemeny@gmail.com; abigail.cooke@gmail.com,"Kemeny, Thomas/D-1544-2010","Kemeny, Tom/0000-0003-4984-9104; Cooke, Abigail/0000-0002-3758-6629","National Science Foundation [0961735]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0961735] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [0961735] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",The authors acknowledge the help of two referees whose comments significantly improved the quality of this paper.

The critical-interpretative picture of an extended period of 180 years is complemented by an empirical approach, an original issue in accounting history. Empirical findings based on cluster analysis confirm the existence of six influential factor groups and the intergroup interdependency and provides a fundamental explanation for the effect of factors' combination. The political system has an influence over the economic system, which impacts accounting development, the reporting and disclosure system required by users. The connection between legal and economic factors decided the type of accounting legal system. Socio-cultural factors affected the accounting policies and decided accountancy's progress, closely linked to the educational factor whose strong influence impacted the accounting theory and practice. All this results are a benchmark for other emergent countries.","[Nistor, Cristina Silvia; Deaconu, Adela; Mare, Codruta] Univ Babes Bolyai, Fac Econ & Business Adm, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Nistor, CS (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, Fac Econ & Business Adm, R-3400 Cluj Napoca, Romania.",cristina.nistor@econ.ubbcluj.ro; adela.deaconu@econ.ubbcluj.ro; codruta.mare@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Mare, Codruta/ADC-6680-2022; DEACONU, Adela/E-3889-2013; MARE, Codruta/AAZ-9390-2020; Nistor, Cristina Silvia/G-2735-2017","Mare, Codruta/0000-0002-4920-7462; DEACONU, Adela/0000-0002-7898-2740; MARE, Codruta/0000-0002-4920-7462; Nistor, Cristina Silvia/0000-0002-4246-1847",,,,,38,2,2,3,19,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

It is based on an evaluation conducted by the authors in 2010-2012 - a before and after study of measures partfunded by a Norwegian government funding program for improved accessibility in six different cities. The article employs a two-pronged empirical approach; quantitative surveys of all passengers on the affected routes (supplemented by interviews with drivers and personnel), and qualitative case studies with individual public transport users with disabilities. The first part of the article describes how universal design measures are perceived by and affect passengers in general, and discuss whether such measures may lead to an increase in the number of passengers. The second part considers how such measures influence the experience of travelling for passengers with disabilities, and what it takes for disabled passengers to be able to use public transport on par with other citizens. We conclude that previous surveys, which have not included control cases and questions, have probably overestimated passenger effects of universal design measures, as the results are affected by demographic factors. We still find that the measures have a positive impact on patronage. Like earlier studies, we find that the majority of respondents having trouble using public transport, report that this is due to bringing a pram or heavy luggage. We hypothesize that positive effects on passenger numbers due to reduced expulsion, (i.e. that certain groups are able to continue using public transport for a longer period when it is universally designed) may mean that effects on passenger numbers can increase over time. We find that in terms of social economics, universal design is profitable even with fairly low passenger numbers. The case studies demonstrate that although universal design measures contribute to enabling persons with disabilities to use public transport, such measures should be analyzed as parts of a transport system, not separately. The various elements of the system, including the people employed in it, must continuously work together to maintain universality. This goes for maintenance as well as for services provided by drivers. To secure mobility for people with disabilities, it is also essential that the systemis predictable and that accessibility is from door-to-door, not only from bus-stop to bus-stop.

In contrast to the popular MIDAS approach that employs an (exponential) Almon or Beta lag distribution, we adopt a penalized least-squares estimator that imposes some degree of smoothness to the lag distribution. This estimator is related to nonparametric estimation procedures based on cubic splines and resembles the popular Hodrick-Prescott filtering technique for estimating a smooth trend function. Monte Carlo experiments suggest that the nonparametric estimator may provide more reliable and flexible approximations to the actual lag distribution than the conventional parametric MIDAS approach based on exponential lag polynomials. Parametric and nonparametric methods are applied to assess the predictive power of various daily indicators for forecasting monthly inflation rates. It turns out that the commodity price index is a useful predictor for inflations rates 20-30 days ahead with a hump-shaped lag distribution.

This article studies the effect of firms' political connectedness on court outcomes using a unique hand-collected data set of 3,323 commercial lawsuits involving listed companies in China. We find robust evidence that Chinese courts favor state firms and private firms with personal political ties. The positive effect of political connectedness is pronounced in the outcomes of litigation but not arbitration and is less pronounced in regions with better legal institutions. We also find that locally connected firms are favored in their home courts but not when the case is tried outside their home province. There is some evidence that China's 2007 Property Law reduces the advantage of state firms.

Drawing on extensive qualitative research, this paper illustrates how healthy volunteers selectively import the identity of hustler' from the street environment and reposition it as connoting a set of valuable creative skills that give them a competitive edge over other participants. An entrepreneurial ethos allows them to view personal sacrifice and exposure to potentially dangerous drugs as smart investments leading to financially stable futures.

Studies on equity and bond markets have explored the effects of dispersion in forecasts on the predictive power of forecasts; however, no earlier paper has investigated such effects in the context of the foreign exchange market. This study explores the role of consensus forecast dispersion as a factor leading to bias and anchoring in exchange rate forecasts. Our analysis of five currency pairs reveals that consensus forecasts mostly appear to be unbiased predictors of exchange rates in the long run, but most are unable to pass tests for short-run unbiasedness. In three of the five currencies examined it appears that forecasters should take greater account of reported forecast dispersion.

Within a given country, it would have an economic impact in many areas, in particular on governments. Our objective is to quantify the respective impacts on the public finances of an electrically powered or petrol fuelled private car. In order to do this, we establish an integrated method of valuation, covering both manufacture and use of the vehicle, with location of these two stages within or outside the country concerned. From a depth perspective, it incorporates the economic proceeds from the different activities and what they consume, and from a breadth perspective it incorporates the fiscal effects (VAT, fuel and energy taxes, tax on production, etc.) and the effects on social accounts (social contributions, unemployment benefits). The valuation method is based on an input output model of the productive economy within a country, combined with mechanisms of fiscal and social transfer. We hypothesize an additional type of activity for the Manufacture of electric vehicles, and we model it within the intersectorial matrix associated with production. Application of the method to France reveals first that the impact of a vehicle on the public finances is substantial: manufacture contributes approximately the purchase price excluding VAT, and usage adds an amount of the same order of magnitude. The vast majority of the revenues (approximately 70%) arise from the social contributions associated with production, including the opportunity value of employment; VAT accounts for almost 20%, tax on production around 5%, and energy taxes 9% for a CV vehicle or 1% for an EV. Then, four cases for substitution of EV to CV are set up and assessed, depending on the places either domestic or foreign in which the vehicle is manufactured and used, respectively. In the base case, where the vehicle is both manufactured and used inside the country, substituting an EV to a CV would be financially neutral for public finances at least before any purchase incentive bonus. The export case, where an EV is substituted to a CV in domestic production but then exported and hence used outside the country, yields an additional revenue of about 8000 to the domestic public finances (without bonus); the import case has an opposite effect. Lastly, the twofold substitution of an imported EV to a domestically manufactured CV for domestic use would entail a loss of about 20,000 (without bonus). Therefore, for France the purchase incentive bonus can be justified mainly by the stakes of energy independence and domestic industry at the national scale or of environmental quality at the urban scale.

We have decomposed the annual emission changes into components representing changes in average emission of fossil fuels, fossil fuel share from road freight transport, fossil fuel intensity from road freight transport, road freight transport intensity and gross domestic production. The decomposing analysis results have shown that economic growth is the principal factor driving the CO2 emission growth. Changes in average emission of fossil fuels is the primarily factor driving the CO2 emission changes. For road freight transport-related components, effects of fossil fuel share, fossil fuel intensity, and road freight transport intensity are all found secondary responsible for CO2 emissions changes. They have a main role especially in driving CO2 emissions increase. This study also shows that, given the drastically decline of economic growth since the popular revolution in 2010, the reduction of CO2 emissions become more difficult by the absolute decoupling of road freight transport from economic growth. The relative decoupling by switching to less emission intensive transportation modes, may the adequate solution. To this end, sustainable freight transport policy in Tunisia could apply some fiscal, economic and technical instruments to reduce fossil fuels consumption and CO2 emissions related to the road mode.

However, F&O (1982, Regional Science and Urban Economics, 12: 161-196, 1989, Environment and Planning A, 21: 363-374) show that rents and employment density are flat or falling as the city center is approached, while in the simulations of L&RH (2002, Econometrica, 70: 1445-1476), rents rise at an increasing rate toward the center suggesting a concentration of employment near the center. For the Lucas and Rossi-Hansberg model, we prove that land rents and density must be flat or falling near the center. We explain how using a polar coordinate system when approximating a two-dimensional integral can create systematic imprecision in their simulations, and then present revised simulations.

Portugal has been in the forefront of the most active European countries in the market of PPPs, having adopted a specific legal framework and involving a large number of institutions in its PPP process. PPPs have had high costs for the State, with transparency issues leading to difficulties assessing performance and accountability. This paper attempts to relate those pitfalls of the Portuguese experience with PPPs with the regulatory framework that was adopted and changed along the decades, at the light of theory of regulation. It is a first step in further exploring the relationships between regulatory aspects and PPP performance in the Portuguese case. Several lessons can be learned from Portuguese experience to enhance the processes of successful implementation of PPPs. The paper addresses these elements and provides evidences on pitfalls that should be avoided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

While representative polling has historically proven to be quite effective, it comes at considerable costs of time and money. Moreover, as response rates have declined over the past several decades, the statistical benefits of representative sampling have diminished. In this paper, we show that, with proper statistical adjustment, non-representative polls can be used to generate accurate election forecasts, and that this can often be achieved faster and at a lesser expense than traditional survey methods. We demonstrate this approach by creating forecasts from a novel and highly non-representative survey dataset: a series of daily voter intention polls for the 2012 presidential election conducted on the Xbox gaming platform. After adjusting the Xbox responses via multilevel regression and poststratification, we obtain estimates which are in line with the forecasts from leading poll analysts, which were based on aggregating hundreds of traditional polls conducted during the election cycle. We conclude by arguing that non-representative polling shows promise not only for election forecasting, but also for measuring public opinion on a broad range of social, economic and cultural issues.

A legal entity permits an owner to create a firm as a bundle of contracts that can be transferred to someone else, but only if they are transferred together. This bundled assignability allows for a balancing of several potentially conflicting interests. First, the owner who assembles the contracts wants liquidity - that is, the ability to transfer the contracts and cash out. Second, the firm's contractual counterparties want protection from opportunistic transfers that will reduce the value of the performance they have been promised. And third, the owner wants long-term commitments from the firm's counterparties to protect the value of her investments in the bundle. Because transfers of equity interests in a legal entity will generally not be considered assignments of the entity's contracts, entities reduce the contracting costs of creating bundled assignability. We find that owners will prefer bundled assignability when investments in the bundle are alienable from the owner; but when investments are specific to the owner, contracts that prohibit changes of control are optimal.

Smart grids are seen as the silver bullet responding to the challenge of integrating renewables, managing flexibility, and keeping the costs down in distribution networks. Network unbundling on the other hand is essential for competition in the liberalized electricity industry. It forces independence of the networks and thereby eliminates concern that incumbent integrated (network) firms discriminate against new entrants. With smart grids the unbundling questions become relevant for distribution networks, because active control in smart grids entails discrimination potentials. However, smart grids exhibit coordination needs for efficient system operation and unbundling eliminates firm-internal coordination. Accounting for both aspects, this paper proposes an independent system operator to govern smart distribution grids. It eliminates discrimination incentives and serves coordination needs, thereby striking a balance between both competition and efficiency goals.","Bremer Energie Inst, D-28759 Bremen, Germany",,"Friedrichsen, N (通讯作者)，Bremer Energie Inst, Coll Ring 2,Res V, D-28759 Bremen, Germany.",friedrichsen@bremer-energie-institut.de,,,Next Generation Infrastructures within the project UNECOM; German Federal Ministry of Economics within the research project IRIN Innovative Regulation for Intelligent Networks [FKZ 0328007A],Next Generation Infrastructures within the project UNECOM; German Federal Ministry of Economics within the research project IRIN Innovative Regulation for Intelligent Networks,"Financial assistance from Next Generation Infrastructures within the project UNECOM and from the German Federal Ministry of Economics within the research project IRIN Innovative Regulation for Intelligent Networks (grant number: FKZ 0328007A) is gratefully acknowledged.

This happens because of economic reasons (the supply is running out), ecological reasons (to diminish the impact of the greenhouse gasses), and technological reasons (new and more sustainable processing techniques have emerged). The shift from a fossil fuel based economy towards a bio-based economy has received a lot of attention since about 2010. From an academic perspective, the role of seaports and its chemical complexes in the bio-based economy is in an emerging stage and not clearly defined. This paper defines the relatively new role of ports in the bio-based economy and comes up with a set of indicators to measure the size and development of the bio-based economy on ports. The approach is founded on a literature review and interviews with key informed persons. Although the paper is conceptual in nature, it finds its application in the Flemish Dutch Delta a port delta with one of the largest chemical dusters worldwide. The formation of dusters and their relation to the ports is analysed. It also describes different possible scenarios from a logistics viewpoint after the take-off of the BBE economy which today is still in its infancy, and their effects on seaports.","[Hintjens, Joost] Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Vanelslander, Thierry] Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium; [van der Horst, Martijn; Kuipers, Bart] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Smart Port Rotterdam, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Hintjens, J (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",joost.hintjens@uantwerpen.be; thierry.vanelslander@uantwerpen.be; vanderhorst@ese.eur.nl; bkuipers@ese.eur.nl,"Hintjens, Joost/AAA-1136-2021; Vanelslander, Thierry/I-6083-2015","Hintjens, Joost/0000-0002-5324-8259; Vanelslander, Thierry/0000-0001-5213-3444",,,,,38,4,4,0,17,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Using data from the 2009 to 2012 waves of the National Financial Capability Study (NFCS), this article investigates AFS borrowing behaviors through the lens of a boundedly rational choice framework, with an emphasis on overconfidence. Through repeated testing of isolated samples of individuals with characteristics that make them less likely to objectively need such products, the roles of actual (objective) and perceived (subjective) financial knowledge in the decision-making process are explored. Consistent results indicate that individuals with lower objective financial knowledge and those that are overconfident in their self-assessed knowledge level are significantly more likely to utilize AFS instruments. These results suggest that a significant portion of AFS users may select these products without conducting adequate search, resulting in less than optimal financial decisions holding all else equal.","[Robb, Cliff A.; Seay, Martin C.] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Babiarz, Patryk; Woodyard, Ann] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA",Kansas State University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Robb, CA (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",cliffrobb@ksu.edu; pbabiarz@uga.edu; awoodyrd@uga.edu; mseay@ksu.edu,"Robb, Cliff/AAC-5050-2020","Seay, Martin/0000-0003-1630-9056; Babiarz, Patryk/0000-0003-2506-381X",,,,,33,59,77,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

Optimal imprisonment sanctions and the optimal probability of sanctions are determined. A point of emphasis is that the incapacitation of individuals is often socially desirable even when they are potentially deterrable. The reason is that successful deterrence may require a relatively high probability of sanctions and thus a relatively high enforcement expense. In contrast, incapacitation may yield benefits no matter how low the probability of sanctions is implying that incapacitation may be superior to deterrence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, the goals of the Government and the private sector may conflict with each other. Whereas the government's goal should be to maximize social welfare through increasing value for money, the private sector is focused on maximizing its profit. Introducing performance based incentives bonuses and penalties tied to social goals in contracts is a popular way to align private and government objectives to achieve value for money. The goal of this paper is, by using a quantitative model, to evaluate whether toll highway PPPs, especially those incorporating safety performance based incentives, are actually safer than conventionally procured roads. To this end we have calibrated negative binomial regression models using information from the Spanish high-capacity road network covering years 2007-2009. The results show that toll highways, especially those with safety performance incentives, are ceteris paribus safer than conventionally procured roads, even though safety is still influenced by variables not manageable by the contractor such as traffic volume.

We then compare the effectiveness of these two different identification methods for post-sample forecasting, in the context of a relatively large-scale exemplar of macroeconomic post-sample Granger causality testing. This example examines the Granger causal relationships among four macroeconomically important endogenous variables - monthly measures of aggregate income, consumption, consumer prices, and the unemployment rate - embedded in a six-dimensional information set which also includes two interest rates, both of which are taken to be weakly exogenous in this context. We find that models indentified by the traditional method tend to have better post-sample forecasting abilities than analogous models identified using the mechanized method, and that the analysis done using the traditional identification method generates stronger evidence for post-sample Granger causality among the four endogenous variables.

Ideally we would like to have the data on the trade flow between two countries in combination with the information about the split of this flow between various (multi-modal) routes linking the pair of countries. In reality trade and transport statistics are quite difficult to match due to differences in methodology for data collection and the use of surveys. The unification and reconciliation of transport and trade statistics is of great value to both policy makers and the scientific community. The present paper uses the inverse transport network equilibrium problem that simultaneously calculates both the Origin-Destination (OD) matrix of transport flows and estimates the parameters of route choice multinomial logit model on the basis of available transport survey data. The choice of transport network equilibrium model parameters are done in such a way as to minimize the distance between available trade data and the resulting OD matrix. The distance between the two datasets is measured by the entropy function. The methodology presented in this paper has been developed within the framework of the ETIS-Plus project for DG MOVE.,,,,,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,7,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

The use of quantile regression allows us to examine specific parts of the return distribution such as the tails and the center, and for a sufficiently fine grid of quantiles we can trace out the entire distribution. A univariate quantile regression model is used to examine the marginal stock and bond return distributions, while a multivariate model is used to capture their joint distribution. An empirical analysis on US data shows that economic state variables predict the stock and bond return distributions in quite different ways in terms of, for example, location shifts, volatility and skewness. Comparing the different economic state variables in terms of their out-of-sample forecasting performance, the empirical analysis also shows that the relative accuracy of the state variables varies across the return distribution. Density forecasts based on an assumed normal distribution with forecasted mean and variance is compared to forecasts based on quantile estimates and, in general, the latter yields the best performance.

Data were collected by international databases and published reports of the Greek Ministry of Order and were employed under statistical analysis. First, six independent variables (economic and demographic) were included in the research and it was investigated which affect the aggregate criminality. Results denote that the unemployment rate considerably affects the overall criminality. Moreover, criminality is sufficiently affected by the level of the average monthly wage and the level of population. The second point was the appointment of the factors that affect specific type-crimes. The assumption that recession would be reflected to a rise of criminality was not confirmed. Thieveries/burglaries and robberies (including robberies in banks) were not associated to any factor under study. Homicides, frauds, rapes, forgery, beggary, sexual assault, property rights crimes and illegal antiquities dealing, were not found to be associated to any economic factor. Only the crime of blackmails was found strongly associated with the level of the average monthly wages (p = 0.005).

However, these advancements suffer greatly from hacking; as a result, many security countermeasures have been proposed. Nonetheless, the gap between successful hacking attempts and current security countermeasures is remarkable. The presence and success rate of hacking attempts are due to many reasons, including the emergence of relevant technologies (software and hardware) that aid hacking, complexity of hacking strategies that make them difficult to thwart, and neglecting the behavior of hackers in the design of hardware and software today. Fortunately, sophisticated hackers develop suitable hacking strategies for nominated victims based on gathered information through a prior step called scanning. Scanning provides hackers with necessary information including IP addresses, operating systems, running services and open ports in victims' infrastructures. In this article, we propose an active defense system that targets scanning properties and makes collecting necessary information about the protected infrastructure impractical, rendering the development of suitable hacking strategies against protected infrastructure nearly impossible.","[Alsunbul, Saad; Le, Phu; Srinivasan, Bala] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Alsunbul, Saad] King Abdullaziz City Sci & Technol, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Tan, Jefferson] IBM Res Australia, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Monash University; King Abdullah University of Science & Technology,"Alsunbul, S (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia.",saad.alsunbul@monash.edu.au; phu.dung.le@monash.edu; jeffetan@aul.ibm.com; Bala.Srinivasan@monash.edu,,,,,,,26,0,0,1,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,634.0,647,,,,,,14,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700065,0

These problems are generated by organisational and human factors, financial aspects and difficulties with business processes. Are the Czech companies ready to implement these new agile approaches? This question was investigated during the second author's survey. The results of this survey proved that agile approaches are used in most projects of software and Internet organizations. Here the project managers also have the greatest knowledge of agile principles. However, it is essential that organizations must have corporate culture, which allows the greatest possible extent an appropriate communication of team project members and also to communicate with the customer. Therefore in the last part of the article the experience: how to implement this new approach and how to communicate in innovation projects is mentioned; the solution could be the knowledge network model. In one big international company this knowledge network model was implemented.

Following the calculation and analysis, we found an increased capacity for Romania in self-sufficiency in terms of cereal production and consumption from its own production.

The researcher found similar results in the South African context compared to research in other countries and industries. The research challenges the notion that there is one dominant theory driving CEO compensation. The principal-agent theory, supported by the optimal contract theory, are foremost during periods of strong economic performance, while the influence of managerial power and other behavioural theories appear to prevail during periods of weak economic performance.

Using 2010 IMF data on FDI stocks, this article sheds new light on geographical, historical and political determinants of offshore FDI. Despite its intangibility, offshore FDI is as sensitive to physical distance as real FDI. Offshore FDI links are particularly strong between colonial powers and their current and former colonies. The OECD, while officially leading an agenda against tax evasion, internalizes significant offshore FDI within its membership. Indeed, offshore FDI is pervasive, affecting wealthy economies as much as developing countries.","[Haberly, Daniel] Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England; [Wojcik, Dariusz] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Wojcik, Dariusz] Univ Oxford, St Peters Coll, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",University of Sussex; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Haberly, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England.",d.haberly@sussex.ac.uk,,"Wojcik, Dariusz/0000-0003-2158-284X",,,,,95,79,83,8,78,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Not until recently that market orientation construct has evolved, diffused and transcended across organizational context onto individual employee. Within the Malaysian scenario, stringent capital requirements, heightening competition and turbulent economic forces made it more difficult for financial institutions to maintain healthy asset growth. Due to the importance of business banking asset in the system, the primary interest falls on the business-to-business (B2B) salespeople. Their ability to be resilient in adapting to the market forces is crucial for these firms to be competitive. Thus, this study seeks to understand the factors that enhance their performance; namely, individual market orientation (I-MARKOR) and learning orientation. Data were gathered from 80 B2B salespeople from several licensed local and foreign financial institutions in Kuala Lumpur. Several factors of I-MARKOR are reported to be significant predictor of job performance, while learning-oriented behavior is found to have interaction effects on certain I-MARKOR dimensions. This paper contributes to the enrichment of the existing literature on market orientation and learning orientation by proposing a model that was empirically tested to be a valid and reliable predictor of job performance. By assessing and profiling the market oriented behaviour of their salespeople, firms will be able to focus on the right competencies training and market-focused performance appraisal.","[Hamzah, Muhammad Iskandar; Othman, Abdul Kadir; Hassan, Faridah] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business & Management, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Hamzah, MI (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Business & Management, Shah Alam, Malaysia.",iskandarh@salam.uitm.edu.my; abdkadir@salam.uitm.edu.my; faridah387@salam.uitm.edu.my,"Othman, Abdul Kadir Kadir/J-6264-2014; Othman, Abdul Kadir/S-3126-2019; Hamzah, Muhammad Iskandar/R-2003-2019; hj hassan, faridah/HNQ-4811-2023","Othman, Abdul Kadir/0000-0001-5174-573X; Hamzah, Muhammad Iskandar/0000-0002-8794-2409; hj hassan, faridah/0000-0003-4242-7443",,,,,37,0,0,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,3009.0,3021,,,,,,13,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700313,0

This model shares several desirable features of a set of models based on random regret minimisation (RRM), such as parsimony and choice set dependence. Although model fit differences are small, a preliminary comparison shows that the RAM model empirically outperforms the standard random utility maximisation (RUM) model, the RRM model, and a hybrid RUM-RRM model in all eight data sets analysed. The paper concludes with a discussion of the marginal willingness to pay (WTP) measures derived from the RAM model.","[Leong, Waiyan] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Leong, WY (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",waiyan.leong@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,18,25,28,0,7,UNIV BATH,BATH,"JRNL OF TRANSPORT ECON & POL CLAVERTON DOWN, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND",0022-5258,1754-5951,,J TRANSP ECON POLICY,J.

As one of the basic indexes to measure the financial condition of insurance companies, solvency is the core of the supervision and management. Studying on the life insurance company's solvency to build a set of evaluation system, helps to provide theory support and empirical basis for the supervision and control by relevant department. On the one hand, the solvency of life insurance industry is systematically and qualitatively discussed with direct and environmental factors through theoretical analysis. On the other hand, combining with China's actual situation and choosing indicators of these two kinds of factors, under the assistance of SPSS, seven typical companies in domestic life insurance market are used to empirical analysis by factor analysis as well as correlation analysis with the data from 2007 to 2012. The result shows that the solvency not only can be described by internal factors such as capital structure and premium scale, asset quality, growth and profitability, but also has relationship with external factors such as GDP growth rate, inflation rate and real interest rates, which support the theory of qualitative analysis in turn. Finally, according to the solvency evaluation system established above, from the aspects of internal corporate governance and external economic environment, this paper puts forward some corresponding policy recommendations for solvency regulation on life insurance companies in our country.","[Li Pei; Song Pingfan] Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430072, Hunan, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Li, P (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430072, Hunan, Peoples R China.",li_pei@whu.edu.cn,,,,,,,15,3,3,0,7,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-258-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,66.0,79,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD0EE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357102700003,0

The concern is that relying on sometimes adversarial, sometimes unstable countries for a quarter of our oil carries certain risks. For that reason, reducing the external oil dependence has been of interest to policy makers. This paper examines the impacts and costs of transportation-based policies on light-duty vehicle fleet energy usage and emissions. Using the 2010 elastic version of the US Environmental Protection Agency's Market Allocation (MARKAL) model, recent increases in US Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards are compared to what some economists suggest would be a much more efficient alternative-asystem-wide oil tax internalizing a number of environmental externalities. We discover that our series of oil taxes produce larger and more cost-effective reductions in economy-wide emissions than CAFE. The same cannot be said in regards to net oil imports. Stricter fuel economy regulations result in much larger cutbacks in imports than the oil tax. In fact, we found that in 2040 import demands are roughly 250 million BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) higher with our oil tax regime than they are with CAFE. The additional import reductions achieved with stricter CAFE Standards do come, however, at a much larger cost to society. A great deal of these additional economic costs stems from greater usage of more energy-efficient automobiles and the higher initial capital costs associated with their adoption. In our supplementary analysis, we find that even if the costs of these types of vehicles are lowered by as much as 75%, oil taxes would still be able to maintain their competitive edge over CAFE standards in regards to cost-effectiveness.

Adopts a quantitative cross-sectional research design and uses the MedGraph program, Sobel tests and the Baron and Kenny method to test for mediation effect of service quality on the relationship between customer complaint behaviour and customer loyalty. Service quality is a significant mediator in the relationship between customer complaint behaviour and customer loyalty of Ugandan mobile phone subscribers. Adding service quality to the relationship boosts the relationship between customer complaint behaviour and customer loyalty by 45 percent among the mobile phone subscribers studied. The findings therefore suggest that when service quality is low, a high level of customer loyalty may not be attained among mobile phone subscribers. Future research should use quantitative and a qualitative approach. Only cross-sectional used. A longitudinal study may therefore be useful in future to investigate the mediating impact of service quality over a longer period of time. Managers, policy-makers, and mobile telephone companies should advocate and strive for improvements across all dimensions of service quality to boost the loyalty of cell phone customers. While substantial body of research has been carried out on customer complaint behaviour, our paper is the first to test the mediating role of service quality in the relationship between customer complaint behaviour and customer loyalty among mobile phone subscribers in a developing nation context.

The ever increasing cost of healthcare services, in contrast with the limited resources available, means hospitals have to utilize more advanced management and economics tools in order to boost their efficiency. Detailed and accurate cost-related information could result in superior decision-making and better resource utilization. The accuracy of calculating costs depends on the costing method used, with traditional methods often giving rise to inaccurate cost allocation. The study presents analysis of the costs and reimbursements of selected DRGs and patients within three particular departments at a Czech regional hospital (ENT, Dermatology and Neonatology). The costs of the given samples of patients were calculated by a custom Activity-Based Costing (ABC) application, comprising a more appropriate approach than a traditional costing method. The ABC methodology applied enables more accurate cost estimation for individual patients and DRGs, also generating a variety of additional cost-related information which could potentially inform any decision-making process. The study discusses the differences between the cost and reimbursement of individual diagnosis groups and cost variances between distinct patients within the each diagnosis, along with the managerial implications of the information obtained.","[Popesko, Boris; Papadaki, Sarka; Novak, Petr] Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Enterprise Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Popesko, B (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Enterprise Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic.",popesko@fame.utb.cz; sfialova@fame.utb.cz; pnovak@fame.utb.cz,"Novak, Petr/AAM-7284-2020","Novak, Petr/0000-0003-4701-5755; Popesko, Boris/0000-0002-3590-7070","Internal Grant Agency of the Ministry of Health, the Czech Republic, (IGA MZ CR) [NT 12235-3/2011]","Internal Grant Agency of the Ministry of Health, the Czech Republic, (IGA MZ CR)","This paper was carried out as part of the NT 12235-3/2011 project Applying modern calculation methods to optimize costs in health care, registered at the Internal Grant Agency of the Ministry of Health, the Czech Republic, (IGA MZ CR).",,30,10,12,0,37,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The present analysis draws upon four views of topos categories to construct a rich model of a logic based on recognition theory. The topos initially provides support for: (1) set theory (and classical logic), (2) topological regions dualism. The resulting structures support: (3) a local intuitionist logic that can vary by situated circumstances and actor types, and (4) the specification of regions that are defined by finely-differentiated classifiers. These tools construct an integrated topos category of social recognition that supports diverse forms of local logic. The latter are then explored regarding their contributions to a mathematical model of social conflict. Categorial analysis of historical patterns, as well as a complementary simulation model, is used to illustrate the advantages of such an approach.","[Sallach, David L.] Univ Chicago, Argonne Natl Lab, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory,"Sallach, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Argonne Natl Lab, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",sallach@anl.gov,,,,,,,58,0,0,2,10,SPRINGER-VERLAG TOKYO,TOKYO,"37-3, HONGO 3-CHOME BONKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",,,978-4-431-55236-9; 978-4-431-55235-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,39.0,51,,10.1007/978-4-431-55236-9_4,0.0,,,13,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF3PA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380563900004,0

A System Generalized Method of Moments methodology is applied to control for the heterogeneity and endogeneity problems. The finding shows a negative effect of several measures of ownership on debt ratio. Therefore, the presence of an individual as main shareholder has a positive effect on debt, while the presence of a corporation as main shareholder exerts a negative influence. As research implications, this paper includes the agency problem based on principal-principal conflicts to explain the capital structure of small and medium enterprises, going beyond traditional principal-agent conflicts. The main practical implications of the paper is that owners who seek equity financing can use the results of this study for understanding better why investors are reluctant to invest in their small and medium enterprises.

Such is the case of Lima, Peru, our case study. Through the analysis of the potential for integration of non-motorised facilities with current and planned public transport networks, we seek to provide evidence on the planning considerations of non motorised facilities in Lima with an emphasis on multi-modal travel and integration of non-motorised infrastructure. We develop spatial coverage, capacity and accessibility assessment of the 'supply side' of the transport network. In addition, the research studies the local transport system and travel patterns to identify trips with the potential to shift to non-motorised alternatives. Based on these analyses we estimate indicators of potential coverage, changes in mobility patterns and distributional effects of current investments. Our analysis suggests that coverage of high-capacity public transport can potentially increase by up to six times if integrated adequately with cycling facilities. The research provides methodological and empirical contributions to debates related to the capacity of cities in the global south to adopt low-carbon mobility in the foreseeable future.

Yet, many contemporary research challenges in economic geography center on questions regarding structural dynamics and their implications in entire networks for the collective outcomes involving social actors. This special issue portrays three areas of structural methods for the analysis of entire networks: positional analysis and generalized block modeling, network evolution and dominant path analysis and multi-level network analysis. Moreover, these methods offer new ways of theorizing the organization and evolution of the space economy so as to enhance relational thinking in this field. Finally, we suggest there is value in having more intensive exchanges, collaboration and cross-fertilization between economic geography and social network studies.","[Glueckler, Johannes] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Geog, Berliner Str 48, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Doreian, Patrick] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Doreian, Patrick] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Sociol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Ljubljana; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Glückler, J (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Inst Geog, Berliner Str 48, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.",glueckler@uni-heidelberg.de,"Glückler, Johannes/K-3807-2018","Gluckler, Johannes/0000-0002-2507-1556",,,,,63,58,65,7,142,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

This feature renders it attractive to a significant percentage of the population, especially younger people who do not own a car. To maximize the effectiveness of such systems, the characteristics of potential users have been investigated in this research. The propensity of people to join a carsharing scheme is being modeled using mixed data collected from Internet and paper surveys. An ordered logit model is developed to model the Willingness of young Greeks to join carsharing. Several types of explanatory variables are used, including demographic characteristics and travel attributes, but also the satisfaction of the commuters about their current travel patterns, which is included as latent attitude in the modeling framework. The combination of the two datasets aims to measure the difference of the variance of the error term, generated from the paper and Internet respondents; the latter are prone to be more positive in their responses, possibly in order to satisfy the interviewer. This is verified in the current research by the positive sign of the scale parameter applied at the utility function of the Internet-based data. The use of latent classes enhances the model estimation, by measuring the parameters that determine the respondents' unobserved, underlying behaviors. The results demonstrate that people who use taxi for social activities, those with medium to low income, and the environmentally conscious, are more willing to join a hypothetical carsharing scheme. The results are compared with a 2013 study, in order to identify the advantages of using this advanced modeling framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we examine the land development impacts of BRT in Bogota and Quito, two cities that have made a variety of BRT investments over the last two decades and with Curitiba, they have been world pioneers of BRT. Relying on 10 years of data, we use a quasi -experimental research design to quantitatively examine changes in land development in both cities. Outcomes include land market characteristics such as built area added per year (both cities), units added (Quito), building permits issued (Bogota), changes in land use (Bogota), and property price changes (Quito). We compare how outcomes vary over time for treatment corridors - those that received BRT service at various points throughout the decade, relative to control corridors in both cities, and in Bogota also relative to a road expansion corridor. In Bogota, control corridors were corridors slated to get BRT but that had not received any BRT service yet, whereas in Quito they are adjoining areas. Results reveal heterogeneous impacts in both cities. Although increased building activity tends to concentrate in treatment areas, comparisons with controls suggest that the impacts are context dependent. Some stations showed very high development activity and others less so. Development induced along the road extension in Bogota was considerable. In both cities, the strongest effects appear to concentrate in end-of-line terminals and stops built in the early 2000s. Whether BRT stimulates land development depends on institutional factors such as developer appetite, market conditions, land availability, and land regulations.

We find that firms located in an urban area are more likely to receive a takeover bid and complete a takeover transaction as a target than firms located in rural areas, and takeover deals involving an urban target are associated with higher acquirer announcement returns, after controlling for the proximity between the target and the acquirer. In addition, a target's urban location significantly attenuates the negative effect of a long distance between the target and the acquirer on acquirer returns, a fact that is documented in the existing literature. Our findings reveal a previously underexplored force-firm location-that can affect takeover transactions, in addition to proximity. Our paper suggests that a firm's location plays an important role in facilitating the dissemination of soft information and enhancing information-based synergies.","[Cai, Ye] Santa Clara Univ, Leavey Sch Business, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA; [Tian, Xuan] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN USA; [Tian, Xuan] Tsinghua Univ, PBC Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xia, Han] Univ Texas Dallas, Jindal Sch Management, Richardson, TX 75083 USA",Santa Clara University; Indiana University System; IU Kelley School of Business; Indiana University Bloomington; Tsinghua University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Cai, Y (通讯作者)，Santa Clara Univ, Leavey Sch Business, Santa Clara, CA 95053 USA.",ycai@scu.edu; tianx@indiana.edu; han.xia@utdallas.edu,"Tian, Xuan/JOZ-0963-2023",,,,,,67,30,33,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Nevertheless, the study of cartels as networks can advance some general elements and measurements that can help the detection and elimination of these organizational forms that cause evident harm to general well-being. This is the first time that the approach of network theory has been used to analyze cartels. This article uses a set of classical measures such as clustering and centrality measures, taken from network theory, and applies them to a specific case of a cartel sanctioned as such by the European Commission. This approach has enabled us to quantify some characteristic elements of the cartel, such as, for instance, a remarkable asymmetry between operators (nodes in the network), its different degree of influence (study of links), as well as the critical importance of some operators versus other cartelized agents, such that their elimination from the organization would not enable them to create their own cartel. This finding warrants reconsidering the antitrust policy based on leniency programs.","[Grau-Carles, Pilar; Cuerdo-Mir, Miguel] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales, Dept Econ Aplicada 1, Campus Vicalvaro,Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Grau-Carles, P (通讯作者)，Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales, Dept Econ Aplicada 1, Campus Vicalvaro,Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain.",pilar.grau@urjc.es; miguel.cuerdo@urjc.es,"Grau, Pilar/F-1288-2016; Cuerdo-Mir, Miguel/ABF-1551-2021","Grau, Pilar/0000-0003-3917-1096; Cuerdo-Mir, Miguel/0000-0002-4841-0493",Spanish Education Ministry [DER 2011-22549]; Spanish Economic Ministry [ECO2012-32554],Spanish Education Ministry(Spanish Government); Spanish Economic Ministry,"This article was supported by grants from the Research Project, La Potestad Sancionadora de los Organismos Reguladores' (Ref.

Energy surpluses such as this are unusual in human history. In systems with little surplus energy, population growth is low and complexity emerges slowly due to the energetic costs it carries. On the rare occasions when energy is readily available, societies respond by growing rapidly. They must become more complex in response to the social, economic, and resource challenges of dense population. More complex societies are more expensive, requiring greater energy per capita. The process of increasing complexity necessitates greater energy production, creating a positive feedback cycle. Past societies have collapsed under such pressures. Population and complexity grew rapidly when the Industrial Revolution replaced economies based on annual solar radiation with economies fueled by fossil energy. The Green Revolution of the 20(th) century is credited with preventing mass starvation, but it has made food production and sustaining population ever-more dependent on high-energy (low-entropy) inputs. Some believe innovation will overcome the limitations of resources and permit unchecked growth. However, increases in complexity, innovation, and fossil energy are all subject to diminishing returns, and cannot continue to support population at current levels.","[Taylor, Temis G.] Utah State Univ, Dept Environm & Soc, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Tainter, Joseph A.] Utah State Univ, Dept Environm & Soc, Sustainabil, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Taylor, TG (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Environm & Soc, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",Temis.Taylor@usu.edu; Joseph.Tainter@usu.edu,,,,,,,93,19,24,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Therefore, it has received a great deal of criticism from Western democracies. Of course, China faced internal problems related to population, such as the Great Famine of 1958-1961. This might be deemed the direct cause of the one-child policy. However, the more powerful factors were indirect and of foreign origin. China's one-child policy was deeply influenced by the West, especially by Western population science. Since the May 4(th) Movement in 1919, China has had a tendency to worship science because of the Chinese obsession with Western-style modernization. In other words, China's one-child policy is a product of blind imitation of Western population science. The action has resulted in serious negative consequences such as an imbalance of the sex ratio, elder-care problems, human rights violations, undermining of traditional values, and even endangering the regime. Those problems caused China to reverse its one-child policy. The authors believe that China should develop a postmodern population policy with Chinese character, based on organic thinking, which takes human feelings seriously and empowers people and allows them to act as subjects or agents in decisions about their families, including the size of their family and the selection of gender.","[Wang, Zhihe] Harbin Inst Technol, Ctr Construct Postmodern Studies, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhihe] Inst Postmodern Dev China, Claremont, CA USA; [Yang, Ming] Guangdong Finance Univ, Marxism Sch, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jiaming] Fudan Univ, Ctr BRICS Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chang, Jiang] Jilin Normal Univ, Sch Polit & Law, Siping, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; Fudan University; Jilin Normal University,"Yang, M (通讯作者)，Guangdong Finance Univ, Marxism Sch, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",ym1631@163.com,"Zhang, Jiaming/GSD-8224-2022",,,,,,121,8,12,0,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Using data on individual sales people, one per firm from a survey of 261 firms, we show that, consistent with predictions from our model, sales people are given more pricing authority when they are more experienced and more capable, when there is less environmental uncertainty, and, to a lesser extent, when customer valuations for the product are more variable.

We rely on a law change that raised compulsory schooling from 5 to 8 years in Turkey to address the endogeneity of education to happiness. Our study shows that, for females, earning at least a middle school diploma increases the likelihood of being happy and the probability of being satisfied with various life domains. Descriptive tests suggest that being hopeful about one's own future well-being partly explains the relationship between women's schooling and happiness. For males, although relatively imprecisely estimated, we find evidence that earning at least a middle school degree results in a decline in subjective well-being. Supplemental analysis develops evidence consistent with the view that an imbalance between aspirations and attainments, flowing from extended primary schooling, may be the reason behind this counterintuitive finding among men.","[Dursun, Bahadir] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Econ, 2416 BEC, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Cesur, Resul] Univ Connecticut, Dept Finance, 2100 Hillside Rd,Unit 1041, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; University of Connecticut,"Dursun, B (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Dept Econ, 2416 BEC, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",odursu2@lsu.edu; cesur@business.uconn.edu,,,,,,,132,19,24,1,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

In this paper, we examine outcomes that have remained largely unexplored, soft skills and personality. We use Add Health data to construct relevant controls for teenage mothers and explore a set of measures that proxy for what is usually deemed in economics as non-cognitive or soft skill traits. We find that teenage childbearing increases impulsivity, a trait that has been found to have negative effects on a large set of outcomes and has a negative effect on other personality traits perceived as positive, such as openness to experiences. Our results remain consistent through a set of robustness checks, and we interpret our findings to suggest that adolescence may be a sensitive period for the development of soft skills and that childbearing may interrupt this process.","[Fletcher, Jason] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Demog & Ecol, La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Sociol,Inst Res Poverty, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Padron, Norma] New York Acad Med, Ctr Hlth Innovat, 1216 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10029 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; New York Academy of Medicine,"Fletcher, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Demog & Ecol, La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, Dept Sociol,Inst Res Poverty, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jason.fletcher@wisc.edu; npadron@nyam.org,,,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P01-HD31921],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"This research uses data from Add Health, a program project directed by Kathleen Mullan Harris and designed by J.

In this paper, we extend the traditional model to account for role-uncertainty and dual-effect precautions. We find that in these situations, the traditional formulation of Negligence fails to incentivize efficient precautions, inducing excessive role-specific precautions and insufficient dual-effect precautions. For such cases, we argue for a modification of the standard of due care that accounts for the full benefit of dual-effect precautions, in order to incentivize efficient precautionary efforts.

The existing monocentric city literature has repeatedly shown that mitigating the congestion externality causes the densification of population toward the city center. In contrast, we find the opposite of densification can occur if public transit mode is present. Modal substitution effect limits the centralizing force of anti-congestion policies. In addition, redistributing tax revenues among residents generates a decentralizing effect by increasing housing demand because marginal utility of income is higher in suburbs. At the optimum, mitigating congestion can cause urban sprawl depending on degree of substitutability between automobile and public transit, relative congestibility of the two modes, tax revenue redistribution and preferences for location and lot size.","[Buyukeren, Akin C.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA; [Hiramatsu, Tomoru] Kumamoto Gakuen Univ, Dept Econ, Kumamoto, Japan",Texas A&M University System,"Buyukeren, AC (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA.",akin.buyukeren@tamucc.edu,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26285051] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,25,11,13,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

J,"Tabachnick, D",,,,"Tabachnick, David",,,Two Models of Ownership: How Commons Has Co-Existed with Private Property,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article challenges the claim by many historians that the rise of capitalism requires the destruction of common property systems. In contrast to the English case in which commons were enclosed, French peasants used their common property system to regulate the market, provide a rural safety net and a democratic check on elites, while urban industry developed. European battles over common property replayed in surprising ways in colonial African countries such as Sierra Leone, and echoes reemerge today. The West African country of Guinea tests two possible paths to development of a market society: the English path and the French path. Interviews with key government officials collected in 1993 help explain why Guinea, despite adopting a land law in 1992 inspired by the English path, has so far failed to widely apply the law and, in fact, is following the French path. The United States pursued a policy of replacing American Indian common property systems with exclusive individual property rights. Nonetheless, Indian common property survives in the form of recent recognition of Indian off-reservation hunting and fishing rights. The Menominee reservation successfully resisted the destruction of its common property system and today participates in the market in a manner that preserves reservation ecology, democratic government, and Menominee cultural identity. Rethinking the meaning of French, African, and U.S. accommodation to common property systems offers important lessons for contemporary development policies in Africa and around the world.","[Tabachnick, David] Muskingum Univ, Dept Sociol, New Concord, OH 43762 USA",University System of Ohio; Muskingum University,"Tabachnick, D (通讯作者)，Muskingum Univ, Dept Sociol, New Concord, OH 43762 USA.",,,,,,,,108,2,2,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The results identify the importance of price -based competition to the analysis, as markets that are characterized by price competition tend to generate significantly higher estimates for the probability of a unilateral effects finding, all else equal, especially when repositioning is difficult.

In this article, we identify schemes that reduce the number of innocent pleas without affecting guilty individuals' plea-bargaining incentives. Large compensations for exonerees reduce expected costs associated with wrongful determinations of guilt in trial and thereby reduce the number of innocent pleas. Any distortion in guilty individuals' incentives to take plea bargains caused by these compensations can be offset by a small increase in the discounts offered for pleading guilty. Although there are many statutory-reform proposals for increasing exoneree compensation, no one has yet noted this desirable separating effect of compensations. We argue that such reforms are likely to achieve this result without causing losses in deterrence.","[Mungan, Murat C.] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Klick, Jonathan] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; University of Pennsylvania,"Mungan, MC (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",,,"Mungan, Murat/0000-0003-1948-6488",,,,,23,10,12,0,10,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Aiming to add value to the existing literature, the structural analysis was adapted to classification and identification of the key factors.

Our 'in-play' model is dynamic, in the sense that the parameters of the underlying logistic regression model are allowed to evolve smoothly as the match progresses. The use of this dynamic logistic regression approach reduces the number of parameters required dramatically, produces stable and intuitive forecast probabilities, and has a minimal effect on the explanatory power. Cross-validation techniques are used to identify the variables to be included in the model. We demonstrate the use of our model using two matches as examples, and compare the match result probabilities generated using our model with those from the betting market. The forecasts are similar quantitatively, a result that we take to be evidence that our modelling approach is appropriate. (C) 2015 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The methodology applied is both quantitative and qualitative. Out of a sample of 100 questionnaires, 80 responses were collected from the different Human resource personnel at Huawei in China and Senegal. The nature of data is both primary and secondary. The findings have shown that, first of all, Huawei uses different recruitment channels in Senegal and China. Also, they indicate that both in Senegal and China, in order to get the required talent, Huawei adopts different processes in recruitment and selection. In addition, Huawei Company uses internal and external sources in its recruitment processes in both countries.

Research emphasises mainly the effect of income level on psychological well-being, and its orientation to psychological well-being is narrowly derived from a focus on subjective well-being constructs. This study addresses the research gap by exploring the relationship dynamics between sense of coherence, income level and financial well-being. Secondary data were obtained from a cross-sectional online employee-wellness survey (n = 7 185). The sample distribution included 66 per cent females and 34 per cent males from various age groups, with 46 per cent of the sample comprising single-household earners and 54 per cent sharing household income. Analysis of variance was conducted to examine the relationship dynamics between sense of coherence, level of income and financial well-being. Demographic variables that formed part of the survey results were included in the analysis. The relationships between sense of coherence and identified significant income level, financial well-being and demographic effects were further explored in Bonferroni multiple comparisons of means test and cross reference frequency tables that included Pearson's chi-square and/or Cochran-Armitage trend tests. Detail results indicate that high-income employees exhibit a significantly stronger sense of coherence than low-income employees, and that, despite level of income, financial wellbeing is nevertheless positively related to sense of coherence. Results indicate important implications for managing a financially healthy workforce. Limitations are discussed and recommendations for future research are highlighted.","[Barnard, Antoni] Univ South Africa, Dept Ind & Org Psychol, Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Barnard, A (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Dept Ind & Org Psychol, Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Barnard, Antoni/G-1835-2014","Barnard, Antoni/0000-0003-0371-9486",National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa [84412],National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa),"This work is based on research supported in part by the National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa (Unique Grant No. 84412).

The authors define the important factors that form the EO, analyze and quantify the the linkages in the model. A part of the research is dedicated to the comparison of the various components of EO in terms of gender and education of entrepreneurs, and of the size of the company. Based on the results of our research, we can conclude that the EO level in the Czech Republic is below the average. The highest index of EO (IEOSME) was achieved by larger companies that belong to the category of SMEs. Our research suggests that there are differences between the defined groups of entrepreneurs in terms of their level of education, and size and age of the company. Entrepreneurs with the university degree have better preconditions for doing business, because they have much higher IEOSME. Microenterprises have significantly lower IEOSME than larger enterprises in the category of SMEs. The companies that operate on the market longer have higher IEOSME than younger companies. Quantification of individual dimensions of EO in terms of gender and education of entrepreneurs, and age and size of the company has brought some interesting findings. The least differences were found when comparing entrepreneurs by gender. The only difference identified within the evaluation of five dimensions of EO was, that males take more risks in business than females. The biggest differences across all analysed dimensions of EO were found when comparing companies according to their size. Larger companies belonging to the segment of SMEs were more innovative, more active and more autonomous in comparison to microenterprises.","[Belas, Jaroslav] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Enterprise Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic; [Sopkova, Gabriela] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235 5, Slovakia",Tomas Bata University Zlin; University of Economics Bratislava,"Belas, J (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Enterprise Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",belas111@gmail.com; gabika.sopkova@gmail.com,"Belas, Jaroslav/AGS-6813-2022","Belas, Jaroslav/0000-0002-5900-997X",,,,,48,30,30,0,31,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The model is implemented with the use of fuzzy logic. First, fundamental theoretical principles related to the problems of project success rate, fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic are introduced, after which a fuzzy model for project success rate evaluation, including partial sub-models, is presented in the form of a case study which represents the main goal of the article. The fuzzy model is implemented in the MATLAB software environment with the use of the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox application, where it is also verified and further specified. The fuzzy model consists of six input variables which are divided according to their character into three categories in each block (RB1, RB2, RB3) and are separately evaluated. Partial outputs from the blocks (RB1, RB2, RB3) are simultaneously inputs for block RB4, from which there is a single output variable - project success (PS). The RB1 rule block evaluates the situation from the point of view of the state of the project. The RB2 rule block evaluates the total value of project risk. The RB3 rule block evaluates project quality. The RB4 rule block evaluates the total project success rate. Experimenting with the fuzzy model allows simulation of the uncertainty that is always involved in projects. The case study introduces an overall diagram of the fuzzy model, the input and output variables, including their attributes, and the evaluation rules of the four rule blocks. The proposed fuzzy model is used to evaluate project success primarily in the implementation phase, then repeatedly after each phase of the project is completed. This provides project managers with a tool that allows relatively rapid evaluation of the success of the project and the opportunity of applying appropriate measures in good time if necessary.","[Doskocil, Radek; Skapa, Stanislav] Brno Univ Technol, Dept Informat, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic; [Olsova, Petra] Univ JE Purkyne, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Reg & Local Dev, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Doskocil, R (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Dept Informat, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic.",doskocil@fbm.vutbr.cz; skapa@fbm.vutbr.cz; petra.olsova@ujep.cz,"Olšová, Petra/JOZ-7261-2023; Doskočil, Radek/GLN-8159-2022","Doskočil, Radek/0000-0002-9716-1411",Internal Grant Agency at Brno University of Technology [FP-S-15-2787],Internal Grant Agency at Brno University of Technology,This paper was supported by grant FP-S-15-2787 Effective Use of ICT and Quantitative Methods for Business Processes Optimisation'' from the Internal Grant Agency at Brno University of Technology.,,55,14,14,8,44,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Almost unnoticed by many, but with significant economic value. Volunteers can be recruited to perform their volunteer work by a special non-governmental organization (NGO) - volunteer center. Their purpose is basically the recruitment of volunteers on behalf of needed community services. However, what is the exact role of the volunteer centers in volunteer human resource management? The role of the volunteer centers were explored in this paper on the example of the Czech Republic, the country with o long volunteering tradition, where the role of the volunteer centers are defined by the law on volunteering. The initial data was acquired from the law. The additional data was provided by ADRA (Adventist Development and Relief Agency) Czech Republic, one of the Czech biggest NGOs with a large network of volunteer centers across the country. The aim of the paper was to identify the role of the volunteer centers in the Czech Republic in managing volunteer human resources. The following role was found: 1) volunteer HR management, 2) communication with receiving organization, 3) fundraising activities and 4) administrative agenda. Moreover, ADRA is coordinating more than 1,800 regular volunteers in 50 fifty Czech cities, which is about 8 % of all accredited volunteers in the Czech Republic. The economic value ADRA volunteers is in hundreds of thousands EUR annually, with a guaranteed minimal standard given by the accreditation of the Czech Ministry of Interior. Thus the volunteer centers in the Czech Republic can be called, with a little exaggeration, as nonprofit agencies for making good, based on its mission, its goal and the condition of volunteer work given by law.","[Dostal, Jakub] Coll Polytech Jihlava, Jihlava, Czech Republic",College of Polytechnics Jihlava,"Dostal, J (通讯作者)，Coll Polytech Jihlava, Jihlava, Czech Republic.",jakub.dostal@vspj.cz,"Dostál, Jakub/ABA-3982-2020","Dostál, Jakub/0000-0001-8764-0542",,,,,14,1,1,0,10,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,238.0,246,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254500026,0

This paper attempts to explain the firm-bank relationship and its impact on the dividend payout of the client firm. For the said cause the data of listed companies in Karachi Stock Exchange were collected from 2008 to 2013. For the bank-firm relationships, two proxies were used. A dummy variable was used for bank relations (1 if number of bank relations is more than 5 otherwise 0) and the second variable is actual number of relations a firm is maintaining with banks. We have regressed these variables among some of largely used determinants of dividend payout as control variables and found that, though the coefficients are low but both proxies taken for bank-firm relationship are significant at 5%. It concludes that the policy makers and investors may also consider this relationship for their decision making as a significant factor and also draw attention for future researches in this horizon.","[Javed, Fahad; Sultan, Jahanzaib; Chen Xiaofeng] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,"Javed, F (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",mfahadjaved@gmail.com; jzsultan@hotmail.com; cxf2010611@163.com,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,1,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-5431-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,932.0,935,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393354400154,0

Empirical tests are based on data on European countries between 1995 and 2007. The HOV hypothesis is partially confirmed in that the forest resource endowment is a significant determinant for explaining differences in net trade of two products (pulp and paper and furniture) but not for woodworking products. In addition, empirical tests also show the limits of the HOV model for explaining international trade of wood products. Indeed, factors reflecting industrial performance of wood sectors, including total factor productivity and average labor cost, have a significant role in determining differences in net trade of wood products.

However, such wealth is often associated with poverty and a slower economic growth. This phenomenon is called the resource curse, and it shows that most countries that are rich in natural resources have markedly reduced economic growth and development, and it shows that the wealth of natural resources adversely affects their economies, although it is intuitively expected to be the opposite i.e. that such wealth would have a positive impact on the country's economic development. This paper, a product of the mentor-student joint effort, studies the paradox of natural resources and its most common channels through which it is converted from a blessing into a curse. The purpose of this study is to make conclusions about the existence of the natural resource curse, and to show the way or channel through which the wealth of natural resources becomes a blessing or a curse. The research was conducted in the countries where the largest part of exports in total merchandise exports were exports of natural resources, and such countries were selected from the region of Sub-Saharan Africa given that in this region natural resource curse is the most present. In the paper the export of natural resources is analyzed and compared with a GDP per capita of those countries, the dependence of these countries on the prices of resources is analyzed as well as diversity of their economies, the quality of institutions, and the presence of corruption. The data, which were used for analyzing, are statistical data collected by the World Bank, and the data from the other statistical sources related to such matters (BP and Transparency International).","[Kurecic, Petar; Seba, Marija] Univ North, Trg Zarka Dolinara 1, Koprivnica, Croatia",University North - Croatia,"Kurecic, P (通讯作者)，Univ North, Trg Zarka Dolinara 1, Koprivnica, Croatia.",petar.kurecic@unin.hr; marija.seba@gmail.com,"Kurecic, Petar/M-2524-2017",,,,,,29,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,164.0,175,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254500018,0

J,"Lough, AW",,,,"Lough, Alexandra W.",,,"Tom L. Johnson and Cleveland Traction Wars, 1901-1909",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TAXATION,"Tom L. Johnson made his mark on politics far from Capitol Hill, in the gritty world of turn-of-the-century Cleveland, Ohio. Barely 30 years old and at the height of a successful career as an inventor, steel manufacturer, and street railway monopolist, Tom Loftin Johnson experienced a change of heart. After discovering the ideas of Henry George, Johnson became a lifelong advocate of the single tax, which he used to guide his new career in politics. In 1901, Cleveland voters elected Johnson to the first of his four terms as mayor of the industrial city of 400,000 people. During his eight-year reign as chief executive, Cleveland took over essential services such as garbage collection, street cleaning, and lighting from private enterprise. Johnson helped humanize the city's correctional system by replacing the old workhouse with a network of farm colonies designed to rehabilitate wayward youths and adults convicted of petty crimes. Largely as a result of Johnson's efforts, Cleveland won constitutional home rule, a lower streetcar fare, the referendum, and higher taxes on the corporations that amassed giant fortunes through perpetual public franchise grants. For a short time, while he was still mayor, Cleveland owned and operated its own streetcar company, a rarity in early 20th-century America. All of these accomplishments made Johnson something of a hero to progressive reformers. The muckraker Lincoln Steffens famously called Johnson the best Mayor of the best-governed city in the United States.","[Lough, Alexandra W.] Hist Res Ctr, Arch, Henry George Birthpl, Philadelphia, PA USA",,"Lough, AW (通讯作者)，Hist Res Ctr, Arch, Henry George Birthpl, Philadelphia, PA USA.",,,,,,,,50,0,0,1,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

At that time incipient forms of what are now true phenomena of socio-economic world emerged, like telework, e-learning, e-government, e-banking and generally e-business. Coming to present day, we notice a spectacular development of ICT and adaptation of international legal framework, which not only stimulated the development of telework and tele-activities in general, but also provided the necessary premises for new forms of manifestation, like cloud-working and cloudsourcing. In this paper we propose to analyze in what way the cloud computing paradigm is an indispensable input for the cloud-working model, and also what is the direct impact of cloud computing on telework in general. The analysis will be performed on the background of identifying a close relationship between the two models; this relation tends to be a mutually recursive one. Additionally, the analytical approach will take place on the three architectural tiers of the organization - business, information and technology, encompassing specific aspects of modern cloud, like big-data and cloud storage. Finally, once the cloud-working paradigm is built, we will try to see in what way it may be a launch ramp for what literature calls today cloudsourcing.","[Marian, Stoica; Bogdan, Ghilic-Micu] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Econ Informat & Cybernet, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Marian, S (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Econ Informat & Cybernet, Bucharest, Romania.",marians@ase.ro; ghilic@ase.ro,"Stoica, Marian/H-9490-2019; Ghilic-Micu, Bogdan/AAE-1257-2020","Stoica, Marian/0000-0003-2852-9224; Ghilic-Micu, Bogdan/0000-0003-3038-1302",,,,,15,0,0,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,3966.0,3973,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700398,0

Comparing changes in economic conditions across US states to changes in living arrangements, I find that fewer jobs, low wages, and high rental costs all lead to increases in the numbers of men and women living with their parents. The magnitudes of the effects are quite large: for men, I estimate that changes in economic factors alone are large enough to have caused the observed changes in parental coresidence between 1970 and 2011.","[Matsudaira, Jordan D.] Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Matsudaira, JD (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, 133 MVR Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",jdm296@cornell.edu,,,,,,,34,46,54,2,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

They provide a stable supply of electricity and heat without polluting the environment by emissions. They significantly contribute to the environmental protection. For businesses, this renewable source of energy means financially a very profitable, safe and a fast repayable investment. These investments are a big opportunity mainly for a family type of business which especially in municipalities in rural areas performs a variety of other economic and non-economic objectives including the use of biomass. Opportunities of family businesses are in agreement between the parties, involvement of family members, knowledge of technology and know-how, flexibility in labor, time and money, long-term planning, stable corporate culture, speed in decision-making, proximity to local markets, pride and credibility, efficiency, productivity, focus on quality. In recent decades, corporate social responsibility has been at the forefront of marketing tools of businesses and is often associated only with the ethical standards that, among other things, seek to minimize negative impacts on the environment This article focuses on their basic characteristics, maps specific ways which the company can use for their financing and analyzes the profitability (yield) and return on these investment projects. This development can focus more on strengthening family businesses in municipalities of a rural type where many owners of forests or larger plots can take advantage of investment opportunities and stabilize the economy of their businesses.

Authors consider Russian financial market as a field of empirical study. Goal is to reveal the nature of the financial convergence as a mechanism of competitiveness for the parts of FC. Methods of the article are based on the Performance-Conduct-Structure (PCS) idea known as Boone effective competition indicator applied for insurance financial conglomerate member competitiveness evaluation. Objectives. 1) To reveal the process of competition on financial markets using mechanism of financial convergence. 2) To give definition of financial conglomerates as a basic institutional and organizational form of financial convergence. 3) To implement Boone effective competition indicator for empirical study of the financial convergence as the mechanism of the competitiveness increase for the Russian biggest financial-insurance groups. Results and findings. The results and novelty of the study are (1) refined definitions of financial convergence and financial conglomerate. (2) Boone indicator is used to estimate financial convergence, which is a tool to improve competitiveness through competition between insurance organizations. (3) Assessment for competitiveness of Russian insurance companies as part of financial groups and as independent companies. (4) proposed hypothesis is confirmed only partly. Financial Convergence as a mechanism to enhance the competitiveness of its members presupposes the solution of a number of issues related to its institutional and organizational for empirical study of leading Russian insurance financial conglomerates competitiveness based on the proposed method of Boone effective competition indicator evaluation and on the alternative method of coefficient variation of the insurance undertaking financial result-s activity calculation.

With increasing awareness of environmental protection across the world the green trend of conservation of the resources and protecting the environment is overwhelming and these drivers have exerted pressure on organizations to improve their environmental performance. Successful participation in global markets requires MNCs to organize domestic green supply chain management practices. This paper has employed a case study approach with an institutional theory perspective to identify driving forces for MNCs in South Asian developing countries like Pakistan to adopt and implement green supply chain management practices. Detailed interviews from 14 employees of two different MNCs revealed identical results. In Pakistani environment normative pressures from customers, suppliers and consumer pressure groups have significance impact on decision making regarding green supply chain management while no importance given to coercive and mimetic pressures. It is also revealed that MNC's could be a major source of diffusion of green practices into less aware and resourced local suppliers from a global supply chain perspective.

Second part of the paper explores relationship between municipal waste volume, expenditures and selected social demographic parameters of municipalities using linear regression techniques and presents several models and discussion of the effects of considered variables. Results show that there is, without surprise, very strong relationship between the amount of municipal solid waste and related expenditures. Both these values are also strongly affected by the population level or alternatively amount of flats within the municipality. Either of them can thus serve as a proxy for municipal solid waste generation prediction. Additional estimated models explore effects of considered social demographic data on per capita development of expenditures and waste generation in order to estimate their marginal effects. Results presented in the models can have policy utilization regarding municipal solid waste collection fee differentiation, or serve as a supporting tool for municipal authorities when predicting development of waste volume and expenditures.","[Struk, Michal] Masaryk Univ, Dept Publ Econ, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Struk, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Publ Econ, Brno, Czech Republic.",struk@mail.muni.cz,"Struk, Michal/I-2218-2013","Struk, Michal/0000-0003-3832-5735",,,,,28,0,0,0,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27573-4; 978-3-319-27572-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-2,,,,,,399.0,416,,10.1007/978-3-319-27573-4_28,0.0,,,18,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429800028,0

Achieving transformation through education and learning can be complex and painstakingly slow process, therefore it is important to look at causal factors which shape the competencies of the 21st century generation. In this paper we took a closer look at emerging subfield of education - global education. Global education is not a new teaching subject, but an interdisciplinary field which emerged in education, especially in social sciences during the end of the 20th century. The main themes of global education are: globalization, economic and political interconnections, culture diversity, environment and sustainability, social justice and civic education. We show how these themes have become more relevant with the reference to business leadership qualities. The study examines internal and external factors that contribute to teacher's motivation in teaching about global issues. Study design is based on integral theory formulated by Ken Wilber and Sean Esbjorn-Hargens, which examines four complementing dimensions - teacher's personal and social values as well as the role of institutional framework in their motivation to implement global education. Study sample consists of 135 secondary school teachers who have participated in global education training project. Based on findings from teachers' survey and a focus group discussion we concluded that the motivation of teachers is positively affected by their personal values, beliefs and attitudes. The social values currently are less supportive for the implementation of global education but they do not seem to have a significant impact on professional activity of the teachers. Legislative and institutional framework plays a neutral role. Current teaching standards and programs for education curricula are compatible with the global development topics and their inclusion in school curricula. The study recommends to support teachers in the implementation of the teaching methods related to global education and to upscale several successful initiatives in schools.","[Valtenbergs, Visvaldis] Adv Inst Social & Polit Res, Riga, Latvia; [Irbite, Inguna] Ctr Dev Educ, Riga, Latvia; [Ebele, Inese] Vidzeme Univ Appl Sci, Riga, Latvia",Vidzeme University of Applied Sciences,"Valtenbergs, V (通讯作者)，Adv Inst Social & Polit Res, Riga, Latvia.",visvaldis.valtenbergs@va.lv,,,,,,,19,0,0,2,10,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,882.0,890,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200075,0

In the study, corporate statements in crisis public relations are analyzed by using Brown and Levinson's classification of positive and negative politeness strategies. The results indicate that positive strategies are more often used in corporate statements than negative ones. Besides, some politeness strategies such as exaggerate, make offer or promise, apologies, etc. are quite indispensable in statements issued to cope with crisis, since these strategies endow the statement with its basic functions.","[Xie Ruiting] Hubei Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Wuhan 430062, Peoples R China",Hubei University,"Xie, RT (通讯作者)，Hubei Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Wuhan 430062, Peoples R China.",sherryting0716@qq.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,1,3,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-5431-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,1049.0,1052,,,,,,4,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393354400174,0

Using panel data from 274 Chinese municipalities in the 2000-2010 period, our study explores the role of motorway network in the evolution of spatial economic agglomerations. Our results confirm the existence of a distributive effect of road infrastructure in China, and show that an improvement in the motorway network leads to a higher degree of geographic concentration of economic activities. However, in our simulation new motorway construction appears to facilitate spatial dispersal when transport costs fall below a critical level. Moreover, the improved road network has led to a loss of industry in China's lagging areas. Accordingly, current transport investment policy, especially in lagging western areas, has not contributed to spatial equity in China, which contrasts with investment in education, for example.

Its goal is to keep the budget in balance while connecting matters of economic sustainability with anti-cyclical financial policy. Ever since, the debt ratio of the Swiss Confederation has been mainly decreasing. Furthermore, since 2006 the Swiss federal budget has been mostly in a surplus-even throughout the latest economic crises. The Swiss debt brake is considered a success story and has been referred to as a model for sustainable balanced budgeting which leads to a stabilization of public finances. The proof for the debt brake's success in the light of the last economic crises and despite the demographic challenges to the social security system still remains to be seen in the years to come. The successful mechanism of Switzerland's sustainable public finance, however, is not solely based on a debt brake but includes a variety of different financial instruments. It is based on a comprehensive approach to a responsible financial policy connecting the public tasks to their costs and covering a short-term as well as a medium and a long-term perspective. And it is supported by a political consensus to prevent an increase of public debt.","[Zielniewicz, Agata] Univ Bern, Inst Publ Law, Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Zielniewicz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Inst Publ Law, Bern, Switzerland.",agata.zielniewicz@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2214-6881,,978-3-319-41205-4; 978-3-319-41203-0,IUS COMP,,,2016,20,,,,,,267.0,297,,10.1007/978-3-319-41205-4_10,0.0,,,31,Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BI1RQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406787000010,0

Litigating the legality of the Islamic banking license issued by the apex bank in Nigeria was the first in the yet unknown phase of the dispute resolution trends in the nascent Islamic finance industry in the country. This study therefore examines the challenges, prospects and future directions of sustainable dispute resolution practices in the Islamic finance industry. It proposes a practical dispute resolution framework for Nigeria through best practices from three key jurisdictions-Malaysia, Indonesia and Pakistan-who have some unique mechanisms that have stood the test of time. The study concludes that for Nigeria to be able to attract foreign direct investment into its nascent Islamic finance industry, particularly from the oil rich Middle Eastern countries, it requires a sound and robust judicial system and dispute resolution mechanism that can stand the test of time.","Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",International Islamic University Malaysia,"Oseni, UA (通讯作者)，Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",umaroseni@iium.edu.my,"Oseni, Umar A./F-9121-2011","Oseni, Umar A./0000-0002-2425-5345",,,,,65,11,11,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

This paper derives the implications of this observation for the pattern of matching in marriage markets, the dynamics of human capital accumulation, and the evolution of the gene pool. A key consequence of the trade-off faced by women is that marriage markets will naturally tend to be hypergamous - that is, a marriage is more likely to be beneficial to both parties relative to remaining single, the greater the man's human capital, and the lower the woman's human capital. As a consequence, it is shown that the equilibrium can only be of two types. In the Victorian type, all agents marry somebody of the same rank in the distribution of income. In the Sex and the City (SATC) type, women marry men who are better ranked than themselves. There is a mass of unmarried men at the bottom of the distribution of human capital, and a mass of single women at the top of that distribution. It is shown that the economy switches from a Victorian to an SATC equilibrium as inequality goes up. The model sheds light on how marriage affects the returns to human capital for men and women. Absent marriage, these returns are larger for women than for men but the opposite may occur if marriage prevails. Finally, it is shown that the institution of marriage may or may not favour human capital accumulation depending on how genes affect one's productivity at accumulating human capital.","[Saint-Paul, Gilles] NYU, Paris Sch Econ, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",,"Saint-Paul, G (通讯作者)，NYU, Paris Sch Econ, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",,,,,,,,31,3,3,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

The study presents and tests a theoretical model resorting to data on 151 Portuguese SMEs. The study uses nonlinear principal component analysis by alternating least squares, bivariate analysis and cluster analysis. Family characteristics influence governance mechanisms and family firms form clusters based on family characteristics and governance mechanisms. The results reveal that family characteristics are a source of heterogeneity among family firms which corroborates the criticism on family firms' homogeneity assumption. The identification of clusters of firms constitutes a reference for family firms' definition of governance models. The originality of the paper relies on the analysis of specific family characteristics and its importance as a source of family firms' heterogeneity is proven. This study opens new insights on family firms' governance research and may be extended to other family characteristics and overall implications on performance.","[Augusto Felicio, J.] Univ Lisbon, ISEG Sch Econ & Management, P-1200725 Lisbon, Portugal; [Galindo Villardon, Maria Purificacion] Univ Salamanca, Dept Stat, Salamanca 37007, Spain",Universidade de Lisboa; University of Salamanca,"Felício, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, ISEG Sch Econ & Management, Rua Miguel Lupi 20,Gab 603, P-1200725 Lisbon, Portugal.",jaufeli@iseg.ulisboa.pt; pgalindo@usal.es,"; Galindo-Villardon, Purificacion/E-3594-2013","FELICIO, J.

More recently this switch in travel mode has received considerable attention as declining levels of physical activity, growing car dependence and the childhood obesity crisis have pushed concerns about the health of future generations up the public health agenda, particularly in the U.S., but also in the UK and Europe. This has led to a proliferation of international studies researching a variety of individual, school and spatial characteristics associated with children's active travel to school which has been targeted by some governments as a potential silver bullet to reverse the trend. However, to date national pupil census data, which comprises annual data on all English pupils, including a mode of travel to school variable, has been under-utilised in the analysis of how pupils commute to school. Furthermore, methodologically, the grouped nature of the data with pupils clustered within both schools and residential neighbourhoods has often been ignored - an omission which can have considerable consequences for the statistical estimation of the model. The research presented here seeks to address both of these points by analysing pupil census data on all 26,709 secondary pupils (aged 11-16) who attended schools in Sheffield, UK during the 2009-10 school year. Individual pupil data is grouped within school, and neighbourhood, within a cross-classified multilevel model of active versus motorised modes of commuting to school. The results support the findings of other research that distance to school is key, but suggest that sociospatial clustering within neighbourhoods and schools is also critical. A further finding is that distance to school varies significantly by ethnicity, with white British pupils travelling the shortest distance of all ethnic groups. The implications of these findings for education and transport policy are discussed. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

As Richard Stewart (1975. Reformation of Administrative Law, 88 Harvard Law Review 1667-813) noted 35 years ago, administrative law is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Following Stewart, the modern explanation in legal scholarship of the transformation is that federal judges came to the rescue of the administrative state, actively intervening in the regulatory process in order to preserve key values which had been threatened by an admixture of internal pathologies and external (read: political) threats. We argue that the traditional explanation neglects a central aspect of the major transformations in American regulatory politics during the past half century-the critical role of Congress and the President in the reformation of both the American regulatory state and administrative law. The traditional explanation in legal scholarship, that courts implemented values and agendas separate from legislative aims, and hence separate from politics, is flawed because it neglects the larger transformations, beginning in the 1960s and continuing over the next two decades, in American national politics. During this period, a wide range of new constituencies arose, including the environmentalists, consumerists. The courts' role in the reformation must be seen in this broader political transformation of the 1960s and 1970s rather than in a court-centric perspective in isolation from the rest of the political system. We illustrate our thesis with nuclear power regulation, which demonstrates the critical, joint roles of entrepreneurs in Congress and the courts.","[Rodriguez, Daniel B.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Weingast, Barry R.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Northwestern University; Stanford University,"Rodriguez, DB (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,"RODRIGUEZ, Daniel/GWC-3563-2022","Weingast, Barry/0000-0002-4991-2444",Stanford; Texas,Stanford(Stanford University); Texas,"Earlier versions of this article were presented at the Searle Center Conference at Northwestern Law School (co-sponsored by Stanford and Texas), October 2010, at Center for the Study of Law and Politics Conference at California Institute of Technology and USC Gould School of Law, January 2010, and at 2009 workshops at Emory and Northwestern Law Schools.

This paper explores how the development of cognitive and relational social capital can, over time, mitigate such challenges and encourage fruitful collaboration between firms and universities in research alliances for the development of innovations. Using a multi-level perspective at the individual, organizational and alliance levels of social capital, this paper investigates firms participating in two contrasting research alliances: one well-established research alliance and one emerging alliance. This study suggests that the development of both cognitive and relational social capital at the individual, organizational and alliance levels appears crucial for effective collaboration in research alliances over time. Common goals and understandings regarding the collaboration and the creation of personal relationships between the employees of firms and universities helps mitigate collaborative challenges, stimulate cohesion and realize the goal of creating innovations.","[Steinmo, Marianne] Univ Nordland, Sch Business, Bodo, Norway",Nord University,"Steinmo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nordland, Sch Business, Bodo, Norway.",marianne.steinmo@uin.no,,,,,,,58,31,40,9,89,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Each of the five largest European hubs - Amsterdam, Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt, Heathrow, and Madrid - is closely associated with one former national flag carrier. Some concerns exist in Europe that the expansion of the Gulf carriers with their hubs in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha threatens the existence of European hubs regarding transfer city pairs that include at least one long-haul leg. Our paper examines the actual exposure to competition by combining airline schedules data with methodology to measure competitive tranger connections. We provide the percentage of the transfer city pairs of the five largest European hubs that is exposed to competition. Further, we identify the main competitors to each of these hubs. One important result of our paper is that despite the increasing market share of Gulf carriers, the main competition for transfer traffic is still among the five largest European hubs, with Munich and Istanbul being another two strong contenders. Hence, our paper puts into perspective the competitive risk posed by Gulf carriers and their hubs.

The underlying causal mechanisms for such effects remain unsettled. We consider a model in which parents impose more stringent disciplinary environments in response to their earlier-born children's poor performance in school in order to deter such outcomes for their later-born offspring. We provide robust empirical evidence that school performance of children in the National Longitudinal Study Children (NLSY-C) declines with birth order as does the stringency of their parents' disciplinary restrictions. When asked how they will respond if a child brought home bad grades, parents state that they would be less likely to punish their later-born children.

The external auditor firm rotation could supplement the internal mandatory rotation (auditor rotation) by the 8th EC directive. This article presents an agency theoretical foundation of rotation. In this context, the main influences on low balling and on the expectation gap will be presented. The total effect of the rotation on financial accounting and audit quality is theoretically uncertain, because the rotation can also lead to a decreased independence in a low balling situation and is connected with interrupted or lost learning and knowledge effects by the auditor or the audit firm. Then, a state of the art analysis of empirical research results with regard to auditor and audit firm rotation is focused. In contrast to the assumption of the EC, the majority of the empirical results don't lead to an increased financial accounting and audit quality by audit firm rotations. Furthermore, the positive effects of the internal rotation period of 7 years and the cooling off period of 2 years by the 8th EC directive are not empirically proved yet.","[Velte, Patrick; Freidank, Carl-Christian] Univ Hamburg, Dept Business Adm, Sch Business Econ & Social Sci, D-22765 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Velte, P (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Dept Business Adm, Sch Business Econ & Social Sci, Max Brauer Allee 60, D-22765 Hamburg, Germany.",Patrick.Velte@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,"Velte, Patrick/I-9262-2019","Velte, Patrick/0000-0001-5960-8449",,,,,103,1,2,0,71,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The IETF's contributions to flexible open transmission architecture, able to provide the required traffic qualities for the different applications, constitute the relevant pillars of a Generalized Differentiated Service (DiffServ) architecture. Further, the role of entrepreneurial traffic management within the Generalized DiffServ architecture, and the division of labor between the IETF and entrepreneurial traffic management, is analyzed. Within the umbrella architecture of Generalized DiffServ with the potential to combine basic elements of QoS differentiated traffic architectures, a flexible framework for entrepreneurial traffic quality differentiation strategies is evolving. Its basic characteristic is market-driven network neutrality with all applications bearing the opportunity costs of their required traffic capacities. Consequently, an artificial market split between best effort TCP/IP and managed services would conflict with the integrated service approach of the IETF. Finally, the implementation of Generalized DiffServ via Next Generation Networks is considered.","Univ Freiburg, Inst Transport Econ & Reg Policy, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Knieps, G (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Inst Transport Econ & Reg Policy, Freiburg, Germany.",guenter.knieps@vwl.uni-freiburg.de,,,,,,,33,4,4,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The paper aims at clarifying whether the impact of energy sector reforms on generation efficiency differs among countries according to their level of development and regional characteristics. Our hypothesis is that the EU reform model is not appropriate for all Member States and Southeast European countries since it does not improve efficiency in electricity generation in all countries and therefore, it can hamper economic growth. For testing the defined hypothesis the panel regression model with fixed effects has been used. The research results show that unlike in the EU-15 (old Member States), energy sector reforms in the EU-12 (new Member States), and selected Southeast European countries (Energy Community contracting parties) have no significant impact on electricity transmission and distribution losses. These evidences imply that the uniform EU reform model does not improve efficiency of electricity generation in less developed countries. On the contrary it can even hamper economic growth and therefore it cannot be appropriate for all Member States. The reason lies in the fact that successful reform model requires adequate level of institutional resources that are missing in most transition and post-transition countries.","[Lenz, Nela Vlahinic] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia; [Prsa, Vedran] JP Elektroprivreda BiH Subsidiary Elektrodistribu, Krupska Bb 77000, Bihac, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Rijeka,"Lenz, NV (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",nela@efri.hr; vedranpra@yahoo.com,"Lenz, Nela Vlahinić/P-9560-2018","Lenz, Nela Vlahinić/0000-0002-2317-0446",Croatian Science Foundation [IP-2013-11-2203]; University of Rijeka [13.02.1.3.05],Croatian Science Foundation; University of Rijeka,This work has been fully supported by Croatian Science Foundation under the project IP-2013-11-2203 and has been supported in part by the University of Rijeka under the project number 13.02.1.3.05.,,58,2,2,0,6,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

Taking advantage of lower rates in car use due to economic reasons, a Public Transport (PT) system reform, where the impact of adding value can thus be bigger, should be posed at the crux of the city's agenda. This reform refers to a provision of services contributing to the development of accessible affordable high-quality PT, which should, however, be based on smart-and-soft interventions that respect the limited budget while upgrading the perceived PT quality. Based on a dedicated examination of Thessaloniki, this paper seeks to determine users' needs and the impact on perceived time savings (and on modal shift) of key investments based on the exploitation of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for PT. The paper examines the soft interventions because the current economic system cannot afford extra pressure from the adoption of costly measures. The paper concludes by verifying that ICT can play a catalytic role in changing passengers' perception concerning time savings and can encourage passengers to use PT more often.

Our theoretical analyses show that under some conditions it is optimal for the owner to choose the relational governance, while under other conditions it is optimal for the owner to adopt the professional governance.

Their power is exerted in many ways, such as by funding progressive organizations and movements; sponsoring policy think tanks and organizations of public officials; influencing the political culture through media, academic researchers, and university programs (including public interest law in law schools); and co-opting activists and potential rebels among the rich and poor. Because of their resources and prestige, they are powerful members of coalitions and collaborations with overt and covert government departments, U.N. agencies, universities, and nongovernmental organizations. Foundations have been major actors in the Cold War, which continues as the attempt to deflect any movement towards socialism here or abroad. Globalization has amplified the power of foundations, for many of the global institutions were created by foundations and continue to be fostered by them. The sponsorship of civil society institutions worldwide by private foundations, now with additional billions from governments and international governmental institutions, supports U.S. hegemony: military, political, and economic. We cannot know what the world would have been like absent foundation activities, but the current one does not appear to have a democratic, peaceful, or sustainable future.","Keene State Coll, Polit Sci, Keene, NH 03431 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; Keene State College,"Roelofs, J (通讯作者)，Keene State Coll, Polit Sci, Keene, NH 03431 USA.",joan.roelofs@myfairpoint.net,,,,,,,28,21,25,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This research explores the influence of built environment on children's travel to school across a range of typical urban environments in Australia. The analysis draws on a sample of children and their parents from nine primary schools across four urban regions: Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Rockhampton. The built environment features for each school neighbourhood are measured. An analysis of travel, socio-demographics and attitudes to travel is conducted. The findings indicate that children residing in built environments that are more dense and urban are significantly associated with more active travel to school and for other journey purposes. Distance to school is critical for active travel (AT) and many children lived beyond walking distance. While built environment is important, a decisive role for children's active travel to school and other places is seen in the combination of preferences and licences. Children who AT prefer to be more autonomous/independent travellers and have parents who foster their IM; conversely, children's preferences for being driven coincides with parents' fears for IM and lack of confidence in their children abilities to travel independently.

In a linear (Hotelling) market we show that a minimum distance rule is beneficial for consumers and disadvantageous for the firms when demand is sufficiently inelastic. The distance rule that maximises social welfare is one quarter of the market under which firms will be located at the quartiles. Those locations are also optimal under regulated prices. Moreover, our model of two licenses with simultaneous entry is the first one that performs the horizontal product differentiation analysis using quadratic transportation costs and a binding reservation price. We find that a subgame perfect equilibrium exists for all the values of the reservation price and, for those values that induce a unique location equilibrium, the distance between the firms ranges from one half of the of the market to the whole market length. This analysis, which is not yet considered in the literature, is motivated by a change of entry regulation in the drugstore market in the Spanish region of Navarre. Since the demand in this market is quite inelastic, the minimum distance rule maybe socially more beneficial than the license rule.","[Elizalde, Javier; Kinateder, Markus; Rodriguez-Carreno, Ignacio] Univ Navarra, Pamplona 31009, Spain",University of Navarra,"Elizalde, J (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, Campus Univ,Edificio Amigos, Pamplona 31009, Spain.",jelizalde@unav.es,"Carreño, Ignacio Rodríguez/L-8277-2014; Kinateder, Markus/K-9801-2014; Elizalde, Javier/C-7432-2018","Carreño, Ignacio Rodríguez/0000-0001-9287-0190; Kinateder, Markus/0000-0002-0833-0157; Elizalde, Javier/0000-0003-0401-6205","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2010-18680, ECO2012-34202]",Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government),Financial support from Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (ECO2010-18680 and ECO2012-34202) is gratefully acknowledged.,,23,0,0,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

An additional aim is to test whether such factors predict intentions to use public transport and reported use of public transport. Data were collected via a self-completion questionnaire survey conducted in June and August 2013. Participants included a total of 1039 people who were randomly selected from the urban regions of Norway using the Norwegian population registry. Due to missing data on travel mode use variables the analyses were conducted with 546 observed cases. Two clusters of transport users were identified; individuals who primarily use public and health-promoting transport (e.g. public transportation users, bicyclists) and car users. Logistic regression analysis showed that older age, strength of the car use habit, and priorities of flexibility (e.g. prioritize being able to choose the exact time of travel) increased the odds of car use. Structural Equation Modeling showed that priority of convenience, priority of safety and security, and favorable attitudes towards public transport use were positive predictors of intentions to use public transportation, while car use habit was a negative predictor of both intentions to use public transportation and reported public transportation use. Traffic safety campaigns aiming to increase public transportation use in the urban Norwegian public could focus on increasing the attractiveness of public transport, particularly by improving flexibility of such transport.

Using Fama- MacBeth regressions, we find that industry concentration is negatively related to average stock returns, even after controlling for beta, size, book-to-market equity, momentum, and leverage. In addition, there is a strong evidence of a growth effect. Firms or industry portfolios with smaller book-to-market ratios have significantly higher returns. In contrast, beta is never statistically significant. The above results are robust to firm- and industry- level regressions, and the formation of firms into 100 size-beta portfolios. Our findings indicate that competitive industries earn, on average, higher risk-adjusted returns than concentrated industries. An explanation is that investors in more competitive industries require larger premiums for greater distress risks associated with these industries. Our paper is one of the first to link market competition with the average stock returns in the UK, and contributes to the asset pricing literature by extending the evidence from the US to another important financial market.","[Hashem, Nawar] Damascus Univ, Fac Econ, Damascus, Syria; [Su, Larry] Univ Greenwich, Sch Business, London SE10 9LS, England",Damascus University; University of Greenwich,"Su, L (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Sch Business, London SE10 9LS, England.",nhashem@hotmail.co.uk; l.su@gre.ac.uk,"Su, Larry/AAH-8426-2021","Su, Larry/0000-0001-8285-5122",,,,,27,6,6,0,13,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

We define the forecastability quotient (Q) to support this economic analysis. We implement TPOP in our empirical analysis via double exponential smoothing with a damped trend, and implement ROP through a simple moving average. Our empirical study of a large dataset of time series from a Fortune 100 firm found that Q in the holdout sample can be predicted using just three variables from the estimation sample. Surprisingly, many highly touted time series metrics (e.g., the coefficient of variation and approximate entropy) and forecast accuracy metrics (e.g., the mean absolute percentage error) were not good predictors of Q. We then validated this model on four additional datasets. This research contributes both to the research literature and to managers who need to decide whether an independent demand item should be managed with a TPOP or reorder point system.

This paper is the first to explicitly model and estimate social interaction between siblings' migration decisions in such settings. The interaction consists of two effects with opposite signs; a chain migration effect that can cause traditional caregiving structures to break down and an opposing specialization effect that increases family members' incentives to remain at home and provide care when their siblings migrate. The estimates for Moldova, one of the countries with the highest emigration rates in the world, indicate that siblings' interaction strongly decreases their equilibrium emigration rates. Siblings' interaction is found to increase in line with the incentives that are assumed in the model. Hence, the paper provides evidence of the robustness of families' informal security arrangements to large-scale emigration and has important implications for policies that aim at the population left behind.","Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Stöhr, T (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",tobias.stoehr@ifw-kiel.de,,"Heidland, Tobias/0000-0001-9646-1132",EuropeAid project [DCI-MIGR/210/229-604],EuropeAid project,"I would like to thank Marcus Bohme, Brian Krauth, Judith Heidland, Toman Omar Mahmoud, Kacana Sipangule, Andreas Steinmayr, Rainer Thiele, Michaella Vanore, the editor, four anonymous referees, and seminar participants at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, the University of Kiel, Maastricht School of Governance, SMYE 2013 and the 2013 AEL conference.

Projects run by partnerships were five times as likely to reach commercialization as those without business partners, and they had mean revenues approximately 10 times as great as projects run by solo entrepreneurs. These gross differences may be due both to partners impacting business success that is, who the particular partners were, and to selection of the type of project or of whom to select as a partner. After controlling for selection effects and observed/unobserved heterogeneity, the smallest estimate of partners' complementary assets approximately doubles the probability of commercialization and increases expected revenues by 29% at the sample mean. Our findings suggest that a critical policy option to increase commercialization rates and revenues for early-stage businesses is to support the market for finding skilled partners.","[Astebro, Thomas] HEC Paris, F-78351 Jouy En Josas, France; [Serrano, Carlos J.] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona GSE, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Serrano, Carlos J.] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Banco Espana, Barcelona 08005, Spain",Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris; Barcelona School of Economics; Pompeu Fabra University; Pompeu Fabra University; Banco de Espana,"Åstebro, T (通讯作者)，HEC Paris, F-78351 Jouy En Josas, France.",astebro@hec.fr; carlos.serrano@upf.edu,"Serrano, Carlos/R-9871-2018","Serrano, Carlos/0000-0002-5792-5210; Astebro, Thomas/0000-0002-8077-7631",HEC Foundation; HEC Leadership Center; Marie Curie FP7-PEOPLE-COFUND Action [600387],HEC Foundation; HEC Leadership Center; Marie Curie FP7-PEOPLE-COFUND Action(European Union (EU)),"We have benefited from comments by Victor Aguirregabiria, Serguey Braguinsky, Alberto Galasso, Bart Hamilton, Octavian Harare, Ig Horstmann, Alexander Kritikos, Illoong Kwon, Evgeny Lyandres, Tomasz Obloj, Robert Petrunia, Aloysius Siow, Sheryl Winston Smith, Scott Stern, Peter Thompson, Tereza Tykvova, and seminar participants at several conferences.

The horizontal approach views such restrictions as an agreement among the participants of a sports league with the sports association merely representing an organization executing the horizontal cooperation. In contrast, the vertical approach views the sports association as being a dominant upstream firm enjoying a monopoly position on the market stage for competition organizing services, an important input for the actual product-the sports game. Taking the recent Financial Fair Play (FFP) initiative by UEFA (the Union of European Football Associations) as an example, we demonstrate that the different views lead to different assessments of restrictive effects and, thus, matter for competition policy decisions. The economic story of the potential restrictive effect of FFP on players' and player agents' income may fit more plausibly to the horizontal approach, whereas the potentially anticompetitive foreclosure and deterrence effects of FFP may be economically more soundly reasoned by taking the vertical approach.","[Budzinski, Oliver] Tech Univ Ilmenau, Inst Econ, Econ Theory, Ehrenbergstr, Germany; [Szymanski, Stefan] Univ Michigan, Sch Kinesiol, Sport Management, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Budzinski, O (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ilmenau, Inst Econ, Econ Theory, Ehrenbergstr, Germany.",oliver.budzinski@tu-ilmenau.de; stefansz@umich.edu,,"Budzinski, Oliver/0000-0003-4096-072X",,,,,35,8,9,2,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

J,"Nicholson, A",,,,"Nicholson, Alan",,,Travel time reliability benefits: Allowing for correlation,RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Travel time; Reliability; Estimation; Benefits; Correlation,,"The economies in developed countries depend heavily on their transport systems. That dependence has increased with the adoption of 'just-in-time' production methods, which involve reducing the costs associated with holding goods in stock and relying on required goods being delivered promptly once ordered. This has meant an increased emphasis on the reliability of the service and increased efforts to mitigate the impacts of disruption of road transport networks, and has led to changes in reliability being included within economic appraisals of road network improvement projects that are expected to result in an improvement in reliability. Current methods for estimating the benefits of such projects typically involve estimating the change in the standard deviation of trip time and assigning a monetary value to that reduction. While it can be shown that the estimate of the standard deviation of trip time is sensitive to correlation between the travel speeds on the segments of a trip, the methods do not allow for such correlation. The few studies to assess the level and extent of such correlation have led to different conclusions regarding the need to allow for such correlation. This paper will discuss why those studies have produced different conclusions. Another issue associated with estimating the travel time reliability benefits of projects is that current traffic assignment methods do not take account of travel time variability when predicting the flows on alternative paths through networks. This means inconsistency between the flow estimation and economic appraisal stages, and casts further doubt upon the robustness of estimates of the travel time reliability benefits of road network improvement projects. The paper will review research relating to these two issues and describe research which shows that ignoring correlation can result in substantial errors in estimates of the benefits of projects that are expected to result in an improvement in reliability. The paper will conclude with a discussion of how the process for estimating travel time reliability benefits can be improved.

Previous studies have focused on the extent to which Norwegian politicians use the results of cost-benefit analyses when they prioritise various road projects. In contrast, we analyse how road characteristics, prior to the planning period (2009 and earlier), influence the amount of money to be spent on the roads. Broadly speaking, the multiple regression analysis shows that the technical characteristics of the roads and their environmental impacts do not have a substantial influence on the funding decisions. The most prominent explanatory factors seem to be the total traffic on the roads under consideration. Thus, our analysis does not support critics of the allocation of funding to Norwegian roads who claim that regional policy considerations largely decide the allocation of road funding. The opponents' critics, however, gain support from the fact that, due to frequent start-ups and stops. in Norwegian road building, no economies of scale seem to exist. Another result worth noting is that roads located in constituencies that, relative to the number of inhabitants, are overrepresented in the Norwegian Parliament receive more funding. This does not necessarily mean that politicians are particularly concerned about the people in these constituencies but rather that they perceive high political returns for investing in these constituencies.

Using data for the period 1996 to 2011 we find that implied volatility is an effective predictor of the month-ahead realized volatility. We show that implied volatility subsumes the information content of contemporaneous volatility, and it contains incremental information on future volatility after controlling for contemporaneous volatility. Furthermore, incorporating risk-neutral skewness, and especially kurtosis, improves the forecasting of realized volatility. Overall, the association between implied volatility and month-ahead realized volatility is consistent with evidence documented for other asset classes, leading us to conclude that implied volatility serves as a reasonable proxy for expected volatility.

This has led policy and development experts to opt for strategies to induce a shift in the pattern of specialization towards other sectors. This paper proposes a different approach. By exploring recent evidence from the Argentinean agricultural sector and the mining industry in Chile, it points to the window of opportunity that NR industries offer as a platform to develop knowledge intensive industries with which to support economic development in resource-endowed countries. The lessons drawn from these findings suggest that development strategies can also promote more innovative knowledge intensive NR-based industries rather than moving away from them.","[Marin, Anabel] Conicet Cenit Univ Nacl Tres de Febrero, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Navas-Aleman, Lizbeth] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Perez, Carlota] LSE, London, England; [Perez, Carlota] Tallinn Univ Technol, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia; [Perez, Carlota] Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Tallinn University of Technology; University of Sussex,"Marin, A (通讯作者)，Conicet Cenit Univ Nacl Tres de Febrero, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",a.i.marin@fund-cenit.org.ar; L.Navas-Aleman@ids.ac.uk; carperez@carlotaperez.org,,"Marin, Anabel/0000-0002-4612-1903",ESRC [ES/H008098/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H008098/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,43,38,41,2,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Results from the BUS test reject the null hypothesis of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) returns and results from the simulation indicate that the average quarterly return remains almost constant and thus independent of the holding period but the average quarterly risk (standard deviation) varies among different timberland investment vehicles. For private-equity timberland assets, the average periodic risk increases with the holding period, whereas for public-equity timberland assets, it stays relatively constant. Overall, there is some evidence that private-equity timberland returns as measured by various NCREIF timberland indices tend not to be independent and identically distributed, a violation of the key assumption for the modern portfolio theory.

In the introduction, we argue that the interpretative power of the current evolutionary approach can be improved by elaborating an augmented' perspective to economic development, which explicitly integrates the role of institutions and the dynamics of natural resource sectors (e.g. agro-food) into the analysis. We maintain that such a theoretical and empirical advancement can help to define a conceptual framework that is more suitable to analyse innovation-driven change, differentiated development patterns, opportunities and constraints for developing countries in the globalised knowledge economy. A collection of papers that adopt this perspective are discussed in order to prove the interpretative power of this approach in a variety of development contexts.","[Morrison, Andrea] Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Planning, Sect Econ Geog, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Morrison, Andrea] Crios Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy; [Cusmano, Lucia] OECD Ctr SMEs Entrepreneurship & Local Dev, Paris, France",Utrecht University; Bocconi University; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Morrison, A (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Planning, Sect Econ Geog, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",a.morrison@uu.nl; Lucia.CUSMANO@oecd.org,"CORREA, RENATA/AAA-2417-2022","Morrison, Andrea/0000-0002-1878-6780",,,,,41,8,8,2,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

We then test the predictions of the model regarding the impact of output in the sending country and migration costs on average skill level of immigrants to the United States from 1899 to 1932, where immigration was initially unrestricted by law and then highly limited. Our panel of 39 countries includes data on occupations that immigrants had in their country of origin, providing a more accurate skill measure than previously available datasets. We find that migration costs have a negative but skill-neutral effect on quantity of immigrants and an increase in output, measured as GDP per capita, has a positive effect on quantity and a negative effect on average skill level of immigrants, suggesting that the main channel by which changes in output affected the average skill level of migrants in that time period is through the easing or tightening of the liquidity constraints and not through the economic incentives as in previous models. Also, using migrants' occupation in the United States as a measure of skills would lead to misleading conclusions.","[Covarrubias, Matias; Lafortune, Jeanne; Tessada, Jose] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Lafortune, Jeanne; Tessada, Jose] EH Clio Lab UC, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Covarrubias, M (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile.",jlafortune@uc.cl,"Lafortune, Jeanne/Q-7146-2019","Lafortune, Jeanne/0000-0003-0127-0646",Conicyt Programa de Investigacion Asociativa SOC [1102]; Fondecyt Grant Iniciacion [11110101],Conicyt Programa de Investigacion Asociativa SOC; Fondecyt Grant Iniciacion(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),We would like to thank conference participants at the EH-Clio Lab UC First Annual Conference and the Journal of Demographic Economics Inaugural Conference.

I show that the SEP holder's contractual obligations still permit it to seek an injunction. A FRAND commitment requires the SEP holder to offer a license for the SEPs on FRAND terms (or otherwise to grant implementers access to the SEPs). Extending an offer containing a price within the FRAND range discharges the SEP holder's contractual obligation. Thereafter, the SEP holder may seek to enjoin an implementer that has rejected a FRAND offer. This analysis indicates the imprudence of categorically banning injunctions for the infringement of SEPs, as some scholars have advocated and as one of the world's most significant SSOs-the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)-actually did in 2015 in amendments to its bylaws. Such a ban would invite opportunism by implementers and is unnecessary. Courts already can prevent opportunism by SEP holders by conditioning an injunction on the implementer's actual or constructive rejection of a FRAND offer.","Criter Econ LLC, Washington, DC 20006 USA",,"Sidak, JG (通讯作者)，Criter Econ LLC, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",jgsidak@criterioneconomics.com,,,Qualcomm,Qualcomm,"Chairman, Criterion Economics, L.L.C., Washington, D.C.

It is located in Lake Victoria where since the 1990s a vibrant Nile perch fishing for overseas export developed. Focusing on a very small area in the Ugandan part of the lake, the paper uncovers a larger diversity in fishermen's responses to the dynamic environment of the Nile perch sector than a widely adopted generic model predicts. To understand this better, the paper looks at the social practices of Nile perch fishermen, uncovering the operation of different, spatially situated, fishing styles. These styles structure the social relations that the fishermen mobilise, the symbolic meanings they attach to their gear, and the values that inspire their decision-making. By thus looking at socio-cultural factors the paper hopes to contribute to an emerging spatial perspective on small-scale fishing in Africa that begins with an interest in actual social practice.","Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Cultural Anthropol & Dev Studies CAOS, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Beuving, J (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Cultural Anthropol & Dev Studies CAOS, Thomas van Aquinostr 4, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands.",j.beuving@maw.ru.nl,"Beuving, Joost/B-9592-2018","Beuving, Joost/0000-0002-0879-7400",,,,,35,6,6,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Drawing on the analysis of fepow-community.org.uk, an online network devoted to honouring the stories of Allied soldiers interned by the Japanese during the Second World War (also known as FEPOWs), and an online survey of its members, this paper examines the extent that such platforms facilitate more inclusionary allowances for doing so vis-a-vis physical sites of memory. Specifically, while web-memorials do remedy some of the shortcomings linked to the latter, they too are plagued by criticisms limiting them as a more democratic way of remembering. It also highlights how physical sites of memory provide certain affective resonances virtual memorials do not. Consequently, both genres of memory are often capitalised upon complementarily (rather than in a mutually exclusive way) as each feeds into the other, both salient to memory work.","[Muzaini, Hamzah] Wageningen Univ, Cultural Geog Chair Grp, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Yeoh, Brenda S.

Organisational identification comprises identification with the organisation both as a collective of individuals and as a social entity. Perceived external prestige augments corporate identification and helps to explain organisational commitment. A strong positive link between corporate identification and organisational commitment was also found. The findings suggest a means for marketing strategists and general managers to predict the consequences of managing reputation for employees and to undertake appropriate initiatives to enhance corporate identification inside the company and thus influence organisational commitment and corporate performance.","[Podnar, Klement; Golob, Ursa] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Golob, U (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Kardeljeva Pl 5, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",klement.podnar@fdv.uni-lj.si; ursa.golob@fdv.uni-lj.si,"Podnar, Klement/ABD-3461-2020; Golob, Ursa/JXM-2175-2024; Golob, Urša/AAX-3495-2021","Golob, Urša/0000-0001-7782-0996",,,,,48,10,11,0,27,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The vast expansion of digital data has been closely intertwined with the development of advanced analytical algorithms with which to make sense of the data. The advent of techniques of knowledge discovery affords some capacity for the analytics to derive the object or subject of interest from clusters and patterns in large volumes of data, otherwise imperceptible to human reading. Thus, the scale of the big in big data is of less significance to contemporary forms of knowing and governing than what we will call the little analytics. Following Henri Bergson's analysis of forms of perception which 'cut out' a series of figures detached from the whole, we propose that analytical algorithms are instruments of perception without which the extensity of big data would not be comprehensible. The technologies of analytics focus human attention and decision on particular persons and things of interest, whilst annulling or discarding much of the material context from which they are extracted. Following the algorithmic processes of ingestion, partitioning and memory, we illuminate how the use of analytics engines has transformed the nature of analysis and knowledge and, thus, the nature of the governing of economic, social and political life.","[Amoore, Louise; Piotukh, Volha] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, S Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England",Durham University,"Amoore, L (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Dept Geog, S Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",louise.amoore@dur.ac.uk; volha.piotukh@durham.ac.uk,,,RCUK [ES/K000276/1]; ESRC [ES/K000276/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K000276/1] Funding Source: researchfish,RCUK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This work was supported by the RCUK Global Uncertainties Fellowship Securing against Future Events: Pre-emption, Protocols and Publics [Grant number ES/K000276/1].",,68,105,106,3,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Depending on researched indicators, convergence is divided into nominal and real convergence. The aim of this paper is to analyze the nominal convergence in the European Union through the most used indicator that is comparative price level. An alternative concept to the nominal convergence is the Maastricht criteria, fulfillment of which is a condition for joining the European Monetary Union. While researching the Maastricht criteria is a broader form of nominal convergence, price levels in this paper present a narrower form of analysis in this paper through the comparative price level. Values of this indicator of EU Member States are compared to the average of the European Union (EU-28). Nominal convergence is connected with real convergence and both processes, changes in economic level and price level, occur simultaneously. By using simple regression analysis (linear model), the relationship between real and nominal convergence, was tested. Results showed that the correlation between researched indicators, i.e. gross domestic product per capita in PPS and comparative price level, is very tight. Countries with low economic level have low price level and on the contrary, countries with high economic level have high price level. The price level of the Czech Republic is, in comparison to the price level of the European Union, lower than would be appropriate for its economic level.","[Brandova, Blanka; Rozkovec, Jiri] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Dept Econ Stat, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Brandová, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Dept Econ Stat, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",blanka.brandova@tul.cz; jiri.rozkovec@tul.cz,"Rozkovec, Jiri/AFP-2672-2022; Brandová, Blanka/AAC-5497-2020","Rozkovec, Jiri/0000-0001-8870-5467; Brandová, Blanka/0000-0002-2894-7955",,,,,11,0,0,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,29.0,35,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000003,0

The authors as well show that the path dependence is stronger and the chance to modern development is lower in those countries where institutional reforms were not carried through.","[Iacobuta, Andreea-Oana; Pohoata, Ion] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi 700505, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Iacobuta, AO (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Blvd Carol 1,22, Iasi 700505, Romania.",andreea.iacobuta@uaic.ro; ionpohoata@yahoo.com,"Iacobuta-Mihaita, Andreea-Oana/GJB-6392-2022; Pohoata, Ion/A-2230-2017","Pohoata, Ion/0000-0002-1046-3864","Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi, Romania [GI-2014-12]","Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi, Romania","This work was financed by Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi, Romania, through project Path dependence in Romania's development- a new institutionalist approach; code GI-2014-12, Grants for Alexandra loan Cuza University of Iasi, Romania young researchers.",,23,1,1,0,29,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

While, the number of roads to be maintain are numerous and lengthy the approach in executing the maintenance of these roads needs to be reviewed Damages to roads are mainly brought about due to the lack of standardization of the road constructions, including solidity of soil, concrete steel, and asphalt. In addition, the damages to these roads are also caused by lack of water controlling system (drainage) and overloads. Added to this is the fact that the maintenance of road infrastructures by the Service of Public Works of Padang City was conducted using two traditional maintenance models namely;, the periodic maintenance and regular maintenance model. The two models are dependent on the budget allocation. The problems of road maintenance in Padang City lead to a research with the objective of finding an appropriate maintenance model. Prior to conducting a full scale research an initial research was conducted aimed at identifying the appropriate tools that can be used to identify priorities in conducting road maintenance. Two method were selected namely the Fuzzy Screening System (FSS) and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method as tools to solve the problems for prioritizing maintenance. By using (FSS) and (AHP) method simultaneously), this research hopes to develop a new method in prioritizing road maintenance activities in Padang.

One of the main reasons for the evaluation of information systems is to receive feedback and adopt measures based on results. Although there is a lot of foreign literature in this area, there are still differences in the usage of research results. In this article I compared the methods according to the following six criteria: method, number of phases/criteria, information system life cycle phase, output, the possibility of comparing results of effectiveness, primary focus of the method. For the analysis, which is the subject of my work, I have chosen four scientific articles - four different approaches that have been published since 2011. This article contains detailed descriptions, benefits, drawbacks and comparison of chosen methods. The primary aim is to analyze chosen methods, which can be used for the evaluation of information systems. The secondary aim of this paper is theoretical preparation for the dissertation thesis. The basis of the method, which is purpose of my thesis, is considering the close links between the organization and business informatics. Above all, it is about appreciating the life cycle of the company, the content of the information strategy and the information system life cycle. The system would be assessed from two perspectives - levels: organizational level (e.g. financial criteria) and user level (e.g. system requirements). The result of the methods would be to assess the state of a system that respects the organizational level (e.g. financial limits) and user level (e.g., if it fulfils the requirements of users). Based on this evaluation it would be possible to take a decision whether to implement the proposed changes.","[Novak, Lukas] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Novák, L (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic.",novakl@fbm.vutbr.cz,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,612.0,621,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700063,0

The combination of methods could bridge the implementation gap between scenario-based research and actual policy implementation and thus increase the chances of research being implemented in practise. In the case study, backcasting identifies a need for diverse fuels and vehicles and for immediate policy action. However, analysis of policy integration demonstrates that such action is unlikely given current policy structures. The fundamental lack of integration between energy and transport policy obstructs measures to increase the use of renewable fuels and more energy-efficient vehicles, which in turn obstructs the reduction of CO2 emissions from transport. The combination of backcasting and policy analysis is demonstrated to improve our understanding of the prerequisites for transitioning to a system based on renewable energy, and could thus be useful in further research.

Most theories emphasize the importance of R&D investment in the creation and development of country's competitive advantage. Each country has its own unique characteristics, with different resources and opportunities to use them for the increase of competitiveness. The use of resources for R&D investment is much more efficient together with a proper identification of industry sectors and formation of priorities for R&D investment. The research has revealed that the economies of the Baltic States basically cover low technology industries where innovations are continual and based on market demand whereas the largest share of R&D funding consists of the state budget funds, allocating comparatively the largest part of the funds in the sector of higher education. Rather different correlations between the same economic indicators or indexes reveal that the indicators determined by R&D investment compose only an insignificant share in the scale of the sources of economic growth.

The present paper analyzes the current knowledge of future climate changes to understand their possible impacts on real estate sector of Malaysia with an aim to help stakeholders to adopt necessary responses to reduce negative impacts. The study shows that rising temperature, changing precipitation pattern, and increasing frequency and severity of extreme events may pose risk of property damage and increase property maintenance cost. Constraints in water and energy resources due to climate change may increase the property lifecycle cost. Property price and the overall growth of property sector may be affected for implementing the government policy of greenhouse gas emission reduction up to 40% by the year 2020. The study reveals that property sector of Malaysia will be affected more to implementation of greenhouse gas emission reduction policy in the short-term and due to physical risk posed by variable climate and related extreme events in the long-term.","[Shahid, Shamsuddin] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Hydraul & Hydrol, Johor Baharu 81301, Malaysia; [Minhas, Anil] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Geotech & Transportat, Johor Baharu 81301, Malaysia; [Muthuveerappan, Chitrakala] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Geoinformat & Real Estate, Dept Property Management, Johor Baharu 81301, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Shahid, S (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Hydraul & Hydrol, Johor Baharu 81301, Malaysia.",sshahid@utm.my,"SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/B-5185-2010","SHAHID, SHAMSUDDIN/0000-0001-9621-6452; Muthuveerappan, Chitrakala/0000-0003-4460-1193",,,,,59,0,0,2,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,3540.0,3553,,,,,,14,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700371,0

In the tax structures of many countries, Value Added Tax (ESA95 code D.211) represents a most important source of budgetary revenues, raising about one-fourth of the world's tax revenue. Like other taxes, VAT is subject to risks arising from tax errors and evasions that reduce the scope of the declared, accounted for and collected tax. Estimation of VAT losses is an important tool for their detection and prevention as well as for collection of the right sums of VAT in the right time (European Commission, 2015).

The cross-sectional methodology, group comparison, measurement of inter-rater agreement and explanatory factor analysis were used to find out the differences in the assessment of leadership effectiveness. The results of this study suggest that when subordinates assess their leader's performance, the application of different theoretical background to the appraisal system does not make a distinction between the feedbacks. However, the subordinates agree more on the appraisal of leader's performance based on behavioural paradigm in comparison to the transformational leadership theory.

We find that although targeted advertising avoids the wasting of ads, firms might find it optimal to mix specialized advertising with the mass media. We also show that the characteristics of the specialized media available crucially affect the outcome of price competition between firms, which can range from a full fragmentation of the market into local monopolies to lower average prices (compared to the case where firms had only mass advertising available). Regarding welfare, we prove that although the use of specialized advertising can lower consumer surplus and drive a fragment of consumers out of the market, this advertising technology is welfare-improving, and can be Pareto superior.","[Esteban, Lola; Hernandez, Jose M.] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Anal Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Esteban, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Anal Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",lesteban@unizar.es; hernande@unizar.es,"Hernández, José/JKI-8418-2023","Hernández, José/0009-0006-6689-6980",,,,,15,3,3,2,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Previous research attributes the rapid recovery to shifts in supply and demand curves. Our analysis suggests the more probable explanation is rotation in the curves. Supply and demand shifts come into play in the second and third years as rebuilding from the hurricane begins in earnest, and as timber inventory is rebuilt in response to elevated price expectations. But for the period in which price recovery occurs, model simulations based on data for Hurricane Hugo indicate the major causal factors of the observed price dynamics are curve rotation and trade with the surrounding undamaged region. Inventory-based supply shifts, the previously-identified causal factor, play a minor role in the observed price dynamics. Getting the causal factors right is important for predicting the price effects of forest inventory shocks, and for proper measurement of their welfare effects.

However, the existing literature suggests nothing to constrain ex post strategic behavior of contractors except the reputation mechanism. This paper uncovers a complementary vehicle: an ex post incentive payment mechanism for contract adaptation. The incentive payment mechanism contributes to the regulatory literature in the transportation industry, by providing a method to prevent ex post strategic behavior of the contractor. After relaxing the traditional assumption that contract adaptation is exogenous, we show that the government will undertake a higher payment for cost-saving efficiency that also brings a higher ex post economic profit to the contractor. Using highway paving contracts of California Department of Transportation, we provide evidence of a positive relationship between ex post economic profit and ex post payment. Our results are robust to different types of contract adaptation.","[Fu, Tong] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Ind Econ, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Fu, T (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Ind Econ, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",canjianft@hotmail.com,"Fu, Tong/AAS-8814-2021","FU, TONG/0000-0002-6929-3230",,,,,24,0,0,0,6,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

Recent research reports the need to assess equity impacts of urban projects to better allocate resources. This has an even larger meaning in Latin America, because of great inequalities present. Additionally, literature about accessibility highlights the readiness of their indicators on assessing equitable access to opportunities Hence, this work explores ways to measure access inequality aimed towards better methodologies for transport project assessment. Chile represents an opportunity to develop this approach. Different accessibility measures for modelled future scenarios are analysed in the context of Santiago. The method builds from a simple accessibility formulation based on travel times forecasted by a four-step transport model. Using two subway projects as case study, methodological implications for assessment are then discussed. As a result, an index is proposed to incorporate equitable accessibility impacts parallel to CBA, which demands to further consolidate multi-criteria analysis. In the future it may also be possible to explore a value for accessibility to allow a different type of cost-benefit analysis. Conclusion remarks operational and concept issues that need to be addressed to further build a useful accessibility and equity indicators. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Cointegration analysis is used to estimate the long-run equilibrium relationships between several time series, with the coefficients of these long-run equilibrium relationships being the cointegrating vectors. We provide a sparse estimator of the cointegrating vectors, where sparse estimation means that some elements of the cointegrating vectors are estimated to be exactly zero. The sparse estimator is applicable in high-dimensional settings, where the time series is short compared to the number of time series. Our method achieves better estimation and forecast accuracy than the traditional Johansen method in sparse and/or high-dimensional settings. We use the sparse method for interest rate growth forecasting and consumption growth forecasting. The sparse cointegration method leads to important forecast accuracy gains relative to the Johansen method. (C) 2016 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Using Singapore as an example, we investigate the impact of planners' and developers' decisions on the density distribution of high-income households in areas around Mass Rapid Transit(MRT) stations and how these households respond to better access to urban rail transit systems. We find that the maximum density permitted by the master plan is only marginally correlated with the distances to MRT stations. Instead, the average unit size tends to be smaller, and the share of small-sized units tends to be higher in new private projects that are close to MRT stations after the new lines are in operation. This indicates that developers, who act mainly in response to the market, intentionally place more housing units in developments closer to MRT stations. Consequently, more upper- and upper-middle-class households that can afford private housing are accommodated in areas with greater accessibility to MRT. By comparing two household travel surveys before and after the opening of the Circle Line, we find that MRT did not change household demographics much in the station area, but there was an evident change in the mode share of trips made by the surveyed households, embodied by lower levels of car dependence and more reliance on MRT.

Players learn the probability that a risky prospect pays by either taking draws from the distribution themselves or observing the outcome of another player's choice. Our experiment is designed to learn whether players experiment strategically, anticipating the opportunity to free-ride on others' information and doing so. While error rates exhibit a bias toward under-experimentation, we observe a significant strategic effect. Structural parameter estimates suggest the lack of experimentation observed is due to decision error and somewhat pessimistic priors, rather than risk preferences or probability weighting.

We assess the effects of both regulatory changes on railroad safety with the use of RegData: a new data set that was developed by one of the authors that measures the amount of regulation that is imposed by specific regulatory agencies on specific industries.

I adopt Bayesian methodology with shrinkage in the parameters of the probit model for the binary time series tracking the state of the economy. The in-sample and out-of-sample results show that utilizing a large cross-section of indicators yields superior US recession forecasts in comparison to a number of parsimonious benchmark models. Moreover, the data-rich probit model gives similar accuracy to the factor-based model for the 1-month-ahead forecasts, while it provides superior performance for 1-year-ahead predictions. Finally, in a pseudo-real-time application for the Great Recession, I find that the large probit model with shrinkage is able to pick up the recession signals in a timely fashion and does well in comparison to the more parsimonious specification and to nonparametric alternatives.

We hypothesize that two-candidate races provide stronger incentives for going negative relative to non-duopoly contests: when the number of competitors is greater than two, airing negative ads creates positive externalities for opponents that are not the object of the attack. To investigate the empirical relevance of the fewness of competitors in explaining the volume of negative advertising, we exploit variation in the number of entrants running for US non-presidential primaries from 2000 through 2008. Duopolies are over twice as likely to air a negative ad when compared to non-duopolies, and the tendency for negative advertising decreases in the number of competitors. The estimates are robust to various specification checks and the inclusion of potential confounding factors at the race, candidate, and advertisement levels.","[Gandhi, Amit] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI USA; [Iorio, Daniela] Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Urban, Carly] Montclair State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Bologna; Montclair State University,"Urban, C (通讯作者)，Montclair State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA.",carly.urban@montana.edu,,"IORIO, DANIELA/0000-0002-3718-9201",Barcelona GSE; Government of Catalonia,Barcelona GSE; Government of Catalonia(Generalitat de Catalunya),"We thank Andrea Mattozzi, Riccardo Puglisi, Karl Scholz, Erik Snowberg, Chris Taber, Stefano Gagliarducci, two anonymous referees, and seminar participants at European University Institute, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Bologna, 1st IGIER Political Economy Workshop, 2nd Petralia Sottana Workshop for helpful comments and discussions.

Appraisal petitions have increased markedly over our sample from 2000 to 2014, and the composition of those bringing these suits has shifted from individual shareholders toward specialized hedge funds. Appraisal petitions are more likely to be filed against mergers with perceived conflicts of interest, including going-private deals, minority squeeze outs, and acquisitions with low premiums, which makes them a potentially important governance mechanism. Appraisals yield sizable excess returns to the petitioners, with an average annualized return of 32.9 percent, which suggests that appraisals also act as a litigation arbitrage.

International commercial arbitration is a system of private commercial law that enables firms to more effectively enforce contracts by allowing them to avoid inefficiencies that arise from domestic courts. As a result, access to international arbitration should foster FDI. To explain the effect of international arbitration on FDI, this paper develops a model to explain the use and effect of resolving international disputes through arbitration. The predictions of the model are tested empirically in a gravity framework. The results of this analysis suggest that access to arbitration leads to an increase in FDI flows. This increase largely occurs through a change in the volume of investment, with a much smaller effect on the number of investment projects. The effect of arbitration is greater for countries with weaker institutions and for larger projects.","[Myburgh, Andrew] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Paniagua, Jordi] Catholic Univ Valencia San Vicente Martir, Valencia, Spain",The World Bank; Universidad Catolica de Valencia San Vicente Martir,"Myburgh, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,"Paniagua, Jordi/H-6353-2015","Paniagua, Jordi/0000-0002-8859-0775",Spain's Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2015-68057-R]; International Finance Corporation (World Bank Group),Spain's Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; International Finance Corporation (World Bank Group),"The authors are indebted to Pol Antras, Beata Javorcik, Michael McIlwrath, Kai-Uwe Karl, Gaurev Bagwe, and Nina Mocheva for their valuable input on the paper.

Usually, this ability is estimated using a sample-splitting scheme, true out-of-sample data being rarely available. We argue that this method makes poor use of the available data and creates data-mining possibilities. Instead, we introduce an alternative .632 bootstrap approach. This method enables building in-sample and out-of-sample bootstrap datasets that do not overlap but exhibit the same time dependencies. We show in a simulation study that this technique drastically reduces the mean squared error of the estimated predictive ability. We illustrate our methodology on IBM, MSFT and DJIA stock prices, where we compare 11 trading rules specifications. For the considered datasets, two different filter rule specifications have the highest out-of-sample mean excess returns. However, all tested rules cannot beat a simple buy-and-hold strategy when trading at a daily frequency.

Yet existing literature tends to depict the 'financialization' of urban infrastructure assets as a restless move towards market efficiency aided by the growing transparency of financial information. This article offers a different view, showing how the spatial richness of financial data for infrastructure has progressed towards what we term a more permanent state of 'informational translucency'. We draw on 53 interviews with participants in the market for infrastructure investment to present this more complicated picture of infrastructure finance, thereby elaborating a more granular understanding of how information flows through and shapes financial market geography. From this we propose a relational model that contributes to theoretical understandings of how financial products are intermediated over time and space.","[Knight, Eric R.

We present a structural comparison of the examined ports and current results from workshop-based focus group studies conducted in order to elaborate current sustainability challenges and practices in seven major LAC ports. In this way, we obtain insights into specific challenges of LAC ports on the way to more sustainable processes. We structure these insights with respect to the dimensions of sustainability in a staged conceptual reference model for sustainable ports in LAC. The developed model considers the development process of LAC ports and can function as a guideline for researchers and practitioners working in the field of sustainable port logistics and development in the region.","[Schulte, Frederik; Voss, Stefan] Univ Hamburg, Inst Informat Syst, Hamburg, Germany; [Gonzalez-Ramirez, Rosa G.] Univ Los Andes, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, Santiago, Chile; [Ascencio, Luis M.] Latin Amer & Caribbean Econ Syst SELA, Caracas, Venezuela",University of Hamburg; Universidad de los Andes - Chile,"González-Ramírez, RG (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Aplicadas, Santiago, Chile.",rgonzalez@uandes.cl,"Voß, Stefan/K-6655-2019","Voß, Stefan/0000-0003-1296-4221; Gonzalez-Ramirez, Rosa G./0000-0001-8029-5432; Ascencio, Luis M./0000-0001-5850-1631",Latin American and Caribbean Economic System (SELA); CAF-development bank of Latin America,Latin American and Caribbean Economic System (SELA); CAF-development bank of Latin America,The authors are grateful to the Latin American and Caribbean Economic System (SELA) and the CAF-development bank of Latin America for the support to carry-out the first phase of the Program Latin American and Caribbean Network of Digital and Collaborative Ports (NDCP).

Going beyond the papers that study forecast errors based on the model of Nordhaus (1987), we use a time-varying procedure to forecast revisions and to account for the possibility that the duration of the state may also affect the bias. Three testable hypotheses are presented to help researchers test the optimality of forecasts, with the ultimate aim of determining whether these biases depend on the underlying economic state and whether they are persistent for the duration of the state. Corresponding bias corrected forecasts can then be made based on these results. The empirical study finds that the one-quarter-ahead official forecast of GDP growth in Taiwan does indeed suffer from state-dependent biases: a persistent under-estimation bias in the relatively good state, and an under-reaction bias that decays with duration in the relatively bad one. Eliminating these biases in the forecast can remove over 44.0% of the variation in forecast errors, and pseudo out-of-sample experiments further support the fact that the resulting bias corrected forecasts are markedly better than those made by Taiwan's government or using other competing models.

Annual data from 1970 to 2013 are employed to estimate a demand system for solid fuels, oil, gas and electricity with the models incorporating quadratic and demographic terms to estimate long-run price and expenditure elasticities. This is the first attempt in an Irish context to estimate an energy demand system for the residential sector. Error correction models were also estimated to recover short-run elasticities. Against the backdrop of onerous climate and energy efficiency policy targets, and given the residential sector's substantial energy use, it is important to update energy demand elasticity estimates to better inform policy instrument design.","[Curtis, John; Stanley, Brian] Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq, Dublin 2, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Curtis, J (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq, Dublin 2, Ireland.",john.curtis@esri.ie,"Curtis, John/Q-8539-2018","Curtis, John/0000-0002-6957-5684",ESRI's Energy Policy Research Centre,ESRI's Energy Policy Research Centre,"Funding from the ESRI's Energy Policy Research Centre is gratefully acknowledged.

While under common law appellate judges' biases offset one another at the cost of volatility of the law, under civil law the legislator chooses a certain legal rule that is biased only when he favors special interests, i.e., when preferences are sufficiently heterogeneous and/or the political process is sufficiently inefficient. Hence, common law can be selected only under this last scenario.

We also show that a grant of protection of depends on just seven statistically significant applicant characteristics or process factors suggesting the determining officer's assessment of the credibility of an asylum claim is nuanced. Taken with the fact that the UNHCR provides oversight of the IP determination procedure we take the view that the procedure is reasonably fair.

The paper models the FAIR highway operations considering the heterogeneity of commuters and lane-by-lane variations. A bilevel programming framework is established to concurrently model the FAIR operator's pricing strategies (at the upper level) and commuters' mode and lane choices (at the lower level). Various operation policy scenarios are designed and tested to evaluate the FAIR highway performance on an experimental highway corridor. A series of sensitivity analyses are conducted with respect to the key conditional factors such as travel demand levels and lane-by-lane variations. Numerical results show that compared to the do-nothing case the FAIR scheme can significantly alleviate the traffic congestion and promote the use of high-occupancy vehicles. The FAIR highway, however, has two potential disadvantages: (i) the toll level is increased when subsidizing the low-income commuters and (ii) the divergence of lane utilization is aggravated on the FAIR highways compared to the do-nothing case. The study provides insights for the decision-makers and practitioners on the potential outcomes of a FAIR highway application. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, if the capability approach is employed to guide egalitarian public policy, capabilities are the appropriate goal of just distributive policies, not just components of individual well-being. When understood as a policy-guide, I argue that the capability approach's focus on 'athletic' individual freedom and control is justified: in the public domain, it is important not just that individuals receive benefits, but that they participate in their achievement.","[Begon, Jessica] Univ Sheffield, Dept Philosophy, Victoria St, Sheffield S3 7QB, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Begon, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Philosophy, Victoria St, Sheffield S3 7QB, S Yorkshire, England.",j.begon@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,2,2,1,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

The demographic shift towards older people, declining car accessibility for the younger generation and public concerns about environmental issues are some reasons of change in trip behavior and mobility demand structure as well as increase in potential mobility disadvantage groups in Germany. This paper explores the horizontal and vertical mobility equity statuses of various districts and socio-economic groups in the city of Aachen considering different trip modes. A set of statistical measures including the Gini index were utilized in a horizontal equity analysis, and the role of urban texture in mobility equity analysis is highlighted. Despite an overall fair distribution of mobility between the inhabitants of different districts, the vertical equity analysis shows a significant variation between different socio-economic groups and different transportation modes. This study also suggests some strategies to improve mobility equity based on the results of the analyses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The efficient train is a train with a particular length, which results in the efficient use of a train path. The ARTC uses train paths to allocate access to the rail infrastructure. We discuss the motivation for and the goals of the proposed policy. As the new policy does not allow for differences in the equipment and track section, we argue that it may distort decisions about the net to gross tonne ratio, and it may not give the right incentives for future investment.

This study deviates from prior studies which have focused on small-scale farmers and subjected farmers' access to finance to rural credit markets, mostly informal money lenders using secondary information mostly from household surveys to build econometric models. The study indicates that only about 33 percent of formal financial institutions are providing finance to agricultural SMEs. The lack of expertise and perception of risk were cited as top reasons why formal financial institutions find it hard to provide finance to agricultural SMEs.

To sum up, the conclusion of the up to date literature is an idea that customer satisfaction leads to customer loyalty and loyalty leads to willingness to purchase additional products. However, there are practically no papers quantifying the influence of loyalty on additional products purchases. The aim of this paper is to create a model among customer satisfaction, loyalty and financial performance of commercial banks in the Czech Republic. It is based on our original research realized as a survey with a total of 459 respondents that have been reached. The created model has proven that product quality, recognition of customers' financial needs and acceptance of prices by a customer have an impact on customer satisfaction, which then influences customer loyalty and this in return influences additional purchases potential of a customer. The regression model of relation between customer satisfaction and loyalty of bank customer has this form: CL = 0.01163 + 0.9191 x CS, where: CL customer loyalty, CS customer satisfaction. The regression model of relation between customer loyalty and additional purchases: APP = -0.05667 + 0.5848 x CL, where: APP additional purchases potential, CL customer loyalty. At the end, the paper is dedicated to a model example showing that if a commercial bank is able to increase the number of satisfied customers by 10,000, it can obtain additional yearly income of EUR 9.6 million.","[Belas, Jaroslav; Gabcova, Lenka] Thomas Bata Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Enterprise Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Belás, J; Gabcová, L (通讯作者)，Thomas Bata Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Enterprise Econ, Zlin, Czech Republic.",belas111@gmail.com; l.gabcova@gmail.com,"Belas, Jaroslav/AGS-6813-2022","Belas, Jaroslav/0000-0002-5900-997X",Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU: Optimization of parameters of the financial performance of the commercial bank [005/IGA/FaME/2014],Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU: Optimization of parameters of the financial performance of the commercial bank,"Authors are thankful to the Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU No. 005/IGA/FaME/2014: Optimization of parameters of the financial performance of the commercial bank, for financial support to carry out this research.",,42,38,55,9,63,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Basically, a linear growth regression model with individual and time fixed effects is estimated, where overall local expenses and their structural (economic and functional) components are considered as explanatory variables. The main finding of this article is that local expenses have no positive effect on the territorial economic growth (the result is, to various degrees, confirmed for all expenditures, more for the interest and social security and less for the capital or transportation ones), mainly due to their poor management and the lack of a result-orientated vision.

However, in spite of considerable international press, there is still little evidence to substantiate this claim. This study proposes a method through which the cost-effectiveness of EbA strategies can be evaluated against alternative adaptation options, and contributes to South African literature on the subject. The potential cost-effectiveness of wetland restoration is assessed as a means of securing the carrying capacity of land for pastoralist communities of the Kamiesberg communal area in South Africa under projected future climate conditions. The conventional alternatives would be to respond to increasingly dry conditions by drilling boreholes and using supplemental feed for livestock. It was assumed that the EbA interventions would occur upfront, whereas the alternatives are more likely to be implemented in reaction to droughts over a longer time period. The study found the implementation of conventional alternatives to be more cost-effective than EbA as a means to sustaining livestock stocking rates, with EbA being twice as costly. However, this is framed from the perspective of those directly affected (the landowners), and does not include the benefits to broader society.","[Black, David; Turpie, Jane K.] Univ Cape Town, Environm Econ Policy Res Unit EPRU, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Rao, Nalini] Conservat Int, Arlington, VA 22202 USA",University of Cape Town; Conservation International,"Black, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Environm Econ Policy Res Unit EPRU, Rondebosch, South Africa.",,,"Turpie, Jane/0000-0003-1220-6295",,,,,34,4,5,3,16,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

If the economy is well consolidated, it shall be able to provide a good absorption of the labour force, so that it would not cause a strong tendency towards migration. The precariousness of the labour market generates the increase of the informal economy and also causes its infiltration into the formal field. Within this work, I have identified different forms of informalization of the labour force market, and I have analysed the motivations and effects of resorting to the international mobility in order to achieve employment at a higher salary level. Equally diverse as the official economy, the sphere of the informal activities, which is missing from the statistical records, avoiding the control of the public power, exists to a larger or smaller extent in all the countries of the worlds, enjoying a perennial existence. The underground economy exists where there are also market restrictions. The underground economy must not be understood as a deviation from economy in its whole but as a component of it, as the activities omitted by the control of the governmental regulations are considered underground. The underground economy is a feedback of the economic system to the governmental, institutional - juridical management act. The more extensive the underground economy, the more profound the governing deficiencies. An effective management shall know how to take note to their own true extent, of the signals highlighting the presence of the underground economy. Based on them the government shall intelligently react, eventually causing its restriction to a limit under which (like other macroeconomic variables, such as inflation rate or unemployment rate) one can consider that it does not exist, i.e. can be controlled.","[Cojocaru (Borovina), Cristina] Univ Econ Studies, Fac Theoret & Appl Econ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Cojocaru, C (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Studies, Fac Theoret & Appl Econ, Bucharest, Romania.",C_borovina@hotmail.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,188.0,198,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254500020,0

The analyzed time span includes the periods of both the socialist and market based economy. Based on a detailed review of previous empirical studies it is possible to conclude that this issue has not been systematically explored and analyzed using Croatia as an example. In our analysis, we use a multivariate model (a conventional multifactor neoclassical aggregate production function) of real GDP and electricity generation together with capital stock, employment and technological progress. In order to get robust results this paper applies the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) cointegration procedure with a time break as an appropriate quantitative method when analyzing small samples. The empirical results provide clear support of a unidirectional causality that runs from electricity generation to real GDP in both short- and long-term. Electricity generation has a positive and statistically significant impact on Croatian real GDP. This means that stable, adequate and uninterrupted electricity supply is one of the crucial determinants of Croatia's economic growth. Croatia should adopt a more vigorous economic policy that should aim to increase investments in the electricity infrastructure.","[Jakovac, Pavle; Lenz, Nela Vlahinic; Zikovic, Sasa] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Jakovac, P (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia.",pjakovac@efri.hr; nela@efri.hr; szikovic@efri.hr,"Lenz, Nela Vlahinić/P-9560-2018; Jakovac, Pavle/P-1936-2018; Žiković, Saša/P-9458-2018","Lenz, Nela Vlahinić/0000-0002-2317-0446;",,,,,66,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27573-4; 978-3-319-27572-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-2,,,,,,209.0,230,,10.1007/978-3-319-27573-4_14,0.0,,,22,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429800014,0

The article derives from the assumption that if business ethics is incorporated in CSR, it might have positive impact on the quality of leadership and managerial decision-making process. In this article, the authors discuss CSR in Slovak business environment and its link to ethical leadership. Using the Ethical Leadership Scale (ELS) (Brown et al. 2005), perceived ethical leadership was measured on the sample of 790 Slovak managers, and the differences related to engagement in CSR were examined.

According to conventional wisdom, the economic efficiency of agricultural enterprises is a function of the use of owned balance sheet and non-balance sheet resources, which are referred to as intellectual capital. One of the measures describing the effects of the use of these resources is the Value-Added Intellectual Coefficient (VAIC (TM)) developed by Pulic. Similarly to profitability indicators used in financial analysis, it is based on companies' source data (balance sheet and income statement). This enables the study of the relationship between VAIC and its derivatives and corporate profitability measured with the indicators of the Return On Assets (ROA) and Return On Equity (ROE). The paper makes reference to a wide range of publications on the efficiency of use of intellectual capital and its impact on the financial results in non-agricultural sectors and it presents the results of a study on a group of Polish agricultural enterprises. The results confirmed a correlation between the VAIC (TM) and profitability indicators, pointing to the growing importance of intellectual capital in agricultural enterprises, which justifies further research. The research shows that intellectual capital is important to generate value added and results in enterprises. So far researchers of the agricultural sector have been disregarding this issue. The study proves the thesis that financial results are strongly related to the efficient use of non-balance sheet resources of intellectual capital.","[Kozera, Magdalena] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Kozera, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Poznan, Poland.",mkozera@up.poznan.pl,"Kozera-Kowalska, Magdalena/U-8914-2018","Kozera-Kowalska, Magdalena/0000-0002-9245-0548",,,,,42,3,3,1,16,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-21139-8; 978-3-319-21138-1,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,123.0,136,,10.1007/978-3-319-21139-8_8,0.0,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE5QC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373209100008,0

Consequently, the aggressive spread of invasive alien plants (IAPs) in the river catchments of South Africa is a major threat to, inter alia, water security. The Olifants River catchment is one such a catchment that is under pressure because of the high demand for water from mainly industrial sources and unsustainable land-use, which includes IAPs. This study considered the cost-effectiveness of clearing IAPs and compared these with the cost of a recently constructed dam. The methods used for data collection were semi-structured interviews, site observation, desktop data analysis, and a literature review to assess the impact of IAPs on the catchment's water supply. The outcomes of this study indicate that clearing invasive alien plants is a cost-effective intervention with a Unit Reference Value (URV) of R1.44/m(3), which compares very favourably with that of the De Hoop dam, the URV for which is R2.93/m(3). These results suggest that clearing invasive alien plants is a cost-effective way of catchment management, as the opportunity cost of not doing so (forfeiting water to the value of R2.93/m(3)) is higher than that of protecting the investment in the dam.","[Morokong, Tshepo; Nkambule, Nonophile Promise; Mudhavanhu, Shepherd; Vundla, Thulile] ASSET Res, Pretoria, South Africa; [Blignaut, James] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa; [Blignaut, James] South African Environm Observat Network, Pretoria, South Africa; [Nkambule, Nonophile Promise] Univ Swaziland, Dept Agr Econ & Management, Kwaluseni, Swaziland; [Mudhavanhu, Shepherd] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Agr Econ, Stellenbosch, South Africa",University of Pretoria; National Research Foundation - South Africa; South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON); Stellenbosch University,"Morokong, T (通讯作者)，ASSET Res, Pretoria, South Africa.",morokons.t@gmail.com,"Blignaut, James N/U-1755-2017","Morokong, Tshepo/0000-0003-4559-6103; Blignaut, James/0000-0001-7059-9010",Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA: Natural Resource Management); South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON),Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA: Natural Resource Management); South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON)(National Research Foundation - South Africa),"The authors would like to acknowledge the following organisations for their support and valuable input: the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA: Natural Resource Management), and the South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON).",,35,13,14,0,6,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Nevertheless, there are situations where standard methodology UML does not offer appropriate solutions. This mainly concerns the situation where the UML is not used directly in the context of software development, but in the modeling process. This UML was not originally intended for this purpose, but that is a fact, that nowadays it is relatively widely used for it. One such situation is the modeling of parallel activities where the UML notation does not allow effectively to model more complex situations in which it is necessary to precisely specify the logical connection between the individual parallel streams.

The aim is to identify the major problems of the methodology used and describe how they have (or could have) an impact on the comprehensibility of the existing process model.

Findings show that there is a need for customer complaints to be handled by competent and service-minded staff. Issues such as lack of courtesy and professionalism characterize the retail sector in Uganda. Concluded that complaints should be handled quickly, and feedback on complaint handling process should be encouraged by management in order to use the feedback as starting point for improving future complaint management. A major managerial implication is that organizations should pay attention to failure attribution, and that providing detailed explanation may be an effective organizational response that will have an impact on behavioural aspects of brand loyalty.","[Osarenkhoe, Aihie] Univ Gavle, Dept Business & Econ Studies, Gavle, Sweden",University of Gavle,"Osarenkhoe, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gavle, Dept Business & Econ Studies, Gavle, Sweden.",aoh@hig.se,,"Osarenkhoe, Aihie/0000-0003-0477-855X",,,,,63,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,3615.0,3626,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700365,0

The participation tax rate (PTR) is used as the indicator of the incentive to work. Using the European Union tax-benefit microsimulation model (EUROMOD) and the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey microdata, PTRs are computed in two different ways. At first, PTRs are computed only for those in work, while another way of the calculation takes into consideration both employed and unemployed. Heckman two stage estimation method is used to predict the hypothetical wage rates for those actually not working on the basis of the observed workers' wage rates. The results suggest that implemented reforms slightly reduces PTRs for low-income earners, nonetheless high PTRs in the lowest deciles suggests a particularly strong disincentive for low-income persons to participate in the labour market.

In this purpose,,, the empirical data provided by the National Institute of Statistics for the period 2000-2015 were used to calculate the statistical parameters, correlation, regression as well as the elasticity coefficients. The Pearson correlation coefficient was r=0.848, reflecting that honey price at beekeepers' gate is positively and strongly correlated with honey production. The determined price-production regression model is Y = 0.432624113 - 1,317.253546 X, and Fisher's test proved its validity. In the two variants, V1 and V2, the price elasticity coefficients varied from a year to another, being higher when the year 2000 was considered term of reference. In case of V1, honey had a more elastic price than an inelastic one, while in case of V2, honey had a more inelastic than an elastic one. Price-production regression is helps to better identify the relationships between these economic indicators. The three scenarios for different growth rates for honey production pointed out that the scenario S2, where production growth rate will be 8 %, the average growth rate recorded in the period 2011-2015, in the year 2020, honey price could reach Lei 13,916/Ton, by 7.04 % more than in 2015. The price volatility could affect beekeeping efficiency, honey production and offer, consumption and trade. But, the positive relationship between honey production and its selling price encourage the beekeepers to keep more bee families and produce more honey.","[Popescu, Agatha] Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med, Bucharest, Romania",University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest,"Popescu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med, Bucharest, Romania.",agatha_popescu@yahoo.com,"Popescu, Agatha/KBB-4359-2024","Popescu, Agatha/0000-0003-2330-7120",,,,,10,9,9,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,935.0,944,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700092,0

Secondly, to examine the international convention; the United Nation Convention on The Law of The Sea (UNCLOS), as a comprehensive tool for world ocean management from a new perspective of environmental ethics. This paper serves to contribute towards the importance of recognizing the actual purpose of all treaties; achieving global peace as the ultimate need for future generations through a philosophical method of accomplishing it.","[Rani, Mohd Haris Abdul] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Malaysia Japan Int Inst Technol, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Rani, MHA (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Malaysia Japan Int Inst Technol, Kuala Lumpur 54100, Malaysia.",harisrani66@gmail.com,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,4,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-5431-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,591.0,599,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393354400096,0

Taylor was mayor of Vancouver more times than anyone, intermittently, and over a long period-1910 to 1934. In spite of his solid on-the-ground accomplishments and proven electoral popularity, journalists today tend to ignore or dismiss him; historians keep alive doubts about his integrity; and, among the general public, his name is almost unknown.

This level of activity has also led to the development of a number of standards that prescribe for and advise organisations on the best way to manage their risks. Every meaningful standard for project management contains project risk management as its important part. The goal of this essay is to present and compare the main standards for project risk management that are currently available today. Four international standards recognized world-wide were selected for comparison: PMI, PRINCE2, IPMA, ISO 31000 and JEC 62198. Chapter 1 introduces the article, basic principles and concepts of risk management. Chapter 2 consists of brief recapitulation of the selected standards in a manner that facilitates their comparison. This is followed by a comparison in chapter 3 including discussion regarding the commonalities among the standards.

In other words, the model of Community Governance, observes the linkages between citizens, governments and measuring performance as configured in a triangle (Foley, Martin, 2000). The literature will also cover the issue of the territorial dimension named the Metropolitan Area (Bryson, 2011) that, by its natural and original configuration as a public policy, is per se conceived as a form of public value that is generated or destroyed (Esposito, Ricci, 2015). Within the territorial configuration of Metropolitan Areas, policies towards the creation of integrated systems, such as culture systems in this circumstance, will be also explored in order to understand if Performance Measurement represents a tool that is useful to visualize tangible and intangible Public Values or if it is, rather, a myth as argued by some authoritative scholars (Mondell, 2004).","[Ricciardelli, Alessandra; Esposito, Paolo] Univ LUM Jean Monnet, Fac Econ, Bari, Italy",Lum Jean Monnet University,"Ricciardelli, A (通讯作者)，Univ LUM Jean Monnet, Fac Econ, Bari, Italy.",ricciardelli@lum.it; esposito@lum.it,,,,,,,92,0,0,1,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,335.0,345,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254500036,0

Furthermore, according to the developed concept a negative impact of work-life conflict and psychological well-being of employees under the supervision of entrepreneurs with negative personality, on business and project failure exists. Most of the studies in this area focused on identifying the positive sides of leaders, limiting the discussion on negative sides of leaders.

The present study reviews the Low-Carbon Green Village Project and the Seoul City Hatbit (Solar) Power Plant Project launched, respectively, in 2008 and 2012. The two case studies share commonalities in that both attempt a transition into a new socio-technical system based on the shared recognition of the valuable 'environment' under the existing catch-up policy mode. These case studies are reviewed as examples of transition to a post catch-up paradigm. This transition is often characterised by sustainability, diversity, and a new development trajectory along with changes in environment and energy policy perspectives, which have been neglected.","[Seong, Jieun; Cho, Yejin; Song, Wichin] Sci & Technol Policy Inst STEPI, 5th Floor,Sejong Natl Res Complex 370, Sicheong Daero 30147, Sejong Si, South Korea","Science & Technology Policy Institute (STEPI), Republic of Korea","Seong, J (通讯作者)，Sci & Technol Policy Inst STEPI, 5th Floor,Sejong Natl Res Complex 370, Sicheong Daero 30147, Sejong Si, South Korea.",jeseong@stepi.re.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea Grant [NRF-2014S1A5B6A02048960],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant(National Research Foundation of Korea),This work was supported by National Research Foundation of Korea Grant [NRF-2014S1A5B6A02048960].,,43,4,4,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

However, the knowledge on this issue is scarce on some retailing sectors, like convenience stores. The present study is focused on convenience stores, with the main purpose of finding out to what extent non-major food retailers successfully adopt a shopper-centric category management. The study is relevant in order to evaluate if a more shopper-centric approach is adequate to smaller companies/stores. To accomplish that goal, an exploratory qualitative study was conducted among convenience store retailers and suppliers. Six semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with Commercial Directors and Trade Marketing Managers. This data was complemented with thirteen interviews with shopper marketing experts. The data was analyzed using thematic content analysis technique, identifying themes, categories, subcategories, units of meaning and relations. The results revealed that convenience store retailers use some of the principles and techniques of the shopper-marketing and shopper-centric category management approaches, which they do in a non-standardized and non-formal approach or process. Their suppliers (the manufacturers) do it in a more formal and structured manner, probably as a result of previous interaction with major supermarkets chains. Both direct and indirect evidences of a shopper-centric approach were found, which, however, were slight, discrete and not formal.

This study is conducted to prove the results of previous studies which show that the number of family firms will decrease when the third generation leads the company. The decrease of family firms is caused by many factors such as family conflict, founder's distrust to successor, successor's unwillingness to continue founder's leading, and different competence in managing company between founder and successor. By assuming that family firms have no problem with the three first factors, many family firms cannot continue the leadership from founder to successor because of two financial factors including profitability and leverage. First, family firms have no enough profitability to sustain. Second, family firms can go bankrupt because of running up huge debt. The population of this study was all three-generation family firms at Indonesia Stock Exchange, whereas the samples were selected based on purposive sampling technique. To analyze panel data, this study collected data from 1982 to 2014. The findings of this study show that the mean value of family firms' profitability led by sibling partnership is the highest. Furthermore, the mean value of leverage increases from founder to cousin consortium, yet the debt growth of family firms led by cousin consortium is the highest.

Availing of a large panel dataset of school fees and other schools' characteristics, the paper employs a differences-in-differences methodology to allow robust and statistically significant findings to be drawn. Evolution of school fees of the group of 50 infringing schools-subject to OFT treatment-is compared with a 'no-intervention' counterfactual scenario, informed by reference to a control group of 178 non-participating schools. The analysis controls for other factors that may influence the determination of fees, most notably the quality of the schools. The analysis finds the OFT intervention leads to a reduction of 1.6 % in the boarding fees of the infringing schools. This equates to savings of approximately A 500 pound per boarder per term, and suggests consumer savings of around A 85m pound may have been realised since intervention. Additional potential effects in spurring wider competitive responses by non-infringing schools are not considered in this analysis, and underline the conservative nature of the findings.","[Pesaresi, Enrico] Commiss European Communities, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; [Flanagan, Conor; Tregear, Paul] Competit & Markets Author, London, England; [Scott, Dominic] Off Gas & Elect Markets, London, England",,"Pesaresi, E (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",enrico_pesaresi@yahoo.it,,,,,,,9,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Informed patients choose the physician whose treatment practice best fits their preferences, aligning physician incentives with patient preferences. An insurer's ability to counter these incentives is not monotonic in how informed patients are, however. When demand is either perfectly inelastic to treatment practices because patients are completely uninformed or a sufficient proportion of the market is informed relative to the number of physicians in the market, then an insurer can induce its preferences through supply-side payment rules. Otherwise, more intensive policy levers such as utilization review must be employed. Programs that increase patient information can therefore improve the efficiency despite generating stronger incentive to treat according to patient preferences. I also explore how noisy signals of illness type and diagnostic testing further complicate the insurer's problem.","Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Pflum, KE (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Box 870224,361 Stadium Dr, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",kpflum@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,40,2,2,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Drawing on 15 focus-group interviews with locally or universally-orientated civic organisation groups in two English counties (Cornwall and Devon) and two Finnish provinces (North Karelia and Southwest Finland), I analyse reflexive, stable and eclectic identifications with regional spaces and provide a typology for understanding archetypal and absorbed regional legacies and differently positioned ways of thinking.

The fixed effect panel model was used as a framework for the analysis. The commonly used models confirmed the presence of the inverse U-shaped relationship. The novel contribution of this paper is that the factor referring to the global financial crisis was tested in expanded EKC model. Higher energy taxes, primary production of nuclear heat and R&D decrease the level of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The size of agriculture, industry and construction, as well as the primary production of solid fuels have a positive sign, which means that a higher value of these indicators is associated with a higher level of GHG. This implies that the analysed set of factors can be applied to adjust the EKC trend in the region and might be useful for the climate change policy adjustment.","[Lapinskiene, Giedre; Peleckis, Kestutis] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Business Management, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Radavicius, Marijus] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Fundamental Sci, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Lapinskiene, G (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Business Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",giedre.lapinskiene@vgtu.lt; kestutis.peleckis@vgtu.lt; marijausr@gmail.com,"Lapinskienė, Giedrė/HNR-0508-2023","Peleckis, Kestutis/0000-0001-9886-2431; Lapinskiene, Giedre/0000-0003-0179-794X",,,,,38,18,18,0,23,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The proposed model is empirically tested using Partial Least Squares with 119 freight operators. The findings reveal the moderating effect of regulations (negative effect) on the positive relationship between collaboration and load/unload interfaces regarding receivers and freight operators.

Natural gas vehicles are designed as charge sustaining hybrid vehicles (HEV) and hydrogen fueled vehicles (FCV) are powered by a fuel cell. All the vehicles have a range of 400 miles between refueling stops. This paper is concerned primarily with the near-term time period in which the fuel cell technology is maturing and the hydrogen infrastructure is being constructed both with respect to refueling stations and the source of the hydrogen being distributed. Detailed computer simulations are presented for vehicle classes from compact cars to mid-size SUVs. Energy (MJ) and volume (L) of fuel storage required to meet the 400 mile range target for each vehicle using natural gas and hydrogen are compared. Costs of the vehicles simulated are projected for 2015-2030. Cost results indicate that the costs of ownership of the natural gas HEVs and the hydrogen fuel cell vehicles become close in the 2025 2030 time period. CO2 emissions from natural gas fueled hybrid and fuel cell vehicles are calculated and compared for hydrogen and electricity from natural gas. Ways in which the introduction of the natural gas fueled vehicles could be a bridge to the mass marketing of fuel cell vehicles are discussed.

As part of this solution, retailers (and other brands) reimagined how GHG emissions should be allocated-shifting from a productionist-based to a consumptionist-based perspective-and redefined what they are responsible for and what their supply chains must care about. The article argues that the complexity involved in engaging tens, hundreds, or even thousands of individual organizations across numerous products' supply chains means that requirements to measure and reduce a product's carbon footprint cannot, and are not, simply pushed down a supply chain. Rather through a confluence of the practices of translation, observation, and normalization retailers are creating, fostering, and articulating new regimes of responsibilization within which actors across successive tiers of a product's supply chains must measure, monitor, and reduce their own carbon footprints independently, conscientiously, and diligently, thereby enabling retailers to achieve carbon reductions at a distance. Seen through the Foucauldian-inspired lens of the technologies of the self and self-government under neo-liberal governance regimes, this article suggests that, through the control of what is in a product's carbon footprint, how this should be measured, and how it should be reduced-what are called here carbon truths-global retailers are working to consolidate their socioeconomic powers as sustainability leaders that fundamentally direct society's response to, and mitigation of, climate change.

Regional innovation is both influenced by heterogeneous regional attributes and the neighbouring innovation factors. Spatial econometrics are developed to explicitly cope with the issues of spatial dependence. This paper aims to reveal the spatial processes of regional innovation at the city scale by including the spatial terms in panel data specification. The research region, Guangdong Province, has developed into one of innovation hubs in China. Panel data set in 21 municipalities in Guangdong Province over the period of 2001-2013 has been established. The spatial panel data model shows that regional innovation in Guangdong is driven by R&D expenditure input. Besides, inflow of external knowledge boosts the innovation output through foreign investment stock and imported goods, and it strengthens its role as innovation impetus for the neighbouring cities with the spatial spillover effect. Meanwhile, the depth and width of knowledge accumulated by specialisation economy and diversification economy contribute to innovation both for the city itself and the neighbouring cities. Overall, the paper has succeeded in revealing the effect of spatial dependence of innovation output, as well as the spilling over' of the innovation factors on distance-based spatial relations.","[Li, Ting] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Planning & Design, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Fu, Wenying] S China Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Zhongshan West Ave 55, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; South China Normal University,"Fu, WY (通讯作者)，S China Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Zhongshan West Ave 55, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",fuwenying@m.scnu.edu.cn,,"Fu, Wenying/0000-0002-5617-4718",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41301109]; Special Prophase Project for National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2014CB460614],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Prophase Project for National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China),This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [41301109]; Special Prophase Project for National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2014CB460614].,,45,7,9,4,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Because they involve vertical and horizontal collaboration, ACOs also have the potential to harm competition. In this paper, we analyze ACO entry and formation patterns with the use of a unique, proprietary database that includes public (Medicare) and private ACOs. We estimate an empirical model that explains county-level ACO entry as a function of: physician, hospital, and insurance market structure; demographics; and other economic and regulatory factors. We find that physician concentration by organization has little effect. In contrast, physician concentration by geographic site-which is a new measure of locational concentration of physicians-discourages ACO entry. Hospital concentration generally has a negative effect. HMO penetration is a strong predictor of ACO entry, while physician-hospital organizations have little effect. Small markets discourage entry, which suggests economies of scale for ACOs. Predictors of public and private ACO entry are different. State regulations of nursing and the corporate practice of medicine have little effect.","[Frech, H.

The method adopted the Cobb-Douglas production function combined with a semi-parametric method to decompose productivity. This study based on the micro-level dataset of iron and steel enterprises in the database of China's industrial enterprises between 1998 and 2007 that investigated the intrinsic correlation among corporate entry and exit, market competition of existing enterprises, and TFP growth in the iron and steel industry. The results of the research show that the entry-exit would promote the growth of the aggregate productivity, while the low efficiency of resource allocation would significantly inhibit the TFP growth. The basic conclusion is that, with substantial government intervention in enterprise investments, market competition may not promote optimal resource allocation efficiency in China's iron and steel industry, but make the allocation less efficient.","[Huang, Jianbai; Liu, Chuan; Li, Xiaoping] Cent S Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China; [Lu, Daguo] Jiangxi Univ Finance Econ, Inst Ind Econ, Nanchang 330013, Peoples R China",Central South University; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Li, XP (通讯作者)，Cent S Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China.",jbhuang@csu.edu.cn; cliu1914@foxmail.com; peterlv1979@126.com; Littlexp@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373283]; National Social Science Foundation of China [13ZD024],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"This project was funded by The National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71373283), and the Key Project of National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 13&ZD024).

First, we find that 48.2% of the deals have jury waiver clauses. Second, we find that deals in which New York is chosen as the governing law and forum state are more likely to include a jury waiver clause. No other state has such an effect. Third, we find that contracts negotiated by counsel from high reputation law firms tend to include jury waiver clauses, and this effect is more significant for the acquirer's law firm than for the target's law firm. Fourth, we find strong evidence for the bargaining power hypothesis wherein larger acquirers that take over smaller targets are more likely to include jury waiver clauses. Finally, we find no evidence that lawyer familiarity, industry effects, whether the acquirer was an international firm, or whether the deal was completed has a statistically significant impact on the likelihood of having a jury waiver clause.","[Palia, Darius] Rutgers Business Sch, Piscataway Township, NJ USA; [Palia, Darius; Scott, Robert E.] Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY 10025 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Columbia University,"Palia, D (通讯作者)，Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY 10025 USA.",rscott@law.columbia.edu,,,Center for Contract and Economic Organization at Columbia University,Center for Contract and Economic Organization at Columbia University,"We thank Albert Choi, Victor Goldberg and especially Max Schanzenbach (the editor), and three anonymous referees for many helpful comments.

We argue that judicial systems that limit policy-making authority also discourage the politicization of courts, encouraging judges to think narrowly about the interests of litigating parties. In contrast, granting a court high policy-making authority-affecting potentially thousands of cases and other branches of government-naturally encourages judges to consider broader ideological principles. Typically, unraveling cause and effect would be difficult, as judicial behavior and institutions are usually stable and endogenous. But an especially stark sequence of political and institutional changes in Brazil affords analytic leverage to explore these questions. A series of judicial reforms greatly expanded the Brazilian Supreme Court's authority, and our analysis of judicial decisions shows the emergence of a political cleavage on the court after these reforms.","[Desposato, Scott W.] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Desposato, Scott W.] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Ingram, Matthew C.] SUNY Albany, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Lannes, Osmar P., Jr.] Camara Deputados, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Lannes, Osmar P., Jr.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of Zurich; University of California System; University of California San Diego; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Desposato, SW (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",,"Ingram, Matthew C/AFP-3675-2022","Ingram, Matthew C/0000-0001-6904-2178",,,,,49,14,19,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

This contribution deals with both the determinants of corruption in the judiciary and the consequences of judicial organization for corruption at large. Regarding the latter, it is shown that the actual independence of the judiciary as well as that of prosecution agencies is correlated with lower levels of corruption. This is also true for a third indicator that measures the degree to which judges are held accountable for their decisions (judicial accountability). Furthermore, independence and accountability function as complements in preventing corruption - judicial accountability without independence appears to be ineffective, whereas judicial or prosecutorial independence alone can even have adverse effects.

As the findings are robust to various tests, they provide consistent evidence for the existence of judicial local protectionism in China. On the other hand, no significant impact of plaintiff location on trial outcome is found in appeals rulings for the IP cases. Instead, the appellate courts are found to redress the local protectionism problem in the first instance rulings in the PSC cases, thus offering support for the argument that the case law developed by the People's Supreme Court aims at providing correctional mechanisms at the higher level to remedy the wrongs perpetrated at the lower level judiciary. The empirical results using the larger five-province sample, however, fail to find the rectifying effect of the appellate courts, suggesting that the goal of the PSC has yet to be achieved in many Chinese regions. These findings provide new insights for the relationship between law and development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The analysis of these patterns allows us to detect the existence of different social or neighbourhood effects, namely, contextual, correlated and peer effects. Our empirical analysis is based on the General Council of the Judiciary database, which provides court level information on the number of cases resolved in favour of the worker by judges between 2004 and 2010. Methodologically, we build different spatial correlation matrices to find local and/or regional patterns. Underlying the current analysis is the notion that judges might be influenced by the decisions taken by their colleagues in neighbouring provincial or even regional courts. Our results point to the absence of contextual effects, some significance of correlated effects (likely caused by the existence of a High Court in each region that acts as the highest authority before which appeals may be filed) and strong evidence of peer effects.

A consequence of this has been a shift from the traditional focus on individual service strategies to a focus on bundle strategies. Building on bundle value is gradually becoming a key ingredient for the long-term viability of services as it fosters better allocation of resources and investment choices. This entails the assessment of the value that customers assign to bundles and the alignment of business models to match this value. To address this issue, this paper investigates the conditions under which a low share transportation service, bundled together with a ferry service and a tie-in recreational package, can compete with a faster transportation connection. By merging the conceptually rich business model research with the more rigorous bundling literature, the current paper proposes a mixed service bundling strategy as an effective way to increase market share and create customer value over time. This bundling strategy is applied in the case of an illustrative example of the connection between Patras, Kalamata and Crete and the results are reported. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The case of China and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (REP and Neighbourhood, respectively) is used to demonstrate the usefulness of NeSI framework and its possible application to other similar cases.

Theoretically, this argument responds to calls for firm finances to be more fully incorporated into understandings of wider economic geographies and, in particular, addresses the neglect of finance in extant understandings of the internationalization of TNCs.

We set up a novel five-treatment design and compare situations where a wrongdoer acts under: (1) no third-party punishment; (2) nonaccountable third-party punishment; and (3) accountable third-party punishment. We show that when citizens are active and make their voice heard, public officials sanction wrongdoing significantly more. Our experimental finding complements previous empirical work based on field data and suggests that when third-party institutions are held accountable, their propensity to fight misconduct is higher, other things equal. We view this result as good news with regard to domains where it implies that pro-consumer policies will be more likely (e.g., regulatory policies).

We begin by providing a comprehensive survey of the forecasting algorithms and explanatory variables used in the motion picture domain. Because of the importance of forecasting in early periods, we develop three sequential forecasting models for predicting the non-cumulative and cumulative box office earnings: (1) prior to, (2) a week after, and (3) two weeks after release. The numbers of SNS mentions and their weekly trends are used as input variables in addition to the screening-related information. A genetic algorithm is adopted for determining significant input variables, whereas three machine learning-based nonlinear regression algorithms and their combinations are employed for building forecasting models. Experimental results show that the utilization of SNS data, machine learning-based algorithms and their combination made noticeable improvements to the forecasting accuracies of all the three models.

We develop a multivariate forecast model whose continuous forecasts are used as test statistics in decision rules to make binary (yes/no) forecasts for large changes in time series data. The model is fit based upon a penalty function that maximizes the partial area under the ROC curve (PAUC) along a relevant range of false positive rates, and can be used by managers who wish to take action on the small percentage of products whose demand is likely to change the most in the next time period. We apply the model to a crime dataset and compare the results to OLS, as a basis for comparisons, as well as to models that have shown themselves to be promising for large-change demand forecasting, including logistic regression, quantile regression, synthetic data from a Bayesian model, and a power loss model. Using the PAUC metric, our proposed forecasting model's out-of-sample performance shows statistical significance, a 35% improvement over OLS, and at least a 20% improvement over other competing methods. We suggest that managers with large numbers of time series (e.g., for product demand) should use our method to forecast large changes preemptively, in conjunction with magnitude-based methods for forecasting the expected demand.

Both accumulation and assimilation processes of ERL are examined in detail to elucidate the dynamic process of the multilateral model' of a HSR system. The approaches have led ERL to witness convergence innovation between Siemens's technology and ERL's knowledge in operating systems. The convergence innovation between the two processes has enabled ERL to venture into engineering consulting services, exporting innovative operating solutions to other firms abroad. The strategic approaches discussed in this paper may thus provide policy lessons for other firms in developing countries aspiring to emulate the upgrading process of rail technology.","[Mohamed, Mazmiha; Fung, Hon-Ngen; Wong, Chan-Yuan] Univ Malaya, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, Fac Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Wong, CY (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, Fac Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",wongcy111@gmail.com,"WONG, CHAN YUAN/C-1044-2010; Fung, Hon-Ngen/AAI-1909-2020","Fung, Hon-Ngen/0000-0001-9391-2807",Equitable Society Research Cluster of University Malaya [FL025-2012],Equitable Society Research Cluster of University Malaya,The authors are grateful for the research support [FL025-2012] of the Equitable Society Research Cluster of University Malaya.,,40,5,5,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

We use a sample of SMEs located in the interior region of Portugal, using the LSDVC dynamic estimator as method of estimation, the empirical evidence obtained allows us to conclude that the most profitable and oldest SMEs resort less to debt, which corroborates the forecasts of Pecking Order Theory. SMEs, with greater size, resort more to debt, corroborating the forecasts of Trade-Off Theory and Pecking Order Theory. In addition, SMEs adjust noticeably their current level of debt towards the optimal debt ratio, which corroborates what is forecast by Trade-Off Theory. Therefore, this paper enhances that Trade-Off and Pecking Order Theories are not mutually exclusive in explaining the capital structure decisions of SMEs. The results suggest that younger and smaller SMEs should be object of public financing support, when the internal financing is clearly insufficient to fund those firms' activities.","[Serrasqueiro, Zelia; Caetano, Ana] Univ Beira Interior, Fac Social & Human Sci, Dept Management & Econ, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal; [Serrasqueiro, Zelia; Caetano, Ana] Univ Evora, CEFAGE Res Ctr, P-7000809 Evora, Portugal",Universidade da Beira Interior; University of Evora,"Serrasqueiro, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Beira Interior, Fac Social & Human Sci, Dept Management & Econ, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal.",zelia@ubi.pt; anacaetano19@gmail.com,"Serrasqueiro, Zélia/J-5662-2014","Serrasqueiro, Zélia/0000-0003-1761-5426",,,,,63,63,107,4,83,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

It shows that U.S. corporations' rate of return on fixed asset investment fell throughout the half-century preceding the recession, and that this fall accounts for the entire decline in their rate of capital accumulation (productive investment). The investment slowdown led to a decline in the rate of economic growth, which was a main cause of rising debt burdens, as were stimulative fiscal and monetary policies that delayed but exacerbated the effects of the underlying economic problems. The article also refutes the claim that the rate of profit could not really have fallen because massive redistribution of income from wages to profits took place, and it argues that it is unlikely that major crises of capitalism can be eliminated.","Pace Univ, New York, NY 10038 USA",Pace University,"Kliman, A (通讯作者)，Pace Univ, New York, NY 10038 USA.",akliman@pace.edu,,,,,,,46,10,14,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

By combining structural and time series elements we hope to reap the benefits of both approaches, namely the relatively better forecasting performance of time series models in the short run and a theory-consistent economic interpretation of the forecast coming from the structural model. In our model we consider the hybrid version of the NKPC and use an open-economy measure of marginal cost. The results suggest that our semi-structural model performs better than a random-walk forecast and most of the competing models (conventional time series models and strictly structural models) only in the short run (one quarter ahead) but it is outperformed by some of the competing models at medium and long forecast horizons (four and eight quarters ahead).

In particular, the order-m approach, which is based on the concept of expected minimum input function and quantile regression, for the analysis of the factors determinants of efficiency is used. On the other hand, the results obtained applying the methods mentioned in the Spanish retail sector can contribute to opening up a new field of analysis since the results may be compared by means of the methodologies proposed as well as those which already exist in the literature. The paper used data envelopment analysis stochastic (order-m) to measure efficiency and quantile regression analysis for the second stage in Spanish retail. For the second stage of analysis relative of the factors determinants of efficiency, we use quantile regression. We take account of heterogeneity between the different characteristics of firms, using quantile regression techniques. We find that firm size, age and market concentration are positively related to the efficiency along the quantiles considered in the analysis. The relationship between intensity of capital and better trained employees in the efficiency shows a curvilinear behavior. Also, there are significant differences by region to which the firm belongs. The main contribution of this paper is to provide an efficiency analysis for Spanish retail sector using a non parametric approach with a robust estimator and quantile regression analysis for second stage. This methodology allows for a more careful analysis of what happens at firm level.","[De Jorge Moreno, Justo] Univ Alcala, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales & Turismo, Madrid 28802, Spain; [Rojas Carrasco, Oscar] Univ Talca, Escuela Auditoria & Ingn Control Gest, Talca, Chile",Universidad de Alcala; Universidad de Talca,"Moreno, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales & Turismo, Plaza Victoria 2, Madrid 28802, Spain.",justo.dejorge@uah.es; osrojas@utalca.cl,"Rojas Carrasco, Oscar Alfredo/F-2954-2018; De Jorge-Moreno, Justo/O-9546-2018","Rojas Carrasco, Oscar Alfredo/0000-0002-6739-5559; De Jorge-Moreno, Justo/0000-0002-8326-3046",,,,,45,4,4,0,19,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The results conveyed that the productivity of six diseases, among 12 highly efficient diseases, was increased while the productivity of the remaining six diseases was decreased. On the other hand, the productivity of six diseases was increased, among nine low-efficient diseases, even though the relative efficiency was low.

One of the principles of regional redistribution are the municipal budgets. The budgets of municipalities are determined by the tax revenue, non-tax revenue. capital revenue and subsidies.

The estimation of technical efficiency was conducted using the data envelopment analysis (DEA), per total and separately for each size classes selected (based on UAA). The main findings indicate that with actual inputs a European farm can produce 37.9% more outputs and they could increase their relative efficiency by 10.7%. Moreover, from 128 farms only 34 farms (25.6%) are efficient (CRS) and the majority of farms have an increasing return to scale which means that they obtain more outputs by increasing inputs. On the other hand, contrary to the relatively common opinion that bigger size promotes higher efficiency, it was found that the very large farms from European regions are characterized by low pure technical efficiency and the farms with 10-20 ha and 50-100 ha have higher scale efficiency and technical efficiency.","[Dona, Ion; Toma, Elena; Dobre, Carina] Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, Bucharest 011464, Romania; [Vlad, Mihaela Cristina] Inst Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Bucharest 011464, Romania",University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest,"Dona, I (通讯作者)，Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, 59 Marasti Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest 011464, Romania.",ion_dona@yahoo.com; elenatoma2001@yahoo.com; dobrecarina@yahoo.com; cristinamiha@yahoo.com,"Dobre, Carina Andreea/HZJ-3666-2023; TOMA, ELENA/B-1263-2012","Dobre, Carina Andreea/0009-0004-6194-6913; TOMA, ELENA/0000-0002-5716-9486",,,,,16,0,0,0,8,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,657.0,667,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700067,0

The main problems were found at the level of making calculations, including the animal (to the accounts of fixed assets or inventory), valuation pups or measurement of crop production. This leads to different values in the financial statements of the entities that do not provide a sufficiently fair view of the accounting, and are incomparable both between companies and in time.

While both countries make extensive use of the payback model, they fully defend the view that this model influences a short-term mentality. The Czech Republic, more so than the UK, also support the view that the payback is unsuitable for appraising information communication technology projects, yet they still use it to appraise such projects. The Czech Republic places less importance on the discounted cash flow models than the UK, with the Czech Republic preferring the 'net present value' to the 'internal rate of return'. The UK, by using an 'opportunity cost of capital' approach in the determination of the 'discount rate', may be making it harder to achieve a positive net present value than the Czech Republic, who adopt an approach which is nearer to the true cost of capital. This exploratory study will aid both practitioners and academics in a greater understanding of the appraisal of capital assets and focus future research in a positive way.","[Hynek, Josef] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Informat & Quantitat Methods, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; [Janecek, Vaclav; Lefley, Frank] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Econ, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove; University of Hradec Kralove,"Hynek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Informat & Quantitat Methods, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",josef.hynek@uhk.cz; vaclav.janecek@uhk.cz; frank.lefley@uhk.cz,"Hynek, Josef/F-3987-2014; Lefley, Frank/E-4521-2016","Hynek, Josef/0000-0002-8443-0256; Lefley, Frank/0000-0003-4162-6694",,,,,46,2,2,0,6,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The main purpose of the paper is to present the extent and content of businesses' communication about Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in Poland. In particular, the study investigates the CSR actions and issues displayed on 24 companies ' official websites. Methodology. A procedure to seek information about CSR on the web pages was defined. 24 companies (from the Energy and ICT sectors) from The Fortune 100 2014 ranking of businesses in Poland were used as a sample frame. The search was limited to those website areas which referred directly to the responsibilities and commitment of the company either to the society, the environment or the economy. Links to the relevant areas were searched for either on the home page of the company or in a section providing general company information. Results. The results show that the biggest businesses in Poland (Energy and ICT sectors) do not display the same eagerness to appear as socially responsible and employ diverse means to convey social responsibility images. The theoretical contribution. Over the past few years, businesses and academic researchers alike have displayed increased interest for Corporate Social Responsibility. In particular, the recent research suggests that CSR may be an excellent instrument to enhance the legitimacy of the firm among its stakeholders and to develop positive social responsibility images. The value of the paper is in the coding scheme which was developed based on an analysis of 100 companies ' web pages. The coding scheme employed was based on the conceptualization of CSR as three logics -social, economical and environmental. Practical implications. Some studies have started to investigate how businesses use communications to highlight their commitment to CSR (e.g., Esrock & Leichty, 1998; Hooghiemstra, 2000). Against this backdrop, the present study examines how businesses in Poland communicate about CSR on their official web pages. The research findings can be used to show the best practices regarding CSR communication. Paper type: Research paper.

The ultimate goal of the Shariah is to be a blessing for mankind. This is the primary purpose for which the Prophet Muhammad (Saw) was sent to this world.(rahmatan lii a'alamin) There is also a common belief among all societies around the world that the primary purpose of development is to promote human well-being. In this respect, Islam also identifies some of the equally important and generally recognized requirements for sustained well-being as among others; the security of life, property and honor, individual freedom, moral as well as material education, marriage and family management and social solidarity, minimization of corruption, breach of trust, and fraud. It is argued that the spiritual foundation needed for the realization of the above lacks the emphasis that it needs. It is also argued that it may not be possible to promote sustainable development without ensuring adequate satisfaction of all these requirements. In this paper, the objectives of Shariah are addressed as the determining factors, which, if properly understood and translated into practice, would become a tool in realizing the mission towards sustainable development. This study highlights the importance of having a correct understanding of the objectives of the Shariah in land development and land management hence forms as framework in all policies or activities and helped prioritise in decision makings and actions. The method employed in this study is data collection based on primary and secondary sources and analysis of the opinion of the Muslim jurists on maqasid, land, land development and management.","[Mohamad, Nor Asiah] IIUM, Civil Law Dept, Ahmad Ibrahim Kulliyyah Laws, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",International Islamic University Malaysia,"Mohamad, NA (通讯作者)，IIUM, Civil Law Dept, Ahmad Ibrahim Kulliyyah Laws, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",nasiahm@iium.edu.my,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,3621.0,3635,,,,,,15,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700378,0

A comparative method was chosen for cursory investigation of such concepts. It is found that property rights in Islamic and Civil law perspectives are not always the same. Such dissimilarities were interpreted as to either they result in conflict or otherwise. At best there is presumption that a concept not recognized by either of the above legal systems might result in disputes or a ground for disputes between the beneficiaries of an estate. In either case it is concluded that the effectiveness and efficiency of the estate distribution by Land Office, Amanah Raya Berhad or High Court will be affected by such conflict and lack of recognition.","[Mohammad, Tahir Sabit Mohammad] CRES LAD Fac Geoinformat & Real Estate, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Azmi, Fatin Afiqah Binti Md] Univ Teknol Malaysia, LAD Fac Geoinformat & Real Estate, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Mohammad, MTS (通讯作者)，CRES LAD Fac Geoinformat & Real Estate, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",mtahir@utm.my; fafiqah2@live.utm.my,"AZMI, FATIN AFIQAH MD./AAX-1716-2020","MD.

Advertiser uses various techniques to attract consumers and shape consumers attitude and intentions towards product. Today consumers are exposed with different advertising campaigns. It becomes very challenging for advertisers to break through the cutting edge competition. Advertising is a way of communication to convince consumers and move them to next level of buying process. It shapes the attitudes of the society and the individual and inevitably influences customer behavior. Television advertisement is a lucrative option used by advertising companies and brands. They communicate with consumers to influence their decision making process and in turn trying to increase the sustainability of business and brands. 'Emotional' advertising displays the benefits of the product or service through acts or dramas and expect to strike an emotional chord with the consumer. It is very indirect in its persuasion. Referring to the 'Rational' Advertising, it deals with logical and appealing price point and with highlighting the consumer benefits by owning the product. This study shows how emotional and rational advertisement impacts advertising and try to understand the value of emotions in advertising. This paper is intended to give an insight of the influence of emotional advertising and rational advertising on the minds of the Indian consumer. For this research 'Projective techniques with an Experimental study' design was used on a group of 48 students. The aim of study was to find out which advertising appeal affect the consumer. For this study the questionnaire was designed based on 12 various factors, which is taken equally from advertisements with rational and emotional appeals. These attributes were taken from customer based brand equity model (Keller 1993). For this study ten television advertisements were chosen based on CBBE model, where five ads were based on rational appeal and other five were based on emotional appeal. Similarly, all the 12 factors were divided based on 6 rational and 6 emotional characteristics. The respondents marked the most relevant option on 5 point Likert scale. The result shows that majority of the consumers prefer emotional advertising over rational advertising","[Sharma, Pooja; Gupta, Priya; Sreedhar, Abhishek] Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Univ, Amrita Sch Business, Kollam, Karnataka, India",Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham; Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Amritapuri,"Sharma, P (通讯作者)，Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Univ, Amrita Sch Business, Kollam, Karnataka, India.",poojatrips21@gmail.com; priyagupta.amrita@gmail.com; abhi10sreedhar@gmail.com,,"Gupta, Priya/0000-0002-7543-4941",,,,,18,0,0,2,24,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,171.0,183,,,,,,13,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700018,0

These methodological sources represent current best practices and include recommendations addressing various IT management issues encountered in practice. However, their application in practice brings along numerous problems as showed by the results of recent surveys conducted among Czech organizations. Moreover, their use, in particular in small and medium sized enterprises, is still very limited. In this paper we discuss existing IT management approaches and their limitations with a particular focus on Czech organizations. We base our discussion on available literature, our surveys of Czech organizations and our experiences gained from practical assignments. The MBI (Management of Business Informatics) model developed at the Department of Information Technologies, University of Economics in Prague attempts to overcome such limitations of existing methodologies and models. We describe the basic concepts and features of the MBI model. The MBI model represents an original solution that brings along essential advantages over existing business informatics management methodologies. To such advantages primarily belong monitoring links between individual objects and the possibility to utilize these links as search criteria. Furthermore, the model captures an influence of various business informatics factors on the MBI tasks and enables to adjust its context according to these factors. In addition, the MBI model metrics and analytical applications monitor IT investment effectiveness. The MBI model is available as a web application (at website mbi.vse.cz) and the MBI community participates on its further development.","[Vorisek, Jiri; Pour, Jan; Buchalcevova, Alena] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Informat Technol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Vorisek, Jiri] Pan European Univ, Fac Informat, Bratislava, Slovakia",Prague University of Economics & Business; Pan-European University,"Vorísek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Informat Technol, Prague, Czech Republic.",vorisek@vse.cz; jan.pour@vse.cz; alena.buchalcevova@vse.cz,"Buchalcevova, Alena/L-2239-2016","Vorisek, Jiri/0000-0001-9307-2756","GACR (Grant Agency, Czech Republic) [P403/11/0574]; Research Centre for Human Centered Technology Design at the University of Technology, Sydney","GACR (Grant Agency, Czech Republic); Research Centre for Human Centered Technology Design at the University of Technology, Sydney","This research was supported by the GACR (Grant Agency, Czech Republic) grant No. P403/11/0574 and the Research Centre for Human Centered Technology Design at the University of Technology, Sydney.",,28,16,18,0,58,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Several Malay Kingdoms throughout the Golden Chersonese together with Sabah and Sarawak in Borneo formed a new country known as Malaysia which inherited some welfare policies from its former British rule. Since World War II, welfare in United Kingdom and all over Europe has evolved into a high scale state level humanitarian policy. Social welfare has been an idea very much cherished by developed countries especially in Europe such as United Kingdom, Sweden and Norway concerning redistribution of wealth. On the other hand, many countries across Asia are known or depicted as less developed and plagued by poverty. Malaysia does not embrace the welfare state policy but the preservation and continuation of the welfare department which was established during colonial times marked its undisputable stance on the importance of social welfare. Besides having a well-founded welfare depat talent, other welfare measures were channelled through education, health and land development agencies. Interestingly welfare has been a pillar of faith among Malaysian Muslim community. Therefore it is fascinating to discover the redistribution of wealth and welfare in the Malaysian context. In the end, this paper shows that the people of Malaysia developed and practised their own unique measures in welfare and social protection.","[Yaakob, Mohamad Lusfi; Rom, Noor Ashikin Mohd; Hassan, Nurbani Md.] Multimedia Univ, Selangor, Malaysia",Multimedia University,"Yaakob, ML (通讯作者)，Multimedia Univ, Selangor, Malaysia.",lusfiyaakob@gmail.com; ashikin.rom@mmu.edu.my; nurbani72@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,2613.0,2618,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700269,0

During scientific literature analysis we identified 14 e-service quality dimensions forming three scales: 1) a core e-service quality scale, 2) e-service quality recovery scale, and 3) website quality scale. These scales were tested empirically in quantitative research using online survey method. However, the empirical research results do not supported the suggested three scales. The findings show that e-service quality from customers' perspective is a four-dimensional construct, i.e. composed of four dimensions: 1) compensation, 2) responsiveness and fulfillment, 3) website operation, and 4) reliability. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the validity and reliability of the four-dimensional construct. Thus, the instrument is recommended for evaluation of e-service quality.

Chinese monthly data from January 2000 to December 2013 are used. To account for the mixed integrated orders of variables and to control for the potential endogeneity, the bounds testing approach for cointegration is employed within an autoregressive distributed lag framework. The results show that there exists a long-run cointegrating relationship between China's lumber import and some specific explanatory variables. In the long run, the import demand is found to be elastic with respect to the lumber import price and a macroeconomic shifter at the 5% statistical level. Imported lumber seems to be a complement to other input factors, but the effect is not statistically significant. As expected, the short-run price and income elasticities are smaller in absolute terms than their long-run counterparts. The projection indicates China's future lumber imports will probably keep growing, but with a slower annual growth rate than observed in the past.

Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., the US Supreme Court dramatically restricted the scope of the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), holding that the statute does not permit victims of human rights abuses to sue foreign corporations for violations of international law that took place entirely abroad. We draw on three unique characteristics of the decision to estimate its effect on companies' valuations. First, we show that extractive industry firms with headquarters abroad experienced larger cumulative abnormal returns following the ruling. By contrast, similar US-based firms-which generally remain subject to ATS liabilitydid not benefit from the decision. Second, we demonstrate that foreign-based firms benefited both on the final decision date and on the earlier date when the Court slated the case for reargument on the issue of extraterritoriality. Third, we show that this effect varied with the human rights records of host countries: mining firms based abroad with subsidiaries in countries with poor human rights records benefitted most. Although our results cannot resolve debates over the merit of ATS suits, we do show that the Kiobel decision mattered: for foreign firms, it decreased the cost of doing business under regimes with records of human rights violations.","[Christensen, Darin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, Publ Policy, 337 Charles E Young Dr East, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Hausman, David K.] Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 616 Serra St Room 100, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Stanford University,"Christensen, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, Publ Policy, 337 Charles E Young Dr East, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",darinc@luskin.ucla.edu; dhaus-man@stanford.edu,,,,,,,35,3,5,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

In the absence of lobbying, the policymaker (PM) may prioritize more promising issues. Recognizing this, interest groups involved with other issues have a greater incentive to lobby in order to change the issues that the PM learns about and prioritizes. We show how informational lobbying can be detrimental, in the sense that it can lead to less informed PMs and worse policy. This is because informational lobbying can lead to the prioritization of less important issues with active lobbies, and can crowd out information collection by the PM on issues with more likely beneficial reforms. The analysis fully characterizes the set of detrimental lobbying equilibria under two alternative types of issue asymmetry.","[Cotton, Christopher S.] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Dellis, Arnaud] Univ Quebec, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Queens University - Canada; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Cotton, CS (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Kingston, ON, Canada.",cotton@econ.queenau.ca; dellis.arnaud@uqam.ca,,,Queen's University; Jarislowsky Foundation,Queen's University; Jarislowsky Foundation,"Cotton is grateful for funding provided through his position as the Jarislowsky-Deutsch Chair in Economic and Financial Policy at Queen's University, which was funded in part by The Jarislowsky Foundation.

We assess the relative importance of neighbourhood segregation, parental choice and the location of independent schools for school segregation. In particular, we exploit variation in school choice opportunities across municipalities and provide descriptive evidence that in regions where school choice has become more prevalent, school segregation between immigrants and natives, and between children of high/low educated parents, has increased more than in regions where choice is limited. This result also holds when we account for residential segregation and focus on excess segregation over and above the segregation that would occur if all pupils attended their assigned schools. We find that the increase in school segregation 15 years after the reform that can be attributed to choice is relatively small.","[Bohlmark, Anders] Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res, IFAU, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Bohlmark, Anders] Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res, CREAM, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Holmlund, Helena] Inst Evaluat Labour Market & Educ Policy IFAU, Box 513, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Lindahl, Mikael] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, CESifo, IFAU,IZA, POB 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Lindahl, Mikael] Univ Gothenburg, UCLS, POB 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",Stockholm University; Stockholm University; University of Gothenburg; University of Gothenburg,"Holmlund, H (通讯作者)，Inst Evaluat Labour Market & Educ Policy IFAU, Box 513, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",anders.bohlmark@sofi.su.se; helena.holmlund@ifau.uu.se; Mikael.Lindahl@economics.gu.se,"Lindahl, Mikael/GQA-3588-2022",,"Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE) [2013-0645]; Swedish Research Council [D0199201, 2007-2283]; European Research Council (ERC) [241161]; European Research Council (ERC) [241161] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE)(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government)","This study was funded by the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE) (grant number 2013-0645), the Swedish Research Council (grant number D0199201; 2007-2283) and the European Research Council (ERC starting grant number 241161).",,45,64,74,2,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Systemic efficiencies occur in large complex systems through the interaction of multiple distributed components, a process that is commonly coordinated by an entity that can exercise pervasive control over the system's components and their interactions. That type of extensive control can manifest as potentially anticompetitive practices, such as tying, refusing to deal, and full-line forcing, which can provoke the reaction of competition authorities. However, at the same time, systemic efficiencies can have significant benefits that cannot be generated by more isolated efficiencies that are simpler and smaller in scale. Thus, systemic efficiencies are of great interest to society, and of high redeeming value as an antitrust defense mechanism for the introducing entities. This article discusses two cases to demonstrate how systemic efficiencies and their benefits materialize in practice: (1) the recent IBM mainframes cases in the United States and the European Union and (2) the ongoing Google Android cases in the United States and the European Union. Both cases belong in the ICT industry, which is paradigmatic of large complex systems that can give rise to systemic efficiencies.","[Stylianou, Konstantinos] Univ Leeds, Competit Law & Regulat, Sch Law, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Stylianou, K (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Competit Law & Regulat, Sch Law, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",k.stylianou@leeds.ac.uk,,"Stylianou, Konstantinos/0000-0002-7171-8058",,,,,138,1,1,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In this paper, we employ an asymmetric nonlinear ARDL approach to investigate the short- and long-run impacts of fuel price increases and decreases and fuel price volatility on motor-vehicle travel in Korea. Using monthly data from January 2000 to December 2013, the results show that travel responds differently depending on the direction of fuel price changes. In examining the sensitivities of travel demand, the traffic volume is significantly responsive to fuel price changes when prices fall, while it is insensitive to fuel price changes when prices rise in the long-run. The fuel price volatility has a negative long-run impact on travel demand, indicating that a rise in fuel price uncertainty can induce drivers to reduce transport fuel consumption and motor-vehicle travel. The GDP and the road length are also found to be vital factors determining travel demand. In comparing the magnitude of the short- and long-run effects of fuel price changes, the short-run elasticities tend to be smaller than the long-run elasticities in absolute value.

We show that informative signaling in the model can be detected by the presence of a specific mixture over distinct duration processes. Using a new estimator consistent with these predictions, we find that the filibuster has historically conveyed information and that it continues to do so, counter to many claims.

This study analytically formulates CEP delivery behaviors in last-mile networks to estimate the effects of logistics collaboration for apartment complexes. Reflecting courier delivery behavior, the CEP delivery problem was divided into horizontal and vertical routing problems. Optimization methodologies commonly utilized in the operations research area were employed for the analytical modeling of these two routing behaviors. The proposed methodologies were applied to apartment complexes in Seoul, Korea. It was found that the financial feasibility of CEP collaboration is guaranteed when the number of households in an apartment complex exceeds about 900. From the financial perspective, CEP collaboration is applicable to 9.1-19.4% of the apartment households in Seoul. In addition, CEP collaboration was analyzed to provide a meaningful amount of social cost savings, implying its economic feasibility. The public sector's roles in stimulating CEP collaboration are discussed from financial and legislative perspectives. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, previous studies point out the diminishing role and engagement of shareholders in terms of governance, thereby challenging some vital design principles of robust common-pool resource institutions. We assume that major reasons for this is associated with socio-demographic changes meaning a large proportion of shareholders do not live in the area. Therefore this study compares resident and non-resident shareholder participation in and perceptions about their common, as well as assesses their engagement in the management of one major forest common in Northern Sweden. To this end a questionnaire survey was conducted together with regular consultations with the common's board and staff to discuss shareholder participation and other major issues concerning the common. The study shows that the common has a low shareholder engagement and a high proportion of non-resident shareholders. Even though a large proportion of resident shareholders acknowledged benefits from the common, they were also less satisfied with the cooperation among shareholders and less optimistic about the possibilities to influence management decisions. In contrast, the majority of non-resident shareholders saw 'no disadvantages' of the common. Although most of the shareholders regularly visit the common, hardly any partipate in the general meetings. While residency outside the municipality certainly seems to have an impact on the engagement of non-resident shareholders, our study suggests that simple strategies from the board including accessible information and better timing and/or location of meetings might even increase the participation among all shareholders.

Many investment theories have been established and adjusted to maximize profit, yet limited knowledge is available regarding the predictive power of theories. Understanding foresters' harvesting behavior, however, is important for forest management and policy support. Thus, the question arises as to what extent risky harvesting decisions comply with economic theories. Therefore, we conduct an incentive-based economic experiment with 107 forestry decision makers in order to analyze this research question. This approach is well-established in the field of behavioral economics since it has the advantage of analyzing certain economic parameters isolated from further aspects of the decision situation. We use the Faustmann-Pressler-Ohlin theorem and a real options approach as normative benchmarks. The present study provides evidence that none of the examined theories fully comply with the observed behavior. However, the harvesting behavior coincides significantly more with the real options theory than with the Faustmann-Pressler-Ohlin theorem. It can thus be stated that a higher degree of education leads to decisions that are more in accordance with the real options theory.

The main question studied in this paper is whether forest carbon sequestration is worth increasing at the expense of bioenergy and forest products to achieve the EU emissions reduction target for 2050 in a cost-efficient manner. A dynamic cost minimisation model is used to find the optimal combination of carbon abatement strategies to meet annual emissions targets between 2010 and 2050. The results indicate that forest carbon sequestration is a low-cost abatement method. With sequestration, the net present costs of meeting EU carbon targets can be reduced by 23%.

The properties of the forecast combination are typically derived under the assumption that the weights are fixed, while in practice they need to be estimated. If the fact that the weights are random rather than fixed is taken into account during the optimality derivation, then the forecast combination will be biased (even when the original forecasts are unbiased), and its variance will be larger than in the fixed-weight case. In particular, there is no guarantee that the 'optimal' forecast combination will be better than the equal-weight case, or even improve on the original forecasts.

This dichotomy implies that risk-neutral policy-makers may prefer the classical PCR approach, while the BMA approach would belong in the toolkit of a prudential, risk-averse forecaster.

Recently, most of the attention has been devoted to the estimation of four specific demographic components, namely mortality, fertility, emigration and immigration. Many methods take a deterministic viewpoint, which can be quite restrictive in practice. The statistical method that we propose is a multilevel functional data method, where both mortality and migration are modelled and forecast jointly for females and males. The forecast uncertainty associated with each component is incorporated through parametric bootstrapping. Using the historical data for the United Kingdom from 1975 to 2009, we found that the proposed method shows a good in-sample forecast accuracy for the holdout data between 2001 and 2009. Moreover, we produce out of-sample population forecasts from 2010 to 2030, and compare our forecasts with those produced by the Office for National Statistics.

In line with existing literature, we bias-correct opinion polls. We consider accuracy, bias and precision over different time horizons before an election, and we conclude that prediction markets appear to provide the most precise forecasts and are similar in terms of bias to opinion polls. We find that our statistical model struggles to provide competitive forecasts, while expert opinion appears to be of value. Finally we note that the forecast horizon matters; whereas prediction market forecasts tend to improve the nearer an election is, opinion polls appear to perform worse, while expert opinion performs consistently throughout. We thus contribute to the growing literature comparing election forecasts of polls and prediction markets.

Social pressure is manipulated by means of an explicit request for a receipt when not released. We employ an innovative approach to the identification of the treatment effect. We find that a single request for a receipt causes a 17 per cent rise in the probability of a receipt being released for a sale occurring shortly thereafter, causing on average more than two receipts to be released.

Because time is limited, activities compete for the limited time available. When Phylogenetically Important Events (PIEs) that ultimately affect fitness and ontogenetic proxies of these PIEs occur as consequences of an activity, they drive time spent in that activity. Time allocation is studied in the laboratory with concurrent payoff schedules, in which two or more schedules operate simultaneously. The generalized matching law describes choice in relation to relative consequences. It has been verified for food and other PIEs and for pairs of variable-interval schedules and variable-interval schedules paired with variable-ratio schedules. Because behavior produces consequences in the environment and those consequences in turn affect behavior, the environmental feedback functions and behavioral functional relations may be characterized as a feedback system. When different activities produce different consequences, choice depends also on the substitutability of the consequences. When consequences are perfectly substitutable, exclusive preference may occur, but when they are imperfectly substitutable, partial preferences may occur. Choice may become a dilemma pitting impulsivity against self-control when consequences are not stationary with respect to time. Evaluated in short timeframes, an activity may be strongly induced by its consequences, but evaluated in long timeframes, its consequences may be extremely negative; such an activity (e.g., using cocaine or lying) is a bad habit. A good habit (e.g., tooth brushing or helping others) presents the opposite conflict: bad consequences in short timeframes and positive consequences in long timeframes. Research on choice between good and bad habits may reveal factors that increase time spent in good habits relative to time spent in bad habits. The Multiscale Molar View helps to clarify various complexities that underlie choice viewed as time allocation.

We empirically examine the intertemporal shifts in U.S. cartel cases during the period 1969-2013. This period has seen substantive policy innovations with increasing penalties that are related to fines and jail terms. There appear to be four distinct cartel policy regimes: pre-1978, 1978-1992, 1993-2003, and 2004-2013. Our empirical estimates show significant variation in the number of cartel cases initiated and the penalties imposed across the policy regimes. The more recent regimes are characterized by far fewer cartel cases initiated, but with substantially higher penalties levied on firms and individuals. While effective deterrence is one explanation for these patterns, we are more inclined to conclude that U.S. cartel enforcement has seen an underlying shift away from focusing on smaller cartels to larger and multinational cartels. In terms of political effects, our results reveal no clear inter-political party effect, but there appear to be interesting intra-political party effects. We find that particular Presidencies matter for cartel enforcement, and variation across Presidential administrations led to marked shifts in the total number of cartel cases initiated. Overall, the shifts in the prosecution patterns portray changing policy priorities and a search for the optimal enforcement design to curtail one of the clearest sources of welfare loss, collusion.","[Ghosal, Vivek] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Econ, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Ghosal, Vivek] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Sokol, D.

The work concentrates on urban areas where public policies aiming at improving the sustainability of city systems necessarily affect both passengers and freight dimensions. Traffic in towns is responsible for a high share of congestion and pollution and consequently, it contributes to the climate change problems. The following conclusions can be derived. ABMs present important advantages for analysing urban transport and its sustainability but more efforts are needed in order to test and improve their use. In the literature, there is still a gap in urban transport AB modelling. The number of developed models is limited and they are often applied in broader geographical areas than urban ones. Only some of the works includes the estimation of environmental impacts as a result of certain types of agents' behaviour. Despite their potential effectiveness to represent the impacts of different public policies on agent behaviour and on the environment, none of the ABMs have been implemented in the real word by the researchers and there is no evidence of application of any model by policy-makers.

It does so by analyzing entanglements of Western and Chinese 'oil zones' in Niger, which are understood as trans-territorial spaces of assemblage. I argue that the specific properties of these two oil zones have triggered the emergence of a particular 'petro-political configuration' in Niger. The argument proceeds through four stages. Firstly, looking at economic entanglements, I argue that the Chinese oil zone enabled the Nigerien economy to develop so-called upstream and downstream oil industries, something the Western oil zone had not allowed. Secondly, analyzing political and socio-cultural entanglements, I argue that, by being co-opted into former Nigerien president Mamadou Tandja's political project for constitutional amendment, China's oil diplomacy has become a kind of 'soft power' in Niger, something Western political rhetoric has failed to achieve. Thirdly, focusing on geopolitical and military entanglements, I argue that the militarization of global space should ensure capitalist accumulation, especially in situations in which the translation of transnational governmentality has failed. Finally, I use these entanglements to identify the heterogeneous elements of Western and Chinese 'oil zones', and the specific capitalist properties these assemblages generate.","[Schritt, Jannik] Univ Gottingen, Inst Social & Cultural Anthropol, Theaterpl 15, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Schritt, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Inst Social & Cultural Anthropol, Theaterpl 15, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",jschrit@uni-goettingen.de,"Schritt, Jannik/JPW-8450-2023","Schritt, Jannik/0000-0003-2161-2711",German Research Foundation (DFG) project on 'Oil and Social Change in Niger and Chad' at the Georg August University of Gottingen,German Research Foundation (DFG) project on 'Oil and Social Change in Niger and Chad' at the Georg August University of Gottingen,"Jannik Schritt is a PhD researcher in a German Research Foundation (DFG) funded project on 'Oil and Social Change in Niger and Chad' at the Georg August University of Gottingen.

We depart from a literature review on the renegotiation of infrastructure concessions and of the main renegotiation triggers and the methodologies used to assess them. By collecting data from a total of 32 transport PPP projects, in 13 European countries, we identified a total of 37 renegotiations. Our findings corroborate the literature in that a country's economic and legal environment has an important impact on the likelihood of renegotiation. The occurrence of elections is shown to have an indirect impact on increasing renegotiations. Furthermore, both the uncertainty associated with developing new PPP projects with budgetary motivations, and the operational stages of long term contracts, play a critical role in contractual renegotiation.

We explore the interaction between legal and reputational sanctions using the idea that inducing safety through reputation requires implementing costly market sanctioning mechanisms. We show that law positively affects the functioning of market reputation by reducing its costs. We also show that reputation and product liability are not just substitutes but also complements. We analyze the effects of different legal policies, and namely that negligence reduces reputational costs more intensely than strict liability, and that court errors in determining liability interfere with reputational cost reduction through law. A more general result is that any variant of an ex post liability rule will improve the functioning of market reputation in isolation. We complicate the basic analysis with endogenous prices and observability by consumers of the outcome of court's decisions.

The three cities chosen have a highly varying modal share of public transport trips and thus offer interesting insights into the attitudes of trip makers towards the changes in operational variables such as fares, service levels. This paper contributes towards understanding of the determinants of demand for public transport in a developing country and applies econometric methods involving static and dynamic modelling methodologies. This research addresses the question of smaller sample sizes which constrain the use of standard regression approaches and applies a bootstrapping method which substitutes for traditional assumptions on distributions and asymptotic results. It was found that the suburban rail demand is inelastic to fare which indicates that the revenue would increase with an increase in fare. Finally, the paper illustrates the use of computed elasticities by estimating the demand for suburban rail in Kolkata. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A more efficient management of parking demand can improve the utilization of the limited parking capacity in high-demand areas. Even though parking policies are often a topic of public debate, there is lack of systematic empirical analysis of various parking measures. This paper proposes a survey methodology to empirically measure the impacts of on-street parking policies based on automated parking transaction data. Parking performance is computed based on data available from ticket vending machines calibrated using floating car films. The survey method allows comparing parking occupancy including its temporal variations, allowing the analysis of the accumulated utilization pattern. Average and maximum parking occupancy levels, throughput, parking duration and total fare collection are compared prior and following the introduction of a new parking scheme for visitors to Stockholm inner-city, Sweden. The results indicate that the policy fulfilled its objective to increase the ease of finding a vacant parking place in the central areas and even resulted with underutilized parking spaces.

Fixed-effects panel data models allow us to eliminate possible bias due to individual-specific media use propensity. We observe significant substitution among paper, television, and computer use, while telephone and computer use seem to be complementary in time of use. The magnitudes of substitutability and complementarity become larger if we control for subscriptions or the possession of media devices. For specific actions and purposes of use, there is substitutability within a smaller set of media. Televisions and computers exhibit substitutability for watching real-time television, cameras act as substitutes for video devices for viewing movies/videos, paper and computers exhibit substitutability for reading news articles, and computers and telephones substitute for one another in using informative content.","[Jang, Shinjae] Korea Dev Inst, Sejong, South Korea; [Park, Minsoo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul, South Korea",Korea Development Institute (KDI); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Park, M (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",minsoopark@skku.edu,,,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B8060964],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),We would like to thank the editors and two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments.

The analysis is performed using both real and nominal variables. The paper finds that although government expenditure has been rising over the period in question the rate of growth has not outpaced growth in GDP per capita, thus weighing against Wagner's Law. Results are robust across a selection of the most prominent model specifications in the literature, and to the volatility in government spending during the recent crisis.

I assume that there are two competing firms, each producing two complementary products. Each firm decides whether to employ strategies that enhance the quality of the fit (the degree of complementarity) between its pair of complementary products before competing in prices. The consumers have heterogeneous tastes for the four possible bundles. They arewilling to pay a price premium in order to purchase a bundle from the same firm if this firm chose to make such bundle more attractive. I find that increasing the degree of complementarity between a firm's complementary products intensifies price competition and often leads to smaller profits. Only when complementarity enhancing strategies significantly increase the demand for a firm's matching bundle, does the firm benefit from employing them. The highest profits for both firms are obtained when both firms do not employ complementarity-enhancing strategies. Deteriorating the quality of the fit between one's own and a rival's complementary products is never profitable.","[Sinitsyn, Maxim] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Sinitsyn, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",msinitsyn@ucsd.edu,,"Sinitsyn, Maxim/0000-0002-8272-1439",,,,,11,1,2,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

The protracted intra-regional debate surrounding the construction of the museum is informative in that it offers a scenario in which two rival cities are competing with each other within the same state. The story of their conflict adds a new and complicating dimension to the discussion by highlighting how city identity may intersect with national identity in relation to the politics of the state. The results show how the actual politics of city/state relations can be one of contestation between a range of political interests that extend beyond a simple, bipolar city/state relationship.","[Dempsey, Kara E.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Dempsey, KE (通讯作者)，Appalachian State Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",dempseyke@appstate.edu,,"Dempsey, Kara/0000-0002-4176-6569",Trewartha International Research Grant,Trewartha International Research Grant,"The author would like to thank Dr. Robert Ostergren, Dr. Colin Flint, Dr. Pat McHaffie and the anonymous reviewers.

In this paper we make use of the fact that these two royalty bases are equivalent to using ad valorem and per-unit royalties, respectively. We abstract from implementation and practicability considerations to analyze the welfare implications of the two rules. Ad valorem royalties tend to lead to lower prices, particularly in the context of successive monopolies. They benefit upstream innovators and do not necessarily hurt downstream producers. This benefit increases when there are multiple innovators contributing complementary technologies, as is typical of standard-setting organizations. Ad valorem royalties are even more desirable when enticing upstream investment is optimal. Our findings explain why most licensing contracts include royalties based on the value of the product.","[Llobet, Gerard] CEMFI, Madrid, Spain; [Padilla, Jorge] Compass Lexecon, Washington, DC USA; [Llobet, Gerard] Ctr Econ Policy Res, Washington, DC USA",Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Llobet, G (通讯作者)，CEMFI, Madrid, Spain.",,"Llobet, Gerard/L-5996-2014; Padilla, Jorge/JFS-3911-2023","Llobet, Gerard/0000-0002-6421-5890;",Qualcomm; Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitivity [ECO2011-26308],Qualcomm; Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitivity(Spanish Government),"Llobet is also a Research Fellow at the Centre for Economic Policy Research.

The empirical analysis was based on data captured from an online questionnaire on the Portuguese manufacturing industry. The multivariate data analysis focused on the analysis of variance and factor analysis.

The questionnaire survey was conducted among the targeted SMEs in Malaysia and based on the 160 completed responses, the study finds that both Malaysian small and medium firms made extensive use of traditional MAPs and only selectively use modern MAPs such as non-financial performance measures related to internal processes and to customers. Results for all MAPs also indicate that a higher usage by medium firms as opposed to small firms. In most part of MAPs, medium firms adopted as twice as many small firms. The most significant differences between small and medium firms relate to the use of decision support system and strategic management accounting.

Alternative investments are characterized by their specific targets (such as non-listed companies or special properties) and by their pursued investment strategy (hedge funds). Hedge funds, have been especially focused on by the European Union, which passed Directive 2011/61/EU (AIFM-Directive) in July 2011 in order to regulate their intensive use of options and other highly leveraged financial instruments, generally believed to have aggravated the last financial market crisis. Pursuant to this Directive, initiators of hedge funds and other alternative investment funds are subject to a uniform schedule of licensing and operations requirements to market their funds across the European Union (European Passport). Along with this EU-wide regulation, which is expected to facilitate German inbound investments in alternative forms, a tax-efficient structuring of those investments is crucial, especially for real estate transfer taxes and definitive withholding taxes. Tax burdens arising from national taxation regimes not compliant with the AIFM-Directive can lead to investment hurdles resulting in low after-tax yields.

While there has been some research quantifying impacts of e-bikes on the transportation system, there has been little work tracking e-bike use patterns over time. This paper investigates e-bike use over a 6-year period. Four bi-annual travel diary surveys of e-bike users were conducted between 2006 and 2012 in Kunming, China. Choice models were developed to investigate factors influencing mode-transition and motorization pathways. As expected, income and vehicle Ownership strongly influence car-based transitions. Younger and female respondents were more likely to choose car-based modes. Systematic and unobserved changes over time (time-dynamics) favor car-based modes, with the exception of previous car users who already shifted away from cars being less likely to revert to cars over time. E-bikes act as an intermediate mode, interrupting the transition from bicycle to bus and from bus to car. Over 6 years, e-bikes are displacing prospective bus (65 -> 55%), car/taxi (15 -> 24%) and bicycle (19 -> 7%) trips. Over 40% of e-bike riders now have household car access so e-bikes are effectively replacing many urban car trips. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

There is a limited amount of factors capable of influencing the aforementioned process on the national and/or regional level, and the direct policy actions carried out by the government are among the most important of these factors that can be adjusted on a relatively short notice. With the aim to gauge potential impact of policy actions on the regional demographic change, author reviews the available literature concerning regional demographic development policies, and proceeds with the content analysis of the available legal/policy documents, as well as the meeting proceedings of the national parliament-Saeima. Author evaluates the selected documents and political statements in the context of the ongoing nationwide and regional demographic processes. Study results indicate significant discrepancies between the regional demographic problems and the respective policy actions.

The current study uses rural household survey data captured in the Chinese provinces of Fujian, Shaanxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi. It applies a Heckman regression model and a quantile regression model to determine the effect of income diversification on forest dependence. The three main findings of this study are as follows. (1) The mean income diversification index values in Fujian, Shaanxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi are 1.81, 1.46, 1.63, and 2.00, respectively; this indicates that livelihood activities within the study areas are limited. (2) When the income diversification index increases by 10%, the proportion of forest income to total income within the study areas decreases by 4-8%; this indicates that income diversification can significantly reduce a household's dependence on forest resources, especially among the poorest households. (3) For the top 20% of high-income households, the effect of income diversification on forest dependence is insignificant, but for the bottom 20% of low-income households, income diversification has a major impact in terms of reducing their forest reliance (6-10%). The findings of this study will help inform the design of alternative policies that could alleviate pressure relating to forest-resource protection.

Using Minnesota State University, Mankato campus as the case area, model simulations were run to answer the question, How do we price parking permits to minimize parking supply surpluses! shortages on campus and still meet the cost of parking? The study's results indicate that there is an over/undersupply of parking spaces when parking demand is determined only by the expected permit purchases without considering the peak use of parking facilities. This leads to the issues of excess parking costs and parking shortages which characterize the iterative process in campus parking pricing and supply policies. By running the model through several simulations, an optimum parking price level - that which minimizes supply excesses/shortages while also ensuring that revenue generated meets at least the annual operations and maintenance costs - was determined for each parking permit on campus.

The effectiveness of endorsement depends on a number of factors, among others: the star's compatibility with the brand or the product, the creativity of the advertising message, or the choice of promotion forms and media. Another interesting issue is the influence of the nationality or the type of a star (an expert, an actor, a sports person) on the effectiveness of this form of marketing communication. This article aims to analyze the way in which endorsement of food products is perceived by consumers with ethnocentric attitudes. It is assumed that the attitudes of consumer ethnocentrism, which are characterized by the preference for the domestic or foreign brands and products, affect the reception of advertising messages endorsed by a domestic or a foreign star. On the basis of a survey conducted among Polish consumers, the authors will define the relationship between the nationality of the endorser of a food brand and the level of ethnocentrism diagnosed by means of CETSCALE (Shimp's and Sharma's Consumer Ethnocentrism Tendencies Scale). Moreover, they will specify the types of stars involved in the endorsement of food products, which are most favored by consumers with different levels of ethnocentrism. The obtained results indicate that the higher the level of consumer ethnocentrism towards food products, the stronger the preference for domestic stars endorsing brands and products.","[Jerzyk, Ewa] Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Mkt Strategies, Poznan, Poland; [Wyczynski, Kamil] Univ Catholique Lille, Fac Management Econ & Sci, Lille, France",Poznan University of Economics & Business; Universite Catholique de Lille,"Wyczynski, K (通讯作者)，Univ Catholique Lille, Fac Management Econ & Sci, Lille, France.",e.jerzyk@ue.poznan.pl; kamil.wyczynski@lille.iseg.fr,"Jerzyk, Ewa/V-2618-2018","Jerzyk, Ewa/0000-0001-8474-3570",,,,,27,1,1,0,15,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27570-3; 978-3-319-27569-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-1,,,,,,501.0,514,,10.1007/978-3-319-27570-3_37,0.0,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429900037,0

This paper is aimed to apply, upon the status quo analysis of the transport and logistics processes, the optimization measures in Milktrans a.s. towards making the selected processes more effective and their economic evaluation. Specifically, it is the application of the Clark-Wright method as one of the method in solving the travelling salesman problem. The problem of the circular travels is defined on the transport network consisting of the group of nodes and edges connecting the nodes. In case of transportation through a few service points, which is effected by the means of transport, the travelling salesman problem method is the best solution.","[Jiri, Cejka; Dana, Smetanova] Inst Technol & Business, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Jirí, C (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",cejka@vstecb.cz; smetanova@vstecb.cz,"Smetanová, Dana/ABA-2720-2021","Smetanová, Dana/0000-0002-3666-2212",,,,,11,2,2,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,1195.0,1207,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700118,0

Although it is impossible to incorporate and calculate all the potential impacts, such a model can provide an estimation based on sound statistics and methodologies. Understanding the potential, wider economic impacts of strike action can lead to valuable insights for policymakers, businesses and workers. This will hopefully result in improved policies, as well as enriched negotiations to find solutions to deadlocks in wage negotiations before such deadlocks progress to strike action. Data from the Department of Labour (DoL) shows that 103,155 workers participated in the strike in the metal-ores sector during 2012, and company annual reports indicate that this strike action lasted seven weeks on average. Estimates show that the monetary value of ounces lost by the platinum-related mining industry as a result of lost production during the strike periods amounted to R10.6 billion. Two scenarios are estimated that result in a gross domestic product (GDP) loss for 2012 of 0.53 per cent or R16.5 billion (Scenario 1), and of 0.49 per cent or R15.5 billion (Scenario 2). This implies that GDP growth could have been 3 per cent for Scenario 1 and 2.97 per cent for Scenario 2, instead of the actual GDP growth of 2.47 per cent. Exports could have been R9.05 billion higher for Scenario 1 and R8.4 billion higher for Scenario 2. The current-account deficit for 2012 could have been reduced to 4.93 per cent of GDP for Scenario 1 and to 4.9 per cent for Scenario 2, as against the actual deficit of 5.23 per cent. Tax income could have been R3.8 billion higher for Scenario 1 and R3.6 billion higher for Scenario 2. As a result, the government's budget deficit could have been reduced to 5.13 per cent instead of 5.26 per cent. Expressing employment opportunities lost in terms of annual employment opportunities lost as a result of lost activity shows that this represents almost 25,000 employment opportunities for Scenario 1 and almost 23,300 such opportunities for Scenario 2.","[Jordaan, Johannes C.] Univ S Africa, Bur Market Res, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Jordaan, JC (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Bur Market Res, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,,,,,,34,4,7,0,1,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Using a questionnaire, this study investigated the environmental information needs of South African users of environmental reports. The study was deemed necessary to unveil users' preferences which, if incorporated in reports, could enhance their perceived decision-usefulness, thus increasing readership. The results of the survey revealed that users need balanced environmental information that identifies and describes key, relevant issues and that is both specific and accurate. In addition, users need future-oriented information that identifies and addresses key stakeholders' concerns, and which demonstrates the integration of environmental issues into core business processes. Furthermore the information should be summarised in an integrated annual report and posted on a company's website. Based on its findings, this study recommends that standard setters and regulators should recognise that both financial and non-financial users need decision-useful environmental reports.

Micro, small and medium enterprises are an important element of European economies, both those within the EU as well as those outside it. The results of the analysis of macroeconomic data, which are presented in the article, will indicate significance of this sector in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Ukraine. Literature studies and analysis of the national legal regulations allowed to indicate different ranges of the mandatory elements of the financial statements and of the additional information which the entities from the SME sector must prepare in individual countries. The differences also exist in case of tax evidence and tax reporting. As a result, the scope of the financial information for decision-making and for evaluation of the enterprises is not homogenous in the researched Eastern-European countries.

Against the background of the continuous intensification of resource and energy constraints in China. Therefore, the analysis of China's regional transport efficiency and its determinants has practical significance. This paper attempts to evaluate regional total factor transport efficiency in China based on the Super-SBM DEA model considering undesirable output and explores the influence factors of transport efficiency in China during the period 1995-2012. The empirical results indicate that during the research period, most provinces in China are not performing efficiently in transport systems. Additionally, the overall average level of China's total factor transport efficiency is low and the spatial pattern of the total factor transport efficiency demonstrates a declining trend from eastern to western China, which coincides with the spatial pattern of economic development in China. The analysis of the influence factors by the regression model shows that economic development and government influence can decrease overall transport efficiency, while industrial structure, population density, and geographical position can influence transport efficiency. The influence of these factors varies by region. Finally, this paper provides policy recommendations to improve transport efficiency in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, a qualitative cause and effect model has been devised, illustrating the mechanisms of the occurrence and the course of currency crises. This model is independent of the time and place and it includes potential causes of disorder on monetary markets. The authors have identified four major groups of conditions for the emergence of currency crises, i.e. 1) functioning of the financial system, including the quality of supervisory and audit institutions, 2) economic policy, especially the public finance sector debt, the established exchange-rate regime and the level of currency reserves, 3) real sphere factors, including company and household debts in foreign currencies,4) external factors, including an import of crisis from the neighbouring states. The authors have also made an attempt at verifying their qualitative cause and effect model on the example of Poland. According to the authors, a serious imbalance of part of the world's economy in the 21st century, emphasised in the form of the financial crisis and the subsequent economic and debt crises, could be a vital factor facilitating the occurrence of the currency crisis. Nonetheless, an assessment of the model for Poland makes it possible to estimate the risk of the occurrence of a currency crisis, as low. The current exchange-rate regime, Institutions of Supervision and Security in Poland and the level of currency reserves have been concluded to serve as strong crisis-defense factors. The liberalisation of capital flows and public finance sector debt have been assumed to be rather slumpogenic factors. The assessment of the risk of the start of a currency crisis will become greater in the case of Poland's participation in the ERM II mechanism which precedes Poland's accession to the European Monetary Union. In this context, the exchange-rate regime and the level of currency reserves have been regarded as rather slumpogenic factors.","[Lis, Piotr; Zwierzchlewski, Slawomir] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ & Local Govt Policy, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Lis, P; Zwierzchlewski, S (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ & Local Govt Policy, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland.",piotr.lis@ue.poznan.pl; s.zwierzchlewski@ue.poznan.pl,"Lis, Piotr Konrad/I-5779-2018","Lis, Piotr Konrad/0000-0001-7942-2668",,,,,29,2,2,0,6,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

A decomposition of export growth shows that exports of non-fuel primary commodities as well as medium-skill and technology-intensive manufactured products increased. The largest decrease was in the export of resource-intensive manufactures. These changes reflect South Africa's endowment of relatively low levels of physical and human capital.

However, the associated risks and risk strategies have scarcely been mentioned in these discussions, remaining a subject worthy of attention for scientific literature. The present study aims to research the hampering factors of the wind energy business in Romania and the strategic methods of risk mitigation. The threats of the wind energy sector have been a major concern of the last 2 years in Romania, as the companies in the field have striven to overcome the green certificates subsidy crisis from 2013. By using the Delphi method based on questionnaires and interviews with 26 experts in the field, the current paper offers an overview of the most significant risks that have been associated with wind energy and of the risk mitigation strategies. The study revealed major threats in the case of political and regulatory risks and the risks associated with the authorization phase of wind energy projects. The relevance of the study lies in the correlation of the risks and risk mitigation strategies of the wind energy companies and the legal and economic environment in Romania that has brought adverse shift in the development of the wind energy field in the last year.","[Nichifor, Maria Alexandra] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Business Adm, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Nichifor, MA (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Business Adm, Bucharest, Romania.",maria_nichifor@hotmail.com,"Maassen, Maria Alexandra/M-6277-2018; Maassen, Maria Alexandra/ABF-9709-2020",,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27573-4; 978-3-319-27572-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-2,,,,,,247.0,258,,10.1007/978-3-319-27573-4_16,0.0,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429800016,0

The development of shopping centres has formed a new structural and very concentrated urban element the result of activity of which has not been widely studied from the transportation point of view. When implementing a sustainable urban development the authors of the article aimed at ensuring the effective use of the parking lots of shopping centres during twenty four hours. For this purpose, an empirical research was carried out which resulted in a comprehensive analysis of the parking lots of 49 shopping centres in Vilnius City. The research used observation method to determine a design capacity of the parking lots of shopping centres, their occupancy, to additionally define the number of residents living in the closest proximity to the parking lot, the number of flats, the value of flats, the number of working population, the demand for parking spaces, occupancy of the parking lots with cars, etc. The expert method was used to select the main criteria characterizing interaction of the parking lots of shopping centres with the multi-storey housing area. With the help of expert questionnaire the weights and significances of criteria were determined. Using the multiple-criteria methods a priority use of the parking lots of shopping centres for parking of passenger cars was calculated and assessed. The article gives development priorities and outlines the strategy of implementing the given recommendations. This is one of the first attempts to use the parking lots of shopping centres to park passenger cars at night. If the suggested system is put into practice it would help to reduce up to 20% the demand for parking spaces in the urbanized multi-storey housing areas.","[Palevicius, Vytautas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Environm Engn, Res Inst Terr Planning, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Burinskiene, Marija; Paliulis, Grazvydas Mykolas; Sarkiene, Edita] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Environm Engn, Dept Urban Engn, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Podvezko, Valentinas] Fac Fundamental Sci, Dept Math Stat, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Saparauskas, Jonas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Palevicius, V (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Environm Engn, Res Inst Terr Planning, Vilnius, Lithuania.",vytautas.palevicius@vgtu.lt; marija.burinskiene@vgtu.lt; valentinas.podvezko@vgtu.lt; msk@vgtu.lt; edita.sarkiene@vgtu.lt; jonas.saparauskas@vgtu.lt,,"Sarkiene, Edita/0000-0002-1608-1373; Palevicius, Vytautas/0000-0002-0331-2101",,,,,39,5,5,0,14,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

In particular, we consider changes in the scale, scope and specialisation of resources and capabilities at subsidiaries over time by drawing on Dodgshon's (1998) study of change in empires and societal systems. Following Dodgshon, we classify changes at MNE subsidiaries into processes of (i) expansion or contraction, (ii) reduction, (iii) involution, (iv) aggregation upwards and outwards, (v) accretion and (vi) replacement/ substitution, illustrating this framework with reference to the extant literature. We suggest that the potential of this framework lies, in part, in its embrace of both change and inertia within MNEs and at their subsidiaries. It is important to consider both change and inertia if we are to understand the implications of MNE subsidiary evolution national and subnational economic development policy.","[Phelps, Nicholas A.] UCL, Bartlett Sch Planning, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Fuller, Cris] Cardiff Univ, Sch Planning & Geog, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward 7 Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales",University of London; University College London; Cardiff University,"Phelps, NA (通讯作者)，UCL, Bartlett Sch Planning, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",n.phelps@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,88,33,34,2,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Furthermore, as the level of analysis gets larger, additional social and economic complexities may challenge a creative class model. Using a cross-national sample of 59 countries, we examine the quantitative associations between creative class dimensions (technology, talent, and tolerance) with business environment. Our findings provide partial support for creative class theory, finding that technology and tolerance are positively associated with business environment after controlling for certain social characteristics.","[Recker, Nicholas L.] Metropolitan State Univ Denver, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, POB 173362,Campus Box 28, Denver, CO 80217 USA; [Moore, Matthew D.] Univ Cent Arkansas, Dept Sociol Criminol & Anthropol, 306 Irby Hall, Conway, AR 72035 USA",Metropolitan State University of Denver; University of Central Arkansas,"Recker, NL (通讯作者)，Metropolitan State Univ Denver, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, POB 173362,Campus Box 28, Denver, CO 80217 USA.",nrecker@msudenver.edu; mmoore@grandview.edu,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,103.0,111,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254700012,0

The performance of banking sector during 2004-2014 shows that total assets of banking sector are increasing continuously since 2004 and reached up to 298% during the period 2004-14. The non-performing Loans (NPLs), which is the main indicator of assets quality showed a surprise boost from 2007 to 2012. However banks diverted their assets mix to investments in government securities. There was a visible improvement in indicators pertaining to solvency of banking sector. Capital adequacy ratio reached 17.1 percent during 2004-14. The accumulation of large stock in liquid assets through government securities provided more comfortable funding in liquidity to banks. A remarkable improvement is observed in profitability.

In the history of science, there were many cases when suspicions terms with a more or less strong metaphysical flavour were introduced and it only complicated explication of relevant issues. The article addresses the following problem question: Does the abstract concept of culture meet the standards of contemporary scientific language? The aim of the article: to explicate the explanatory value of culture concept in the contexts of international business communication. The objectives related to this aim are following: I. to reveal essential features of the technical language of postmodern science; 2. to distinguish the main semantic aspects of the culture concept in theoretical contexts; 3. to discuss the heuristic value of the culture concept in practical situations. Research method: a conceptual analysis. The main conclusions are following: first, culture is a useful binding metaphor in contemporary interdisciplinary context. Once it is applied consciously and cautiously, it promotes holistic, non-reductionist approach toward complex human behaviour; second, using the culture concept in the scientific way one is able to avoid traps of stereotype (fast) thinking and, consequently, to initiate and elaborate meaningful international dialogue.","[Saulius, Tomas] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Fac Sports Educ, Dept Hlth Phys & Social Educ, Sporto Str 6, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Valanciene, Dovile] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Dept Sports Management Econ & Sociol, Fac Sports Educ, Sporto Str 6, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Skurvydas, Albertas] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Dept Appl Biol & Rehabil, Fac Sport Biomed, Sporto Str 6, Kaunas, Lithuania",Lithuanian Sports University; Lithuanian Sports University; Lithuanian Sports University,"Saulius, T (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Fac Sports Educ, Dept Hlth Phys & Social Educ, Sporto Str 6, Kaunas, Lithuania.",tomas.saulius@lsu.lt; dovile.valanciene@lsu.lt; albertas.skurvydas@lsu.lt,,,,,,,86,2,2,0,7,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

This is based on a systematic, comprehensive review of a company's activities and results with the goal of identifying weaknesses and opportunities for improvement. Therefore, it is put more emphasis on the development of an effective performance measurement and management system as a tool for enhancing business competitiveness. Given the importance and urgency of this issue the revolutionary developments in this area can be observed over the last 20 years. Researchers and managers are constantly trying to understand all the variables affecting the performance of the company. They are looking for an answer to the question of how best to use the lessons learned from performance measurement to its management. They design and develop various concepts, frameworks and methods for measuring and managing performance in the current business practice. They are constantly trying to eliminate the drawbacks of contemporary systems in order to increase their effectiveness. Cognition of these systems, their characteristics and identification of weaknesses can be seen as challenges for performance measurement and management in the future, for which solutions must be found. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to investigate the level of development of current performance management systems in Czech companies. The level of development is determined by fulfilment of the characteristics of an effective performance management system based on literature review. Attention is also paid to determination whether the level of a performance management system's development is dependent on company size.

Despite the passing of two Acts to provide for the substantive law and establish a competition commission to enforce it, various issues remain open, including the objective the law is intended to serve and the construction to be afforded to the substantive provisions. Certain areas were left out of the law, including two sectors and merger control. In an economy where there are many concurrent directorships the law omits interlocking directorships. The scope of the law is also open to debate, with such issues as the interaction between the general and sectoral competition laws, the locus standi of final consumers vis-A -vis the enterprises that infringe the law. Issues aside, the newly established commission is also faced with challenges, including its financial and policy independence, and its ability to attract subject matter experts and deal with complex legal and economic analysis.

We discuss how to assess the sustainability of transit investment and the mechanisms through which public transit investment can affect equilibrium auto travel volumes and the associated congestion and air quality outcomes. Several related issues are addressed: the differences between short-run and long-run equilibria; the role of regional heterogeneity; regulatory and policy considerations; and the potential endogeneity of transit investment when conducting empirical analyses. As the transportation policy landscape evolves and technological advancements continue, a complete evaluation of the social benefits of transit investment is essential both for allocating investment funds and for designing policies that result in an efficient level of investment and travel in the long run. Does the existing evidence bolster public transit's 'green' reputation? Reviewing the recent empirical literature, it appears that transit can both reduce congestion and improve air quality, but the magnitudes of these benefits are uncertain and may be specific to each location.

However, global IT companies acquire patents not only from internal research and development (R&D), but also from inbound open innovation. Focusing on this, we examine the differential effects of patents from various sources, including (1) internal R&D, (2) university-industry collaboration, and (3) transaction on corporate sales, profits, and market value in 28 global IT companies. We find that patents by internal R&D boost sales, profits, and corporate value. Purchased patents have small, immediate positive effects on market value and profit, but do not increase sales. University-industry collaboration patents drive sales after more than two years, but negatively impact market value. Overall, internal R&D is consistently important for sustainable corporate growth, implying that the acquisition of ideas, technologies, and human resources for internal R&D is the most effective method of inbound open innovation. Purchased patents boost short-term growth, while university-industry collaboration is necessary for mid- and long-term growth. Our study provides the basis for an optimal balance between internal R&D and inbound open innovation, as well as the creation of a financial performance-oriented patent portfolio.","[Lee, Byoungho] Samsung Elect, 130 Samsung Ro, Suwon 443803, South Korea; [Cho, Hwang Hee] Sci & Technol Policy Inst, Sicheong Daero 339007, Sejong Si, South Korea; [Shin, Juneseuk] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Syst Management Engn, 2066 Seobu Ro, Suwon 440746, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea","Samsung; Samsung Electronics; Science & Technology Policy Institute (STEPI), Republic of Korea; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)","Shin, J (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Syst Management Engn, 2066 Seobu Ro, Suwon 440746, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",jsshin@skku.edu,,,Basic Science Research Program through National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2013R1A1A2009406],Basic Science Research Program through National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education,This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education [NRF-2013R1A1A2009406].,,47,22,22,7,97,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

In this framework more wealth improves commitment and gives rise to insurance gains within the household. Our theory motivates these gains by the empirical observation that wealth, in contrast to labor income, is a commonly held resource within households. Based on this observation we study whether eliminating capital taxes from the economy, and raising labor taxes to balance the government's budget, may generate welfare gains to married households. We illustrate that the quantitative effects from this reform are rather small. We attribute the small effects to the life cycle pattern of wealth accumulation and to the impact of labor income taxes on household risk sharing: In particular, we show that higher labor taxes may make the limited commitment friction more severe, even though they may make the distribution of labor income more equitable within the household.","[Oikonomou, Rigas] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain, Belgium; [Siegel, Christian] Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England",Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Exeter,"Oikonomou, R (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain, Belgium.",rigas.oikonomou@uclouvain.be; c.siegel@exeter.ac.uk,,"Siegel, Christian/0000-0002-1686-8686",Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Societe et Culture,Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Societe et Culture,"We are grateful to the editor David de la Croix, and to two anonymous referees for useful comments and suggestions.

Exit, Voice, and Loyalty under Increasing Competition",JOURNAL OF LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,QUALITY; ENTRY; DIFFERENTIATION,"Competition works only if poorly performing vendors can be punished. The principal vehicle for consumers to discipline ill-performing firms is to switch to alternative providers. But switching is not the only mechanism consumers have to express disapproval. While some unhappy consumers may choose to no longer buy the good or service, other consumers express their disappointment through complaining. This article examines Albert O. Hirschman's conjecture that as industries become more competitive, consumers' complaints give way to switching. It offers a simple description of the theoretical relationships among market structure, quality, and complaints. It then utilizes an extensive data set to explore the empirical determinants of consumers' complaining behavior in the local-exchange telephone industry. These data overcome the problem that complaints can depend on both competition and quality, while competition also presumably affects quality directly. The estimations accommodate this complication and provide considerable support for Hirschman's conjecture.","[Beard, T.

We show how after the exit of its rival in an initially duopolistic market, the remaining airline did not increase its prices in order not to provoke the entry of new rivals. According to our view, this result was explained by the 'public concern' that was created about the incumbent's behaviour and its attempt of presenting itself as a benevolent monopolist. However, its strategy failed and a new operator finally entered the market, with a subsequent drop in average prices. We prove our hypothesis by developing a theoretical multi-route oligopolistic model with differentiated services and by testing its implications using several difference-in-difference econometric techniques on a monthly prices database collected in 2012-2013.

In the paper we offer a comprehensive analysis of the effects of the mechanisms to coordinate tort and insurance payments on the three essential decisions involved, namely precaution, risk coverage and litigation. We undertake the analysis for the Collateral Source Rule (cumulation), benefits offset (deduction), and subrogation of insurer. In the presence of a liability system, the problem of coordination makes sense only in a world in which liability rules do not operate perfectly. Under an imperfect strict liability regime, we show that solely subrogation can induce optimal incentives for risk coverage. In addition, collateral offset dilutes injurer's incentives to take care as compared to the other two regimes. Under an imperfect negligence regime, incentives to buy coverage under the collateral source rule are lower. Under collateral benefits offset, the victim may prefer to ignore tort payments entirely, buying full insurance and leaving the injurer with no incentives for precaution. The paper also discusses the litigation decision and the apparently strong advantage in terms of administrative costs of the collateral offset rule over subrogation, and points out several factors that might undermine this presumed advantage.

In the context of bivariate stationary VAR(p) models, we show that its finite sample properties are comparable to those of alternatives based on the backward representation.

Using data from 49 countries we extend the conventional capital-asset pricing model (CAPM) to include a property rights risk-factor. In the conventional CAPM model only a single risk factor-systemic risk-is considered. However, when using a world market portfolio to estimate systemic risk in national portfolios, little of the required rate of return is explained in less developed as compared to more developed countries. Adding a factor representing institutional risk increases predictive power substantially. Further, we find that property rights affect the transmission of information, which suggests that markets price information differently, and allocate resources less efficiently, in countries with less secure property rights. We find that the CAPM model performs better in countries with more secure property rights.","[Bjuggren, Per-Olof] Jonkoping Int Business Sch & Ratio Inst, SE-10364 Stockholm, Sweden; [Eklund, Johan E.] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, SE-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden; [Eklund, Johan E.] Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, SE-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden",Jonkoping University,"Bjuggren, PO (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch & Ratio Inst, POB 3203, SE-10364 Stockholm, Sweden.",p-o.bjuggren@ratio.se; johan.eklund@entreprenorskapsforum.se,"Eklund, Johan/HPC-9141-2023",,Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation,Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation,"Financial support from the Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.

One common supporting tool of port authorities evolution and strategies could be identified into transportation flows modelization in order to assess the impact of policies in the modal distribution of the traffic flows (e.g. from road to sea) and the impacts that this shift may have in term of reduction of the emissions. The proposed methodology is based on the construction of a transport simulation model in order to check the modal distribution in different scenarios. The model can be used to compare the market dynamics (based on transport costs) with reference to different scenarios (number and frequencies of lines) and to the different costs involved. In such a way it is possible to compare and simulate the introduction of new lines on one side and the impact of Mos policies and projects on territories (in terms of regional impact in modal shift from road to MoS). The gravity model used in this work shows that the socio-economic and environment impact of Motorways of the Sea (MoS) depends more on environmental policies integration in the transport and logistics chain, territorial potential and importance of logistics systems rather than distance and transportation cost factors.","[Juste, Ndayishimiye] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, UMR CNRS ESPACE, F-7300 Nice, France; [Ghiara, Hilda] Univ Genoa, Fac Econ, I-16126 Genoa, Italy",Universite Cote d'Azur; University of Genoa,"Juste, N (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, UMR CNRS ESPACE, F-7300 Nice, France.",nj905704@etu.unice.fr; ghiara@economia.unige.it,,,,,,,47,2,2,0,8,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

This can also potentially reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by reducing the number of freight vehicle movements for a given freight task. Decisions regarding increased axle loads on the existing road infrastructure can be founded on the marginal cost of road wear as the basis of a price for increasing axle loads. These prices can provide a clear signal for targeting maintenance and rehabilitation funding and works provided the revenue raised by the price is directly linked to the funding. The Freight Axle Limits Investigation Tool (FAMLIT) is a pavement life-cycle costing model that can be used to estimate load-wear-cost (LWC) relationships for a range of typical roads and pavement types for six heavy vehicle axle groups. Loads were incrementally increased above current load limits to estimate the LWC relationships. Life-cycle road wear costs were based on the present value (PV) of the routine and periodic maintenance and rehabilitation costs associated with managing each road type within agreed functional and structural conditions. The PVs of these costs were subsequently converted into equivalent annual uniform costs (EAUC) which were used to form LWC relationships with axle load (tonne-km) and standard axle repetitions (SAR-km), providing alternative independent variables. The marginal cost of road wear was determined by the first derivative of the LWC relationships. The estimated marginal road wear costs, in both short-run marginal cost (SRMC) form and long-run marginal cost (LRMC) form were found to vary across a range of road types and were highly dependent on the pavement/subgrade strength and traffic load. The marginal costs based on the LWC relationship using SAR-km as the independent variable were a constant value until axle group loads were increased significantly above current limits.

A game-theoretic model is introduced, presenting the alternative capital markets as Harsanyi's games with imperfect information, succeeding to each other in a Selten's extensive game with imperfect recall. Market participants' behaviour is made of strategies oriented on cash flows and indirect benefits, through the usage of discretionary freedom of choice offered by the applicable law. The overall level of risk in the market depends on whether these strategies reach, collectively, a state of Nash's dynamic equilibrium, or not. The institution of nominated advisers, in two alternative capital markets, namely the British AIM and the Polish New Connect, is studied on the grounds of the model. The main finding is that, although the regulations of both markets create significant risk through the discretionary freedom of choice that the operators of these markets attribute to themselves, in terms of social games the markets seem to be quite stable. In conclusion, numerous hypotheses for further research are formulated, in particular that alternative capital markets are still institutionally young and experimental.","Modrzewski Cracow Univ, Andrzej Frycz, Dept Econ & Management, Krakow, Poland",Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski Krakow University,"Wasniewski, K (通讯作者)，Modrzewski Cracow Univ, Andrzej Frycz, Dept Econ & Management, Ul Herlinga Grudzinskiego 1, Krakow, Poland.",krzysztof.wasniewski@gmail.com,"Wasniewski, Krzysztof/C-9641-2018","Wasniewski, Krzysztof/0000-0003-0076-4804",,,,,74,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Exploring sharp temporal and geographic variation in the pattern of consumer broadband adoption, I find that the latter has significantly contributed to increased marriage rates among 21-30 year-old individuals. A number of tests suggest that this relationship is causal and that it varies across demographic groups potentially facing thinner marriage markets.

The selection of weather station(s) plays a vital role in electric load forecasting. Nevertheless, minimal research efforts have been devoted to weather station selection. In the smart grid era, hierarchical load forecasting, which provides load forecasts throughout the utility system hierarchy, is emerging as an important topic. Since there are many nodes to forecast in the hierarchy, it is no longer feasible for forecasting analysts to figure out the best weather stations for each node manually. A commonly used solution framework involves assigning the same number of weather stations to all nodes at the same level of the hierarchy. This framework was also adopted by all four of the winning teams of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012 (GEFCom2012) in the hierarchical load forecasting track. In this paper, we propose a weather station selection framework to determine how many and which weather stations to use for a territory of interest. We also present a practical, transparent and reproducible implementation of the proposed framework. We demonstrate the application of the proposed approach to the forecasting of electricity at different levels in the hierarchies of two US utilities. One of them is a large US generation and transmission cooperative that has deployed the proposed framework. The other one is from GEFCom2012. In both case studies, we compare our unconstrained approach with four other alternatives based on the common practice mentioned above. We show that the forecasting accuracy can be improved by removing the constraint on the fixed number of weather stations. (C) 2014 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, it is described how such a fee can be determined for the purpose of licence renewal or extension. National and regional Dutch FM licences were valued, taking into account that simulcast broadcasting of digital and analogue radio is obligatory upon extension. Licences are valued using discounted cash flow methodology, whereby the cash flows of an averagely efficient entrant are taken as the benchmark for valuation of each individual licence. Cash flows during the licence period 2011-2017 are forecast based on generalized least squares regressions, using financial variables of Dutch radio stations for the years 2004-2008. Separately, bottom-up cost and investment models are used to calculate analogue and digital distribution costs. This results in a value per licence, based on objective licence characteristics, which can be used to set licence fees if administrative renewal or extension is opted for instead of a new auction or beauty contest.","[Kerste, Marco] SEO Econ Res, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Poort, Joost; van Eijk, Nico] Inst Informat Law, NL-1012 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Poort, J (通讯作者)，Inst Informat Law, Kloveniersburgwal 48, NL-1012 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.kerste@seo.nl; poort@uva.nl; vaneijk@uva.nl,,"Poort, Joost/0000-0003-4611-8816",,,,,15,0,0,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

An integrated organizational approach towards learning and knowledge sharing creates the right environment for creativity and enables the business to convert an opportunity into an innovation. Open innovation, hover, consists of three different subsets that are categorized into three main core processes (inside-out, coupled and outside-in).

The focus is on the effects of quality of institutions and similarity of institutions in explaining variation in bilateral agricultural and food exports among the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The empirical results confirm the separate effects for similarity of institutions and quality of institutions with agro-food export patterns. The similarity of institutions has significant but mixed associations with the agro-food exports in similar institutional frameworks. The effect of quality of institutions on agro-food exports varies: different institutions have different impacts on the agro-food exports. The good quality of institutions reduces the effects of the distance, which jointly with the level of economic development in importing OECD countries encourages the international agro-food trade.","[Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, SI-6104 Koper, Slovenia; [Ferto, Imre] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary; Corvinus Univ Budapest, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",University of Primorska; Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Corvinus University Budapest,"Bojnec, S (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Cankarjeva 5,Koper Pp 345, SI-6104 Koper, Slovenia.",stefan.bojnec@fm-kp.si; ferto.imre@krtk.mta.hu,"Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009; Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022; Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022; Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021","Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964; Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372;",Hungarian and Slovenian Academies of Sciences; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund [37868],Hungarian and Slovenian Academies of Sciences; Hungarian Scientific Research Fund(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)),Acknowledgments: The authors thank for the financial support of the bilateral project between the Hungarian and Slovenian Academies of Sciences.

Economic sociologists have carefully studied the 'defuturizing' technologies devised by private actors, but have tended to neglect the increasingly pivotal part played by central banks. Political economists have had more to say on central banks, but have focused on institutional issues rather than on the concrete practices of central banking. Making an original contribution to both literatures, this paper traces the construction and subsequent evolution, up to 2007, of the European Central Bank's communicative apparatus. Drawing on official documents and on interviews with both ECB staff and market participants, the paper shows how this apparatus created the conditions for the formation and coordination of private sector expectations. The insights from this empirical analysis into the performative dimensions of 'credibility' and 'knowledge' in monetary governance contribute directly to ongoing debates about the recent extension of the ECB's communicative apparatus through forward guidance and quantitative easing.","[Braun, Benjamin] Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Paulstr 3, D-50676 Cologne, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Braun, B (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Paulstr 3, D-50676 Cologne, Germany.",b.braun@mpifg.de,,"Braun, Benjamin/0000-0002-5186-5923","Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate 'Globalisation, the EU and Multilateralism'","Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate 'Globalisation, the EU and Multilateralism'","This work was supported by the Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate 'Globalisation, the EU and Multilateralism'.",,102,52,54,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The main factors for the evaluation of city tourism competitiveness were selected following the logic of the conceptual model of city tourism competitiveness. The importance of internal and external environment factors was estimated in form of weight coefficients through the analysis of expert evaluation results. According to the expert assessment results external and internal environment factors have almost the same importance. Most important factors of external environment affecting city tourism competitiveness are: status of resort, state's monetary policy, education system. Internal environment factors such as travel agencies, theater, zoo are most important. For the further evaluation the quantitative measures of the analyzed city tourism competitiveness factors should be chosen in order to calculate the city tourism competitiveness index.

Most of the academicians and practitioners assent to the idea that the effectiveness and efficient managing of a company significantly depends on the leader's character. Good management strengthened by the charismatic leader secures order and consistency in daily activities of an organization and motivates employees to strive for the best possible result. It is interesting to distinguish that the personnel employed in the cultural organization are as well propelled by the content of actions that sometimes hardly fits in the traditional management theories. In the cultural organization, the traditional management processes are enriched by the cultural and art processes including inspiration, concept purification, elevating performances etc. Therefore, the main objective of the article is to disclose the relevance of leadership in the cultural organization. In order to reach the objective, the following tasks have been set out: firstly, to analyse the leadership phenomenon in general; secondly, to set a special focus on the cultural organization; thirdly, to research a case of Kaunas Biennial by disclosing the relevance of leadership in different management levels. The case study of the Kaunas Biennial clearly unveils the relevance of leader's characteristics managing the cultural organization, since the managers of such type of organizations quite often do not have any financial instruments to motivate their team members. The leader is obligated to possess characteristics of self-sacrifice and self-devotion in order to make people invest in one another and share all their best, i.e., competence, knowledge, experience, skills, visions, etc. Since teams may be created for a limited period of time in the cultural organization, i.e., until a particular project is implemented, the leader should serve as a catalyst promoting healthy, goal-oriented internal communication as an ongoing process.","[Dudenaite, Gintare; Nausedaite, Reda] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Dept Philosophy & Culture Studies, Muitines Str 12, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Pilinkus, Donatas] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Dept Business Econ & Management, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University; Vilnius University,"Dudenaite, G (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Dept Philosophy & Culture Studies, Muitines Str 12, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",gintare.dudenaite@gmail.com; donatas.pilinkus@khf.vu.lt; redute.lt@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,1,2,0,18,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The fourth proposition supplements these general discussions of the landscape of business with a focus on a specific business application: it works through the case of business strategy by discussing how insights from the international domain can be applied to the intranational domain in that field of business.","[Ghemawat, Pankaj] NYU, Management & Strategy, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Ghemawat, Pankaj] NYU, Stern Sch Business, Ctr Globalizat Educ & Management, New York, NY USA; [Ghemawat, Pankaj] IESE Business Sch, Global Strategy, Barcelona, Spain",New York University; New York University; University of Navarra; IESE Business School,"Ghemawat, P (通讯作者)，NYU, Management & Strategy, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10016 USA.",,,,,,,,52,3,3,0,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78441-739-0; 978-1-78441-740-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,5.0,28,,10.1108/S1571-502720150000028002,0.0,,,24,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2QT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380491300002,0

Double-cohort stand systems, such as seed-trees, shelterwood and many two-aged variations supporting natural seeding, are common silvicutural practices. This paper presents a unified economic approach integrating the most common management alternatives of a double-cohort forest resource in one generalized deterministic model. A three-dimensional problem is solved for regeneration age, overstory density and removal cut maximizing the land expectation value and analyzed in a comparative static analysis. The findings of the model analysis are discussed in a comparison with even- and uneven-aged management. In addition, the dynamic even-aged thinning problem is extended to two age-classes and solved.

The analysis assesses data from Boulder, Colorado, a city that has made substantial efforts to improve its multi-modal transportation infrastructure and services by investing in pedestrian, bicycle, and transit infrastructure and services. We aim to describe connections between supply and demand by measuring two phenomena: the extent of transportation infrastructure investments supporting pedestrian, bicycle, and transit modes made between 1990 and 2009 and the share of these modes during the same 20 years period. Results illustrate an overall increase in transit and bicycle mode share and a decrease in single occupancy vehicle share, with consistent pedestrian share. We conclude that Boulder's investments in improving mode choices through new infrastructure and services supporting non-automobile modes are associated with increasing share of non-automobile modes. This is despite national trends that indicate an increasing automobile mode share. Regardless of the reasons for the positive trends experienced in Boulder, the presence of robust pedestrian, bicycling, and transit infrastructure has clearly coincided with evolving travel preferences. Boulder therefore serves as an example for other cities desiring to focus on developing policies and infrastructure that expand the availability of non-automobile modes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Differences in efficiencies across different territories are seen as important policy targets by most of governments. Focus of the paper is dealing the problem of searching the efficient frontier and group of similar units using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. DEA is a suitable tool for selecting the appropriate benchmarking set (or reference set with respect to obtained efficient frontier) and understanding the implications of this choice for improving efficiency of decision making units, i.e. the European Union NUTS 2 regions based on their factor endowment identified by Regional Competitiveness Index 2013 (RCI2013) approach. Using DEA is supposed the way how to choose an optimal number of groups coming into efficient frontier analysis. Firstly it's necessary to estimate returns to scale orientation, to find the closest characteristics for a given region according to a previously specified criterion of similarity. After fulfilment this criterion and creating optimal groups of similar regions, it's possible to evaluate level of efficiency of homogenous groups. The idea laying behind this approach is that inefficient regions can learn more easily from those, that are more similar; and closer similarity may show for the inefficient regions how to achieve the improvement with less effort This could be tool of regional strategic management to identify strengths and weakness of individual region with respect to other ones. The main contribution of this paper is thus to determine efficiency scores based on the efficient projection to the frontier along both the input and output spaces simultaneously.","[Melecky, Lukas; Stanickova, Michaela] Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; University of Ostrava,"Melecky, L (通讯作者)，Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",lukas.melecky@vsb.cz; michaela.stanickova@vsb.cz,"Melecky, Lukas/AAY-7847-2021; Melecky, Lukas/A-8078-2015; Stanickova, Michaela/ABE-6334-2020","Melecky, Lukas/0000-0001-8889-6400; Melecky, Lukas/0000-0001-8889-6400; Stanickova, Michaela/0000-0001-6210-2377",,,,,8,0,0,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,112.0,121,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000011,0

Thus, the aim of the paper is to develop a model for dynamic evaluation of innovative activities of a company according to the market capacity for innovation. The authors postulate that the expediency of a product launch is determined by a ratio of two parameters: the level of novelty Delta N (N-new - N-absolete) and the time-to-market of the innovative product Delta t (more precisely, from development of the product to its mass production and sustainable sales). At the same time, the ratio Delta N/Delta t is an integral parameter that characterizes the creative ability level of both the producer and the consumer. This model has enabled to develop recommendation on evaluating strategic actions of the company, depending on preparedness of its specialists to exhibit the required innovative activities, corresponding with the market capacity for innovation that had been identified by the marketing subsystem. The research demonstrates that innovative activities of every company is one of the strategic aspects of a company's development and has a cyclic nature, depending on both the growth of the market capacity for innovation and the organizational-technological level of the company itself. The authors have defined that the suggested model for evaluating the innovative activities of the company ensures maintaining and enhancing its competitiveness on the basis of the continuous comparison of the market capacity for innovation with the existing and strategic capabilities of the company.","[Melnikov, Oleg; Zaytsev, Andrey] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Dept Engn Business & Management, Moscow 105005, Russia",Bauman Moscow State Technical University,"Melnikov, O (通讯作者)，Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Dept Engn Business & Management, 2nd Baumanskaya 5, Moscow 105005, Russia.",melnikov@creativeconomy.ru; zayand12@yandex.ru,"Zaytsev, Andrey/A-1772-2014",,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,323.0,332,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000033,0

Consumers are not fully informed, they are affected by changes in fashion trends, influenced by their environment, no matter if by family/friends or advertising. When making their decisions consumers must face a risk of purchase of a wrong product, dissatisfying their needs. This paper deals with consumer behavior in outdoor-clothing segment. Secondary research has revealed that outdoor clothing is very popular in the Czech Republic, used not only for outdoor activities. The universality of outdoor clothing enables people to wear such clothing also for their every-day activities. Several types of consumers have been defined depending on their attitude to outdoor activities; a questionnaire survey (n=338) has been employed. The most represented type of a consumer has been an individual with medium-intense relation to outdoor activities. The purchase of such consumer is influenced by several factors, including campaigns/discounts, material brand, clothing brand, fashion, every day use, recommendations offered by their family or friends. However, such consumer may not be finally satisfied with their purchase.","[Mracek, Pavel; Fojtu, Katerina] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Mrácek, P (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",fojtu@fbm.vutbr.cz,,"Fojtu, Katerina/0000-0002-1303-5881",,,,,11,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,1278.0,1284,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700127,0

The authors of this article recommend for the relevant institutions to pay attention to the development of the distinctive capabilities of food SMEs in Sri Lanka, as this may lead to the overall development of business in the food industry in this developing country.","[Mura, Ladislav] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius Trnava, Dept Publ Adm, Trnava 91701, Slovakia; [Buleca, Jan] Tech Univ Kosice, Dept Finance, Kosice 04001, Slovakia; [Hajduova, Zuzana; Andrejkovic, Marek] Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Quantitat Methods, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",University of SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava; Technical University Kosice; University of Economics Bratislava,"Mura, L (通讯作者)，Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius Trnava, Dept Publ Adm, Nam J Herdu 2, Trnava 91701, Slovakia.",ladislav.mura@gmail.com; jan.buleca@tuke.sk; zuzana.hajduova@euke.sk; marek.andrejkovic@euke.sk,"hajduova, zuzana/AAO-2368-2020; Buleca, Jan/D-8777-2016","Buleca, Jan/0000-0002-6613-2167","Scientific Grant Agency of Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic; Slovak Academy of Sciences [2/0004/12, 1/0381/13]","Scientific Grant Agency of Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic; Slovak Academy of Sciences(Slovak Academy of Sciences)","Processing of this article was supported by the Scientific Grant Agency of Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic and the Slovak Academy of Sciences under the grant VEGA No. 2/0004/12 and VEGA No. 1/0381/13.",,35,32,32,4,38,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Earlier views on participation focused mainly on adults, and at the same time the area of services for children and teenagers was based on the assumption that by involving adults (parents, teachers and social workers) the best interests of the child would automatically be represented. McNeish and Newman (2002) note that currently there is no longer a debate about whether to include children and young people in the decision-making process, but rather ways are being sought to find different approaches to participation which apply in different conditions and situations. In the Czech environment, however, it still seems that the involvement of children and teenagers in decisionmaking in the context of social service management is not routine. The text is very first of the outputs of the Czech-Swiss project, whose research and the practical aim is to analyze and transfer experience from children and teenagers participation in the Swiss social services. The goal of the essay is to review the academic and professional literature on the topic of participation of children and adolescents, especially from the domestic and Anglo-Saxon environment to establish conceptual framework and knowledge base for empirical research (which we do not present here).","[Navratil, Pavel] Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Social Policy & Social Work, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Navrátil, P (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Social Policy & Social Work, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic.",navratil@fss.muni.cz,"Navratil, Pavel/B-4345-2009","Navratil, Pavel/0000-0002-1619-0967",,,,,24,2,2,0,5,"UNIV SOUTH BOHEMIA CESKE BUDEJOVIC, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, 37005, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-536-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,87.0,92,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF6ZN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383863800013,0

Thus, ICT can facilitate inclusive growth by making education more accessible. This study, therefore, examines the role of ICT in facilitating school enrolment at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The baseline model for this investigation is a knowledge economy framework for which panel data for 32 SSA countries that spans from 2001 to 2012 is used. Using the system generalized method of moments (SGMM) technique, it was discovered that ICT played a more significant role in facilitating school enrolment at the secondary and tertiary levels of education unlike at the primary level.

The question why one region is more vulnerable to economic shock than other, impelled to analyze resilience notion in regional development context. Often used in engineering and ecological sciences, the notion of resilience is rapidly becoming part of the conceptual and analytical lexicon of regional economic studies. There is no universally agreed definition of regional resilience, as well as there is yet no theory of regional resilience as such. In this paper the multidimensional aspects of regional resilience notion will be revealed as well as proved the resilience is a dynamic feature insured regional uninterrupted development or fast enough recovery after economic shock occurred. The main purpose of the paper is to identify the specific aspects of resilience notion used in the regional development context.

On the other hand, extensive use of debt may introduce a higher risk for the investors, which may increase the interest rate and/or bring credit restrictions on the company. Utilization of traditional or modern capital structure theories assumes the proactive approach of companies towards the process of capital structure optimization. Companies may, however, exert rather a passive approach based on the utilization of industry standards for corporate indebtedness. The business sector is seen as one of the most significant elements in determining the degree of financial leverage. The sense of the use of industry standards is that the debt-equity ratios appropriate for other firms in a similar branch should be appropriate for the company as well. Industry standards can serve as a useful benchmark If the particular company is out of line, it can be perceived as conspicuous on the market However, it may prove difficult for an ordinary company to find concrete sectoral recommendations on the debt ratio. The aim of this paper is to make a proposal for specific industry standards of indebtedness for 14 business sectors structured according to the classification of CZ-NACE. The proposal is based on the results of two independent studies conducted by the author of this contribution. The first study was focused on the indebtedness of Czech companies and its development between the years 2006 and 2011; it was based on panel data analysis. The second study was aimed at identification and analysis of trends in the selection of sources of corporate financing in the Czech Republic in a similar period; it was based on a capital structure analysis performed on a sample of 100 randomly selected companies within each business sector. The outcome of this paper is a proposal for industry standards that might serve as a benchmark of the maximal value of the corporate debt ratio within the particular sector.","[Stryckova, Lenka] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Strycková, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic.",lenka.stryckova@tul.cz,"Stryckova, Lenka/L-2467-2015","Stryckova, Lenka/0000-0003-1108-4193",,,,,15,2,2,0,4,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,165.0,+,,,,,,3,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000016,0

Whereas there is no need to look for a model to price liquid exchange traded options, since their price is generally accepted by the demand and supply, for illiquid or even exotic options new efficient models are still developed. The current market practice is to obtain the implied volatility of liquid options as based on Black-Scholes type (BS hereafter) models. Since the BS model at one time moment can be related to a large set of IVs as given by different parameters (maturity/moneyness relation) of tradable options leading to IV curve or surface. Since there is no continuum of options with various parameters, the curve / surface must be obtained by suitable smoothing and interpolation. However, it can bring an arbitrage opportunity, if no-arbitrage conditions on state price density (SPD) are ignored. The focus of this paper is to study the behavior of IV and SPD for several kernel functions and with respect to different choices of bandwidth parameter h. Specifically, we show several interesting implications of the change of h on the violation of no arbitrage condition and the total area of SPD under zero.","[Tichy, Tomas] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Deptartment Finance, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic; [Kopa, Milos] Inst Informat Theory & Automat ASCR, Dept Econometr, Prague 18208, Czech Republic; [Vitali, Sebastiano] Univ Bergamo, Deptartment Management Econ & Quantitat Methods, Bergamo, Italy",Technical University of Ostrava; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of Bergamo,"Tichy, T (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Deptartment Finance, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",tomas.tichy@vsb.cz; kopa@karlin.mff.cuni.cz; sebastiano.vitali@unibg.it,"Kopa, Miloš/H-4481-2014; Tichy, Tomas/AAA-1564-2021; Vitali, Sebastiano/AAA-1712-2020; Tichy, Tomas/ABH-9773-2020","Kopa, Miloš/0000-0002-9438-4484; Tichy, Tomas/0000-0002-6503-5330; Vitali, Sebastiano/0000-0002-6984-4194;",,,,,8,1,1,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,201.0,208,,,,,,8,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000020,0

First, using empirical data from Berlin, London, Sydney and Santiago, it is shown that the proportion of walking as a function of travel distance approximately follows an exponential distribution. Then, probabilities of walking and expected walking distances are calculated under two alternative configurations -free vs constrained pedestrian crossing. Assuming an exponential distribution, we find that average walking distance increases by L/2 plus any extra walking distance due to the crossing itself (e.g., stairs, accessways to pedestrian overpasses), when pedestrian crossing is forced to be made every L metres. The model is applied in Santiago, on a road where a normal avenue was replaced by a segregated highway with pedestrian overpasses in specific locations to allow crossing. We show that the segregated facility decreases the probability of walking to places where walking distance has increased, worsening car dependency even for short trips. The greatest inconvenience is for people living directly adjacent to the highway, whose walking distance to cross the road is tripled on average. This is an estimation of the barrier effect produced by this type of segregated transport infrastructure. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Today, there is an increasing discussion of the effect of a new type of science that is postmodern with complex dynamic systems in all the sciences. In this changing stage of thinking paradigms, it is useful to examine the extent of economics articles by examining the frequency of the selected concepts (representing the new science) that are used in the most representative selected scientific database (the authors chose a representative database of research articles, i.e., Thomson Reuters (ISI) Web of Science). The aim of research is, after the conceptual overview of what are the main features of new science, what is the changing paradigm, and what are one of the key concepts in representing it, to explore how much (quantitative aspect) concepts are used in the economics articles (comparison with science in general articles) and to present paradigmatic changes reflections and plausible insights/perspectives of the future development of economics. Research methods are systematic and logical analysis of changes in science and main features of new science as well as empirical analysis of the quantity of the documents. The main conclusion is that, according to the analysis, from the total research articles (306,768) in Thomson Reuters (ISI) Web of Science (1990-2015(1)) database in science in general, which used the concepts representing the new science, 3.49% were research articles (10,734) in economics. At the moment, economics is in changing stage, and the authors believe that in the near future it will be more open, integrated and solving all difficult problems.

The expression of mobbing in employees' relations has been identified in the organizations of different activity type. The expression of mobbing in employees' relations has been identified in the organizations of different activity type. When comparing organizations of private and public sectors, the tendency that the expression of mobbing is more intensive in the private sector, especially in economical activities of agriculture and mining as well as querying, manifests. The hypothesis that mobbing is not only psychological but also managerial problem has been confirmed; it is more relevant for organizations of the private sector in Lithuania. This is influenced by poorly developed management culture and the lack of managerial knowledge, which is characteristic for management personnel. Lithuania as well as other post-Soviet countries has not performed the researches on mobbing phenomenon broadly and deeply by emphasizing managerial reasons of the phenomenon. The researches on mobbing disclose the 'sensitive' areas, which influence the internal climate of national capital's organizations, the development of their competitiveness and the improvement of the corporate country investment climate. The originality of this research is presupposed not only by the fact that the situation in private and public sectors has been surveyed but also that it has been tried to identify the spread of mobbing among different fields of professional activity. In the case of this research 21 fields of professional activity have been included. During the research higher than medium expression of mobbing has been identified in the field of people health care and social work, which consist of the organizations of both public and private capital (in which more significant mobbing intensity has been identified) in Lithuanian context. It would be relevant to elaborate the research in striving to disclose differences in the culture of organizations' management.

That is, we could more accurately assess the sustainability of a firm's profit and growth by considering both its financial outcomes and business relationships. The rationale of the suggestion is that firms which facilitate mutual profitability between themselves and their stakeholders are more likely to achieve cooperative relationships and consequently enjoy better financial performance and sustainable growth than those who pursue their profitability in an exclusive way. This study therefore suggests that principles of accounting should embrace not only the incomes of a firm and its consolidations (subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements) but also those of its stakeholders, such as suppliers.","[Yoo, Taeyoung; Nam, Giseok] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Coll Business, Seoul, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Yoo, T (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Coll Business, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [NRF-2013S1A3A2053799]; Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology(National Research Foundation of Korea); Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund","*A previous version of the paper was presented at the 2011 European Group for Organization Studies (EGOS), Gothenburg, Sweden.

Both approaches are compared to unrestricted VARs in terms of multivariate point and density forecast accuracy measures as well as event probabilities. The evidence suggests that BVARs and DSGE models produce accurate multivariate forecasts even for larger datasets. I also detect that BVARs are well calibrated for most events, while DSGE models are poorly calibrated for some. In sum, I conclude that both are useful tools to achieve parameter dimension reduction.

By focusing on the monthly data, this paper proposes the k-month kernel-weighted annualized rate (k-MKAR), which includes most existing growth rate measures as special cases. The proposed k-MKAR measure involves the selection of smoothing parameters that are associated with the accuracy and timeliness for detecting the change in business turning points. That is, the comparison base is flexible and is likely to vary for different series under consideration. A data-driven procedure depending upon the stepwise multiple reality check test for choosing the smoothing parameters is also suggested in this paper. The simple numerical evaluation and Monte Carlo experiment are conducted to confirm that our measures (in particular the two-parameter k-MKAR) improve the timeliness subject to a certain degree of accuracy. The business cycle signals issued by the Council for Economic Planning and Development over the period from 1998 to 2009 in Taiwan are taken as an example to illustrate the empirical application of our method. The empirical results show that the k-MKAR-based score lights are more capable of reflecting turning points earlier than the conventional year-on-year measure without sacrificing accuracy.

In this article we use a case study approach to measure and compare these costs during the deregulation of the Swedish railway system from 2000-2015. Our case studies confirm earlier research that vertical separation and the introduction of competition in the railway markets result in comparatively small direct transaction costs. Extraordinary transaction costs in the form of interrupted contracts are also a minor problem for the railway system as a whole but might create major problems for the affected region. Our research concurs with earlier research on the British railway system and a CER study that misalignment costs seem to be significantly bigger and more troublesome to handle than direct transaction costs. Railway maintenance costs in Sweden using competitive tenders are increasing four to five times faster than railway operations with no measurable improvement in performance. Transition costs have been and continue to be important in the deregulated Swedish railway system. First, procrastination in the form of delayed changes in the allocation of train paths results in misalignment costs that seem to be growing. Second, adjustment costs in the form of handouts to the former monopolist have been ten times higher than the costs for interrupted contracts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The cartel punishes suppliers who violate vertical restraints and members who defect in the key regional or product market where it hurts them the most. The cartel organizes sales embargoes to punish its suppliers and supply embargoes to punish its members. Cartels can leverage the targeted punishment strategy to induce good behavior across multiple product, regional, and vertical markets. We examine several episodes in which the association of retail pharmaceutical traders in India, acting as a cartel, imposes sales embargoes on select pharmaceutical firms and supply embargoes on its members, and we find evidence consistent with targeted punishment.

A building block of normative economics and social choice theory, and often borrowed by contemporary political philosophy, the principle has rarely been subjected to philosophical criticism. The paper objects to it on the ground that it applies indifferently to those cases in which the individuals agree both on their expressed preferences and on their reasons for entertaining them, and those cases in which they agree on their expressed preferences while differing on their reasons. The latter are cases of spurious unanimity', and it is normatively inappropriate, or so the paper argues, to defend unanimity preservation at the social level for such cases: thus the Pareto principle is formulated much too broadly. The objection seems especially powerful when the principle is applied in an ex ante context of uncertainty, in which individuals can disagree on both their probabilities and utilities, and nonetheless agree on their preferences over prospects.","[Mongin, Philippe] CNRS, 1 Rue Liberat, F-78350 Paris, France; [Mongin, Philippe] HEC Paris, 1 Rue Liberat, F-78350 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris,"Mongin, P (通讯作者)，CNRS, 1 Rue Liberat, F-78350 Paris, France.;Mongin, P (通讯作者)，HEC Paris, 1 Rue Liberat, F-78350 Paris, France.",mongin@greg-hec.com,,,,,,,22,41,44,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-2671,1474-0028,,ECON PHILOS,Econ.

The Objective of this paper is to elicit ways of building sustainable, low-carbon transport futures for such a system. Using stakeholder narratives as basis, this paper identifies the main driving forces shaping sustainable transport futures, develops four plausible transport scenarios for the MCMA; and assesses whether stakeholders frame driving forces in a certain way. Driving forces stakeholders identified focused especially on cooperation among political entities and negotiation levels with internal transport stakeholders. Further driving forces included regulatory framework of vehicle use, recognition of sustainable transport as political priority, and urban growth and planning. Four scenarios based on political cooperation and internal negotiation were generated using stakeholder narratives. Three stand out: Scenario 1, where both political cooperation and internal negotiation develop positively, leading to low-emission, sustainable transport futures in the city; Scenario 3, the 'worst' scenario, where neither political cooperation nor internal negotiation function, is frequently identified by stakeholders as the way it is now; and Scenario 4 with functioning political cooperation and a lack of internal negotiation is the most unstable scenario and would quickly collapse were it to develop. Overall, stakeholders framed driving forces as more political than technological (e.g. political cooperation was seen as more relevant than upgrading vehicle technologies). Consensus regarding this reached across institutional stakeholder categories. We found that stakeholders' views gave unique in-sights regarding how to build sustainable, low-carbon MCMA transport futures, including policy measures and interventions needed. MCMA scenarios developed reveal the need for common political ground as a priority to guide decision making towards sustainable, low-carbon transport futures for the MCMA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing data from 50 Pakistani autoparts suppliers, the findings suggest that industrial policy has been helpful in creating a local parts supply base and facilitating the entry of Japanese assemblers in the market. However, the implementation of the policy has been weak, and it is an arduous journey for the local suppliers to develop ambidextrous (exploratory and exploitative) learning capabilities. The findings also indicate that where local training and support from R&D institutions are weak, networking alone with foreign multinationals is not sufficient on its own to develop exploratory learning capabilities of local suppliers.

The act reinforced slave owners' property rights, but its effect diminished with distance to the North. Estimates suggest that prices in Northern slave states increased by up to 35 percent relative to Southern states because of the act. The paper's findings are robust to changes in sample restrictions, spatial composition effects, and placebo tests on the act's implementation date. The contention that the act had an effect on escape risk is supported by a reduction in rewards offered and the frequency of advertisements for runaways observed in newspaper advertisements from the time.","[Lennon, Conor] Univ Louisville, Louisville, KY 40292 USA",University of Louisville,"Lennon, C (通讯作者)，Univ Louisville, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.",,,,,,,,35,3,11,1,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

The causes of these delays are uncertain. This paper describes an economic experiment designed to test one popular hypothesis: that asymmetric information might be a contributing cause of observed settlement delays. Experimental results provide strong evidence that asymmetric information can delay settlements, increasing average time to settlement by as much as 90 percent in some treatments. This causal relationship is robustly observed across different bargaining environments. On the other hand, results do not obviously confirm all aspects of the game-theoretic explanation for this relationship and suggest that asymmetric information may be only one of several contributing causes of settlement delay.","[Sullivan, Sean P.] Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20580 USA",,"Sullivan, SP (通讯作者)，Fed Trade Commiss, Washington, DC 20580 USA.",,,"Sullivan, Sean/0000-0001-7634-2072",Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia; Olin Fellowship in Law and Economics from the University of Virginia School of Law; National Science Foundation [SES 0922513],Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia; Olin Fellowship in Law and Economics from the University of Virginia School of Law; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This paper has benefited from the thoughtful comments of Josh Fischman, Charlie Holt, Rich Hynes, Nathan Larson, Jeffrey O'Connell, John Pepper, and Kathryn Spier.

Similarly, spatial patterns of entrepreneurship are increasingly considered to relate to the nature of the culture present within particular places. However, the nature of these relationships remains relatively unexplored, and this study addresses some of the gaps through both a theoretical and an empirical examination of the association between sociospatial culture and entrepreneurship. It develops the notion of community culture, and drawing on an analysis of data from localities in Great Britain, it finds that a range of dimensions of sociospatial community culture relating to social cohesion, collective action, and social rules are significantly associated with local entrepreneurial activity. Generally, localities in more economically developed regions are found to display more individualistic and diverse cultures. It is concluded that the findings represent a significant challenge for policy making in less developed localities and regions, which generally have sociospatial cultures high in communal and collective values but low rates of entrepreneurship.","[Huggins, Robert] Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales; [Thompson, Piers] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Burton St, Nottingham NG1 4BU, England",Cardiff University; Nottingham Trent University; University of Nottingham,"Huggins, R (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales.",hugginsr@cardiff.ac.uk; piers.thompson@ntu.ac.uk,"Thompson, Piers/R-5828-2019","Thompson, Piers/0000-0003-1961-7441",,,,,125,35,37,2,58,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Logistics firms co-located in fresh produce logistics parks share knowledge, combine transport and storage capacities, and trade products more than logistics firms co-located in diverse logistics concentration areas.","[Van den Heuvel, Frank; Van Donselaar, Karel; De Langen, Peter; Fransoo, Jan] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Postbus 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands",Eindhoven University of Technology,"Van den Heuvel, F (通讯作者)，Eindhoven Univ Technol, Postbus 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands.",f.p.v.d.heuvel@tue.nl; k.h.v.Donselaar@tue.nl; p.w.d.langen@tue.nl; j.c.fransoo@tue.nl,"van Donselaar, Karel/AAY-4603-2020; Van den Heuvel, Frank/G-6992-2011; de langen, peter w/U-3588-2018; langen, peter d/G-3823-2011; Fransoo, Jan/A-1135-2011","de langen, peter w/0000-0002-7703-5370; Fransoo, Jan/0000-0001-7220-0851",,,,,45,5,5,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

At the same time, it can be observed that quite a lot of innovative concepts in transportation have been studied in detail. This paper assesses which chain impacts an innovation entails, what conditions will conduce actors to innovate, or prevent them from doing so, and finally also what governments can do to stimulate innovation. The present paper makes an application to innovation by seaport-related operators through a number of cases. For collecting the standardized information, use is made of existing documents as well as sector and project contacts on the cases at hand, on which a scientific review is performed. In order to draw meaningful conclusions from the set of cases, the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) technique is used. The analysis shows that no unique recipe for innovation success exists, but that four sub-groups of cases can be discerned which have common characteristics that consistently lead to innovation success, dealing respectively with the terminal operators, the shipping lines, infrastructure and the innovation champion. The findings are particularly relevant for those in business and in policy-making who are involved in implementing or promoting innovation.","[Vanelslander, Thierry; Sys, Christa; Carlan, Valentin] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Vanelslander, T (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",Thierry.vanels-lander@uantwerp.be,"Sys, Christa/S-4101-2018; Carlan, Valentin/AAV-8992-2020; Vanelslander, Thierry/I-6083-2015","Sys, Christa/0000-0001-5962-334X; Carlan, Valentin/0000-0001-7567-5764; Vanelslander, Thierry/0000-0001-5213-3444","BNP Paribas Fortis Chair on Transport, Logistics and Ports at the University of Antwerp","BNP Paribas Fortis Chair on Transport, Logistics and Ports at the University of Antwerp","The authors wish to thank Athena Roumboutsos, Claudio Ferrari, Alessio Tei, Giuliano Genevieve, Geraldine Knatz, Rosario Macario, Vasco Reis and Jasmine Siu Lee Lam for the data collection of port related innovation cases.

However, the concept of sustainable mobility can be understood in different ways by the stakeholders and the current practice of participation is often limited. This paper presents a framework which makes it possible to evaluate, compare and understand the ranking of the alternatives for small-scale urban and regional mobility projects, assessed on sustainability and stakeholder preferences. We apply rank correlation to detect synergies in evaluation outcomes, in order to understand if there is concordance between the rankings. We also analyse if the stakeholder preferences, calculated by the multi-actor, multi criteria analysis (MAMCA) were similar to the sustainability assessment by multi-criteria analysis (MCA). The results of the application of the framework on three demonstration projects indicate that most stakeholders have similar preferences compared to the project alternatives' ranking of sustainability and that any of the interventions would be more sustainable compared to the business as usual.

Using a sample of over 200,000 US households, we find that, relative to fuel costs, depreciation has a small effect on the amount that households drive.

An analysis of clothing absence in the context of social nudism reveals that the myth of the clothed body cannot easily be remythologized or adapted to suit individual preferences. Rather, social interactions in contemporary societies remain largely locked in material presence.

This research explores the motives, causes, and targets of consumer boycott behavior using content analysis of Twitter feeds. Additionally, human sentiment analysis is used to investigate the relationship between boycott motives and the emotional intensity of boycott messages. The findings from analyzing a sample of 1,422 tweets show that while human rights issues constitute the leading cause of boycotts, business strategy decisions and corporate failures are also frequent causes, with for-profit providers of products and services being the most common boycott targets. The results also indicate that although consumer boycott messages are more commonly motivated by instrumental motives, noninstrumental motives have higher emotional intensity. This study provides a deeper understanding of consumer boycott behavior, and offers implications for consumers and businesses.","[Makarem, Suzanne C.; Jae, Haeran] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Mkt, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University,"Makarem, SC; Jae, H (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Mkt, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",scmakarem@vcu.edu; hjae@vcu.edu,"Makarem, Suzanne C./AAG-2685-2020","Makarem, Suzanne C./0000-0001-9874-9789",,,,,58,79,89,2,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

With current theoretical arguments for the single-hub solution leaving little room for the kind of multi hub networks that exist nowadays, this paper sets up a formal model to explore the optimality of multi hub networks, with or without competition. It is shown that a single-hub or a fully connected network may not be the optimal network configuration, while a 2-hub configuration may be favored under certain circumstances. In addition, the paper shows that competition can also affect an airline's optimal choice of network: a 2-hub network can be preferable if a competitor enters the market. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This article contributes to the ongoing debate on path creation with a new analytical framework that specifies the formation of generic resources in embryonic industries. It suggests that path creation processes are not only conditioned by preexisting regional capabilities and technological relatedness but also by the way firm and nonfirm actors mobilize and anchor key resources for industry formation. Our framework elaborates on the early industry development phase, extending the focus on regional knowledge spillovers in evolutionary economic geography (EEG) literature with recent insights on industry formation dynamics from innovation studies. It understands early path creation as conditioned by four systemic resource formation processes-knowledge creation, investment mobilization, market formation, and technology legitimation- that can be mobilized both from inside or anchored from outside the region. The use and value of the analytical framework is illustrated by a case study on on-site water recycling technology (OST), based on interviews with 40 experts in three Chinese city regions. The findings suggest that, despite possessing the least favorable initial conditions, a sizable OST industry developed only in Beijing. This is explained based on the specific anchoring process of the four key resources in the early development stage of the industry. Our results imply that EEG would profit from incorporating a broader set of variables than knowledge-based relatedness in explanations of regional industrial path creation.","[Binz, Christian] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Binz, Christian] Harvard Univ, Sch Govt, Sustainabil Sci Program Kennedy, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Truffer, Bernhard] Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Social Sci, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Truffer, Bernhard] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Chair Geog Transit Urban Infrastruct, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",Lund University; Harvard University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); Utrecht University,"Binz, C (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.;Binz, C (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Govt, Sustainabil Sci Program Kennedy, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Truffer, B (通讯作者)，Eawag Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Social Sci, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.;Truffer, B (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Chair Geog Transit Urban Infrastruct, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",christian.binz@circle.lu.se; bernhard.truffer@eawag.ch,"Truffer, Bernhard/K-3366-2016; Coenen, Lars/ABE-5947-2020","Truffer, Bernhard/0000-0002-8635-0911; Coenen, Lars/0000-0002-5671-3988; Binz, Christian/0000-0002-6878-2606",,,,,115,183,205,8,210,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

A vector autoregression of the art price index, Johannesburg stock exchange all-share index, house price index, and South African government bond index were used. Results show that, when there are increased returns on the stock market in a preceding period and wealth increases, there is a change in the Citadel art price index in the same direction. No significant difference was found between the house price index and the art price index, or between the art and government bond price indices. The art market is also found to be inefficient, thereby exacerbating the risk of investing in art. Overall, the South African art market does not offer the opportunity to diversify portfolios dominated by either property, bonds, or shares.","[Botha, Ferdi; Snowball, Jen; Scott, Brett] Rhodes Univ, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",,"Botha, F (通讯作者)，Rhodes Univ, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",,"Snowball, Jen/D-8887-2017","Snowball, Jen/0000-0001-7497-6653",ERSA,ERSA,The paper benefited from the comments of an anonymous referee.

In this paper we use theories of social practice to develop insights into why this stubbornness might exist, and what might help accelerate transitions to bus- and cycle-commuting. By analyzing qualitative data about everyday mobility in two UK cities, we examine how the availability of the constituent elements of bus- and cycle-commuting practices is crucial for modal shift to occur, but they are often absent. We also draw attention to time-space contingencies that render recruitment to low-carbon commuting practices more or less likely, including how commuting is sequenced with other social practices and how the sites of these practices interact with the affordances, and spatial infrastructure, of bus- and cycle-commuting. These insights lead us to argue that choice and land use planning focussed policy initiatives designed to invoke modal shift need to coexist in integrated policy configurations with initiatives designed to reshape both mobility and non-mobility practices. This means addressing the structural barriers caused by the lack of availability of the elements that constitute bus- and cycle-commuting, and intervening in the timing and spatiality of a range of social practices so as to reduce the tendency for commutes to have spatial and temporal characteristics that militate against the use of bus and cycle modes.

The RD is triggered by the existence of an infrastructure as a threshold. Only then can we expect the long-term economic and regional effects. From the long-term view, the development of most regions is also associated with a surprising diversity. The reasons for growth or stagnation are very often indistinct, and in some cases they are even unidentifiable. Existing development is a materialized foot print of earlier economic activities and there is more about that, for example, in Quality of life in cities, (European Commission, 2013). We should understand the economics of RD as an account; an account of either poor or successful regional management. In other words, regional economics and management (E&M) is at its causal roots a proof of the right or wrong decision rules and their implementation. This article argues that the state of municipalities and of regions is only partly a hostage of the regional investment economy and that a non-negligible way to success is paved by decision making processes especially through the use of certain decision criteria. The paper aims to demonstrate that: a) an elementary decision rule determines the decision space determining both time and conceivable actions, (timing of innovations, use and functions of areas, implementation of particular investments, localization of research directions, market expansion, etc.); b) dispersion effects are around and outside the primary investment that generates the growth; c) the burnout effect of the initial investment exists and begins to act after a certain time period; d) fixing the time of the initial investment burnout is identifiable and can be calculated. Point c) and d) represent triggers for any need of new investments, usually called innovation, modernization, reconstruction etc.","[Beran, Vaclav] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Czech Tech Univ Prague, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Econ & Management,Fac Econ, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Dlask, Petr] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Econ & Management, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Czech Technical University Prague; Czech Technical University Prague,"Dlask, P (通讯作者)，Czech Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Econ & Management, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",dlask@fsv.cvut.cz; beran@fsv.cvut.cz,,"Beran, Vaclav/0000-0002-2364-5915",Technology Agency of the Czech Republic [TACR TD020040],Technology Agency of the Czech Republic,"This paper originated as part of research project TACR TD020040, TD020040 Tools for the Support of Technical-economic Activities, financed by the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic.",,31,3,3,0,14,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

To date, there has been even less focus on the distribution channel requirements of the National Park customers. The purpose of this study is to examine how the various distribution channels used by South African National Parks (SANParks) go towards satisfying the customers' distribution channel requirements and identifying whether there is any relationship between certain variables, such as gender or the frequency of channel use, and the level of satisfaction that customers experience with the various channels. Web-based and paper-based questionnaires are distributed to the customers who have used the SANParks distribution channels before. The results show that, although the SANParks website is the most frequently used channel for making a booking, it is not necessarily the channel with which customers are most satisfied; in fact, they are more satisfied with the satellite walk-in reservation offices and satellite call centres. While the majority of the research studies in the context of tourism distribution channels have shown the importance and popularity of electronic distribution channels among customers, this paper cautions SANParks not to assume the distribution channel requirements of their customers and urges them to continually assess their distribution strategies and to become more customer-focused in their approach.","[Douglas, Anneli] Univ Pretoria, Dept Tourism Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Douglas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Tourism Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,"Douglas, Anneli/0000-0003-2132-9123",,,,,89,3,4,1,7,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

These basic knowledge on usability concept create the article background in order to describe a proposed methodology for the global assessments of the ergonomics interventions in the case of industrial system.

Selection is often taken for granted and conceptualised as product market competition. We go beyond this view and distinguish between different types of selectionformal and socialand consider how these lead to different entities being selected. Formal selection relies on codified selection criteria and often applies in selection environments where processes are standardised and institutions formalised. Social selection relies on reputation, referrals and previous interactions in order to evaluate intangible properties of the entities being selected. We argue that firms compete in multiple selection environments, not limited to product markets, that different selection environments may rely on different types of selection and that this has profound implications for industrial dynamics.

Therefore, we examine the relationship between intellectual capital (measured using financial data through VAIC (TM)) and firm value creation (using the ROCE measure as the most appropriate value creation proxy in this context). Also, we control for the effect of firm size and leverage in this relation. We based our analysis on 2011 financial statements of 3311 Slovak SMEs operating in ten different industrial sections. The data have been obtained from a business information portal (CRIBIS Universal Register). To examine the relation between intellectual capital and value creation while accounting for industry effects we constructed a set of regression models and analysed the explanatory power of intellectual capital performance in firm value creation. Our results suggest, that intellectual capital performance represents a significant value creation driver in each of the examined industries, and its explanatory power exceeds in all cases but one the explanatory power of control variables. Therefore, our results confirm the paradigm of intellectual capital importance for value creation also in the context of small and medium size companies (SMEs) in Slovakia.","[Holienka, Marian; Pilkova, Anna; Kubisova, Miroslava] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Holienka, M (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",marian.holienka@fm.uniba.sk,"Pilková, Anna/AAD-9645-2019; Holienka, Marian/N-8162-2015","Holienka, Marian/0000-0002-8975-6116",,,,,32,4,4,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-21139-8; 978-3-319-21138-1,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,65.0,77,,10.1007/978-3-319-21139-8_5,0.0,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE5QC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373209100005,0

Relative GDP and per capita income have a significant positive and negative impact respectively on bilateral trade balance between China and Pakistan. Exchange rate does not have a significant impact on China-Pakistan bilateral trade balance in the sample considered here while one year lagged values of trade balance are found significant in predicting trade balance between these two countries. This study is the first attempt to model China-Pakistan bilateral trade balance till now up to the best of author's knowledge: Future studies can include a panel data set to model Pakistan's overall trade balance with all major countries which should definitely consider a larger and more heterogeneous data set.

Although a deterministic cost-benefit analysis indicated that this outgrower scheme would have a very satisfactory net present value (NPV), a Monte Carlo analysis using an integrated financial-economic-stakeholder model identifies a number of risk variables that could make this system unsustainable. The major risks include the variability of the real exchange rate in Zambia; the international price of paprika; and the farm yield rates. This analysis points out that irrigation systems are very important for both stabilising and increasing yields. The analysis also shows the limitations of loan financing for such outgrower arrangements when at the sector level it is difficult or even impossible to mitigate the risks from real exchange rate movements and changes in international commodity prices. This micro-level analysis shows how critical real exchange rate management policies are in achieving sustainability of such export-oriented value chains.","[Kabungo, Arkins M.; Jenkins, Glenn P.] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Northern Cyprus, Turkey; [Jenkins, Glenn P.] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Eastern Mediterranean University; Queens University - Canada,"Kabungo, AM (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Northern Cyprus, Turkey.",,"Jenkins, Glenn P./AAX-3438-2021","Jenkins, Glenn P./0000-0003-4416-0164",,,,,28,3,3,0,19,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

For this purpose we use a continuous-time Markov chain approximation with a finite state space. Essentially, we extend Markov chain filters to processes of higher dimensions. We assess forecastability of the models under consideration by measuring forecast error of model expected realized variance, trading in variance swap contracts, producing value-at-risk estimates as well as examining sign forecastability. We provide empirical evidence using two sources, the S&P 500 index values and its corresponding cumulative risk-neutral expected variance (namely the VIX index). Joint estimation reveals the market prices of equity and variance risk implicit by the two probability measures. A further simulation study shows that the proposed methodology can filter the variance of virtually any type of diffusion process (coupled with a jump process) with a non-analytical density function.

The research involved a long run analysis (of more than one century) of two cork producing firms operating in Spain and Portugal: Mundet & C.(a), Lda and Corticeira Amorim. One of these companies-Mundet-was closed down in the 1980s and the other-Corticeira Amorim-became, and still is, the leading firm worldwide in the cork industry. A detailed comparison of these two histories-one of failure, the other of success-allows an accurate identification of the determinants of successful internationalisation. This comparison is useful for understanding several characteristics of both firms and testing several hypotheses within the context of the theoretical approach to the internationalisation of family firms, as well as the location choices they made, which were an important cause of the opposing destinies of these two emblematic Iberian cork family firms.","[Lopes, Joao Carlos] ISEG, Dept Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Lopes, Joao Carlos] UECE Univ Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal; [Branco, Amelia] ISEG, Dept Social Sci, Lisbon, Portugal; [Branco, Amelia] GHES Univ Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal; [Parejo, Francisco; Rangel, Jose Francisco] Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Badajoz, Spain",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidad de Extremadura,"Lopes, JC (通讯作者)，ISEG, Dept Econ, Lisbon, Portugal.;Lopes, JC (通讯作者)，UECE Univ Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.",jcflopes@iseg.ulisboa.pt; ameliab@iseg.ulisboa.pt; fmparejo@unex.es; jrangelp@alumnos.unex.es,"Preciado, Jose Francisco Rangel/AAO-6690-2021; Moruno, Francisco Manuel FMP Parejo/E-8015-2016; Branco, Amélia/N-1106-2013","Moruno, Francisco Manuel FMP Parejo/0000-0002-5663-5078; Branco, Amélia/0000-0002-3672-8066",,,,,39,2,2,0,15,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27573-4; 978-3-319-27572-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-2,,,,,,417.0,440,,10.1007/978-3-319-27573-4_29,0.0,,,24,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429800029,0

In turn, school textbook supply costs are born either by the state or citizens directly or indirectly. In this paper we explore the evolution of the production and distribution system of school textbooks in several European countries and briefly compare dynamics and outcomes generated by different educational systems.

The empirical findings of the article indicate that in order to stimulate a stable and efficient banking system and influence the structure of loan portfolio, a well performing banking market, epitomized by the high MLP Score, is not sufficient. Equally important are the favourable macroeconomic environment and an adequate scale and universal profile of banks. Thus, the authors claim that as the CEE countries develop, not only size but also depth of the financial market matter for bank performance.","[Miklaszewska, Ewa; Kil, Krzysztof] Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Finance, Dept Finance, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Miklaszewska, E (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Finance, Dept Finance, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",uumiklas@cyf-kr.edu.pl; krzysztof.kil@uek.krakow.pl,"Miklaszewska, Ewa/HMP-7466-2023; Kil, Krzysztof/V-7346-2018; Miklaszewska, Ewa/W-9905-2018","Kil, Krzysztof/0000-0002-2575-7806; Miklaszewska, Ewa/0000-0003-2208-683X",,,,,36,4,4,0,2,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Family support forms to stimulate second, third, and further children born to a family have been initiated, including fiscal incentives and implementing the principle of the progressivity in state support and creating a support program for the treatment of infertility. In public the concept of fertility is closely linked to population statistics and a desired increase in the national birth rate. Depopulation is often defined as a threat to the development of Latvian society. In this paper fertility is explored in micro perspective. Likewise, the use of the concept itself has social and economic aspects that are essential for understanding fertility dynamics. The aim of this paper is to explore how ideas concerning socioeconomic are included in the fertility discourse in Latvia. This paper is based on doctoral research in progress. 30 semi-structured interviews (11 interviews with users of assisted reproduction techniques, 4 interviews with egg donors, and 15 expert interviews) are analyzed. All data was processed using Atlas.ti. The Foucauldrian 'archaeology of knowledge' methodology allows for the systematic study of knowledge, where knowledge is localized in discourse. Fertility as an object of knowledge is a fragmented and multi-sited phenomenon that outlines various aspects that define fertility and its management.","[Mileiko, Ilze] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Mileiko, I (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",ilze.mileiko@lu.lv,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,511.0,519,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200043,0

Since IIT is important in increasing the growth of an economy through trade earnings trade, therefore there is a need to study the determinants of IIT in Malaysia. This study is focused on the manufacturing sector especially the machinery and transport equipment (SITC 7) from 1994 to 2014. IIT is calculated by using the Grubel Lloyd (GL) index. Panel data is utilized in performing panel cointegration and panel Granger causality tests. The Hausman specification test shows that the fixed effect least square dummy variable (LSDV) model is better than the random effects model. These tests were used to determine the relationship between the levels of IIT and its determinants namely differences in per capita GDP, foreign direct investment, geographical distance and technological advancement.

The current economic crisis suffered, to varying degrees, in almost all of the European countries raises the question of whether in financial difficulties entrepreneurial intentions increase or not. Paradoxically, two aspects, among others, influence the entrepreneurial attitude: the perception of opportunities (opportunity-driven factor) and the lack of alternatives (necessity-driven factor). In this contribution, firstly an exhaustive analysis of the most relevant theories of entrepreneurship from the psychological perspective is offered. An excursus is made in order to deeply explain the Entrepreneurial Cognition concept which illustrates the different cognitive processes underlying the way we learn to see and act on opportunities and how decision making on entrepreneurship is made. Based on the exposed theories, subsequently, it is examined to what extent the present economic circumstances may affect entrepreneurial thinking among citizens of the European Innovation-driven economies (all of them under the EU28). Due to the capital importance of entrepreneurial activities for the socioeconomic stability and growth in every economical region and with the finality to support the ideas presented above, subsequently, statistical data are analyzed, which corroborates the relatedness of entrepreneurial intention and the perceived regional economic situation.","[Perez Alonso, Maria A.] Univ Appl Sci Joanneum, Dept Ind Management, Graz, Austria; [Carlos Sanchez, Jose] Univ Salamanca, Dept Social Psychol, Salamanca, Spain; [Maditinos, Dimitrios] Eastern Macedonia & Thrace Inst Technol, Dept Business Adm, Kavala, Greece",University of Salamanca,"Alonso, MAP (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Joanneum, Dept Ind Management, Graz, Austria.",azucena.perez-alonso@fh-joanneum.at; jsanchez@usal.es; dmadi@teikav.edu.gr,"Sánchez-García, Jose Carlos/IZE-5725-2023; Sánchez-García, Jose Carlos/B-3938-2010","Sánchez-García, Jose Carlos/0000-0002-2264-0696",,,,,33,2,2,1,12,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27570-3; 978-3-319-27569-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-1,,,,,,3.0,13,,10.1007/978-3-319-27570-3_1,0.0,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429900001,0

We allow cooperation between a public firm and a private firm through subcontracting in a Hotelling mixed-duopoly model. We find that when subcontracting is possible, the equilibrium without subcontracting is not socially optimal because subcontracting can lower total production costs. And if both firms engage in subcontracting, the existence of a public firm can guarantee the first best equilibrium, whether it is the low-cost firm or not. But when a private firm is the low-cost firm, it is more profitable for it to choose vertical foreclosure. And the consequent equilibrium is not socially desirable anymore.

The authors draw attention to the fact that the ratios which are based on the profit and loss statement may not always indicate the true picture of the company's solvency and financial stability because of the accrual basis, on which the profit and loss statement is based.

This relationship was confirmed in the past several crises. However, the impact of economic downturns on structural unemployment will depend on many factors. The aim of the paper is to decomposite unemployment and we try to estimate the rate of structural unemployment. We also made an effort to determine the effects of the crisis on economic performance and functioning of the labour market in the Visegrad group countries. The analysis showed considerable sensitivity of these economies to the development of the external environment (except Poland), mainly through an export channel the most affected was an industry sector, especially automotive industry. It seems to be important to have more diversified structure of the economy, mainly the exports. Quarterly data from the Eurostat LFS database in the period between 2000 and 2014 were applied. In order to estimate the trend of the unemployment rate's development was used Hodrick-Prescott filter. Data show that all observed economies recorded a low unemployment rate in a pre-crisis period and they had to face worsened labour market performance during and after the crisis. Our results suggest that structural component seems to be the most important component of total unemployment. Moreover, it has decreased in these countries, except Hungary. We also compared our approach with an OECD approach which is based on employment of Kalman filter. Results suggest that both methods, although they are based on different processes, lead to analogous results.","[Tvrdon, Michal] Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Econ & Publ Adm, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Tvrdon, M (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Econ & Publ Adm, Opava, Czech Republic.",tvrdon@opf.slu.cz,"Tvrdon, Michal/J-4806-2012","Tvrdon, Michal/0000-0001-9029-883X; Majerova, Ingrid/0000-0002-0835-9128",Student Grant System within Influence of Regional Disparities on Business Environment,Student Grant System within Influence of Regional Disparities on Business Environment,The research behind this paper was supported by the Student Grant System within the grant SGS/7/2012 Influence of Regional Disparities on Business Environment.,,40,13,13,2,16,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

France therefore abolished usury ceilings on loans to microenterprise in an effort to increase financing for microentrepreneurs. This should have led to an increase in interest rates and increase in microcredit. However, we do not find any increase in interest rates and this is therefore a paradox. The paper provides a brief literature review and the salient features of the legislative changes in France. It follows this up with a presentation of interest rate movements. The discussion of possible explanations of the paradox includes classical market analysis (global interest rates, money supply, and competition), behavioral and institutional analysis (guarantees, Basel II and risk taking, legal concept of abusive support, protection for over-indebtedness, information asymmetry and limited liability) and softer institutional reasons (religion, risk-taking culture).","[Ashta, Arvind; Attuel-Mendes, Laurence] ESC Dijon Bourgogne, CEREN, Burgundy Sch Business, Banque Populaire Chair Microfinance, F-21006 Dijon, France; [Ratsimalahelo, Zaka] Univ Franche Comte, UFR Sci Econ CRESE, F-25030 Besancon, France",Burgundy School of Business; Universite de Franche-Comte,"Ashta, A (通讯作者)，ESC Dijon Bourgogne, CEREN, Burgundy Sch Business, Banque Populaire Chair Microfinance, 29 Rue Sambin,BP 50608, F-21006 Dijon, France.",arvind.ashta@escdijon.eu; Laurence.Attuel-Mendes@escdijon.eu; zratsima@univ-fcomte.fr,"Ashta, Arvind/ADJ-8303-2022","Ashta, Arvind/0000-0002-6160-5375",,,,,61,2,2,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

One of the main solutions for implementing energy efficiency is the optimization of train speed profiles to minimize tractive energy consumption. From a transportation systems point of view, the definition of optimized speed profiles should consider their possible impact on rail traffic flows, in order to evaluate their feasibility. To do so, an innovative optimization framework for the definition and the evaluation of energy efficient speed profiles, based on supply design modelling, is proposed. The framework operates on two levels: the first level generates energy efficient speed profiles with respect to timetable constraints, infrastructure characteristics and rolling stock features, and the second simulates these speed profiles on the rail network within the specific rail traffic conditions. Through this new integrated view, the evaluation of the proposed optimal speed profiles can fully take into account the operational requirements of the services, such as trains scheduling, absence of or small allowance for delays and respect for buffer times for passenger transfer at connecting stations. A numerical example based on a calibrated simulation model of the suburban S-Bahn S9 line that operates in the Canton of Zurich shows how energy efficient speed profiles can be defined considering the rail traffic influences, thus increasing the quality of the solutions.

This study is based on a unique data set that includes activity and travel diaries collected from three Arab communities in the Galilee region of Israel. Through descriptive statistics and nonlinear structural equations modeling, we found that gender plays an important role in both activity participation and travel behavior in these communities. Women tend to travel less than men in terms of both number of tours, defined as chain of trip segments that start and end at home, trips, and total time spent traveling. Women tend to work more within their communities and to conduct more of their activities by walking; they are also the ones who make more child-serving stops, which affect their travel patterns. Women tend to travel by car more as passengers, whereas men tend to be drivers. Those who made more tours also tended to make more complex tours, with more stops per tour, although, in general, complex tours are not substituted for making additional tours. People who work outside the community and make complex tours are more likely to drive, as the car is needed for these types of trips, which men make more than women. From a policy perspective, these findings suggest that public transportation services are needed to help overcome gender differences in travel behavior. Improving transit service for school trips and improving urban design through a friendlier environment, especially for children, will beneficially affect the complexity of women's daily activity patterns and their quality of life.

In the model, there are gains to specialization and team production, but specialization requires communication and coordination between team members. Individuals accumulate cognitive skills in schools when young. As adults, they decide whether to work as a manager or a worker in a firm or become a teacher in a school. Individuals with more communication skills will become either managers or teachers and earn higher wages. Each manager manages several workers and each teacher teaches several students, with their span of control being determined by their communication skill. These individuals also invest discretely more in education than marginally different individuals who become workers.

The policy mix that has emerged can be usefully conceptualized as social neoliberalism, combining relatively orthodox neoliberal economic policies and retrenchment of the protective welfare state (e.g. labour market institutions) with a significant expansion, both in terms of public spending and population coverage, of the productive welfare state (e.g. public health care). Therefore, social neoliberalism as a development model is distinct both from social democracy and orthodox neoliberalism. Its rise in Turkey during the 2000s is arguably best understood with reference to the interests of the AKP's support coalition, the salience of inequalities in access to public services, and the disconnect of social policy-making from civil society mobilization. Turkey's experience with social neoliberalism provides an important reference point for theorizing the social turn' that since the 2000s has occurred in many late-developing countries with now maturing welfare states, including Brazil, South Africa, Mexico and Chile.","[Dorlach, Tim] Koc Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, TR-34450 Rumelifeneri Yolu, Sariyer Istanbu, Turkey",Koc University,"Dorlach, T (通讯作者)，Koc Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, TR-34450 Rumelifeneri Yolu, Sariyer Istanbu, Turkey.",tdorlach13@ku.edu.tr,,"Dorlach, Tim/0000-0002-3916-0082",,,,,56,40,45,2,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Using changes in real benefits under ten disability benefit programs in Canada as an identification strategy and Statistics Canada's National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) as the data source on child outcomes, we find strong evidence that higher benefits lead to improvements in children's cognitive and non-cognitive development, as measured by math scores in standardized tests, hyperactive symptoms, and emotional anxiety behavior.

This research uses empirical analysis of travel survey data to estimate the relationship between built environment characteristics and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in California. The work improves upon past research in two key ways. First, it employs a novel approach to control for residential self-selection, categorizing neighborhoods into types and using these as the alternatives in a predictive model of neighborhood type choice. Second, it focuses on exploring and understanding heterogeneity in the relationship between the built environment and VMT across two dimensions neighborhood type and travel purpose. The results show that VMT sensitivity to built environment characteristics does depend on both neighborhood type and the purpose of travel, in ways that are intuitive but had not previously been estimated. This calls into question the usefulness of prior research that provides only single point estimates of the relationships between travel choices and the built environment. Though these relationships may be small on average, this work shows that for certain trip types and in certain neighborhood types, the built environment is strongly related to travel choices.

Since 2011, when the adoption of IFRS by listed firms became mandatory, more unlisted firms have adopted IFRS voluntarily, improving the transparency and reliability of their accounting information. Using the sample of unlisted firms with 3year study period of preand post-IFRS adoption, we examine whether IFRS voluntary adopters show both lower discretionary accruals and the cost of debt than those of non adopters, and whether both discretionary accruals and the cost of debt of voluntary adopters decrease after IFRS adoption. We employ the Heckman's two stage approach in order to avoid sample selection bias and cross sectional pooled OLS regression with or without clustering test. We complimentary report the results from firm-fixed effect panel model to generalise the results. The results show that firms which adopt IFRS have a higher earnings quality and a lower cost of debt that those which do not. These findings suggest that when unlisted firms issue bonds and borrow money, IFRS adoption contributes to decreasing the cost of debt.","[Lee, Young Hwan] Kumoh Natl Inst Technol, Dept Business Adm, Gumi 730701, Gyeongbuk, South Korea; [Kang, Sun A.] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taejon 305764, South Korea; [Cho, Sang Min] Hannam Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taejon 306818, South Korea",Kumoh National University Technology; Chungnam National University; Hannam University,"Kang, SA (通讯作者)，Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Business Adm, 99 Daehak Ro, Taejon 305764, South Korea.",leeyh@kumoh.ac.kr; sunakang@cnu.ac.kr; chosmcpa@hanmail.net,,,Kumoh National Institute of Technology; Korea Research Foundation - Korean Government [NRF-2012S1A5A8024250],Kumoh National Institute of Technology; Korea Research Foundation - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),This work was supported by the Kumoh National Institute of Technology; and the Korea Research Foundation Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2012S1A5A8024250).,,56,9,10,1,40,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

To this end, we develop a simple dynamic principal-agent model where both players may have feelings of altruism or spite toward each other. The contract may contain two types of incentives for the agent to work hard: a bonus and a threat of dismissal. We find that altruism undermines the credibility of a threat of dismissal but strengthens the credibility of a bonus. Among others, these two mechanisms imply that higher altruism sometimes leads to higher bonuses, whereas lower altruism may increase productivity and players' utility in equilibrium.","[Dur, Robert; Tichem, Jan] Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Dur, Robert; Tichem, Jan] Erasmus Univ, Tinbergen Inst, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Tinbergen Institute; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Dur, R (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",dur@ese.eur.nl; jan.tichem@acm.nl,"Dur, Robert/J-4142-2012","Dur, Robert/0000-0001-9081-4179",,,,,44,22,26,1,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

To perform such study, firstly the analysis of the elasticity was done to assess the sensitive of traffic demand. Then emission costs were estimated considering an integrated approach of environmental and human health impacts. Two motorway groups were analyzed: one originally built with both conventional and electronic toll systems (G1); and another recently equipped with non-stop electronic tolls (G2). The results show that the elasticity of the system changes with the fluctuation prices, particularly influenced by toll prices variation. During the analysis period, traffic volumes decreased (8-11% in G1, and 15-41% in G2). About 75% of traffic flow shows a high statistical significance correlation (p < 0.05) with toll prices, which highlight the impact of toll prices. Differences between emission costs can be close to 50% in those motorway groups. Nevertheless, due the absence of data in alternative routes, the obtained results show only the potential maximum environmental gains of these policies in motorways. This limitation is very important in the quantification of the environmental global impacts. Non-toll roads are usually characterized by slower speeds and higher emissions. Therefore the above mentioned gains can be converted, in these cases, in losses. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","[Fontes, T.; Pereira, S. R.; Bandeira, J. M.; Coelho, M.

Building networks among nonprofits, government agencies, school districts, and others, private foundations such as the Gates, Broad, and Walton family foundations are fundamentally restructuring American K-12 education. The Common Core State Standards, teacher evaluation, and charter schools are a few of the initiatives these funders are backing. The massive influx of private money into education policy and its influence over public education raises questions around the proper role of philanthropy in a democracy. In a society with increasing wealth inequality, should the economic elite be able to gain further power to shape social institutions through giving? Are there or should there be any limits to this power? Examining specific trends and events in education philanthropy over the last 10 years, this article identifies key players in philanthropic education reform and argues that philanthropy in education is now playing a policy-making rolewithout checks and balancesthat is qualitatively and quantitatively different than before.

This research assumes the amount of NOx and tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions and gasoline use reduction as the benefits and the purchase costs, infrastructure expenses, and maintenance costs of alternative vehicles as the costs of switching internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to alternative energy vehicles. In addition, this study conducts a sensitivity analysis considering cost reductions in FCV and EV production and increasing costs for CO2 abatement as well as increasing gasoline prices. In summary, the results show that the diffusion of FCVs is not economically beneficial until 2110, even if the FCV purchase cost decreases to that of an ICE vehicle.

It combines a quantitative analysis of the R&D investment of manufacturers of transport equipment, transport service providers and the constructors of transport infrastructure for the years 2008 and 2011 with a qualitative assessment of their incentives to innovate. The latter takes into account sector-specific innovation systems, their distinct market environments and the products and services produced. The findings show that, although the transport sector as a whole is the largest industrial R&D investor in the EU, there are important differences in the level of innovation activities carried out by the highly heterogeneous sub-sectors. These differences seem to be of systemic nature: they are found consistently in the quantitative analysis and the theoretical considerations.

Using large variations in language composition in Canadian cities from the 2001 and 2006 Censuses, we show that the differences in the knowledge of English by immigrant allophones (i.e., the immigrants with a mother tongue other than English and French) in English-majority cities are mainly due to sorting across cities. Instead, in French-majority cities, learning plays an important role in explaining differences in knowledge of French. In addition, the presence of large anglophone minorities deters much more the assimilation into French than the presence of francophone minorities deters the assimilation into English. Finally, we find that language distance plays a much more important role in explaining assimilation into French, and that assimilation into French is much more sensitive to individual characteristics than assimilation into English. Some of these asymmetric assimilation patterns extend to anglophone and francophone immigrants, but no evidence of learning is found in this case.","[Ortega, Javier] City Univ London, CEP LSE, CReAM, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Ortega, Javier] IZA, London, England; [Verdugo, Gregory] Banque France, Paris, France; [Verdugo, Gregory] IZA, Paris, France",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; City University London; European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Ortega, J (通讯作者)，City Univ London, CEP LSE, CReAM, London EC1V 0HB, England.",javier.ortega.1@city.ac.uk; gregory.verdugo@banque-france.fr,"Verdugo, Gregory/AAF-1279-2020","Verdugo, Gregory/0000-0003-0289-5146; Ortega, Javier/0000-0001-5902-0848",CEPREMAP's Programme Travail,CEPREMAP's Programme Travail,"We would like to thank two anonymous referees, the editor (Klaus Zimmermann), Jan Fidrmuc, Alex Lembcke, Barbara Petrongolo, and seminar participants at the CREAM-TARGET Conference on Immigration (UCL), Universidad de Oviedo, EEA, CEP (LSE), Brunel, City University London, and WPEG for interesting comments.

J,"Bradford, A",,,,"Bradford, Anu",,,Exporting standards: The externalization of the EU's regulatory power via markets,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Regulation; Brussels effect; California effect; European union; Regulatory power; Regulatory race,COMPETITION; GOVERNANCE; BRUSSELS; EUROPE; IMPACT; POLICY; TRADE,"This Article examines the unprecedented and deeply underestimated global power that the EU is exercising through its legal institutions and standards, and how it successfully exports that influence to the rest of the world. Introducing the notion of the Brussels Effect, the Article shows how market forces alone are sufficient to convert EU standards into global standards. Without the need to use international institutions or seek other nations' cooperation, the EU has a strong and growing ability to promulgate regulations that become entrenched in the legal frameworks of developed and developing markets alike, leading to a notable Europeanization of many important aspects of global commerce. This Article identifies and explains the precise conditions for and the specific mechanism through which this externalization of EU's standards unfolds. Enhanced understanding of this dynamic explains why the EU is currently the only jurisdiction that can wield unilateral influence across a number of areas of law, ranging from competition and privacy to health and environmental regulation. This understanding also helps explain why certain regulations can be externalized via markets while others rely on the EU's ability to exert influence through its political agency. The Article further disputes the notion that the EU's ability to externalize its rules would reflect regulatory imperialism, as critics have suggested. Instead, it argues that the EU's external regulatory influence has emerged largely as an inadvertent byproduct of its internal goal to create and strengthen the single market. The EU's regulatory authority has been further solidified as the markets, other states, and international institutions have been able to do little to constrain Europe's global regulatory power. In the end, as much as the rise of the EU's regulatory power is a product of its pursuit of internal goals, any limits to this power are likely to stem from within the EU itself.

Consideration of these risks weakens the case for punishing attempts. Specifically, attempts ought to be punished less frequently than suggested in previous literature, and even when the punishment of attempts is desirable, they typically ought to be punished less severely than accomplished crimes. Purely deterrence related rationales as well as rationales based on costs associated with wrongful convictions support this conclusion. The presence of wrongful conviction costs also implies that a degree of under-deterrence is optimal and that incomplete attempts ought to typically be punished less severely than complete attempts.

It shows that the legal context and company-specific characteristics play a crucial moderating role for contestability. In contrast to previous research, we find that contestability plays a less relevant role in family firms.

The initial argument is that the Olympics, besides being a cyclically recurring tournament ritual in the sports field, constitute a singular flagship project in those fields connected to the preparation and legacy implementation of the event. Conceptually the paper connects, therefore, the literature on field-configuration with a particular branch of project management research. Empirically it builds upon selected results of a major case study of the London Summer Games in 2012, in particular of the massive program of venue construction and urban regeneration linked to this event. The authors maintain that the cross-field-configuring capacity of a global and publicly visible venture like the Olympics is based on the interaction of its public prominence and the performance of involved actors. However, the configuration across field boundaries exhibits a specific temporality. For one thing, this is based on the singularity of the flagship projects within their fields. For another, it refers to the timescale in which the actual performance takes place.","[Thiel, Joachim; Grabher, Gernot] HafenCity Univ, Urban & Reg Econ Studies, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Thiel, J (通讯作者)，HafenCity Univ, Urban & Reg Econ Studies, Hamburg, Germany.",joachim.thiel@hcu-hamburg.de,"Grabher, Gernot/C-4875-2013","Grabher, Gernot/0000-0002-2911-9254",,,,,72,15,16,2,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

The poor performance of macroeconomic models during the Great Recession of 2008 has forced many economists to reexamine macroeconomic theories and search for credible alternatives to the agent-based and general-equilibrium models now currently used by most economists. This article derives a new category of macroeconomic model and applies it conceptually to explain the causes of economic crises. This model, known as the indeterministic balance sheet plus (IBS+) model, is a special breed of accounting models. It takes an indeterministic view of future balance sheets. This article proposes a classification of causes of economic crises using IBS+ models to analyze balance sheets of key economic sectors. Most economic crises are caused by mismanagement of balance sheets by key economic players, not by any fundamental flaw of capitalism. The frequency of economic crises can be minimized by proper risk management practices, but economic crises can never be completely eliminated. Historically, treating mismanagement of balance sheets as the main cause of economic crises is a generalization of Austrian business cycle theory, Fisher's debt deflation theory, and Minsky's financial instability hypothesis.",,,,jjwinterpretation@gmail.com,,,,,,,60,0,0,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

This analysis is relevant to answer the question of how deterrence and welfare in a combined criminal-administrative enforcement system compare with an enforcement system relying on criminal penalization only. This is an important question given the observed shift towards two-track penalization systems, combining administrative and criminal penalization, for environmental enforcement in the European Union.

This paper seeks to bridge the gap between the inaccuracies in demand and cost estimations and hence the evaluation of transport infrastructure projects. Currently, research within this area is scarce and scattered with no common agreement on how to embed and operationalise the huge amount of empirical data that exist within the frame of Optimism Bias. Therefore, a full version of the UNITE-DSS model, which contains an integrated approach to socio-economic analysis, risk-based simulation and database information, will be presented. The procedure is based upon quantitative risk analysis and Monte Carlo simulation and conventional cost-benefit analysis converting deterministic benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) into stochastic interval results. A new data collection (2009-2013) forms the empirical basis for any risk simulation embedded within the so-called UP database (UNITE project database), revealing the inaccuracy of both construction costs and demand forecasts. Accordingly, the UNITE-DSS approach is therefore tested and further explored on a number of fixed case examples to investigate the performance and robustness of the traditional CBA results. Ultimately, a conclusion and perspectives of the further work will be set out. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The short-run effect of bank concentration is tested with the generalised method of moments system and the instrumental variable approaches, and the long-run effect is tested with the fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) approach. The empirical analysis shows that the bank concentration is an insignificant factor on the NPLs, either in the short or in the long-run of the panel data set. On the other hand, individual FMOLS results reveal that the bank concentration reduces the NPLs in Estonia, Latvia, and Slovakia, and increases the NPLs in Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovenia in the long-run. According to this evidence, the bank concentration does not reduce the credit risk for all of the CEE countries. Therefore, bank concentration may not affect systemic stability in the CEE countries. These findings are also robust in controlling several factors, including additional control variables. As a result, the relationship between the bank concentration and the NPLs, in regards to the CEE countries, is ambiguous.","Istanbul Kemerburgaz Univ, Sch Econ & Adm Sci, TR-34217 Bagcilar, Turkey",Altinbas University,"Çifter, A (通讯作者)，Istanbul Kemerburgaz Univ, Sch Econ & Adm Sci, Mahmutbey Dilmenler Cad 26, TR-34217 Bagcilar, Turkey.",atilla.cifter@kemerburgaz.edu.tr,,"Cifter, Atilla/0000-0002-4365-742X",,,,,44,23,24,1,34,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The construction industry plays a critical role in the national economy and in its long-run socio-economic development. It is responsible for the development of housing, facilities and infrastructures necessary for national social and economic development. The industry's operation systems therefore need to be revitalized in order to realize expected and even greater economic gains from its activities. Innovation is the most generally accepted and recommended strategies for re-engineering any economic sector in order to meet the customers' demand, market competition and other challenges of the modern businesses. The roles of the built environment professionals (i.e., the consultants) in the realization of construction projects can never be over-emphasized as they are responsible, especially, in its conceptualization, planning and execution and also in the re-engineering of construction projects. Existing literatures show that innovation studies in the construction industry have been generally organisation-based and the few that are firm-specific do not address some critical issues on innovation practices in this vital sub-sector (consultancy services) of the industry. The paper is therefore aimed at enhancing the understanding and improving innovation practices among consultancy firms in the Construction Industry. The objectives of the study are to review existing literatures on the concept of innovation and its practices and to bring into highlight the need for formalization of innovation practices to achieve greater benefits. The arguments on this paper are derived from PhD research work (in progress) on Assessment of Factors Affecting Innovation Practices among Consultancy Firms in Abuja. The paper concludes that innovation and its formalization is essential for a firm willing to offer satisfactory services to its various clients and become relevant or sustain its relevance in the globalized and competitive market.","[Adinoyi, Y.

Organizational values are a reflection of individual values of founder or founding members of the organization. Through time organizational values are shaped by every member of the organization and by events that shape the organization. On the other hand competencies of managers are not shared by the whole organization though they do influence the way managers run their organizations and through this also how organizations work. Based on the findings of previous studies a model for measuring the influence of organizational values on managers' competencies was proposed. More specifically, by conducting a preliminary study a model was created that discusses the influence of six most commonly stated organizational values on the matching competencies. To this end research question has been proposed: What is the level of correlation between organizational values and matching competencies of managers? The paper-and-pencil survey was carried out in the travel and leisure industry, where 1,100 employees were surveyed. The 388 participants who filled out the questionnaire represent a 35.27% yield of surveys sent out and 4.26% of the population of this industry in Slovenia. We have determined that there is a statistically significant influence of organizational values on matching competencies. This finding clearly indicates that organizational values have a strong influence on managers' competencies. This also to some extent supports the idea of managing by values where managing of organizations is focused on organizational values and every decision is done through the scope of these values.","[Gorenak, Mitja] Univ Maribor, Fac Tourism, Maribor, Slovenia; [Ferjan, Marko] Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor; University of Maribor,"Gorenak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Tourism, Maribor, Slovenia.",mitja.gorenak@um.si; marko.ferjan@fov.uni-mb.si,"Gorenak, Mitja/ABB-9784-2020; Gorenak, Mitja/AAV-6111-2021; Gorenak, Mitja/GQH-2447-2022","Gorenak, Mitja/0000-0002-8786-1959; Gorenak, Mitja/0000-0002-8786-1959",,,,,55,9,13,4,28,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Therefore, this study investigates the impacts of the unfair trade between large retailers and suppliers and the market-dominant market expansion against small and medium retailers out of consumers' store choice factors. This study analyzed negative information (news) on. large retailers (Lotte Mart, E-Mart and Homeplus) based on the monthly data over the past five years from 2008 t0 2012 and also analyzed the correlation between dependent variables that are likely to affect sales through large retailer economic index, special demand (traditional holidays) index and holiday (Saturdays, Sundays, public holidays) index. This study performed Cronbach's alpha reliability analysis and factor analysis for the measurement variables. This study conducted a correlation analysis on the time lag of the factors that have an impact on the negative information and sales of large retailers in order to analyze how consumers respond to the choice of large retailers' store (store sales) when they perceived negative information about the unethical behaviors of large retailers. Together with the above analysis, this study also conducted a multiple regression analysis in order to derive a result that the perception on negative information affects sales (store choice). Unfair and negative information on large retailers appeared significant for the hypothesis that sales will be affected by the image of large retailers and change of consumer attitudes. The important thing here is that such information appeared to have not merely a temporary impact but a continuous impact for 2-4 months.","[Kim, Jong-Jin] Dream Big Inst Ind Econ, Distribut Econ, London, England",,"Kim, JJ (通讯作者)，Dream Big Inst Ind Econ, Distribut Econ, London, England.",2001j2k@hanmail.net,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,1,KODISA,SEONGNAM,"HANSHIN OFFICETEL STE 1030, 2463-4 SHINHEUNG-DONG SUJEONG-GU, SEONGNAM, GYEONGGI-DO 461-720, SOUTH KOREA",,,,,,,2015,,,,,,,347.0,351,,,,,,5,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9RF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365145700060,0

Territorially Vidzeme is divided into 25 districts, which are very different in terms of territory and population, as well as economic activity and development. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate, which factors are decisive for a successful growth of the districts. The districts' economic activity and viability is highly dependent on the size, population and location. Clearly visible is the close relationship between cities and surrounding districts, in particular relationship between Valmiera and its neighbouring territories. The largest districts are in a better position to attract more foreign investment. Retaining the smaller districts mostly seems to be economically unjustified.

While the amount of claims is generally large, and it is an event closely related to people's life, CIRC(China Insurance Regulatory Commission) has focused on the investment risk of life insurance companies. Now investment channel of insurance funds is gradually relaxed, but equity investment is still the mainstream direction, which reveals the significance to study the equity investment risk. This paper attempts to use the logistic analysis to establish equity investment risk-early mechanism to provide life insurance companies with reference information to make decisions. This paper selects 200 listed companies as research sample, and assumes the stocks which receive special treatment from CSRC(China Securities Regulatory Commission) as high-risk stocks, which will trigger the risk-early mechanism, and eventually, life insurance companies will not invest in them, then the value of the dependent variable is 0, otherwise it will be 1. Then the value of explained variable can be found in the stock exchanges. The paper chooses the listed companies' financial ability as independent variables, and builds a index system including indicators which can reflect the company's debt situation, profitability, growth capacity and operational stability. We can calculate the value based on the annual reports of listed companies. While PCA(principal component analysis) is used to eliminate multicollinearity effects and determine the explanatory variables. Then we apply logistic analysis to find specific relations between independent and dependent variables. The paper divides the samples into two groups, one is used for calculate the coefficient estimates of the model, and the other is used for testing model accuracy. The primary innovations of this paper are: Firstly, using PCA to eliminate the correlation and multicollinearity among the indicators in the index system, which increases the accuracy of the model and results. Secondly, introducing Logistic analysis to set risk early-warning mechanism of equity investment, quantifying the influence degree of various financial indicator of listed companies, and this provide objective basis and valuable information to life insurance companies when making investment decision. Furthermore, it can ensure the profit of life insurance companies and protect the interests of the policy-holders.","Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Liu, MJ (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",lmjcufe@163.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-89395-258-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,232.0,240,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD0EE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357102700017,0

In this endeavour, this paper aimed at the following objectives; (i) to estimate the current traffic flow rate; (ii) to estimate the mean trip rate per 100 m(2) of gross floor area (GFA) under commercial land use; (iii) to quantify the impact of additional traffic from the commercial area on the existing road network system in Skudai and finally (iv) To propose an appropriate transport improvement for the road network within the study area. The results obtained predict the additional trips for the horizon year 2015. The transport improvements are suggested under two principal categories of transport-supply adaptation and travel-demand reduction strategies. Although, the study is totally confined to commercial land uses, the assessment framework and the methodology of traffic impact assessment could be used for other major land use types. Knowledge is obtained about trip-rates following commercial developments that community decision makers as well as real estate developers can use to predict the anticipated impacts.

The discussion is extended to academic buildings in higher education institutions. The development of indicators is suggested as measures of evaluating socially sustainable academic buildings.

Seven cars on sale in 2013 are considered: the Ford Fiesta (diesel), the VW Polo (gasoline), the Fiat Punto Evo (bi-fuel - CNG), the Natural Power Alfa Romeo Mito (bi-fuel - LPG), the Toyota Yaris (hybrid - gasoline), the Peugeot iOn (BEV - owned battery), the Renault Zoe (BEV - leased battery). A Mixed Error Component Logit model is estimated based on data collected via a stated preference choice survey administered in 2013 in various Italian cities. The model's parameters are then used to build a Monte Carlo simulation model which allows evaluating, under different scenarios, the market penetration of the seven cars. The main findings are that (a) the subsidies enacted by the Italian government in favour of the low CO2 emitting cars appear to favour mostly the Ford Fiesta (diesel); (b) a three-fold increase in the BEVs range would not change their market share significantly (about 2%); and (c) only a combination of changes such as the introduction of a subsidy equal to 5000, the decrease of the purchase price for BEVs by 5000, the increase in the battery range, and the increase in the conventional fuel price would significantly increase the BEVs' market share, raising it to about 15%.

These markets are often not homogenous as intra-national diversity has created a complex market place in many Western key markets. In this study, wine brand category choice for Chinese and South Korean consumers living in Australia was probed and contrasted with the choices of Caucasian consumers. Three purchase scenarios, namely self/household-consumption, social entertainment-use and gift giving were presented to 511 consumers through a shopping mall intercept using a paper-based questionnaire. Separate models were developed to distinguish preferences for Australian and French wine. Backward deletion regression analysis was used to arrive at the most parsimonious models. A comparison of three research models, namely a marketing model, a Confucian Consumption Behaviour Component (CCBC) model and a Hybrid Model were tested. We found that the hybrid model (i.e. a combination of marketing variables and CCBC variables) has the highest explanatory power for consumers' wine brand category choice.

As Northeast asian countries are geographically adjacent to Northwest coast of Pacific ocean, in case economic cooperations are intensified, transportation & communication costs could be diminished as well as transaction cost caused by economic exchanges could be minimized. In order to analyze trade decision factor of both 2 countries, Index of trade intensity invented by trade intensity theory(Kruger, A.O.1997) is used to analyze it. Even though specific factor should be materialized in terms of analysis of trade decision factor, realistically, concreted explanations are difficult as there are so many unsolved factors and its diversifications. Therefore, this research focus on reviewing trade structural factors and external trade structural factor of trade decision factor's analysis, namely, time-series analysis is efficient.First, these Index of A value/ B value means Korean against Chinese market share/Korean against world market share, of which is comparative market intensity. Second, So, Korea is taking comparative advantage of export specialization and on the contrary, China is taking comparative advantage of import specialization respectively. Third, RCA indexes are considerably improved compared to that of 2000. However, still as RCA indexes are much smaller than +1 means Korea is in a position to comparative disadvantage against China compared to those of other industries. This research is analyzed by quantitative measurement with trade intensity theory, trade specialization and revealed comparative advantage index to see how inter-trade relations are changed between Korea and China during past 10 years(2000, 2005, 2012). Through this survey of time series, we can figure out structural factor of trade dependence relationship between 2 countries. Eventually, even though values of 0.023 in 2000 and 0.128 in 2005 are much more improved value compared to that of 2012, these are still low level.","[Yu, Jun] Honam Univ, Kwangju, South Korea",Honam University,"Yu, J (通讯作者)，Honam Univ, Kwangju, South Korea.",2014112@honam.ac.kr,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,2,KODISA,SEONGNAM,"HANSHIN OFFICETEL STE 1030, 2463-4 SHINHEUNG-DONG SUJEONG-GU, SEONGNAM, GYEONGGI-DO 461-720, SOUTH KOREA",,,,,,,2015,,,,,,,375.0,376,,,,,,2,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9RF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365145700065,0

The quality of primary information has direct influence on the quality of analytical conclusions. One more condition for the qualitative application of this method is the intellectual capital and experience of the analyst. One should note that in this regard we face another problem, that of selection of proper personnel, on the qualification of whom depends the accuracy of the evaluation and final results, on the basis of which strategic decisions are taken. The main aim of the paper is to assess the opportunities for applications of competitive intelligence methods in the railway sector. The study is using Knowledge House, DWS, DMS, DSS methodologies. Having analysed the scientific works the direct scientific sources of information, which are oriented to the application of the methods of competitive intelligence to the railway sector, have not been identified. The paper is absolutely original in that until now the competitive intelligence techniques have not been applied for the railway sector companies. Considering the fact that foreign companies, which compete for freighting at the international level, are regarded as the main competitors of the railway sector, the use of the methods of the competitive intelligence becomes more important while fighting for the part of the market. The competitive intelligence methods and their application to the railway sector companies are little studied. In accordance with application of the relevant methods in other sectors, it can be assumed that these innovative approaches could have a positive impact on the competitiveness of companies in the railway sector and their income.","[Gaidelys, Vaidas] Kauno Technol Univ, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Dailydka, Stasys] Vilniaus Gedimino Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Gaidelys, V (通讯作者)，Kauno Technol Univ, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vaidas.gaidelys@ktu.lt; stasys.dailydka@vgtu.lt,,,,,,,53,1,1,1,10,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

We performed a cross-sectional study of 529 Portuguese export firms drawn from the database held by a Portuguese Industrial Association Business Confederation. From multivariate analysis of variance and the Tukey's HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) test, we conclude that the more important export barriers mentioned by the firms proved more external than internal. Our results also show that the service and retail trade sectors were the sectors reporting the greatest peculiarities regarding export barriers. Thus, we identify an industry effect as regards export barriers even while our findings do not indicate any size effect. Knowing the industry-specific export barriers enables companies not only to better coordinate and perform export processes but also to better anticipate the behaviour of their competitors. Other practical and theoretical implications will also be presented.","[Silva, Joaquim Ramos] Univ Lisbon, ISEG, Dept Econ, SOCIUS CSG, Rua Miguel Lupi 20, P-1249078 Lisbon, Portugal; [Franco, Mario] Univ Beira Interior, CEFAGE UBI Res Ctr, Estr Sineiro, P-6200209 Covilha, Portugal; [Magrinho, Andre] Portuguese Ind Assoc Employers Confederat, P-1300307 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade da Beira Interior,"Silva, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, ISEG, Dept Econ, SOCIUS CSG, Rua Miguel Lupi 20, P-1249078 Lisbon, Portugal.",jrsilva@iseg.ulisboa.pt; mfranco@ubi.pt; andre.magrinho@aip.pt,"Silva, Joaquim Ramos/G-6900-2013; Franco, Mário/ABG-1980-2021","Silva, Joaquim Ramos/0000-0001-7672-1996; Franco, Mário/0000-0001-7818-0206",FCT; FEDER/COMPETE [PEst-C/EGE/UI4007/2013],FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER/COMPETE(European Union (EU)),The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments which contributed to the development of this paper.

This paper conjectures that firms reward directors and supervisors in order to retain their valuable human capital and notes a robust positive effect of excess compensation on future firm performance.

Once fully implemented, Rio shall have a world-class transit system and expects the share of daily trips made by mass transit to increase from 18% to 63%, benefiting almost 1.5 million passengers per day.

However, much like other types of travelling, it may have a negative impact on the environment, especially when it is performed by car. But how to decrease these negative effects while facilitating this important type of interaction has not been addressed before. The programme suggested by the Sustainable Mobility paradigm seems inadequate in the context of family meetings. In this paper we take a first step. We introduce two simple indicators for assessing the performance of travel mobility within family networks in terms of social and environmental sustainability: frequency of contact and total CO2 output of the related travel. Using data from the Netherlands, a Structural Equation Modelling analysis is applied to identify the effect of individual characteristics, car ownership and residential location on the two indicators. The main findings are that car ownership is associated with low environmental sustainability but with high social sustainability, and that living in core cities and distance between parents and adult children are associated with low sustainability in both dimensions. These results serve as input for a discussion of the opportunities and constraints for increasing sustainability in travelling for meetings in family networks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The rapidly growing subway system greatly improves the accessibility of neighborhoods nearby subway stations and often increases neighborhood population and employment densities, both resulting in a larger market for local retail businesses. While numerous studies have shown that rail transit investment tends to raise property value close to stations, few have provided direct evidence on rail transit's effects on local consumer amenities. Using citywide catering establishment data since 2004 from dianping.com (China's yelp.com), we study the effects of new subway stations on catering openings, diversity and consumer demand in neighborhoods near a subway station opened during 2004-2013. We find that a new subway station positively contributes to the quantity, diversity and consumer demand of nearby food and beverage services. These effects are heterogeneous spatially and in terms of catering types. This study enriches the limited extant empirical evidence on urban rail transit's impact on local economic activities and consumer amenities. In China, where unprecedented rail transit expansion has transformed large cities like Beijing in many ways, our findings can help us better understand how major public investment in cities affects local economy, quality of life, the housing market and related further policy concerns.

The worker's actions were successful because they used their production network knowledge and decided against a strategy of pure co-operative co-determination but implemented a strategy of resistance. They concentrated their resistance on the weak points within the value creation processes of the automotive production network. On the basis of this, the authors argue that production network knowledge can be used to develop collective power within organisations.

While the general forecasting framework used reflects standard international practice, forecasting errors are relatively large by international standards. In almost all cases, we find no evidence of bias in the forecasts when considering the major tax heads over various forecast horizons. A decomposition of the forecast errors reveals substantial contributions from sources other than errors in forecasting the macroeconomic environment or in estimating the previous year's revenue outturn. This suggests that a formal review of specific procedures and assumptions by the Department could yield further improvements in forecasting performance. An innovative exercise examining the routine use of judgement by the Department to adjust the outcome of forecasting equations indicates that this practice often improved the quality of the forecasts.","[Hannon, Andrew; Leahy, Eimear; O'Sullivan, Roisin] Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, Dublin, Ireland; [O'Sullivan, Roisin] Smith Coll, Northampton, MA 01063 USA",Smith College,"Hannon, A (通讯作者)，Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, Dublin, Ireland.",ah901@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,12,2,2,0,3,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

The plethora of empirical studies on EO and FP suggest that the EO-FP relationship is linearly positive regardless of the amount of EO investment. The results show that EO increases FP at the bounded level (i.e. an inverted U-shape). We argue that the excessive use of EO, organisational incapability and institutional constraints may contribute to the non-linearity of such effects. We also find that environmental dynamism has no significant effect. Further, contrary to the normative contention, we find that environmental hostility has a negative effect on the EO-FP relationship. The effect of environmental hostility on EO may vary depending on various factors such as firm size, resources, and institutional settings. We present prescriptive implications to practitioners on the antecedent conditions for EO practices.","[Kim, Hwan-Jin; Kim, Byung-Keun] Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Ctr Technol & Innovat Res, Cheonan, South Korea",Korea University of Technology & Education,"Kim, BK (通讯作者)，Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Ctr Technol & Innovat Res, Cheonan, South Korea.",b.kim@koreatech.ac.kr,,"Kim, Byung-Keun/0000-0002-6238-0569",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B8061859]; Graduate School of Korea University of Technology and Education,National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government; Graduate School of Korea University of Technology and Education,This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B8061859] and the Graduate School of Korea University of Technology and Education.,,53,7,8,0,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

We used gradient boosted machines (GBM) for multiple quantile regression, fitting each quantile and zone independently. Standard smoothing techniques were applied to the dominant input signal in order to adapt to forecast inaccuracies, and a cross-sectional approach was applied. We provide a technique for utilizing information about correlated wind farms efficiently, using a two-layer modeling approach.

One of the platforms benefits from a favorable coordination bias in the market, in that for this platform it is less costly than for the other platform to convince customers that the two sides will coordinate on joining it. We find that the degree of the coordination bias affects the platform's decision regarding the business model (i.e., whether to subsidize buyers or sellers), the access fees, and the size of the platform. A slight increase in the coordination bias may induce the advantaged platform to switch from subsidizing sellers to subsidizing buyers, or induce the disadvantaged platform to switch from subsidizing buyers to subsidizing sellers. Moreover, in such a case the advantaged platform switches from oversupplying to undersupplying sellers, and the disadvantaged platform switches from undersupplying to oversupplying sellers.","[Halaburda, Hanna] Bank Canada, Currency Dept, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Halaburda, Hanna] NYU Stern, Dept Management & Org, New York, NY USA; [Yehezkel, Yaron] Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Management, POB 69978, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Bank of Canada; Tel Aviv University,"Halaburda, H (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Currency Dept, Ottawa, ON, Canada.;Halaburda, H (通讯作者)，NYU Stern, Dept Management & Org, New York, NY USA.;Yehezkel, Y (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Management, POB 69978, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",hhalaburda@gmail.com; yehezkel@post.tau.ac.il,"Halaburda, Hanna/AAG-8175-2019",,United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF); NET Institute; Henry Crown Institute of Business Research in Israel,United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF)(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation); NET Institute; Henry Crown Institute of Business Research in Israel,"Halaburda is grateful to the HBS Division of Research.

Based on behavioral and marketing literature, this paper tests three possible roles of involvement in regards to passengers' perceptions of a Light-Rail Transit (LRT) service in Seville (Spain): the mediator, moderator and antecedent roles. The structural equation modeling approach was used to test the conditions of mediation and moderation in social psychology and to evaluate the theoretical relationships of involvement as an antecedent. A nested model strategy allowed us to compare competing models and a multiple group analysis was conducted to test for moderation. Our results indicate that involvement of public transit users could positively affect their evaluations of the service quality, and enhance their intentions to reuse the service and recommend it to others. Furthermore, involvement could also moderate the direct effect of service quality perceptions of highly involved users on their behavioral intentions. Consequently, higher levels of involvement could lead perceptions of service quality to affect positive behavioral intentions mainly through customer's satisfaction. Furthermore, the level of product hierarchy at which passengers make their decisions to use a transportation mode may affect how they make their evaluations and decisions in regards to that mode. These results lead to important and practical considerations for transportation managers who aim to enhance passengers' intentions to reuse the service and recommend it to others. The insight gained with this paper in regards to the effect of involvement on passengers' perceptions may allow the design of effective marketing strategies that aim to grow transit ridership by increasing the importance of public transit for passengers.

This paper uses Malmquist productivity index (classical and bootstrapping) to assess the operational performance of 21 Turkey airports during the period of 2009 through 2014. The findings indicated that the efficiency and productivity of the majority of the Turkish airports increased during the period under investigation. However, in the period of 2011-2012, a significant decline was observed in efficiency. The main reason of this stagnation is the significant increase in the physical capacity of the Turkish airports in 2011. The non-reflection of the increasing physical capacity to passenger and cargo traffic caused a decline in 2012. In spite of declining in the period of 2011-2012, efficiency values of Turkish airports have increased again since 2013. Moreover, decomposition of the Malmquist index showed that most Turkey airports experienced losses in efficiency; however, in terms of technology, they have progressed. Two significant factors (i.e. operating hours and percentage of international traffic) were identified by the Simar-Wilson double bootstrapping regression analysis as explaining variations in airport efficiency.

It presents three main empirical findings. First, the paper shows that a number of attitudes (generalized and personalized trusting behaviour, risk and time preferences) and outcomes (female labour force participation, fertility, entrepreneurship, productivity) are associated with the values received. Second, it documents that values received from parents are correlated with the values transmitted to descendants. Third, by using respondent moving patterns, the paper highlights that values received are slowly changing even after a discontinuity in the reference environment. Comparisons between first-and second-generation movers suggest that what matters for breaking the family chains are the formative years, when young people somehow strike a balance between the values transmitted by their parents and what they experience in the (possibly different) environment where they grow up.","[Albanese, Giuseppe] Bank Italy, Catanzaro Branch, Largo Serravalle 1, I-88100 Catanzaro, Italy; [De Blasio, Guido; Sestito, Paolo] Bank Italy, Struct Econ Anal Directorate, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Albanese, G (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Catanzaro Branch, Largo Serravalle 1, I-88100 Catanzaro, Italy.",giuseppe.albanese@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,40,25,27,1,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

An empirical analysis of Kenya Airways with an aircraft appraisal cost-benefit analysis model,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,EU Emission Trading Scheme; Fuel efficiency; Global market based measures; Carbon emissions; Cost benefit analysis,,"This paper aims to assess the impact of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) legislation on non-Anne country airlines by using a cost-benefit analysis (CBA), assuming those airlines are treated equally. A financial appraisal model of a case study of Kenya Airways is created to answer two key questions: (1) whether the EU ETS results in a negative impact on airlines located in developing countries or not, and (2) whether new and fuel efficient aircraft can be an effective mitigation option for those airlines and how its impacts could be different compared to other carriers in developed countries serving the same market. The results suggest that the option of keeping the current aircraft is preferred for airlines due to the additional large investment cost, while the fuel efficient aircraft option provides benefits across all stakeholder and related groups such as passengers, the workforce, and the environment. It is found that, compared to airlines in developed countries, the high investment requirement burdens carriers in developing countries to a greater extent due to the higher discount rate and exchange rate volatility. For global market based measures (MBMs), the option to support carriers in developing countries can be a possible measure to retain the equity balance among the parties involved, as it may lower barriers to implement new technology-such as new and fuel efficient aircraft-which mitigates aircraft emissions. Specifically, carbon financing through the revenue from global MBMs' offset schemes could be used towards this objective. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The findings highlight the potentially adverse consequences of disappointment in high-stakes testing and suggest that the risk of suicide may be significant among high achievers too.","[Wang, Liang Choon] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Monash University,"Wang, LC (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",liang.c.wang@monash.edu,,,,,,,43,14,21,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Results indicate that the RGD campaign portrays environmentalists as morally bankrupt individuals surreptitiously limiting the freedom of all-too-willing mainstream consumers.

For all three mechanisms, we find low rates of participation (around 40%), high rates of truth-telling conditional on participation (around 90%), high proportions of fair allocations (above 90%), and significant efficiency losses. We also observe differences across mechanisms: RSD is ranked highest in efficiency and TTC is ranked lowest in fairness.

Building on recent economic analysis, we explain why margin squeeze conducts should solely be evaluated under adjusted predatory pricing standards. The adjustment corresponds to an increase in the cost benchmark used in the predatory pricing test by including opportunity costs due to missed upstream sales. This can reduce both the risks of false positives and false negatives in margin squeeze cases. We justify this approach by explaining why classic arguments against above-cost predatory pricing typically do not hold in vertical structures where margin squeezes take place and by presenting case law evidence supporting this adjustment.

It produces new estimates of black and white schooling for this same period. Using a calibrated model of black and white parents, we fit the time series of black and white fertility and schooling. We then produce estimates of the benefits of equal education opportunity for blacks over the period 1820-2000. For the better part of US history, blacks have suffered from less access to schooling for their children than whites. This paper quantifies the magnitude of this discrimination. Our estimates of the welfare cost of this discrimination prior to the Civil War range between 0.5 and 20 times black wealth, and between 0.5 and 10 times black wealth prior to 1960. Further we find that the Civil Rights era was valued by blacks in the South by between 1% to 2% of wealth. Outside of the South, we find significant costs of discrimination prior to 1960, ranging from 6% to 150% of black wealth. For these divisions from 1960-2000, blacks have attained rough parity in schooling access. The welfare magnitudes are similar to the hypothetical gains to blacks if they had white mortality rates. We show that the model's black and white human capital series are strongly, positively correlated with state output measures, black and white permanent incomes and black and white earnings.","[Tamura, Robert] Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Clemson University; University of Chicago,"Tamura, R (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA.",rtamura@clemson.edu,"Tamura, Robert/AAI-7510-2020",,,,,,47,21,23,1,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

This paper borrows the fundamental concept of the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) model to establish a passenger satisfaction evaluation model for urban rail transit in China. A structural equation modeling (SEM) method and its parameter estimation method: Partial Least Squares (PLS), are applied to estimate the proposed model. An evaluation indicator system including three levels of indicators is established to measure passengers' satisfaction on the services offered by the rail transit operation companies. The satisfaction index is obtained to quantize the degree of passenger satisfaction. The IPA matrix is used as an assist tool to show the advantages and disadvantages of the services of rail transit. Suzhou rail transit line 1 was used as a case study, four models with different latent constructs or estimation methods were built and compared, to demonstrate the proposed PSI model based on PLS estimation method was reliable and the sign and magnitude of parameters were reasonable. The causality between passenger satisfaction and its influence factors were confirmed by path coefficients of the model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Data were collected from key stake holders associated with construction projects (client, owner, project manager, architect and supplier) in the Middle-Eastern countries via self-administered questionnaire developed from previous studies. Con-elation and regression analysis along with inter-item correlation matrix confirmed all hypotheses however with varying significance considering the outcomes of previous studies. The results revealed that (1) the relation between relational governance and management of formal contracts is positive though insignificant, (2) the relationship of B2B trust is positive with management of formal contracts and the association is relatively stronger as compared to relational governance, and (3) the influence of moderator, length of relationship, is stronger on the relationship between trust and contract management's effectiveness as compare to the relationship between relational governance and contract management's effectiveness. The current study and its findings will greatly help the project management related professionals and related stakeholders in understanding the complex relationship of formal contract management to business-to business trust and business relationship under the moderation effect of length of business relationship. The study is unique in term of developing and using an integrated framework that investigates relationships between business-to-business trust, business relationship, length of business relationship, and the formal contract management in the Middle Eastern construction industry environment.

In broad terms, the human development approach appeared as a means to reallocate human beings at the center of the actions related to politics, economy, and society. Therefore correct and fair measurement has got a great importance. The human development index (HDI) is a measure of human development based on the three major dimensions such as longevity, knowledge, and standard of living. In this paper, the assessment of the HDI for the OECD countries is reconsidered in the light of data envelopment analysis (DEA). The aim is therefore to provide complementary information for efficiency measure of HD in OECD countries. Instead of a ranking the countries, human development is benchmarked on the basis of empirical observations of the best practice countries by applying output-oriented DEA. As a result of the correlation analysis, there is a highly strong positive correlation between normalized HDI values and the values that we calculated from output oriented DEA model. Hence, the values that we calculated from DEA model fit HDI results. Both HDI and DEA results yield the same three topmost (Norway, Australia, and Switzerland) and the three lowermost countries (Hungary, Turkey, and Mexico).","[Bayraktar, Demet; Ayvaz, Susanna] Suleyman Sah Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Suleyman Sah University,"Bayraktar, D (通讯作者)，Suleyman Sah Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",dbayraktar@ssu.edu.tr,,,,,,,24,0,0,1,5,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,86.0,98,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200007,0

Road transport bears 73% share of total CO2 emissions from transport sector. High concentration of these gases leads to air pollution in terms of poor air quality and health related risks. Many countries have adopted carbon tax as a cost effective measure to correct environmental externality and reduce CO2 emissions since early 1990s. But before adopting carbon tax as a policy measure, it is important to determine people's willingness to pay (WTP) for effective implementation of the same. In order to know the effectiveness of carbon tax in Indian road passenger transport, this study presents the contingent valuation analysis of people's willingness to pay with the help of primary data collected from three different metropolitan cities - Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. Probit and tobit regression models are used to analyse the data. Fihdings show that people of India are willing to pay. Environmental awareness in terms of people's interest in environment, their environmental activities, education, income and age have significant role in determining WTP. The study suggests macro level policy recommendations in terms of utilizing fiscal instruments (such as tax) for environmental externalities. It also helps to analyse sustainability oriented behaviour in terms of society's willingness to pay to avoid environmental risks through contingent valuation method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The ability to control the company's earnings for private gain is considered as disadvantageous for the reliability of the reported earnings. One of the effect on earnings management measured as the degree of discretionary accruals' prevalent in a firm is audit quality, where Big Four auditors deliver higher quality audits than non-Big four auditors. A stream of literature explains that audit quality of external auditor mechanisms such as auditor size, audit fees, non-audit services, and auditor industry specialization are able to contribute towards improving the firms' performance and reducing information asymmetry. The other dimension of value creation is the reduction in the earning management raised by companies. Theoretically to some extent, high audit quality of external auditors will lead to lower firm risk, information asymmetry and subsequently, high earnings. This paper aims to prepare a critical conceptual of the empirical literature on the effect of audit quality on the earning management.","[Hosseini, Mohammad Reza; Tareq, Mohammad Ali] UTM, MJIIT, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Hosseini, MR (通讯作者)，UTM, MJIIT, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",Mh_hoseini94@yahoo.com; tareq@utm.my,"Tareq, Mohammad Ali/D-5524-2016; Hosseini, Mohammadreza/I-3305-2019","Tareq, Mohammad Ali/0000-0001-5521-8814; Hosseini, Mohammadreza/0000-0003-2888-9676",,,,,40,0,0,1,8,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-5431-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,901.0,906,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393354400148,0

This research study attempts to develop a model for process operations variability reduction that integrates the fundamental drivers, the intermediate measures and the four traditional competitive capabilities: quality, cost, delivery reliability and speed of delivery. In addition, it highlights the precise mechanisms in plants that lead to multiple competitive capabilities development. The concept of a routine-based approach to capabilities development provides a nexus between the earlier actions by the organisation and competitive advantage. Using longitudinal data from the Manufacturing Circle of South Africa, a statistical analysis was conducted to support the model, and path analysis models were developed which confirmed that the performance frontier is really a surface that spans many different dimensions. It is observed that the model clearly outlines pathways to process operations variability reduction through better execution of the routines concerned with maintaining the performance by current processes, improving existing processes, and transforming or changing to new processes.","[Katombe, Madi] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Grad Sch Business & Leadership, Durban, South Africa; [Munapo, Elias] North West Univ, Sch Econ & Decis Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal; North West University - South Africa,"Katombe, M (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Grad Sch Business & Leadership, Durban, South Africa.",,"Munapo, Elias/G-2819-2012","Munapo, Elias/0000-0001-6279-3729",,,,,112,1,2,0,14,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Because of the high level of ambiguity surrounding intangible assets, their complementary nature, and possible legal barriers to imitation, competitive advantage based on immaterial assets are perceived to be particularly sustainable and thus of high strategic relevance. However, companies possessing a competitive advantage based on immaterial assets are facing problems resulting from the special characteristics of intangible assets. The intangible assets are accompanied by the central problem of appropriation that results from their public good characteristics. This paper discusses the key importance of the appropriation of economic returns stemming from competitive advantage. The intangible technical assets are a company's strategic reasoning.

One important issue that has attracted a great deal of attention in the seasonal adjustment literature is its detection by an expert procedure. The general-to-specific approach to the detection of structural change, which is currently implemented in Autometrics via indicator saturation, has proven to be both practical and effective in the context of stationary dynamic regression models and unit-root autoregressions. By focusing on impulse- and step-indicator saturation, we use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the performance of this approach for detecting additive outliers and level shifts in the analysis of nonstationary seasonal time series. The reference model is the basic structural model, featuring a local linear trend, possibly integrated of order two, stochastic seasonality and a stationary component. Further, we apply both kinds of indicator saturation to the detection of additive outliers and level shifts in the industrial production series of five European countries.

Changing the mobility culture, two central factors are important: the mental approach to mobility options and the infrastructural conditions. Future mobility isn't about less mobility, but rather a different way of being mobile and using different types of mobility solutions. This research project in progress is based on the systemic-relational approach and seeks to develop and introduce the conditions of electromobility in an urban area without a well-frequented local public transport by a networked innovation cooperation in 4 development areas. The central goal of this work is the integrated development of service innovation of technical and non-technical manner based on the network of project partners, the city council and the university.

The data-flow of a process relies on the data needed (input data elements) in order to execute each activity and the resulted data (the output data elements) after the execution of each activity. This paper focuses on two directions: a) a novel approach for event log extraction (SQL mining using DML statements) and b) a data-flow visualization of process models.

At the second stage, petrol station brands were ranked by respondent priorities. Finally, the importance-performance matrix for factors attracting consumers to petrol stations was composed to reflect the existing situation. Research results indicate that petrol stations in Lithuania do not react to consumer needs and wishes properly. The most important factors for consumers while choosing a petrol station appeared to be price-quality relation (in terms of perceived value), price, and location. Moreover, evaluating sales promotion used by petrol stations, only price-related promotions were evaluated as important. Seven petrol station brands were indicated by the respondents during the research; three of them share the vast majority of the market. However, the competition is hard. Therefore, achieving to attract consumers petrol stations' management has to apply appropriate measures.

Financing of public expenditure (as a sum of short-term, medium or long term projects) is a complicated issue. Regarding the financial perspective, the primary result is the creation of budget deficits. Countries are currently not able to deal with them, and thus this problem leads to the creation of new deficits. Therefore, an economy creates public debt - through the accumulation of deficits. The aim of our paper is to examine the effect of social expenditure on public debt. We have focused on the examination of only two countries - the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Our findings confirm that social expenditure represents a significant proportion of public expenditure. Moreover, public expenditure and social expenditure as well have increased in volume in the previous years. Governments use them to fulfil their social role in the economy. From this perspective, financing of social expenditure also contributes to the deficit, and in the long term to the creation of public debt. For that reason, another objective of our paper is to verify the effect of social expenditure on public debt. We examine the primary hypothesis on the significant correlation between public expenditure and public debt. As a result, we created an econometric model to test our hypothesis that the variable of public expenditure is more significantly correlated with public debt than other selected economic variables. Moreover, we modified the model, and we tested the hypothesis that social expenditure is more significantly correlated with public debt than other selected economic variables. We found that hypothesis concerning public expenditure had been confirmed for both countries. Hypothesis about social expenditure was confirmed for the Czech Republic. However, in the case of Slovakia, this hypothesis could not be verified.","[Raisova, Manuela; Semancikova, Jozefina] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Theory, Kosice, Slovakia; [Pavlikova, L'udmila] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice; Technical University Kosice,"Raisová, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Theory, Kosice, Slovakia.",manuela.raisova@tuke.sk; ludmila.pavlikova@tuke.sk; jozefina.semancikova@tuke.sk,"Raisova, Manuela/AAG-1414-2019; Pavlikova, Ludmila/E-5793-2018","Raisova, Manuela/0000-0003-3393-7492;",project VEGA [1/0994/15]; Ministry of Education,project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)); Ministry of Education,This paper was written in connection with scientific project VEGA no. 1/0994/15.

Addressing the research gap of limited studies at multiple levels of analysis, a theoretical model was derived, in which PsyCap can lead to innovative behavior of employees towards organizational performance through authentic leadership in a public environment that was perceived by disappointed reforms, resistance to change, power abuse, laziness and despair.

There are many studies which deal with the findings with respect to students' expectations. The benefit of our work is that we compare these expectations to the real offer by potential employers. In the framework of our research, we have chosen two different fields of studies, on the one hand the students of economics, who find their employment in the entrepreneurial sphere, the second group was composed of students from social work, who target their careers at the area of social services and their employers will be predominantly non-profit organisations. We took a look as to whether there are differences between the expectations and the reality concerning both the starting salary and its increase during the first three years of employment and thereby grouped into two sections (profit and non-profit). Our conclusions reveal that the level of the salary depends on the field studied. The levels of the salary offered in the profit and non-profit sectors significantly differ. A significant difference is also obvious in the possible salary advancements in the course of the first three years of employment. The students of economics are more likely to estimate the level of their starting salary, but they count on faster advancements. On the other hand, potential employers of economics graduates do not offer such an increase. In the area of social work, i.e. in the non-profit sector, the difference between the students' expectations and the offers by their potential employers is even greater.

These latter two orders differed in terms of the direction of the remaining forecasts: either a horizon-increasing order (1, 2, 3, 4) or a horizon-decreasing one (4, 3, 2, 1). End-anchoring improved the forecast accuracy, especially for more distant horizons, and resulted in the trajectory of the forecast sequence being closer to the optimal one. The direction of forecasting after end-anchoring affected the forecast quality only when the optimal trajectory of the forecast sequence displayed a strong nonlinearity. End-anchoring provides a simple means of enhancing judgmental forecasts when predictions for a number of horizons are being produced from each series. (C) 2015 International Institute of Forecasters.

The aim of this paper is to compare the results of inspections carried out in Croatia with the results in the selected European countries. The reports on audit inspection show that there is still room for improvements in terms of the audit quality. The conclusions of the research point towards the lack of auditor's professional scepticism with regard to the statements of management. This refers to the importance of professional scepticism in audit fields which are exposed to increased risks in the context of the financial market and global economic crises. According to the experience of selected countries, the inspections that were carried out by an independent professional body have increased the quality of the performed audits.

We sample 100 European airports located in 76 metropolitan areas of diverse sizes in 19 countries on both a daily and flight-by-flight basis during the period from April 2011 to December 2012. We construct a panel dataset at the flight code level comprising about 3.5 million observations. We find that LCCs contribute to a reduction of delays for airlines and flights landing at the observed airport. From the customers' point of view and taking into consideration the level of service, we conclude that the presence of LCCs represents a positive externality for an airport. Airport management may therefore consider the proactive increase of LCCs market share in their long-term business strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a firm level diffusion model, we investigate: the effect of social globalization on within- and across-brand word-of-mouth communications; the impact of competitive fractionalization on the probability of adoption; and the effect of the population density on market potential. We use non-linear mixed modeling on pooled multicountry data from 123 firms in 40 countries to estimate a generalised firm level model. Our substantive findings are: social globalization has a positive impact on within-brand communications, and a negative impact on across-brand communications; competitive fractionalization has a negative impact on the probability of firm level adoption; and population density has a positive impact on the market potential. Finally, we demonstrate the model's validity using the model fit and predictive accuracy. Our findings will aid international managers in the evaluation of diverse international market forecasts for entries and regulators in their formulation of strategy and policy.

It looks into the strengths and weaknesses of the most prominent legal options available to States to implement liberalisation, namely, amending the Chicago Convention, including market access in air transport in the GATS Annex on Air Transport Services, waiving the nationality clauses and concluding inter-regional air transport agreements. Via this process, the paper aspires to identify the optimal legal path to liberalisation. The analysis suggests that there is no single way to achieve liberalisation nor is there a shortcut. Instead, it appears that what catalyses liberalisation is the combined effect of the interplay between the various legal options. The paper concludes that, however accommodating the law might be, liberalisation occurs when economics and politics merge, an outcome which in international civil aviation appears to be a long way down the road, but certainly not out of sight.

It is proposed that grant agreements between private foundations and social movement organizations construct idealized spaces of public participation and discursive theories of change that draw attention away from structural inequality and antagonism, ultimately generating consent. Drawing upon archival and ethnographic research on philanthropic investments in addressing migrant poverty in California's Central Valley, the article shows how consensus between foundation staff and farmworker and immigrant organizers promote funding frameworks that exclude questions that challenge relationships of power and systems of agricultural production that contribute to enduring poverty across the region. The Gramscian conceptual frames of discursive power, hegemony as politics, and strategic articulation are presented as a theoretical framework from which to understand the power of private philanthropy as consensus broker during historical moments of crisis.","[Kohl-Arenas, Erica] Milano Sch Int Affairs, Management, Milan, Italy; [Kohl-Arenas, Erica] New Sch, Urban Policy, New York, NY USA",The New School,"Kohl-Arenas, E (通讯作者)，Milano Sch Int Affairs, Management, Milan, Italy.",,,,,,,,63,6,9,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The consideration of the development of multi-local living arrangements in contemporary societies raises conceptual as well as methodological questions, and demands new and revised methods for investigating the phenomenon.

Using a novel application of recurrent-event survival analysis for a pooled sample of 84 European cartels, we find that mergers are indeed more frequent after cartel breakdown, especially in markets that are less concentrated. However, we caution against merely assuming that these mergers are motivated by coordinated effects-alternatively, they may be the consequence of market restructuring, necessitated by more intense competition after cartel breakdown. Further disaggregated analysis of the individual mergers shows that on average these mergers are profitable for the acquiring company and that the tacit-collusion motive is likely to be at work in a large minority of the mergers.","[Davies, Stephen; Ormosi, Peter L.; Graffenberger, Martin] Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Davies, S (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",,"Davies, Stephen/HPD-3182-2023","Ormosi, Peter/0000-0001-6472-6511",Economic and Social Research Council; Centre for Competition Policy,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Centre for Competition Policy,"We are grateful for comments from participants of seminars at the Office of Fair Trading, the economics seminar series of Universite Paris Ouest Nanterre la Defense, and the Centre for Competition Policy at the University of East Anglia.

Transaction cost considerations lead to jobs characterized by either normal or complex exchange. This in turn implies two contracting modes: contingent pay (fixed wage or piece-rate/commission contract) or noncontingent pay (salary with possibly a bonus). We show empirically that observed job characteristics, as measured by the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, can explain the contract form observed in the Panel Study on Income Dynamics. Second, we discuss the implications of contract form for wages and mobility, and show that noncontingent pay jobs have more able workers in more durable relationships.","[MacLeod, W.

Contrary to most of the previous literature, we find such patterns to be highly differentiated. In particular, we identify three types of firm behaviour: high and persistent, low and persistent, and discontinuous. We link the capability-based view of the firm to theories of asset complementarities and market signalling to explain how firm-specific traits affect such behaviours. We obtain the following results: first, the persistent accumulation of IAs is favoured by the internal availability of highly skilled personnel; second, firms with (a) large IA base and (b) high propensity to exploit complementarities in the asset stocks are more likely to persistently accumulate IAs than to discontinuously or never accumulate IAs and third, the adoption of quality management standards facilitates the accumulation of IAs, especially if this is done discontinuously.

A review of prior studies from the domain of economic forecasting finds that the simple average was more accurate than EBMA in four studies out of five. On average, the error of EBMA was 5% higher than that of the simple average. A reanalysis and extension of a published study provides further evidence for US presidential election forecasting. The error of EBMA was 33% higher than the corresponding error of the simple average. Simple averages are easy both to describe and to understand, and thus are easy to use. In addition, simple averages provide accurate forecasts in many settings. Researchers who are developing new approaches to combining forecasts need to compare the accuracy of their method to this widely established benchmark. Forecasting practitioners should favor simple averages over more complex methods unless there is strong evidence in support of differential weights. (C) 2014 International Institute of Forecasters.

The effect of top inventing companies on local inventors,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Localized knowledge spillovers; patents; innovation,KNOWLEDGE SPILLOVERS; PATENT; LOCALIZATION; MOBILITY; FIRMS,"The article investigates whether the patenting activity of the most inventive companies has any causal effect on the number of patents granted to other local inventors in the same metropolitan area in USA. Economic theory predicts that positive agglomeration economies may be counterbalanced by upward pressure on wages, which are stronger within technological classes in the short term. The empirical analysis exploits the panel structure of the dataset to account for various fixed effects, and adopts an instrumental variable approach to prove causality.

In addition, the effect is not bounded within narrow technological categories, suggesting that Jacob-type knowledge spillovers across sectors tend to prevail over other source of agglomeration economies within sectors, including sharing and matching mechanisms.

MAMCA is a methodology that is used to evaluate different policy measures by explicitly accounting for the opinions of various stakeholders. This paper refines the model based on social network analysis to measure the weights of stakeholder opinions and applies the model to the case of Tianjin. Six intervention low-carbon transport policies (tax adjustment, pricing adjustment mechanisms, multi-operation mechanisms, environmental propaganda, traffic demand management, and state funding and subsidies) are evaluated based on the aims and objectives of various stakeholders (government supervisory authorities, end users, infrastructure operators, infrastructure suppliers, academics, the traffic management sector, the technology division, and the planning department) using snowball sampling techniques. Overall, the results showed that the most supportive policies are traffic demand management and state funding and subsidies. The MAMCA also provided insights into the position and preferences of stakeholders in relation to the aims and objectives of low-carbon transport policy. As such, the results can assist decision makers in comparing, selecting and adjusting low-carbon transport policies as well as attracting support for policy implementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Parent valuation of education is examined through the differential effects of school quality on the residential location choices of households with and without children. The analysis relies on data from the 2000 Census and focuses on the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area. The results suggest that immigrant parents place a positive weight on school quality when choosing residences. The weight assigned to school is positively associated with household income and householder's education. The paper further explores variation across immigrants to get at the potential economic mechanisms for differential valuation of school quality. Number of school-aged children in the household, selective migration, and potential returns to education may explain variation in the emphasis immigrant parents place on school quality in residential location choices.","Univ S Carolina, Darla Moore Sch Business, Dept Econ, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Zhan, C (通讯作者)，Univ S Carolina, Darla Moore Sch Business, Dept Econ, 1014 Greene St, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",crystal.zhan@moore.sc.edu,,,,,,,40,8,10,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

We assume that parents maximize the full income of their children and that males have an additional income, independently of education. This additional income biases preferences toward sons and implies that females have relative advantage in producing income through education. When the returns to human capital are low, the bias toward sons is high, so that parents whose first newborns are females have more children. Consequently, daughters are born to larger families and hence receive less education. As returns to human capital increase, gender differences in producing income diminish, bias toward sons declines, variation in family size falls and the positive correlation between family size and the number of daughters is weakened. Ultimately, the relative advantage of females in education dominates differences in family size, triggering the reversal in the gender education gap.","[Hazan, Moshe] Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Hazan, Moshe] CEPR, Jerusalem, Israel; [Zoabi, Hosny] New Econ Sch, Moscow 117418, Russia",Tel Aviv University; New Economic School,"Hazan, M (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, POB 39040, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",moshehaz@post.tau.ac.il; hosny.zoabi@gmail.com,"Hazan, Moshe/S-2470-2019","Hazan, Moshe/0000-0002-5459-5455",Falk Institute,Falk Institute,Hazan greatly acknowledges financial support provided by the Falk Institute.,,46,14,14,3,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",2054-0892,2054-0906,,J DEMOGR ECON,J.Demogr.

Second, do consent decrees sacrifice the public good of adjudication to say what the law is? A comparison of the Intel investigations in Europe and the United States shows that consent decrees need not sacrifice deterrence.

We evaluate this concern within a dynamic model of a patent race, and find first-to-invent (weakly) more conducive to innovation than first-to-file.

For this purpose, the first part of the article applies John Sutton's framework for empirically measuring the relationship between market size and market concentration. Next, the analysis turns to assessing the degree of price competition by applying a method of measuring banking competition that I have recently developed. Results suggest that there is a null relationship between market size and concentration, and that the estimated lower bound to concentration is well above zero. These two pieces of empirical evidence support Sutton's endogenous sunk costs model. Moreover, empirical estimates of a measure of competition-distance to the lower bound to concentration-suggest that the majority of EU national banking markets have low intensity of price competition. In contrast, Estonia, Netherlands, Finland, and Lithuania appear to have the most competitive banking industries.","Swansea Univ, Sch Management, Econ, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales",Swansea University,"Tabacco, GA (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, Sch Management, Econ, Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",G.A.Tabacco@swansea.ac.uk,,"Tabacco, Giovanni Alberto/0000-0001-6437-4560",,,,,36,3,3,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Our results reveal that company size, export activities, internal R&D and innovation activities are positively related to the service provider's likelihood to participate in formal standardization. Additionally, the service industry and the service type are related to the propensity to standardize. The analysis is limited to Dutch companies' involvement at the Dutch standards body and does not consider their engagement in standardization consortia. The paper combines a large and representative sample of service companies with information about service companies' engagement in standardization for the first time.

This finds the railroad sector crucial in generating direct employment and stimulating related industrial investment through forward and backward linkages. The former are associated with 'factor channeling'aEuroplanned strategies to direct raw material flows to the city. NEG theorists' under-emphasis on raw material provision and their use of the iceberg model to avoid analysis of the railroad sector is therefore found to be erroneous.

The multidimensionality of the developed SME knowledge construct was confirmed. The proposed model of the employees' knowledge consists of five main dimensions: innovation capabilities and willingness to learn, attitude, job qualification, formal education, and work experience. To verify and confirm the proposed model, an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was performed.
