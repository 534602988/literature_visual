Our main contribution is a general methodology for solving the optimal commitment problem, in closed form, for asymmetric continuous-type distributions. Our approach consists of a number of innovations. We propose a modeling concept called equal-bid function to build a bridge between two players' strategies. Another concept called equal-utility curve transforms any commitment strategy into a weakly better continuous and everywhere directional-differentiable strategy. The optimal commitment functions in these auctions reveal some important insights. When the player with commitment power (the leader) has low valuation, he bids passively. This is a credible way to alleviate competition and to enable collusion. We demonstrate, via concrete examples, that this is a credible way to threaten the follower so that the leader can secure a higher utility.","[Tang, Pingzhong; Wang, Zihe] Tsinghua Univ, IIIS, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaoquan (Michael)] HKUST Business Sch, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Tang, PZ (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, IIIS, Beijing, Peoples R China.",kenshinping@gmail.com; wzh5858588@163.com; zhang@ust.hk,"Zhang, Xiaoquan/S-9794-2018","Zhang, Xiaoquan/0000-0003-0690-2331",,,,,29,3,3,0,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,197,211,,10.1145/2940716.2940739,0.0,,,15,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300019,0

The Russian nation was largely described in ethno-lingual or ethno-cultural terms, while the Russian state was all but explicitly declared as a nation-state of ethnic Russians. The official identity discourse was marked by the recasting and unprecedentedly strong reassertion of boundaries between the Russian and Ukrainian nations, legitimizing Russian claims to Crimea. However, the changing references to the crisis in Eastern Ukraine illustrate how the Kremlin's identity rhetoric is still mainly guided by considerations of political necessity, rather than dictated by some national or ideological vision. Significantly, the focus of the Russian official identity discourse shifted from the state to the nation. This marks a decisive departure from Putin's earlier largely statist rhetoric in the 2000s, and a new stage of maturation and official acclamation of national ethnicization trends launched during his third presidential term. After years of sitting on the fence, the Kremlin reinvented itself as an active and initiating player in the nationalism field.","[Teper, Yuri] Univ Manchester, Dept Russian & East European Studies, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Teper, Yuri] Ariel Univ, Dept Israel & Middle Eastern Studies Polit Sci, Ariel, Israel",University of Manchester; Ariel University,"Teper, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Dept Russian & East European Studies, Manchester, Lancs, England.;Teper, Y (通讯作者)，Ariel Univ, Dept Israel & Middle Eastern Studies Polit Sci, Ariel, Israel.",yuri.teper@gmail.com,,,,,,,65,59,64,0,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Annual hourly output and annual hourly revenues mean/standard deviation efficient frontiers for wind and solar resource locations are computed from this information. For both efficient frontiers, economically meaningful differences between portfolios on the efficient frontier and the actual wind and solar generation capacity mix are found. The relative difference is significantly larger for aggregate hourly output relative to aggregate hourly revenues, consistent with expected profit-maximizing unilateral entry decisions by renewable resource owners. Most of the hourly output and hourly revenue risk-reducing benefits from the optimal choice of locational generation capacities is captured by a small number of wind resource locations, with the addition of a small number of solar resource locations only slightly increasing the set of feasible portfolio mean and standard deviation combinations.

The network was mathematically modeled as a biobjective and multi-layer fuzzy mixed-integer nonlinear programming model under return quantity uncertainty to minimize the total cost and maximize the comprehensive evaluation values of the SF6 treatment centers. With the cloud model, the method of fuzzy mathematical programming and the interactive non-inferior set estimation method, we obtained the optimal solution which determined transportation quantities of SF6 and the location of facilities. The proposed model was validated by a real world case study, which indicates that the emissions of SF6 will be reduced by 270.23 tons of gaseous SF6.","[Zhang, Hongqing; Zhang, Yanfu; Cheng, Yali] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University,"Zhang, HQ (通讯作者)，North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",bjzhanghongqing@163.com; zfy1093@163.com; 13051318384@163.com,,,,,,,7,2,2,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-273-2,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,75.0,,,,,,38,42,,,,,,5,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7SD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391653700009,0

Proponents of stakeholder democracy argue that stakeholder organizations, such as civil society groups and other non-state actors, may represent people significantly affected by global decisions better than elected governments. In this article we identify a particularly promising sociological variant of this argument, test it against new evidence from a large-scale survey among stakeholder organizations with varying levels of involvement in international organizations (IOs), and find that the suggested stakeholder mechanism for producing democratic legitimacy in global governance does not work. Stakeholder involvement is unproductive for democratic legitimacy in IOs as perceived by stakeholders themselves.

Coupling and decoupling factors from an Input-Output structural decomposition analysis,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Road freight transport; Input-Output; Decoupling; Europe; Structural decomposition analysis,GROWTH,"Decoupling road freight transport from economic growth has been acknowledged by the European Union as a key means to improving sustainability. It is therefore important to identify both the coupling and decoupling drivers of road freight transport demand in order to determine possible factors that may contribute to reduce road transport in the future without curbing economic development. This research proposes an Input-Output (10) structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to explain road freight transport in terms of a set of key factors that have strongly influenced road freight demand in recent decades in European countries such as economic growth, economic structure and the evolution of road transport intensity (including improvements in both supply and transport systems). This methodological approach allows us to quantify and compare their contribution in different European countries to either increase or decrease road freight transport demand. The empirical basis for this analysis is a dataset of nine European countries which have 10 tables and road transport data available from 2000 to 2007, comprising data on domestic production, imports and exports as well as tonne-kms for 11 types of commodity classes. The results show that, as a whole, aggregate road transport demand has grown driven mainly by economic activity but this growth has been strongly curbed in some countries by changes in road freight transport intensity and moderately by the dematerialization of the economy.

These mergers are attempts by airlines to assuage operational and financial challenges and to obtain actual or ostensible benefits, including efficiency and market power gains, and improve competitive position. This study investigates the market reaction to merger announcements by bidder firms in the US airline industry, an oligopolistic industry, during the period 1985-2013. Results of the analysis show significant positive reaction to the announcements. The findings suggest that the market perceives these merger transactions as value-relevant events for bidders.

Two panel estimation methodologies are under consideration: panel cointegration and panel VAR. The findings reveal that financial development affects economic growth and globalization positively.

Using datasets from the Swedish National Travel Survey and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute that spans a period of thirteen years, this study explores the impacts of weather variability on individual activity-travel patterns. In doing so, this study uses an alternative representation of weather from that of directly applying observed weather parameters. Furthermore, this study employs a holistic model structure. The model structure is able to analyse the simultaneous effects of weather on a wide range of interrelated travel behavioural aspects, which has not been investigated in previous weather studies. Structural equation models (SEM) are applied for this purpose. The models for commuters and non-commuters are constructed separately. The analysis results show that the effects of weather can be even more extreme when considering indirect effects from other travel behaviour indicators involved in the decision-making processes. Commuters are shown to be much less sensitive to weather changes than non-commuters. Variation of monthly average temperature is shown to play a more important role in influencing individual travel behaviour than variation of daily temperature relative to its monthly mean, whilst in the short term, individual activity-travel choices are shown to be more sensitive to the daily variation of the relative humidity and wind speed relative to the month mean. Poor visibility and heavy rain are shown to strongly discourage the intention to travel, leading to a reduction in non-work activity duration, travel time and the number of trips on the given day. These findings depict a more comprehensive picture of weather impact compared to previous studies and highlight the importance of considering interdependencies of activity travel indicators when evaluating weather impacts.

First, it employs a minilateral approach, restricting the participants that negotiate new regulatory standards to a few, highly involved stakeholders. Second, it relies heavily on government networks that operate on the basis of soft law. The arrangement circumvents the traditional intergovernmental model that has proven overly rigid and ineffective in addressing the problems that arise from highly interconnected and fast-changing global markets. Current theories of global economic governance predict that this twofold innovation enhances the effectiveness of financial regulatory reform. Yet a study of the evolution in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives regulation shows that this is not the case. The paper then exposes three obstacles to cross-border regulatory cooperation between the two dominant players, the European Union and the United States. Authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are concerned about the distributive consequences of regulation, legislators and legislation hinder cross-border harmonization, and government networks are weak and incomplete. The paper concludes with suggestions of how to overcome coordination failure and theoretical implications for the political economy of networked governance.","[Knaack, Peter] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of Southern California,"Knaack, P (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",,,,,,,,109,20,21,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Therefore, it is important to be able to quantifiably measure the resilience of systems, and thus be able to make decisions on how the resilience of the system can be improved. In this paper we will work with the definition, due to Pimm (1991), that resilience is how fast a variable that has been displaced from equilibrium returns to it. We will think of a system as being more or less resilient depending on the speed with which a system recovers from disruptive events or shocks. Here we consider systems which revert to an equilibrium state from shocks, and introduce a measure of resilience by providing a quantification of the rapidity of these systems' recovery from shocks. We use a mean-reverting stochastic model to study the diffusive effects of shocks and we apply this model to the case of the London Underground. As a shock diffuses through the network, the human-flow in the network recovers from the shock. The speed with which the passenger counts return to normal is an indicator of how quickly the line is able to recover from the shock and thereafter resume normal operations.

A new dependence concept, called excess dependence is introduced and studied in addition to expectation dependence. This new concept coincides with expectation dependence at first-degree but provides distinct higher-order extensions.

It is assumed that individuals prefer this predicted value to be as close as possible to their true value (single-peaked preferences). Consistent with the theoretical literature, we show that subjects misrepresent their private information more when an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is implemented than when the so-called resistant line (RL) estimator is employed. The latter extends the median voter theorem to the two-dimensional setting and belongs to the family of robust estimation techniques. In fact, we find that OLS involves serious biases but the RL estimation is empirically unbiased.

By applying a consistent method to Norwegian data for 1990, 2001 and 2006 (repeated cross-sections), we compare results over time and detect possible trends. We find that electricity consumption for many end use necessities such as washing, water heating and refrigeration varies somewhat from year to year, but they show no trend.

Two ways in which housing receives preferential treatment are the tax deductibility of mortgage interest payments and the non-recognition of imputed rents. We employ a recursive equilibrium model in which heterogeneous agents make housing tenure choices and in which mortgage default occurs in equilibrium. We calibrate the model and use the calibration results to quantify the effects of reforming these parts of the tax regime. We find that elimination of the mortgage interest tax deduction reduces the foreclosure rate by 12.4 percent. Alternatively, taxing imputed rents would reduce it by 32.5 percent.","[Zebian, Firas] Deloitte, Dallas, TX 75201 USA; [Dusansky, Richard] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Dusansky, R (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",fzebian@deloitte.com; dusansky@earthlink.net,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

J,"Bernal, RL",,,,"Bernal, Richard L.",,,The Growing Economic Presence of China in the Caribbean,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,LATIN-AMERICA,"China's economic presence in the Caribbean has grown significantly in the last decade. The growing economic presence of China in the Caribbean is evident in China's exports and development assistance to the region. Caribbean exports to China have not significantly increased; in fact, they declined during the period 2006-09. This is in contrast to the growth of exports from Latin America and the rest of the world and represents a missed opportunity for Caribbean exporters. The potential for further growth in economic relations between China and the Caribbean lies in trade including services, foreign investment and tourism. The pattern of trade, investment and development assistance in the Caribbean is very different from that in Latin America, and therefore it is misleading to conflate the two regions and draw an inference of similarity beyond very broad trends as is the case of the literature on the economic presence of China in Latin America. The contrast is vividly evident in the fact that China is now the largest trade partner of some Latin American countries but remains a small fraction of the Caribbean's trade.","[Bernal, Richard L.] Univ W Indies, Interamer Dev Bank, Mona, Jamaica; [Bernal, Richard L.] Univ W Indies, Sir Arthur Lewis Inst Social & Econ Studies, Mona, Jamaica",University West Indies Mona Jamaica; University West Indies Mona Jamaica,"Bernal, RL (通讯作者)，Univ W Indies, Interamer Dev Bank, Mona, Jamaica.",,,,,,,,105,17,17,3,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2015,38.0,9,,,SI,,1409,1437,,10.1111/twec.12204,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CR2GL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361144400005,0

Our contribution is twofold. First, when estimating the impact of fiscal policy on TFP from a production function approach, we identify the worldwide available level of technology by exploiting the observed strong cross-sectional dependence between countries instead of using ad hoc proxies for technology. Second, next to direct effects, we allow for indirect effects of fiscal policy by modeling the access of countries to worldwide available technology as a function of fiscal policy and other variables. Empirically, we propose and implement a nonlinear version of the common correlated effects pooled (CCEP) estimator of Pesaran (Econometrica 74(4):967-1012, 2006). The estimation results show that through the direct channel, budget deficits harm TFP. A shift toward productive expenditures has a strong positive impact on TFP, whereas a shift toward social transfers reduces TFP. Through the indirect channel, significant positive effects on a country's access to global technology come from reducing the statutory corporate tax rate and from reducing barriers to trade.","[Everaert, Gerdie; Heylen, Freddy] Univ Ghent, Sherppa, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Schoonackers, Ruben] Natl Bank Belgium, Res Dept, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Schoonackers, Ruben] Univ Ghent, Res Dept, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",Ghent University; European Central Bank; National Bank of Belgium; Ghent University,"Schoonackers, R (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Belgium, Res Dept, Berlaimontlaan 14, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",gerdie.everaert@ugent.be; freddy.heylen@ugent.be; Ruben.Schoonackers@nbb.be,,,"Flemish government (Steunpunt Fiscaliteit en Begroting - Vlaanderen); Belgian Program on Interuniversity Poles of Attraction; Belgian State, Federal Office for scientific, technical and cultural affairs, contract UAP [P 6/07]","Flemish government (Steunpunt Fiscaliteit en Begroting - Vlaanderen); Belgian Program on Interuniversity Poles of Attraction(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); Belgian State, Federal Office for scientific, technical and cultural affairs, contract UAP","We thank the associate editor, two anonymous referees, Sarah Balliu, Tim Buyse, Marina Emiris, Maud Nautet, Raf Wouters, Luc Van Meensel, and the members of SHERPPA for constructive comments and discussions during the development of this paper.

With the implementation of the Moroccan Green Plan (MGP), this sector was given a great importance especially regarding the extension of cultivated areas and improvement of the conditions of production. However, it still faces several difficulties related to the technical and social conditions of production. This work aims to: (a) identify, through a structured diagnosis, the constraints hindering the quality of olive oil production by the groups involved in this activity, (b) estimate the capacity of these groups to produce an olive oil with a standard quality, and (c) determine the potential of the olive oil production for a future quality label as a distinctive sign of origin and quality (SDOQ). The field work was carried out through the combination of two complementary methodological steps: a survey via a questionnaire led with 15 groups including more than 300 fanners, and a diagnosis of the olive oil production units, based on check lists. Diagnosis of units with a SDOQ showed that such a quality label can be an effective means to improve the oil standard quality. However, the SDOQ label leads to a higher price of the oil, due to the costs of production and certification. This label is also hampered by the weakness of collective action, and consumer ignorance of the importance of quality labels, which may jeopardize the sustainability of SDOQ.","[Rouas, Siham; Rahmani, Mohamed] IAV Hassan II, Sect Ind Agr & Alimentaires, Dept Sci Alimentaires & Nutr, Rabat, Morocco; [El Antari, Abderraouf] INRA, Unite Ameliorat Plantes & Qualite, Lab Technol Agroalimentaire & Qualite, Marrakech, Morocco; [Baamal, E.] IAV Hassan II, Dept Stat & Informat Appl, Rabat, Morocco",,"Rouas, S (通讯作者)，IAV Hassan II, Sect Ind Agr & Alimentaires, Dept Sci Alimentaires & Nutr, Rabat, Morocco.",rouas23@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,4,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2015,14.0,3,,,,,22,28,,,,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,CX6SZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365833300003,0

Our results indicate that the non-oil commodity prices are useful in setting monetary policy in the 1970s and the beginning of 1980s, but the usefulness has disappeared completely since the early 1980s.

The support for the two latter policies is substantially higher than the support for congestion charging, which is only supported by a majority in Stockholm. Self-interest is important for the formation of the opinion to all three policies. However, fundamental values and general political views, indicated by four attitudinal factors, are even more important in forming opinions towards the three transport policies. Of all attitudinal factors, the one indicating environmental concern most influences the support for all policies. Equity concerns, however, increase the support for free public transport and opposition to taxation increases the support for building more roads. Our results further suggest that the opinions towards free public transport and building more roads can be mapped along the left right political axis, where Environment and Equity are to the left and Pricing and Taxation are to the right. However, the opinion towards congestion charging cuts right through the political spectrum. The impact of the fundamental values and self-interest variables are similar for Stockholm and Helsinki, indicating that even if experience increases the overall support for charging, it does not change the relative strength of different political arguments to any major extent.

The results indicate that the effect of uncertainty on the interest rates has led to a more cautious monetary policy stance by the monetary authorities consistent with a large body of literature that recognizes that an excessively activist policy can increase economic instability. The results further show that uncertainty about the state of the economy clusters around the financial crisis periods in 2003 and from 2007 to 2009.

We find no evidence of asymmetry for aggregate stock returns, and only very limited evidence for 49 industry-level portfolios. Moreover, these asymmetries do not match up well with conventional views regarding energy-dependent sectors of the economy. Instead, asymmetries are more likely driven by the effect of oil price innovations on expected and/or realized demand. We inquire whether the size of the shock matters in that doubling the size of the shock more (or less) than doubles the size of the response, finding that the effect of a 2.s.d innovation is just about double the magnitude of the impact of a 1.s.d innovation. Furthermore, we find no support for the conjecture that shocks that exceed a threshold have an asymmetric effect on stock returns.","[Alsalman, Zeina] Oakland Univ, Sch Business Adm, Dept Econ, Rochester, MI 48309 USA; [Herrera, Ana Maria] Univ Kentucky, Gatton Coll Business & Econ 355Z, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",Oakland University; University of Kentucky,"Herrera, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, Gatton Coll Business & Econ 355Z, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",alsalman@oakland.edu; amherrera@uky.edu,"Alsalman, Zeina/JPL-1652-2023","Herrera, Ana Maria/0000-0003-3583-2555",,,,,35,60,61,0,26,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2015,36.0,3,,,,,171,188,,10.5547/01956574.36.3.zals,0.0,,,18,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CK8CN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356466100007,0

While the basic constitutional features of the European Union have remained stable, EU activity has expanded to an unprecedented degree. This form of integration without supranationalism is no exception or temporary deviation from traditional forms of European integration. Rather, it is a distinct phase of European integration, what is called 'the new intergovernmentalism' in this article. This approach to post-Maastricht integration challenges theories that associate integration with transfers of competences from national capitals to supranational institutions and those that reduce integration to traditional socioeconomic or security-driven interests. This article explains the integration paradox in terms of transformations in Europe's political economy, changes in preference formation and the decline of the 'permissive consensus'. It presents a set of six hypotheses that develop further the main claims of the new intergovernmentalism and that can be used as a basis for future research.","[Bickerton, Christopher J.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Hodson, Dermot] Univ London, Birkbeck, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Puetter, Uwe] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary",University of Cambridge; University of London; Central European University,"Bickerton, CJ (通讯作者)，Dept Polit & Int Studies POLIS, 7 West Rd, Cambridge CB3 9DT, England.",cb799@cam.ac.uk,,"Puetter, Uwe/0000-0002-0568-4208",,,,,93,373,382,8,119,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This study investigates whether the approved black applicants are likely charged higher interest rates than their white counterparts. Using data from three waves of the U.S. Survey of Consumer Finance, our results suggest that black borrowers on average pay about 29 basis points more than comparable white borrowers. We also find that rate disparity mainly occurs to young borrowers with low education as well as those borrowers whose income and credit disqualify them for prime lending rates. Furthermore, among borrowers in the higher rate groups, black women seem to receive much more disparate treatment than black men. We conclude that, while the racial disparity in mortgage rates is widespread between black and white borrowers, it is the more financially vulnerable black women who suffer the most.","[Cheng, Ping] Florida Atlantic Univ, Coll Business, Dept Finance, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Lin, Zhenguo; Liu, Yingchun] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Finance, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Lin, ZG (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Finance, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA.",pcheng@fau.edu; zlin@fullerton.edu; yiliu@fullerton.edu,,,,,,,30,31,40,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We find instead evidence of referee opportunism. The fact that referred recruits have better observed characteristics at the time of recruitment suggests that army recruiters may have been aware of this problem and sought to compensate for lower-than-average unobserved quality.","[Fafchamps, Marcel] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Moradi, Alexander] Univ Sussex, CSAE, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Moradi, Alexander] Univ Stellenbosch, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stanford University; University of Sussex; Stellenbosch University,"Fafchamps, M (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,British Academy Small Research grant [SG-45045]; Economic and Social Research Council First grant [RES-061-25-0456],British Academy Small Research grant; Economic and Social Research Council First grant,"We benefited from comments by participants at the 2009 Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE) Annual Conference, 2009 World Economic History Congress, 2010 Econometric Society World Congress, 2010 Meeting of the European Economic Association and seminar participants at the London School of Economics, Oxford, Sussex, and the Paris School of Economics.

We analyze three waves of survey data on fishermen and fishing villages in Aceh, Indonesia, following the 2004 tsunami. We categorize four organizational structures based on whether and to whom donors contract aid implementation. Compared to bilateral contracting between donors and implementers, donors that vertically integrate and do their own implementation offer the highest-quality housing as rated by village heads and have fewer counts of faults, such as leaky roofs and cracked walls, as reported by fishermen. However, they shade in quality as they lose dominance as the leading aid agency in a village. Domestic implementers and the government agency that was responsible for significant portions of aid delivery provide significantly lower-quality aid. We also examine how the imposition of shared ownership, the primary social agenda for boat aid agencies, affects boat aid quality. We find that village and fishing leaders steer poor-quality boats toward those whom shared ownership was imposed upon, often lower-status fishermen.","[Henderson, J.

Our evidence suggests that in the sectors, natural resources extraction and refining, construction, retail, food processing, beverages and tobacco, and utilities, a less stringent environmental policy in the host country, significantly attract FDI. What is important for these pollution haven effects is not only regulation but also enforcement of environmental policy. In contrast to earlier results, it is not only footloose industries that display pollution haven effects, but also the traditional pollution-intensive industries. But for the machines, electronics and automotive and transportation and communication sectors, a more stringent and better enforced environmental policy attracts more FDI as this may help their reputation for sustainable management and CSR. These sectors display green haven effects.

Such co-operation aims to engage third countries in migration control mechanisms in exchange for enhanced legal migration opportunities, yet this externalization of migration policy is highly selective with regard to both participating Member States and third countries. In this paper we develop a three-level game perspective to explain why Member States and third countries participate in EU external migration policy initiatives. The three-level game links three sets of actors in two strategic interactions: Member States, EU institutions and third countries. We argue that two factors determine the outcome of negotiations: the cost of no agreement and the autonomy of central decision-makers. The model is illustrated by the successful and failed Mobility Partnership negotiations between EU Member States, the European Commission and, respectively, Cape Verde and Senegal.","[Reslow, Natasja; Vink, Maarten] Maastricht Univ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Vink, Maarten] European Univ Inst, Fiesole, FI, Italy",Maastricht University; European University Institute,"Reslow, N (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Fac Law, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",n.reslow@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Vink, Maarten/P-3846-2019","Vink, Maarten/0000-0001-7143-4859; Reslow, Natasja/0000-0003-4382-6809",Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the framework of the IS-Academy cooperation on Migration and Development,Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the framework of the IS-Academy cooperation on Migration and Development,This research was supported by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the framework of the IS-Academy cooperation on Migration and Development (2009-2014).

This paper proposes an integrated approach for analyzing the efficiency and performance of mutual funds. The methodology combines data envelopment analysis (DEA) with a multicriteria decision aid methodology. DEA is employed to assess the relative efficiency of mutual funds in terms of their return, capital flow, gross expense ratio, turnover rate, and risk. In a second stage, a multicriteria approach is employed to develop an overall performance measure on the basis of the DEA efficiency results. The resulting model evaluates all mutual funds in a common basis and enables comparisons over time. The methodology is applied to a sample of more than 500 US equity mutual funds over the period 2003-2010. The analysis is implemented under three different time-window periods (one, three, and five year evaluations). The results obtained for portfolios constructed on the basis of our global performance measure, Sharpe ratio and Morningstar rating system are useful since they provide significant economic evidence in favor of our global performance measure.

Based on a three dimensional geometric approach, we provide a geometric analysis of the non-transitivity of the collective preference relations obtained by majority rule based on difference in support.

A disaggregate activity purpose classification including both in-home and out-of-home activity pursuits is used because of the travel demand relevance of out-of-home pursuits, as well as to examine both mobility-related and general time-use related social exclusion and time poverty issues. The study uses the Nested Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value (MDCNEV) model, which recognizes that time-decisions entail the choice of participating in one or more activity purposes along with the amount of time to invest in each chosen activity purpose, and allows generic correlation structures to account for common unobserved factors that might impact the choice of multiple alternatives. The 2010 American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data is used for the empirical analysis. A major finding of the study is that the presence of a child in dual-earner households not only leads to a reduction in in-home non-work activity participation (excluding child care activities) but also a substantially larger decrease in out-of-home non-work activity participation (excluding child care and shopping activities), suggesting a higher level of mobility-related social exclusion relative to overall time-use social exclusion. To summarize, the results in the paper underscore the importance of considering household structure in activity-based travel demand models, as well as re-designing work policies in the United States to facilitate a reduction in work-family conflict in dual-earner families.

The first approach extracts the seasonal component of the individual variables before estimating the model, while the alternative uses the non seasonally adjusted data in a model that endogenously accounts for seasonal adjustment.

This provided the context for significant migration to the North after 2004. While research highlights migrant experiences not dissimilar to those in other parts of the UK and Ireland after 2004 it also suggests that a number of reported experiences result from the reproduction of one aspect of a new sectarian dispensation. Traditional sectarianism, while typically sustaining differential access to labour markets and other resources according to socio-economic advantage, was remade in the 1998 peace-settlement': a new sectarianism was institutionalized. While not impacting on all migrants, neo-sectarianism now encounters neo-liberalism, the out-workings of which do impact on many. Moreover, experiences of some reveal important and so far unreported features of an accommodation between agent-beneficiaries of the peace-settlement' and neo-liberalism.","[Garvey, Brian] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow G1 1XU, Lanark, Scotland; [Stewart, Paul] Univ Strathclyde, Sociol Work & Employment, Glasgow G1 1XU, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde; University of Strathclyde,"Stewart, P (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Graham Hills Bldg,50 Richmond St, Glasgow G1 1XU, Lanark, Scotland.",paul.stewart.100@strath.ac.uk,,"Garvey, Brian/0000-0003-1931-8679",,,,,45,4,4,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

After characterizing the Portuguese tourism market, the authors undertake an empirical analysis, based on a panel data analysis for the Portuguese regions classified by NUTs II and for the period 1990-2007.

There is, however, one substantial innovation: the euro area's building of its capacity to deal with liquidity crises in member states. This article seeks to explain why the governments, which initially seemed to converge on a euro-area-only approach, decided to shape their crisis management structures around an external actor, the International Monetary Fund. It argues that the concept of learning under severe time constraints and external pressure helps to understand the sudden decisions taken on crisis management and governance reform which embed the IMF in the euro area. The analysis identifies learning in three areas crucial for the design of the crisis management set-up: in the field of practical lending and programme implementation, in the understanding of the nature of the crisis and in the evolving acknowledgement of the incompleteness of the euro area's governance set-up.","German Marshall Fund, Berlin, Germany",,"Schwarzer, D (通讯作者)，German Marshall Fund, Berlin, Germany.",dschwarzer@gmfus.org,,,,,,,26,10,10,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This research note examines the differences in business climate perceptions in North Carolina between executives in companies receiving tax credits for business investment and job creation activities and executives in companies not receiving tax credits. Both groups rank the availability of skilled labor as the primary factor influencing business climate. In addition, executives in both groups prefer overall tax reductions rather than select tax incentives to improve the state's economy. Contrary to the belief among many economic development practitioners that tax credits are a motivating factor for firms to engage in economic development, only 30% of executives in incented companies were aware that their company had received a state economic development tax credit.","[Jolley, G.

We adopt an urban economics model of monocentric city, then a polycentric city, with two different residential areas: suburbia, where there is access to a sewer system and the residential lot size is small, and exurbia, where there is no access to sewerage and the residential lot size is larger to accommodate the sanitary arrangements to meet the regulation on individual septic systems. According to the abatement efficiency gap between wastewater treatment technologies, improving water quality may be achieved at the expense of higher or lower urban spread. We also conduct an analysis of a polycentric city to highlight how asymmetric decision making between primary and secondary cities may have beneficial consequences at the local level, but be detrimental to aggregate environmental performance of the polycentric city.

More specifically, we use a hybrid choice model where latent variables not only enter into utility but also inform assignment to latent classes. Using a discrete choice experiment we analyze the effects of weather (temperature, rain, and snow), cycling time, slope, cycling facilities (bike lanes), and traffic on cycling decisions by members of Cornell University (in an area with cold and snowy winters and hilly topography). We show that cyclists can be separated into two segments based on a latent factor that summarizes cycling skills and experience. Specifically, cyclists with more skills and experience are less affected by adverse weather conditions. By deriving the median of the ratio of the marginal rate of substitution for the two classes, we show that rain deters cyclists with lower skills from bicycling 2.5 times more strongly than those with better cycling skills. The median effects also show that snow is almost 4 times more deterrent to the class of less experienced cyclists. We also model the effect of external restrictions (accidents, crime, mechanical problems) and physical condition as latent factors affecting cycling choices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Contrary to some existing studies, our empirical results provide no support for the argument that the traditional Keynesian interest rate channel is weak or does not operate effectively in the MENA region: both private consumption and investment in the MENA EMEs are sensitive to movements in real interest rates (although, in the case of private consumption, not independently of the level of financial development). We also find that interest rate elasticities of private consumption and private investment vary significantly with the level of development of the domestic financial market in the MENA EMES comparable to that in IT countries. Finally, our findings suggest that liberalization of the capital account has a significantly positive impact on private sector demand in MENA EMEs similar to that in the IT EMEs.","[Mukherjee, Sanchita] San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Bhattacharya, Rina] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; International Monetary Fund,"Mukherjee, S (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",sanchitam@gmail.com; rbhattacharya@imf.org,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Such a field of interest could be road safety. Road safety benchmarking can include several indicators, ranging from performance indicated by crash statistics, to indicators that also account for consequences in costs or the underlying state of the road safety system and relevant organisation and processes at actor level. The structure and culture of a territory is identified as a basic context of road safety performance. This is regarded as important information to use in grouping of territories to get more homogenous or equal and comparable conditions to learn from 'the best in class'. The main aim of this study is to assess the usability of different groupings using the physical structure for benchmarking road safety performance at local territorial level. A traditional grouping of municipalities in the Netherlands was compared with a simple grouping of these municipalities based on their level of urbanisation and an advanced grouping in which more indicators such as differences in demography, growth and road structure were taken into account. As in other studies, urbanisation showed to be the most predominant structural factor for grouping local territories and related to differences in road safety performance. However, if information would be needed for specific target groups, other factors like age and gender distribution or the distribution of the road network can provide valuable additional insight and better homogenous starting points for benchmarking. Especially benchmarking of rural territories may profit from such extra distinctive characteristics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Aarts, L.

Using a Bayesian framework, a TAR process and a STAR process are formally compared within an unobserved components model of output, augmented with a monetary policy variable. The Bayesian model comparison favors the notion that the dynamics are nonlinear and better described by a smooth transition between regimes, which suggests that aggregation plays a role in the dynamics between monetary policy and output. This evidence is further supported by the results of a model that uses output data at the sectoral level: when more disaggregated data are employed, the transition between regimes is more abrupt. Moreover, the results show that, when the transition between regimes is smooth, large monetary policy shocks identified as the residuals of a VAR are neutral, consistent with the implications of menu-costs models.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Labovitz Sch Business & Econ, Duluth, MN 55812 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth,"Donayre, L (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Labovitz Sch Business & Econ, 1318 Kirby Dr, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.",adonayre@d.umn.edu,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The authors find that, after controlling for proximity to the beach, ocean views, the specific characteristics of the homes and neighbourhood effects, proximity to surf breaks is a statistically significant contributor to overall home value.

In this sense, the quality of such infrastructure and how widespread it is, the distribution and capacity of logistics facilities in a country, as well as the number of private operators and their degree of specialisation, all play an increasingly important role in the design of business strategies aimed at increasing a country's share of the international market. Until recently, however, availability and access to logistics services have been considered secondary factors when defining business competitiveness. This paper estimates an augmented gravity model of trade that specifically includes logistics and transport infrastructure indicators as explanatory variables. The model is estimated by using bilateral exports from 19 Spanish regions to 64 destinations (45 countries and 19 Spanish regions) with data for the period 2003-2007. The findings show that logistics is indeed important for the analysis of trade flows in goods and they highlight the importance of logistics measures at the regional level. In particular, the number, size and quality of logistics facilities positively influence export flows. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed estimators share with quantile regression the advantage of exploring the shape of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable. When there are a factor structure and co-movement for economic variables, the underlying unobservable factors (or common components) are more efficient instruments. The proposed estimators achieve the optimality in the following sense: The method of principal component consistently estimates the space spanned by the ideal instruments which are utilized to control the endogeneity in the quantile regression analysis. Analyzing the asymptotic properties of the estimator, we assume that a panel of observable instruments follows a factor structure and the endogenous variables also share the same unobservable factors. Using the estimated factors as instruments, we show that the FIVQR estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. Furthermore, when compared in the GMM framework, the proposed estimator is more efficient than the GMM estimator using many observable instruments directly. Monte Carlo studies demonstrate that the proposed estimators perform well. For an empirical application, we use a firm-level panel data set consisting of trading volumes and returns on DJIA to explore the asymmetric return-volume relation, controlling the endogeneity problem with the estimated factor instruments.","Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei 100, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chen, JE (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, 21 Hsu Chow Rd, Taipei 100, Taiwan.",jauer@ntu.edu.tw,"Chen, Jau-er/ABY-3817-2022",,,,,,25,3,3,1,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The developed dynamic multiple linear regression model of Croatian hotel firms evaluated by the two step Arellano-Bond estimator is used as a basis for analysis. Estimation of model parameters suggests that the dynamics of firms in transition conditions are not just a reflection of random effects, but are also affected by size and ownership factors.

We provide a new explanation that it could be due to the restrictive linear functional form specification on the covariates and the reduced form. For the parameters of endogenous regressors, we propose two kernel-based semiparametric IV estimators that relax the tight functional form assumption on the covariates and the reduced form. They have explicit algebraic structures and are easily implemented without numerical optimizations. We show that they are consistent, asymptotically normally distributed, and reach the semiparametric efficiency bound. A Monte Carlo study demonstrates that our estimators perform well in finite samples. We apply the proposed estimators to estimate the return to schooling in Card (Aspects of labour market behavior: essays in honour of John Vanderkamp. University of Toronto Press, Toronto, pp. 201-222, 1995). We find that the semiparametric estimates of the return to schooling are much smaller and more precise than the 2SLS estimate, and the difference largely comes from the misspecification in the linear reduced form.","[Yao, Feng] W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA; [Zhang, Junsen] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",West Virginia University; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Yao, F (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA.",feng.yao@mail.wvu.edu; jszhang@cuhk.edu.hk,"Yao, Feng/O-1308-2013",,,,,,51,1,1,0,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Despite the importance of SI, its genetic basis in citrus is poorly understood. Two clementine genotypes showing divergent behaviour related to self-pollen rejection ('Comune', self-incompatible'; and 'Monreal', self-compatible) were chosen as model to study the molecular events occurring during pollen-pistil interaction and self-incompatible response. In a previous work, the comparative analysis of the floral transcriptome of these two clementine genotypes led to the identification of a set of candidate genes related to SI. The identified genes showed no homology to genes involved in SI mechanism of other species and many of them lacked annotation. Functional analyses were therefore needed to unravel their function and to confirm their role in citrus progamic phase. Our attention has been focused on 3 uncharacterized genes over-represented in the 'Comune' transcriptome whose expression drastically increased in concomitance with the stop of pollen tube elongation. These genes, due to the abundance in aspartic acid residues in their deduced protein sequences, have been named Citrus clementina aspartic-acid rich (CcAsp-rich) protein encoding genes. A first step of the functional characterization consisted in their over-expression in tobacco plants.

We hypothesize that institutional investors are reluctant to hold stocks of firms with high distress risk and that a decline in their holding or trading lowers distress stocks' prices and causes the returns of these stocks to decrease. Our empirical evidences support these hypotheses. We further find that although both institutional holding and trading can capture the distress risk puzzle, institutional trading seems to be superior. In addition, we document that the holding or trading by either independent or short term institutional investors plays a significant role in explaining this puzzle while the holding or trading by dependent or long term institutional investors does not.

The purpose, in particular, is to investigate how researchers and practitioners have developed their research and what are the next Knowledge Management trends in the academic environment. Design/methodology/approach - The literature review focused on the analysis of three journals: Journal of Knowledge Management, Journal of Intellectual Capital, and Academy of Management Learning and Education. These journals have been selected in an international ranking on the portal SCImago Journal & Country Rank. The research was carried out based on three specific steps: a first selection process based on keywords on the websites of the three journals; in the second step we have analyzed the contents of the abstracts of individual articles, to identify those most related to KM in Universities; in the third phase we collected the articles relevant to our investigation, in order to examine in detail the content and to make a classification. Originality/value - The article aims to provide a literature review related to the topic of Knowledge Management in the educational context, identifying future trends both from a theoretical or empirical side. Practical implications - This research at the moment is a second step of a larger work that will involve the analysis of other journals. The research, currently, is still a work in progress, and it requires new investigations. The analysis will be extended including other journals and the most relevant references found in the papers. The selection and the deepening of the above items, specially classified, based on the model of Earl (2001), made it possible to see that the survey on Knowledge Management, as part of the education sector, is focusing on the basis of data currently collected, to the following directions: the use of information technology or management; for business purposes, and the adoption of organizational methods to create, share and use knowledge.","[De Nito, Ernesto; Gentile, Teresa Anna Rita] Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Dipartimento Sci Giurid Stor Econ & Sociali, I-88100 Catanzaro, Italy; [Vesperi, Walter] Univ Messina, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-98122 Messina, Italy",Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro; University of Messina,"Gentile, TAR (通讯作者)，Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Dipartimento Sci Giurid Stor Econ & Sociali, Campus Univ,Viale Europa, I-88100 Catanzaro, Italy.",,,,,,,,76,0,0,0,10,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1515,1527,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200117,0

In this paper an attention will be aimed to the Czech and Swedish population and their mortality in selected years (mortality in higher ages will be modelled by Gompertz-Makeham function and its modification).","[Dotlacilova, Petra] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Math, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Dotlacilová, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Math, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",petra.dotlacilova@vse.cz,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,370,380,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000036,0

Nowadays, it occupies a prominent position in discussions on how to include non-financial indicators in reports on financial stability indicators. In April 2014, the EU adopted a directive, according to which, large companies with more than 500 employees would have to issue reports on their Social Responsibility activities within the context of non-financial reporting. For Czech companies, it is likely that this requirement will take effect from 2017. The use of CSR standards is a voluntary step for a company to take when introducing new ways of communication with stakeholders. It also helps companies to define their position in relation to CSR. The paper identifies and analyses the reporting and standards in the area of CSR from the point of view of the conditions pertaining in the CR. The outcomes of this paper may be predictions as to the prospects for non-financial reporting in the CR, as pragmatic arguments prevail within the business community.","[Dvorakova, Zuzana; Quigley, Martin David John] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Human Resources Management, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Krasnikova, Daria] CSC Comp Sci Sro, Order Cash, Prague 15800, Jinonice, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Dvorakova, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Human Resources Management, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",zdvorak@vse.cz; Daria.Krasnikova@gmail.com; martin.quigley@vse.cz,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,381,390,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000037,0

This project examines the on-farm cost-benefit of a number of citrus practices that have been promoted to industry. The project utilizes active learning principles by facilitating grower participation with trials (planning, maintenance and reporting). Over 20 trials have been implemented in the past two seasons. Trials included ground and foliar potassium applications, pruning, foliar fruit size sprays, kaolin clay foliar sprays and crop regulation practices. Trials have resulted in cost savings with reduced potassium application. The project developed tools and methods to enable efficient and effective in-field collection and analysis of data. This enabled the project to implement more trials. Single tree replicated trials (RCBD) are the favoured method to conduct trials. Grower feedback has been very positive indicating that it has helped them make improved and cost effective management decisions.

In the international arena some organizations have enacted several frameworks and guidelines in order to provide an operational guidance for the disclosure of non-financial information, in particular on social and governance issues, such as the gender diversity. Giving the growing interest on these issues, the main research objectives are: 1) an overview on the gender diversity disclosure both in terms of mandatory and voluntary reporting; 2) a comparison of the gender diversity information disclosed in Annual Reports (2009) and in Integrated Reports (2013) of a sample of South African listed companies. Design/methodology/approach -. We developed a Gender Diversity Index (GDI) based on the items required by the principles and guidelines issued by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI G3, 2006 and GRI G4, 2013). The items regarding gender diversity refers to employment, occupational health and safety, training and education, diversity and equal opportunity and equal remuneration for women and men. This disclosure index is used in some bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses, to investigate the following research question, i.e. whether and to what extent, GDI affects the firm growth and performance. Originality/value - This research may contribute to the existing literature in regard to three different fields: 1) the studies on the field of non-financial information disclosure, in particular on Social and Governance issues and their impact on the emerging financial markets (Cormier et al., 2011; De Klerk et al., 2012); 2) the studies on the field of corporate governance disclosure focused on compliance with the issues required by the Corporate Governance Codes (Nalikka, 2009; Colaco et al., 2011; Ntim et al., 2012; 3) the studies on the field of gender diversity focused on the role of women in the board of directors and senior managers and on their influence on firm's financial performance. Practical implications -. The research could provide useful tips on how to disclose the non-financial information on gender diversity in corporate reporting and how these items can influence the financial performance. Limitations of the research carried out: 1) size of the sample and 2) analysis focused on only country, South Africa. In addition Integrated Reporting is at an early stage, in fact there is a lack of referral guidelines and the role of accountants in the preparation of this new report is difficult and crucial.","[Fortuna, Fabio; Paoloni, Paola] Univ N Cusano, Rome, Italy; [Doni, Federica] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Business Adm Management Finance & Law, I-20126 Milan, Italy",Niccolo Cusano Online University; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Doni, F (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Business Adm Management Finance & Law, Via Bicocca Arcimboldi 8, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",,"Doni, Federica/L-1047-2017","DONI, FEDERICA/0000-0002-6581-9530",,,,,46,0,0,1,12,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,913,928,,,,,,16,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200069,0

After a discussion of relevant risk sources, the impact of price and production risk on revenue volatility for selected fruit and vegetable crops is presented based on variance decomposition. Finally, a systematic overview of currently available risk management instruments for fruit and vegetable farms is provided. Results indicate that there is a wide range of relevant risk sources. In this context, the strong dependence of producer prices on quality characteristics is noted. Revenue volatility analysis shows that the risk profile differs from crop to crop indicating the need for crop specific risk management strategies. The analysis of available risk management instruments shows that farmers can implement several instruments to manage production risks. However, insurance is only partly available. There are only a few instruments available to manage price risks. Accordingly, it is important to develop appropriate price risk management strategies to cope with increasing market risks.","[Hartwich, A.; Gandorfer, M.; Bitsch, V.] Tech Univ Munich, D-80290 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Hartwich, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, D-80290 Munich, Germany.",,,"Gandorfer, Markus/0000-0002-0624-153X",,,,,32,2,2,0,5,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-91-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1103.0,,,,,,151,157,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1103.23,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BF0DT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378599800023,0

This claim is supported by cross country regressions, but the regressions assume that credit intermediation is measured accurately before modern financial intermediaries arrive. If traditional intermediaries were mobilizing large amounts of financial capital before banks or other modern intermediaries appear, then the strength of the relationship between financial development and economic growth would be cast into doubt. Using an original panel dataset from nineteenth-century France, we provide the first estimates of how much financial capital key traditional intermediaries (notaries) were mobilizing for an entire economy during its first century of economic growth, and we analyze the lending that the notaries made possible in French mortgage market. The amount of capital they mobilized turns out to be large. We then analyze the effect that financial deepening had on the notaries as banks spread and find that the banks' and notaries' services were in all likelihood complements. The implication is that the link between financial development and economic growth may therefore be weaker than is assumed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Since 2000 Croatian government has invested decisive efforts into founding a framework for university-industry cooperation and commercialization of research, but these efforts only slowly produce the expected results. This paper seeks to contribute to the growing body of literature on the Triple Helix Systems and entrepreneurial university by discussing the possibilities and examples of knowledge exchange and networking at a HEI which takes steps to enhance its potential for academic entrepreneurship. Based on the available faculty documents, as well as the results of interviews with faculty members, the study concludes that increasingly staff at the Faculty of Economics in Osijek engage in knowledge exchange and maintain cooperation with partners in industry and government.

Yet, cognitive science and best practice tools have had little to say on this topic because for many years perception, action, and cognition have been studied without taking their role in social interaction related to BMI seriously. However the establishment of a room for social BMI interaction is essential at the very first moment of the meeting between the involved participants - who often are different and unknown to each other. It lays the fundament for knowledge sharing and learning to the BMI project - and the ground for whether the BMI project will succeed and even be implemented. The paper aims to understand the cognitive mechanisms at the very first moment of the BMI process supporting participants' ability and motivation to act together with each other in the BMI projects. The paper address knowledge sharing and learning in high risk and sensitive areas of BMI - where business open their core business, core BM and core competences - and expects trust. Design/methodology/approach The paper provides 2 case studies in 2 different BM projects and BM ecosystems. The research methodology was case research carried out from 2007 to 2015. Originality/values This paper puts in evidence different understandings related to cognitive mechanisms at the very first moment of the BMI meeting between business in BMI projects. The paper seeks to give more understanding of how to support BMI participants' ability to act together with each other in BMI projects addressing the question How to increase and speed up the first moment motivation to achieve knowledge sharing in critical and risky BMI projects? There has not been much research on the cognitive processes and how to establish room for BMI knowledge sharing at the very first moment of complex and risky BMI project. This study extends recent stream of BMI research indicating that facilitation and the ability to establish a trusted and secure knowledge and learning sharing BMI platform at the very first moment may be a useful tool for managing BM risk and improving speed in BMI projects. Moving fast along the learning curve in the first moment seems to require some very special arrangement especially when BMI takes place in strategic critical areas. Although initial adoption of early involvement was intended to reduce costs - both in short and long term perspective, results indicated that early involvement serves to reduce perceptions of BMI risk at the businesses involved. Practical implications The paper illustrates what is at stake and needed for business to exchange knowledge in BMI projects that are complex, are risky and that involves BM's that are core and strategic to their business.","[Lindgren, Peter] Aarhus Univ, Dept Business & Technol, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark; [Uldall, Lena] Uldall Consult Aps, DK-8370 Hadsten, Denmark; [Aagard, Anna Beth] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Strategy & Management, DK-4200 Slagelse, Denmark",Aarhus University; University of Southern Denmark,"Lindgren, P (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Business & Technol, Birk Centerpk 15, DK-7400 Herning, Denmark.",,,"Aagaard, Annabeth/0000-0002-6213-0682",,,,,30,0,0,0,12,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1654,1670,,,,,,17,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200127,0

We estimate the trends using quantile regressions and by analyzing detailed height data from five selected studies. Both methods yield an average decennial increase in height of 1-1.1 cm, and 0.9 and 1,2-1.3 cm for boys of upper and lower socioeconomic status (SES), respectively. SES differences in heights of 9-11 cm are observed up to the late 1940s. However, boys born after the 1930s exhibit substantial convergence in height between socioeconomic groups, driven by an increase in height of middle and lower SES boys of 1.5 and 1.4-2 cm per decade, respectively. As a result, SES differences in height decreased to 5 cm in 1990s. Since these changes occurred in a context of moderate economic growth and persistent income inequality, we argue that our findings are associated with the emergence and expansion of social policies in Chile since the 1940s, which delivered steady improvements in health, nutrition and living conditions.

To restore the ecological balance of this area, the water quality parameters from the source to the mouth must be carefully monitor.

Our research focuses on the risk behaviour of apple farmers in two distinct regions in Germany. Based on data on the risk preferences, risk perceptions and risk management choices collected from 134 apple farmers, we conduct a quantitative analysis of their risk behaviour. The analysis forms the basis for the development of a portfolio-based decision support tool that aids extension staff and practitioners in designing optimal farm programs. In this paper, we deal with risk preferences and risk perceptions among these farmers. A multiple price list technique with two different framings and a self-assessment via Likert scales considering different contexts are applied to test the hypothesis in our sample. Assessments of farmers' risk perception were collected directly through a two-phase question technique for different contexts. Our results suggest the existence of a stable underlying risk trait. However, different contexts lead to heterogeneous results for both self-assessed and experimentally elicited risk attitudes. We find that results of lottery experiments correspond well with the stated preferences in the domain of finance. Our observations indicate that the consideration of domains is of central importance in the analysis of risk attitudes and should not be ignored. Data from two different production areas allow for the detection of the effects of experience of downside events and risk perception.","[Roehrig, M.; Hardeweg, B.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Röhrig, M (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany.",,"Hardeweg, Bernd/I-2463-2016","Hardeweg, Bernd/0009-0008-5551-4531",,,,,14,0,0,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-91-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1103.0,,,,,,261,266,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1103.38,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BF0DT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378599800038,0

Novel and commercially significant scion and rootstock cultivars originating by natural mutation or directed hybridization were introduced during the past century. Significant genetic resource collections exist in many countries. A global citrus germplasm network was developed in 1997. Now that the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGR) has recognized Citrus as an Annex 1 crop, a global conservation strategy needs to be established. The objective of this workshop was to plan the development of this strategy. More than 60 delegates attended with representation from Argentina, Australia, Bhutan, Brazil, China, Columbia, France, Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, UAE, US, and Vietnam. Nine oral presentations were given describing multiple aspects of genebank operations, technologies and gaps in Brazil, China, France, Australia, Spain, and the US. A draft genebank survey questionnaire was presented to the group and comments and suggested changes for improvement were received. Citrus curators and genebank managers throughout the world will be surveyed for the status and health of their collections. The surveys will be received and compiled by collaborators at the University of California, Riverside, and at the USDA ARS Riverside. This information will be compiled and reported. The strategy will include background and history of the development of Citrus as a cultivated crop, conservation protocols, vulnerabilities, and recommendations for safeguarding Citrus germplasm. This strategy will be implemented through the Global Crop Diversity Trust with collaboration from the International Society for Horticultural Science and the international Citrus research community.","[Roose, Mikeal L.; Kahn, Tracy L.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Gmitter, Frederick G., Jr.] Univ Florida, Citrus Res & Educ Ctr, Lake Alfred, FL USA; [Lee, Richard] ARS, USDA, Natl Clonal Germplasm Repository Citrus & Dates, Riverside, CA USA; [Hummer, Kim] ARS, USDA, Natl Clonal Germplasm Repository, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA; [Machado, Marcos] Ctr APTA Citros Sylvio Moreira IAC, Lab Biotecnol, Cordeiropolis, Brazil; [Ashmore, Sarah] Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Ctr, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Ashmore, Sarah] Griffith Univ, Sch Biomol & Phys Sci, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Deng, Xiuxin] Huazhong Agr Univ HZAU, Coll Hort & Forestry, Minist Educ, Key Lab Hort Plant Biol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Ancillo, Gema; Vives, Mari C.] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain; [Volk, Gayle M.] ARS, USDA, NCGRP, Plant Germplasm Preservat Res Unit, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Luro, Francois] Inst Natl Rech Agron INRA, Genet & Ecophysiol Agrumes, Montfavet, France",University of California System; University of California Riverside; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Instituto Agronomico de Campinas (IAC); Griffith University; Griffith University; Huazhong Agricultural University; Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); INRAE,"Hummer, K (通讯作者)，ARS, USDA, Natl Clonal Germplasm Repository, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA.",Kim.Hummer@ars.usda.gov,"Vives, Maria C/F-6657-2018; Ancillo, Gema/ABF-8990-2020; Machado, Marcos Antonio/G-3582-2012","Vives, Maria C/0000-0001-6850-9696; Machado, Marcos Antonio/0000-0001-9780-3990; Hummer, Kim/0000-0003-4110-7501; Xiuxin, Deng/0000-0003-4490-4514",,,,,27,1,3,1,10,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,75,83,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600007,0

Varieties have been progressively released from Australian Post Entry Plant Quarantine with the final variety being field established in November 2011. Evaluation activities include standard fruit quality and yield determination as well as providing larger volumes of fruit from top-worked trees to approved agents for test marketing. Evaluation site visits to view PBR varieties are organised in conjunction with variety managers and fruit displays provided in the major citrus regions of Australia. New variety managers are encouraged to become part of the program and 10 new varieties have been included since 2011.

In the first part, the research focuses on the satisfaction of Czech people with their jobs, and remuneration, as well as the identification of prevailing attitudes to work and employee loyalty. The next section identifies the segments of the Czech labour market according to the perceived importance of selected aspects of working life. These segments are further characterized. Segmentation can be seen in marketing from different perspectives. In the field of human resources, segmentation is applicable primarily as psychographic and behavioural. Psychographic segmentation focuses on psychological or personality characteristics, attitudes and values of individuals in selected demographic groups. Both concepts are adequately reflected in this study. The research results provide a new perspective on the issues of employee recruitment, motivation and retention, which may be the real basis for the application of HR marketing in its complexity in organizations operating on the Czech labour market.","[Stritesky, Vaclav; Stritesky, Marek; Quigley, Martin John David] Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Strítesky, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic.",vaclav.stritesky@vse.cz; marek.stritesky@vse.cz; martin.quigley@vse.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1498,1507,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000143,0

However it is important to know the effect of this auxin under commercial industrial conditions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of postharvest application of TPA on the reduction of disorders associated to degreening in clementines in different commercial postharvest applications (by drencher and by low volume spraying in the handling line). The application of TPA by drencher significantly reduced the disorders of calyx senescence associated to degreening treatment in clementines, recommending 40 ppm of TPA as the most effective dose. The application of TPA by low volume spraying in the handling line treatments was effective on the reduction of calyx disorders, obtaining the best results with 100 ppm of TPA; nevertheless in the trials clementines exhibited low susceptibility to calyx disorders after degreening process.

A possible answer is through virtual health communities (or patient-centered eHealth): digital social networks where people share their clinical history, health information and treatments results. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for understanding those virtual health communities, identifying their models and main characteristics. Design/methodology/approach - Our main objective is to identify and systematize the overlapping research area between online social network and health sector. In order to accomplish this aim we conduct a first exploratory literature review. Originality/value - Information and Communication Technology (ICT) deeply changed the way in which organizations manage (collect, store, analyse, transmit and use) information and data. ICT also enabled and triggered business models in which external actors contribute in the production of information and knowledge valuable for the company (eg. open innovation, FLOSS, citizen-science programs). Health sector, due to the peculiarity of its nature and the sensitiveness of the information processed, has been one of the latest ones to take advantage of this new opportunity. The newness of the phenomenon, as well as the growing number of people using virtual health networks (VHN), call for a work of systematization of the emerging models and factors. Practical implications - In VHNs, a consistent number of patients (considered external to organizations in the traditional management/innovation models) voluntarily disclose their health information to other patients. Thus, even presenting some accuracy and truthfulness issues, nevertheless this model of information sharing constitutes an incredibly rich source of data for researchers (and potentially for pharmaceutical industries and health organizations). VHNs could integrate or expand the traditional pharmaceutical clinical trials; in such case, innovation will not be managed only internally by a company, but will be opened to patients' direct contribution.

That is why also the Czech Republic similarly as other developed countries tries to monitor the public sector performance last years. The paper analyses the current state of performance measurement in the Czech state administration and used performance indicators.

We examine Hansen's ideas and those of young economists associated with him, notably Evsey Domar, Everett Hagen, Benjamin Higgins, Alan Sweezy, and Paul Samuelson, who were the economists who kept the doctrine alive in the 1950s and to whom Summers and others taking up the idea recently turned. Their ideas are contrasted with the theories of stagnation associated with Josef Steindl and Joseph Schumpeter. It is a label for a historical thesis about the American economy, which, initially seen as distinct from Keynes General Theory, came to be seen as a theoretical proposition based on Keynesian theory. It is argued that the idea of secular stagnation had a political dimension, connected to the New Deal and the Cold War and changing conceptions of economic maturity.","[Backhouse, Roger E.] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Boianovsky, Mauro] Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, CP4302, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",University of Birmingham; Universidade de Brasilia,"Backhouse, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.;Boianovsky, M (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, CP4302, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",reb@bhouse.org.uk; mboianovsky@gmail.com,,,CNPq (Brazilian Research Council),CNPq (Brazilian Research Council)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),Mauro Boianovsky gratefully acknowledges a research grant from CNPq (Brazilian Research Council).,,120,43,47,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Using South Tyrol (ST) - a small region with a tourism-intensive economy situated in the North of Italy - as a case study, this article discusses a multiregional input-output (MRIO) framework for calculating the direct and indirect emissions embodied in tourist consumption of goods and services at a subnational level. Compared to more standard single-region implementations of the input-output approach, MRIO analysis offers a more accurate depiction of the amount of emissions, that is, embodied in imports, because it acknowledges that in the modern economy supply chains often stretch across multiple borders and that the carbon intensity of production can vary widely from one location to another. Operationalizing the framework has become relatively straightforward since a number of new global MRIO databases have become available in recent years. Furthermore, the analysis could easily be extended to other environmental externalities of tourism, where the model's capability to explicitly account for spatial spillovers might also be of interest. The modelling exercise at the heart of the article suggests that, over the course of 2010, the process of producing the goods and services consumed by tourists in ST resulted in 1092 kt CO(2)e of GHGs being emitted into the atmosphere. This is equivalent to average emissions of 191 kg CO(2)e per overnight visitor, 38 kg CO(2)e per night or 0.316 kg per euro of tourist expenditure. Direct emissions account for about one-fourth of the total. Almost four-fifths of total emissions appear to be the result of productive activities sited outside ST itself.","[Cai, Mattia] Free Univ Bolzano Bozen, Bolzano, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"Cai, M (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bolzano Bozen, Fac Econ & Management, Piazzetta Univ Univ Pl 1, I-39031 Brunico Bruneck, Italy.",mattia.cai@unibz.it,"Cai, Mattia/GWV-9996-2022",,,,,,37,7,7,3,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

First, when we classify REIT institutional investors by their legal type, we find that the ownership of pension funds (bank trusts) is negatively (positively) related to REIT crash risk. In addition, the trading of investment companies, including mutual funds, has become positively related to REIT crash risk in recent years. Next, when we classify REIT institutional investors by their investment behavior, we find that REIT crash risk is positively related to the trading of transient institutional investors, which trade frequently to maximize short-term gains. Moreover, the adverse impact of transient investors on REIT crash risk has worsened recently. These findings highlight the heterogeneous impacts of different types of institutional investors on REIT crash risk, which has important implications for REIT market participants and policymakers.","[An, Heng] Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Bryan Sch Business & Econ, Greensboro, NC 27402 USA; [Wu, Qun] Univ Nevada, Coll Business Adm, 1664 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Wu, Zhonghua] Florida Int Univ, Hollo Sch Real Estate, 1101 Brickell Ave,Suite 1100-S, Miami, FL 33131 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"An, H (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Greensboro, Bryan Sch Business & Econ, Greensboro, NC 27402 USA.;Wu, ZH (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Hollo Sch Real Estate, 1101 Brickell Ave,Suite 1100-S, Miami, FL 33131 USA.",h_an@uncg.edu; qunw@unr.edu; wuz@fiu.edu,"Wu, Qun/P-8762-2019",,Dean's Research Scholar Fund at the Bryan School; Florida International University through Hollo School of Real Estate; Tibor and Sheila Hollo Research Fellowship,Dean's Research Scholar Fund at the Bryan School; Florida International University through Hollo School of Real Estate; Tibor and Sheila Hollo Research Fellowship,"We are grateful to an anonymous referee, discussants and conference participants at the ARES, AREUEA, and FMA meetings.

My identification strategy employs a reduced-form model that uses variation in state-year house price changes, as well as variation in a homeowner's exposure to house price changes, based on pre-existing leverage. I find that house price declines cause migration to decrease for homeowners that have low equity, but that there is no effect for the most leveraged homeowners. Differences in default costs across states do not appear to affect the mobility of homeowners in negative equity. Housing lock-in effects are larger in the most recent recession, affecting both in-state and interstate migration.

This combined approach allowed us to test the internal validity of preferences for fast food meals across elicitation scenarios. The results showed that calorie information reduces the probability of selecting high calorie meals only in the questionnaire, while it did not have any significant impact on actual purchasing behavior in the field experiment. Thus, the findings show that there is a clear difference between the role of calorie information on immediate stated preference choices, and the relatively low level of responsiveness in real choices in a restaurant. We believe that the current results are quite suggestive, indicating the limits of predicting actual fast food behavior, and may open the way to using data sources that combine stated methods with field experiments.

Results reveal a positive impact of the knowledge, sensorial and interaction dimensions of the tourist experience in both models, and length of stay, age, place attachment and nationality also play a role.","[Kastenholz, Elisabeth; Eusebio, Celeste; Carneiro, Maria Joao] Univ Aveiro, DEGEIT, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro,"Kastenholz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Aveiro, DEGEIT, GOVCOPP Res Unit, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",elisabethk@ua.pt,"Carneiro, Maria João Alves/HDN-9049-2022; Kastenholz, Elisabeth/N-1458-2013; Carneiro, Maria João/ABW-2789-2022; Eusebio, Celeste/U-8527-2017","Kastenholz, Elisabeth/0000-0003-4700-0326; Carneiro, Maria/0000-0002-1682-6857; Eusebio, Celeste/0000-0002-2220-5483",Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [PTDC/CS-GEO/104894/2008]; COMPETE; QREN; FEDER; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/CS-GEO/104894/2008] Funding Source: FCT,Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); COMPETE; QREN; FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"The study is based on results obtained from the 3-year research project ORTE - 'The overall rural tourism experience and sustainable local community development' (PTDC/CS-GEO/104894/2008) financed by the Portuguese Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (co-financed by COMPETE, QREN and FEDER), started in June 2010 (see also http://cms.ua.pt/orte/).

In VNW elections, voters determine how many winners there are, as well as which candidates win. Common VNW elections include elections to bestow honorary status, such as enshrinement in a hall of fame, and elections to determine a shortlist of, say, job candidates for interviews. Such elections are VNW elections whenever the number of winners is not specified in advance. Multi-winner elections are often conducted by adapting standard procedures for single-winner elections. Approval balloting is particularly appropriate for multi-winner elections, as every ballot, and the set of winners, are subsets of the set of all candidates. Many methods of counting approval ballots appropriate to VNW elections are reviewed and illustrated, and their properties-desirable and undesirable-discussed.","[Kilgour, D.

An interrupted time series approach is utilized to detect the total effects of treaty change on the decision-making process. This study thus complements existing research on the effects of decision-making rules, by employing a design more robust to the challenge of endogeneity. The findings suggest that the Amsterdam treaty was very successful at increasing legislative efficiency. In contrast, the Nice treaty does not appear to have had a notable impact, and, more interestingly, neither does the Lisbon treaty.","[Bolstad, Jorgen] Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Cross, James P.] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",University of Oslo; University College Dublin,"Bolstad, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, ARENA Ctr European Studies, POB 1143 Blindern, Oslo, Norway.",jorgen.bolstad@arena.uio.no,"; Cross, James/F-4166-2016","Bolstad, Jorgen/0000-0002-7623-5741; Cross, James/0000-0001-8042-1099",,,,,35,6,7,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This is the question that this article seeks to answer. In the search for an answer, the article investigates the moral ( output) and procedural ( input) legitimacy of the recent competition law reforms. Following a discursive approach, the article looks into the roles played by institutions deliberating for citizens ( consumer organizations, European Parliament and the Union Courts) in the reform process. This inquiry results in the questioning of the reforms' legitimacy, and it also leads to broader conclusions regarding the legitimacy of multi-level governance: expert discourses overshadow potential deliberative qualities of networks, which exacerbates networks' legitimacy problems. Also, the input/output legitimacy dichotomy appears problematic, as expert policy-making in the absence of citizen participation does not guarantee policies resonating with public interest.","[Cengiz, Firat] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Cengiz, F (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Sch Law & Social Justice, Rendall Bldg 2-19, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England.",firat.cengiz@liverpool.ac.uk,,,Marie Curie Career Integration Grant [FP 7 - 334322]; European Union,Marie Curie Career Integration Grant(Marie Curie Actions); European Union(European Union (EU)),"earlier versions of this article have been presented in several places, including the June 2014 Marie Curie Workshop in Liverpool.

Prior research supports the existence of a school proximity premium for housing located near K-12 schools. However, since these investigations have lacked important spatial controls, the authors investigate whether their inclusion affects outcomes. In addition, the authors separate out the effects for proximity to public and private elementary schools, measure the distance from schools using a more precise distance measurement and utilize a very large data set on the West Coast of the US. Counter to prior investigations, the authors find strong evidence for a school proximity penalty, for public elementary schools suggesting that proximity is perceived to be a net negative for homebuyers in San Diego County. When spatially dividing the sample area into a coastal and inland region, the authors find the results for the inland region for public schools more closely resemble the results from prior investigations (with a delayed proximity premium) while the coastal results demonstrate a very strong proximity penalty effect. Results presented here indicate that failure to include robust spatial controls (including zip code and census tract fixed effects) could have important implications for hedonic housing price estimates of this kind.","[Sah, Vivek] Univ San Diego, Sch Business Adm, Burnham Moores Ctr Real Estate, San Diego, CA 92110 USA; [Conroy, Stephen J.; Narwold, Andrew] Univ San Diego, Sch Business Adm, San Diego, CA 92110 USA",University of San Diego; University of San Diego,"Conroy, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ San Diego, Sch Business Adm, San Diego, CA 92110 USA.",viveksah@sandiego.edu; sconroy@sandiego.edu; drew@sandiego.edu,,,,,,,41,30,35,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

However, relevant land market regulations and planning practices may prevent the development outcome from reaching its market potential. City governments should adjust existing planning and policy efforts, including more transparent and open process for station location selection, a better articulated investment program that improves transit service, social service and infrastructure quality in suburbs, a shift toward transaction modes of more competition, and a development guidance that grants density bonus to projects closer to metro stations.

We review the relevant formal causal inference literature, and we demonstrate that this belief is not justified. Couching the problem in terms of falsification, we describe the more stringent conditions that are sufficient to reject a null hypothesis concerning observed, but not deliberately manipulated, variables of the form H-0: A -> B in favor of an alternative hypothesis HA: A -> B, even given the possibility of causally related unobserved variables. Rejection of such an H0 can rely on the availability of two observed and appropriately related instruments. We also characterize, using Monte Carlo simulations, the confidence that can be placed on such judgments for linearly-related, jointly normal random variables. While the researcher will have limited control over the confidence level of such tests, type I errors occur with a probability of less than 0.15 (often substantially less) across a wide range of circumstances. The power of the test is limited if there are but few observations available and the strength of correspondence among the variables is weak.

Social distance is assumed to be high when immigrants come from a different culture, a different education system and speak a different language.

The empirical findings indicate that, net of education, immigrants with a high or very high social distance from the receiving society are strongly disadvantaged in terms of their salaries. Additional analyses show that the impact of typical explanatory factors for labour market success such as education, citizenship and length of stay also vary by the degree of social distance between immigrants and their destination country.

We investigate their preferences toward aid and government projects in order to examine these different theories. Are citizens indifferent between development projects funded by their own government versus those funded by foreign aid donors, as aid capture theory suggests? To address this, in an experiment on a large, representative sample of Ugandan citizens, we randomly assigned the names of funding groups for actual forthcoming development projects and invited citizens to express support attitudinally and behaviorally. We find that citizens are significantly more willing to show behavioral support in favor of foreign aid projects compared to government programs, especially if they already perceive the government as corrupt or clientelist or if they are not supporters of the ruling party. They also trust donors more, think they are more effective, and do not consistently oppose aid conditionality. This experimental evidence is consistent with a theory that we call donor control which sees donors asbeing able to target and condition aid so that it is not fungible with government revenues and thus to be able to better direct it to meet citizens' needs.","[Milner, Helen V.] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, 431 Robertson Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Nielson, Daniel L.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 745 SWKT, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Findley, Michael G.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Govt, 3-108 BATS, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Princeton University; Brigham Young University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Milner, HV (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, 431 Robertson Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",hmilner@princeton.edu; dan_nielson@byu.edu,,,Princeton University; Brigham Young University,Princeton University(Princeton University); Brigham Young University,This study was funded by Princeton University and Brigham Young University.

Utilizing a Bourdieuian conceptual framework it examines Slovenian and Polish workers' migration strategies and struggles to acquire and convert capitals within the process of transnational exchange and upon arrival in the UK. The article uncovers the (self-)colonial cultural capital embodied in CEE workers' habitus that drives their strategies to take up various working and training opportunities in the UK in order to acquire (trans)nationally recognized cultural capital. This labour of acquisition drives Polish and Slovenian workers to seek specific cross-cultural and ethnic-niche intermediary services that can manipulate the most reliable symbolic signs in order to make profits from migrant worker-consumers. In this regard the article also exposes inter- and intra-ethnic variations.,"[Samaluk, Barbara] Univ Greenwich, Sch Business, Work & Employment Res Unit, London SE18 6PF, England",University of Greenwich,"Samaluk, B (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Sch Business, Old Royal Naval Coll, London SE10 9LS, England.",b.samaluk@greenwich.ac.uk,,,,,,,56,29,30,0,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

My argument about who seeks and receives technical election assistance is two-fold, taking into account the incentives of recipients and providers. On the recipient side, governments are less likely to request technical assistance when the political costs are high (autocracy) or the benefits low (strong electoral institutions). On the provider side, international organizations are less likely to provide such technical assistance when the government appears to lack political will for reform and full project implementation is unlikely. Statistical analyses of global data on technical election assistance by the United Nations covering 130 countries from 1990 to 2003 support this argument about political cost-benefit calculations in considering technical assistance. Case examples from Guyana, Indonesia, Haiti, and Venezuela illustrate some of these dynamics. My findings suggest that seemingly complementary international interventions (observation and technical support) can create different incentives for domestic and international actors. This helps explain why some countries tend to agree more often to election observation than to technical election assistance.","[von Borzyskowski, Inken] Florida State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"von Borzyskowski, I (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",i.Borzyskowski@fsu.edu,,,KFG The Transformative Power of Europe at the Free University Berlin; German Research Foundation (DFG),KFG The Transformative Power of Europe at the Free University Berlin; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I thank Gabrielle Bardall, Sarah Bush, Amanda Clayton, Jess Clayton, Susan Hyde, Mert Kartal, Jon Pevehouse, two anonymous reviewers, and the editors.

Health-related behaviors are thus affected by personal time preferences. Based on an Internet-based survey conducted on Japanese adults, we contribute to the literature by incorporating the multifaceted nature of time discounting in an analysis of the associations between time preference and health-related behaviors. We find that, first, less patient respondents tend to exhibit worse health-related attributes. Second, present bias, which is measured by the degree of declining impatience, is positively associated with unhealthy behaviors for naive respondents, who are unaware of their self-control problem. Third, such associations cannot be found in sophisticates, who are aware of that. As a policy implication, direct intervention policies, including nudging, are more effective than a commitment device provision in correcting the unhealthy behaviors due to present bias. Fourth, the sign effect, wherein future losses are discounted at a lower rate than future gains, is negatively associated with unhealthy outcomes, although at weak statistical significance levels.

However, violations of the arrow of time, and thus causality, have been identified in spatial econometric techniques applied to spatio-temporal data consisting of observations each at a specific location and distinct moment in time. A comprehensive review classifies for the first time several redresses to this issue in a currently fragmented literature. This paper puts back the temporal dimension into spatial Hedonic Pricing models through a unique specification of a spatio-temporal model that successfully isolates three distinct effects. First, past sale prices affecting current prices, which exemplifies the sales comparison approach. Second, a contemporaneous peer effect that is occurring within the narrow time frame of interaction between market participants prior to a sale. Third, the signals of sellers' expectations are captured in the asking prices of other houses not yet sold, while the buyer is active in the market. This affects the final sale price, due to strategic behavior and anchoring. This is the first instance that effects other than the own asking price can be handled in such models. In boom market conditions, this mechanism introduces the expectation of increasing prices to the hedonic price function, potentially contributing to housing market bubble propagation.

Their strategies (exit, reframing, and partial separation) appear to be unsatisfactory to the actors themselves, and wield generally no influence on the institutions they wish to change. Three factors have been setting into motion this dynamic: first, the difficulty of escaping ethnic group thinking when attempting to reframe ethnic categories; second, the rationality of avoiding open defiance to ethnic categorisation; and third, the young adults' tendency to centre their life on interethnic and international spaces.

It yields three main analytical findings. First, physical capacity certificates markets implemented in the United States restore optimal investment if and only if they are supplemented with a no short sale condition, i.e., producers can not sell more certificates than they have installed capacity. Then, they raise producers' profits beyond the imperfect competition level. Second, financial reliability options, proposed in many markets, are effective at curbing market power, although they fail to fully restore investment incentives. If no short sale conditions are added, both physical capacity certificates and financial reliability options are equivalent. Finally, a single market for energy and operating reserves subject to a price cap is isomorphic to a simple energy market. Standard peak-load pricing analysis applies: under-investment occurs, unless production is perfectly competitive and the cap is never binding.","[Leautier, Thomas-Olivier] Toulouse Sch Econ, IAE, CRM, IDEI, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Toulouse School of Economics,"Léautier, TO (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, IAE, CRM, IDEI, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",thomas.leautier@tse-fr.eu,,,Electricite de France,Electricite de France,"I am grateful to Claude Crampes, Bill Hogan, Patrick Mouttapa, Marie-Anne Plagnet, David Salant, Jean Tirole, three anonymous reviewers, and participants to the 2010 IDEI conference on the Economics of Energy Markets for insightful discussions and comments on previous drafts, and for a grant from Electricite de France that supported this research.

I find that two stable equilibria may exist: an abstention equilibrium, where none of the voters vote and the incumbent always wins, and a more efficient coordination equilibrium, where a substantial share of a challenger's supporters vote and the candidate preferred by the majority is likely to win. I further show that because the higher capability of the incumbent to stuff a ballot box discourages the participation of his own supporters and creates participation incentives for the challenger's supporters, higher fraud does not always benefit the incumbent, even when costless.

More generally, we expect the projection of the stochastic discount factor on the market portfoliothat is, the discounted pricing kernel evaluated at the market portfolioto be a monotonically decreasing function of the market portfolio. Numerous recent empirical studies appear to contradict this prediction. The non-monotonicity of empirical pricing kernel estimates has become known as the pricing kernel puzzle. In this paper we propose and apply a formal statistical test of pricing kernel monotonicity. We apply the test using 17 years of data from the market for European put and call options written on the S&P 500 index. Statistically significant violations of pricing kernel monotonicity occur in a substantial proportion of months, suggesting that observed non-monotonicities are unlikely to be the product of statistical noise.

This paper proposes a minimal extension of Bayesian decision theory to a large-world context that evaluates an event by assigning it a number that reduces to an orthodox probability for a class of measurable events. The Hurwicz criterion evaluates as a weighted arithmetic mean of its upper and lower probabilities, which we derive from the measurable supersets and subsets of . The ambiguity aversion reported in experiments on the Ellsberg paradox is then explained by assigning a larger weight to the lower probability of winning than to the upper probability. However, arguments are given here that would make anything but equal weights irrational when using the Hurwicz criterion. The paper continues by embedding the Hurwicz criterion in an extension of expected utility theory that we call expectant utility.","[Binmore, Ken] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, 8 Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1TB, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Binmore, K (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, 8 Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1TB, Avon, England.",k.binmore@ucl.ac.uk,,,European Research Council under the European Community [295449],European Research Council under the European Community(European Research Council (ERC)),I am grateful for funding from the European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC grant 295449.

We use a large sample of detailed Danish data on two-car households to estimate - for each car owned by the household - own and cross-price effects of increases in fuel costs per kilometre. The empirical results show that failure to capture substitution between cars within the household can result in substantial misspecification biases. Ignoring substitution, the basic model yielded fuel price elasticities of -0.98 and -1.41 for the primary and secondary cars, respectively. Accounting for substitution effects, these figures reduce to, respectively,-0.32 and -0.45. Consistent with substitution behaviour, we find that the fuel price elasticity of fuel demand exceeds the elasticity of kilometre demands with respect to the fuel price; the difference strongly increases at the highest deciles of the distribution of kilometre demand. Extending the model to account for driver heterogeneity and the role of car characteristics confirmed the relevance of substitution between cars within the household. We found strong evidence of substitution from the secondary to the primary car, especially if the latter is a more recent car with more horsepower. In general, the results of this paper emphasise the importance of behavioural differences related to the position of the most fuel efficient car in the household, suggesting that households' fuel efficiency choices are related to their price sensitivity.

Nevertheless, despite the fact that formal relations within UR are highly centralised, informal practices allow for far greater degrees of regional autonomy. Focusing on UR's candidate selection for the 2011 Duma election this article provides an examination of cross-regional variations in the relations between UR's Party Centre and its regional branches. As electoral legislation requires the segmentation of party lists into regional groups', the composition of the regional lists, specifically the share of native candidates', is considered as an indicator of the level of autonomy of regional branches. Ordinal regression analysis confirms our main theoretical hypotheses. In the more financially autonomous regions, UR's regional branches will have more leverage and bargaining power in their relations with the Party Centre. A second important factor is heterogeneity: the more a region's socio-economic indices deviate from the national average (either up or down), the less its UR branch is subordinate to the Party Centre.","[Panov, Petr] Perm Univ, Dept Polit Inst & Proc, Perm Res Ctr, Ural Branch,Russian Acad Sci,Polit Sci Dept, 13a Lenina St, Perm 614990, Russia; [Ross, Cameron] Univ Dundee, Sch Social Sci, Polit & Int Relat, 149 Nethergate, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland",Russian Academy of Sciences; University of Dundee,"Panov, P (通讯作者)，Perm Univ, Dept Polit Inst & Proc, Perm Res Ctr, Ural Branch,Russian Acad Sci,Polit Sci Dept, 13a Lenina St, Perm 614990, Russia.;Ross, C (通讯作者)，Univ Dundee, Sch Social Sci, Polit & Int Relat, 149 Nethergate, Dundee DD1 4HN, Scotland.",panov.petr@gmail.com; c.z.ross@dundee.ac.uk,"Panov, Petr/O-2160-2016","Panov, Petr/0000-0002-0759-7618",,,,,34,2,5,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,FEB 7,2016,68.0,2,,,,,232,252,,10.1080/09668136.2015.1125854,0.0,,,21,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,DI9CW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373800000002,0

However, existing empirical literature has focused on short-distance travel within urban systems. This paper contributes to the limited number of investigations on mode choice in medium- and long-distance travel. The main objective of this research is to study the impacts of socio-demographic and economic variables, land-use features and trip attributes on long-distance travel mode choice. Using data from 2007 Spanish National Mobility Survey we apply a multilevel multinomial logit model that accounts for the potential problem of spatial heterogeneity in order to explain long-distance travel mode choice. This approach permits us to compute how the probability of choosing among private car, bus and train varies depending on the traveler spatial location at regional level. Results indicate that travelers characteristics, trip features, cost of usage of transport modes and geographical variables have significant impacts on long-distance mode choice.

This paper argues that the logarithm of US real house price is not a unit root process. Instead, the evidence from a 120-year national dataset and metro area level and state level panel data sets supports the notion that US house prices are trend stationary.

Moving beyond a stock-taking, the article distinguishes between `ordering' and `disordering' practices and explores the potential of a practice turn in EU studies for both theory (overcoming dualism, replacing substantialism with processualism and rethinking power) and methods (including unstructured interviews, fieldwork and participant observation).

This period coincided with a great deal of turbulence in the UK equity markets, which had multiple causes that need to be controlled for. To achieve this, we use the common correlated effects estimator for large heterogeneous panels. We extend this estimator to quantile regression to analyse the whole conditional distribution of market quality. We find that both fragmentation in visible order books and dark trading that is offered outside the visible order book lower volatility.

Both primarily impact display advertising (as opposed to search and native social ads), and affect how retailers reach customers and how content producers earn revenue. It is, however, unclear what the consequences of these trends are. We investigate using anonymized web browsing histories of 14 million individuals, focusing on retail sessions in which users visit online sites that sell goods and services. We find that only 3% of retail sessions are initiated by display ads, a figure that is robust to permissive attribution rules and consistent across widely varying market segments. We further estimate the full distribution of how retail sessions are initiated, and find that search advertising is three times more important than display advertising to retailers, and search advertising is itself roughly three times less important than organic web search. Moving to content providers, we find that display ads are shown by 12% of websites, accounting for 32% of their page views; this reliance is concentrated in online publishing (e.g., news outlets) where the rate is 91%. While most consumption is either in the long-tail of websites that do not show ads, or sites like Facebook that show native, first-party ads, moderately sized web publishers account for a substantial fraction of consumption, and we argue that they will be most affected by changes in the display advertising market. Finally, we use estimates of ad rates to judge the feasibility of replacing lost ad revenue with a freemium or donation-based model.","[Budak, Ceren] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Goel, Sharad] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rao, Justin] Microsoft Res, Cambridge, England; [Zervas, Georgios] Boston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, Boston, MA 02215 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Stanford University; Microsoft; Boston University,"Budak, C (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,"Zervas, Georgios/GOJ-9424-2022",,,,,,27,13,19,0,15,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,561,578,,10.1145/1234567.1234567,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300046,0

The local delicacy as souvenirs and gifts to bring to families at the tourists' hometown became one of the important things sought by tourists when traveling to Jember. This can be viewed by industries to acquire income. Besides the available raw materials or ingredients that can be obtained easily, there are many visible things such as the human resources that can process raw materials into high-value finished products. A trending home-based industry today in Jember regency is a raw cassava based industry, as well as its derivative food products such as suwar-suwir, brownies, Dodol and Bakpia Tape. This research is a qualitative descriptive study, by providing in-depth descriptions of the cottage industry. This article description focused on the fundamental problem faced by the home-based industry and alternative solutions. SWOT analysis was applied as an analysis to determine the strategies adopted by small industries to survive and develop their business. SWOT analysis is an effort to identify the scope of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that determine the performance of a company or small business. The analysis results showed that the fundamental problem faced by the home-based industry is the short durability of some of the products, so that a longer time shipping of products to outside of the Java and Bali islands cannot be done. The lack of technology usage such as social media and website as a promotional medium and low quality of human resources are also an obstacle in the business. The absence of a community or inter-industry organization is also an obstacle to develop the business (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Budi, Istatuk; Bhayangkara, W.

The belonging to specific industry branch is not mentioned by the official statistic data. The aim of the paper is to show which industry sectors have been more affected by insolvency proposals from 2008-2015. The analysis is done annually and therefore it is possible to demonstrate the time development and differences among industry branches. The gained results are compared with the development of the gross domestic product, the main indicator of the whole economy. It enables to prove if some industries are more sensitive to macroeconomic shifts than others. More sensitive industries are called cyclical because they react as the economic cycle. On the other hand there can be also detected differences among cyclical industry sectors in the quickness of the number of insolvency proposals.

The present paper models an impact of immigration in order to improve welfare of both current and future generations. The dynamic general equilibrium overlapping generations (DGE OLG) model of the Slovak pension system proposed by Farkasovsky in 2016 includes several blocks: demographic, labour market, households, firms, and government. The aim of this contribution is to extend the demographic block of the original model by an impact of migration on the revenue of the Slovak pension insurance in order either to sustain current level of the replacement rate or to follow the replacement rate proposed by the European Commission in The ageing 2015 report. The result reveals that the demand for the net migration flows is so high, that in future the decrease of the participation rate, an increase of the levies, and many other measures will become reality.","[Farkasovsky, Vlastimil; Zimkova, Emilia] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Farkasovsky, V (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",vlastimil.farkasovsky@umb.sk; emilia.zimkova@umb.sk,"Zimková, Emília/ABA-2577-2022","Zimková, Emília/0000-0003-1648-8103; Farkasovsky, Vlastimil/0000-0001-8942-3605",,,,,15,0,0,0,3,"UNIV BANSKA BYSTRICA, FAC ECONOMICS MATEJ BEL",BANSKA BYSTRICA,"TAJOVSKEHO, 10, BANSKA BYSTRICA, 975 90, SLOVAKIA",2453-9902,,978-80-89438-04-4,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2016,,,,,,,86,94,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BH2KW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000399024100009,0

Research objectives were to know the management of cocoa products, the marketing of cocoa at the farm level, and possible vertical integration between traders and farmers. Determining the location of the research used the purposive methods. There were in Blitar, and Jembrana, the both were center cocoa production areas in the East Java and Bali province. The sampling method used the snowing ball method. Data analysis was used the descriptive analysis and vertical integration of market used the concentration ratio analysis. The result of the research showed that most small farmers who do fermentation, the main factor, there were no pricing incentive for fermented cocoa. Marketing cocoa in Blitar district had a more complex marketing channels compared in Jembrana district. Key actor in the cocoa market in Blitar district was Gapoktan, which was able to export and processing. Key actor in the cocoa market in Jembrana district was Subak Abian. In addition, the price of cocoa at the farm level in the Jembrana district was affected by the price at the wholesalers, while in Blitar the wholesaler price was not affected. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The process is long-dependent on the past and its increments are not independent. For these qualities, fractional Brownian motion is used in hydrology [10], climatology [15] and also for modeling wind power resources [4]. It is also used for modeling of unemployment [3], inflation [5], volatility of assets [1] and trading volume [9]. Long memory models are also used in risk management [12] and for modeling of activity in computer networks [13]. The main topic of this article is parameter estimation for finite dimensional fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process based on ergodicity (see [11]). Parameter estimation in the stochastic equation of the second order (which is basically the equation for the harmonic oscillation) is also discussed. The generalizations of this interesting topic (like infinite-dimensional case) are studied nowadays.

The European Union has recently banned the use of prophylaxis use of antibiotics in animals since 2006 while urgently considers ways to reduce food-borne pathogens. The objective of this study was to propose a screening method for identifying natural compounds with anti-bacteria activity from twenty-six Thai-herbal plants. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by an agar diffusion method, which allowed for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The results indicated that Thai-herbs have potent antimicrobial activity against E. coli, S. aureus and C. jejuni at bacteria suspensions of 2.0-3.0x10(9) CFU/ml. Interestingly, C. formosum had the highest antimicrobial activity against the three food-borne pathogens of E. coli, S. aureus and C. jejuni, which were isolated from the chicken-caecum. MIC values of C. formosum against E. coli, S. aureus and C. jejuni were 3.0 mg/ml, 3.0 mg/ml and 0.3 mg/ml, respectively. Other herbal plants also had antimicrobial activity against the three food-borne pathogens in this study. The herbal plants provide not only a natural source of anti-bacterial activity, but also anti-oxidant activity and anticancer properties. The application of using Thai-herbal plants compounds by adding them in animal feed is proposed. This may be a safe means of enhancing health and production of livestock and thus benefits humans and animals. Consequently, the selection of herbal plants, for use in preventing food-borne bacterial infection, is both interesting and worthwhile for food safety. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Not only did they try to theoretically analyse the underlying causes of unemployment, but they also gave emphasis to the job market organisation. Despite the undeniable political and theoretical differences between them, there were converging points of view regarding labour market issues. In addition, their studies constituted the theoretical basis of the British labor market policies adopted during the period 1885-1914. The basic pillars of that policy strategy were the following: (a) an extensive and organized system of labour exchanges, (b) insurance against unemployment at a national level, (c) undertaking of public works as an anti-cyclical policy measure and (d) industrial training for the amelioration of workers' skills. An extensive and analytical discussion of the ideas of these British authors is important not only from a historical point of view but also for contemporary labour market issues.","[Katselidis, Ioannis A.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Athina, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Katselidis, IA (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Athina, Greece.",katsel@otenet.gr,,,,,,,72,1,1,0,0,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

In order to deal with selective input/output measures in DEA, some two-stage approaches are proposed where selective measures are chosen in the first stage and then the DMUs are evaluated in the second stage based on the selected measures. The current study suggests a common weights DEA model which selects inputs/outputs as well finds the efficiency of DMUs in a single-stage approach.

It takes issue with the fact that gender studies tend to equate gender with women. It sketches a feminist contribution to integration theory, where the EU is perceived as gender regimes at multiple levels. Gender identity constructs-masculinities and femininities-rely on difference and are shifting across time, levels and sectors. Yet the variations of identity constructs are limited by well-established ideas-gender binaries-providing continuity and path dependences to maintain the gender system, for example through the ' EU protector masculinity ' in the EU CSDP. European integration thus is a process whereby EU masculinities and femininities are constructed through EU relations to other states in the global context and in EU policy-making and institution-uilding.","[Kronsell, Annica] Lund Univ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Kronsell, A (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Box 52, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",Annica.Kronsell@svet.lu.se,,,,,,,93,33,33,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The superfluity of such influence has given birth to a phenomenon of. the alienation of communication., which is regarded as an objective entity of social reality. The authors adduce a typology of the alienation of communication occurring in a variety of communicative situations at any level of the social structure. This typology is primarily based on the specificity of the. clash. of individual and social in determining the meaning of communication: the original sense and the following reading of this meaning; the intention and the degree of the twisting of the meaning due to the mismatch of social needs, interests and values of the subjects of communication; the impact of this clash on the nature of social interaction. It is specified that in the social and cultural diversity context the processes of social adaptation, socialization and resocialization become of paramount importance for sustainable development of society. However, omnipresent phenomenon of the alienation of communication inhibits these processes significantly. Mass media contribute to an effect of the fractal proliferation of alienation that leads to its transformation into an indispensable attribute of the information society. The authors come to a conclusion that the reality of alienated meanings inevitably comes into existence and becomes the bellicose element of social environment, which explains a necessity of scientific conceptualization of the phenomenon. The approaches to the study of the alienation of communication are suggested.","[Leshchenko, Tatiana; Teplova, Liubov] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Sokolova, Irina] Russian State Social Univ, Wilhelm Pick Str 4, Moscow 129226, Russia",Lomonosov Moscow State University; Russian State Social University (RSSU),"Leshchenko, T (通讯作者)，Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow 119991, Russia.",tatvy@yandex.ru; piter2003vo@mail.ru; liubovteplova@mail.ru,"Leshchenko, Tatiana/O-6624-2016; Любовь, Теплова/P-2134-2019",,,,,,25,0,0,1,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,753,761,,,,,,9,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400077,0

The central point of the axiomatic risk theory is the idea of the Expected Shortfall (ES), which is a risk measure that fulfils the set of coherency axioms. Since the inception of ES on the turn of the 21st century, numerous estimation methods has been developed and discussed, while testing procedures are still relatively few. As sample ES measure is calculated as the average value over a given threshold, the relevant distribution is unknown. Thus statistical evaluation of the ES model cannot use the natural measure of discrepancy between estimated and empirical ES. Hypothesis testing uses other means like regression approach, saddlepoint technique for approximate p-values or the goodness of fit of the truncated return density. The study presents parametric methods of statistical inference connected with ES measure and, through the simulation study, gives the comparison of the size and power of the considered tests.

Shedding light on an early intrasocialist rupture, this case deserves to be considered alongside better known instances of sporting conflict in the Cold War.","[Mills, Richard] Univ East Anglia, Sch Hist, Fac Arts & Humanities, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Mills, R (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Hist, Fac Arts & Humanities, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",r.mills@uea.ac.uk,"Mills, Richard/GRF-5793-2022","Mills, Richard/0000-0003-3392-8457",,,,,43,4,5,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2016,68.0,10,,,SI,,1736,1758,,10.1080/09668136.2016.1243228,0.0,,,23,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,EI7XF,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392717100005,0

Fuzzy algebra is an algebraic structure, in which classical addition is replaced by maximum and the second operation, multiplication, is replaced by minimum. Fuzzy equations have found a broad area of applications in causal models which emphasize relationships between input and output variables. They are used in diagnosis models or models of non-deterministic systems. We shall deal with the both-sided matrix equations. If we replace elements in matrices with intervals of possible values, we obtain an interval matrix equation. We can define several types of solvability of interval matrix equations. In this paper, we shall deal with four of them. We define the tolerance, weak tolerance, left-weak tolerance, and right-weak tolerance solvability and provide polynomial algorithms for checking of them. We prove, that in fuzzy algebra, weak tolerance, left-weak tolerance, and right-weak tolerance solvability are equivalent to each other.","[Myskova, Helena] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Elect Engn & Informat, Dept Math & Theoret Informat, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04200, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Mysková, H (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Elect Engn & Informat, Dept Math & Theoret Informat, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04200, Slovakia.",helena.myskova@tuke.sk,"Myšková, Helena/AAA-6088-2020",,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,588,593,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500101,0

Postponing entry into partner households combined with a decline in fertility resulted in a decline in the number of women living in partner households with children. On the contrary, the increasing divorce rate led to an increase in the number of women living with children in one-parent households. Capturing trends in structures of family cohabitation with children in the Czech Republic in the last twenty years is therefore one of the objectives of this study. In the first step the study compares different sources of data, mainly data from Census and survey data. In the second part the study shows the basic trends in the household structure focusing on the family arrangement with children. This data are related to women, mainly due to more frequent formation of one-parent households.

It may also lead to situations in which reforms that enjoy both ex ante and ex post majority support will still not come to completion.

The existence of such block effect seriously affected the subjective quality of the images. What is different from the MPEG series standards is that the H.264 does not use the post-processing filter, but adds the loop filter in the motion vector compensation loop. But because the loop filter is based on the macro block and the strip, and the core technology of the loop filter is the judgment of the size of the value of the block effect and the choice of the filter, the subjective quality of the coded images cannot be entirely satisfactory. In order to obtain the better subjective effect, the author of this paper puts forward a new loop filtering method based on the H.264. This method not only makes the filter operators further refined, but also makes the criterion for the judgment of the values of the block effect integrated into more influencing factors. The experimental results show that both in the subjective and the objective aspects, the filtering effects are greatly improved compared with the previous schemes. Compared with the previous video coding standards, the functional block of the H.264 coder has not so many changes, but the details of the functions have the adjustment. Under the condition of the same image quality, the H.264 can save more than 50% of the bit rate than the previous standards, and can allow the video programs transmitted over the lower bandwidth, which can save a lot of the bandwidth resources. When the coding image is of high quality, it can provide the continuous, smooth and high-quality images, with the strong ability of the fault tolerance, and can get the better quality in the network of the unstable quality. The H.264 standard has become the latest international video coding standard because of its high efficiency and the network affinity. It has introduced a lot of the new video coding technologies, which have improved the coding efficiency by nearly 50% compared with the previous standards. After the DCT transform, the technology of the loop filter is effective to remove the block effect, which makes the quality of the images improved greatly, and it plays an important role in improving the peak signal-to-noise ratio and reducing the bit rate. This paper introduces the process and the principle algorithm of the loop filtering, and proves its indispensable effect through the simulation of a large number of the sequences.","[Wang, Ting] Baicheng Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Baicheng 137000, Jilin, Peoples R China",Baicheng Normal University,"Wang, T (通讯作者)，Baicheng Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Baicheng 137000, Jilin, Peoples R China.",,,,Department of Education in Jilin Province,Department of Education in Jilin Province,Fund Project: Planned project of the Thirteenth Five-year Plan scientific and technological research by the Department of Education in Jilin Province: Research on the HEVC-oriented filtering algorithm and the DCT optimization,,5,0,0,0,0,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7914-0,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,58.0,,,,,,581,585,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7QX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391643800110,0

At the same time, it can improve the engineering quality and shorten the construction period.","[Wu, Huanqin; Yan, Yewen] Wuhan Huaxia Inst Technol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yang, Wanfu] Wuhan Univ Technol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan Huaxia University of Technology; Wuhan University of Technology,"Wu, HQ (通讯作者)，Wuhan Huaxia Inst Technol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",hqwu2008@163.com; yangwanf@126.com; 734394163@qq.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7914-0,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,58.0,,,,,,834,839,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7QX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391643800157,0

Then, the study continued to analyze the operating mechanism, i.e. psycholinguistic model of speech production (Faerch & Kasper, 1980, 1983a), in which planning phase is differentiated from execution phase. Finally, the study lent support to the clarification of the controversial question that the CS should be taught or not.

In a benchmark economy, the parameters representing the equilibrium aggregate law of motion are randomly perturbed 500 times, and are used as the new initial guess to compute the equilibrium with this algorithm. In a sequence of cases, differing only in the magnitude of the perturbations, I do not find evidence of multiple self-fulfilling equilibria. The economic reason behind the result lies in a self-correcting mechanism present in the algorithm: compared to the equilibrium law of motion, a candidate one implying a higher (lower) expected future capital reduces (increases) the equilibrium interest rates, increasing (reducing) the savings of the wealth-rich agents only. These, on the other hand, account for a small fraction of the population and cannot compensate for the opposite change triggered by the wealth-poor agents, who enjoy higher (lower) future wages and increase (reduce) their current consumption. Quantitatively, the change in behavior of the wealth-rich agents has a negligible impact on the determination of the change in the aggregate savings, inducing stability in the algorithm as a by-product.","Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Cozzi, M (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, 94 Univ Ave, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",mcozzi@econ.queensu.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council [430-2013-511],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"I am grateful to an anonymous referee for several useful suggestions that greatly improved the paper, to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council for providing financial support for this project (IDG Grant 430-2013-511) and to Kevin Andrew for excellent research assistance.",,20,2,2,1,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Given a local policy invariance assumption, we further show this TED equals the change in the treatment effect that would result from a marginal change in the threshold, which we call the marginal threshold treatment effect (MTTE). We apply these results to Goodman (2008), who estimates the effect of a scholarship program on college choice. MTTE in this case identifies how this treatment effect would change if the test score threshold to qualify for a scholarship were changed, even though no such change in threshold is actually observed.","[Dong, Yingying] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Lewbel, Arthur] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Boston College,"Dong, YY (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",,,"Lewbel, Arthur/0000-0003-3864-2618",,,,,24,67,83,0,12,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Nevertheless, nationally representative data are exceedingly rare. The aim of this study was to examine trends and sociodemographic correlates of age at menarche of Colombian girls. The study sample included 15,441 girls born between 1992 and 2000 who participated in the Colombian National Nutrition Survey of 2010. We estimated median menarcheal age using Kaplan-Meier time-to-event analyses. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were estimated with Cox regression models. The median age at menarche was 12.6 years. There was an estimated decline of 0.54 years/decade (P <0.001) over the birth years; this decline was only observed among girls from urban areas, and was more pronounced among girls from wealthier versus poorer families. Child height and BMI, maternal BMI and education, and family wealth were each inversely associated with menarcheal age whereas food insecurity and number of children in the household were positively associated with age at menarche. In conclusion, a negative trend in age at menarche is ongoing in Colombia, especially in groups most likely to benefit from socioeconomic development. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Second, it analyzes efficiency distribution (in particular, the third moment of the efficiency distribution and the efficiency bound). It also suggests the efficiency bound as a new measure of market competition. By applying stochastic frontier models to a panel data set of the European football leagues (English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, Italian Serie A, and German Bundesliga), it derives important implications. First, the minimum efficiency estimates seem to reveal information relevant to market competition and additional information from the conventional CB measure. Second, differences in the shapes of the efficiency distribution curves across the four leagues imply that the four leagues faced different environments in terms of market competition.","[Lee, Young Hoon; Jang, Hayley; Hwang, Sun Ho] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 121742, South Korea",Sogang University,"Lee, YH (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 121742, South Korea.",yhnlee@sogang.ac.kr,"Jang, Hayley/AAG-5569-2019; Lee, Young/AFO-2829-2022; Hwang, Sun Ho/IAN-2107-2023","Lee, Young/0000-0002-1104-9446; Hwang, Sun Ho/0000-0002-9798-838X",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A3A2053312],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by Korean Government (NRF-2013S1A3A2053312).",,30,4,5,2,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

This concept involves a weakening of unanimity, the most extreme form of consensus. It is shown that if a preference profile exhibits level consensus around a given preference relation, there exists a Condorcet winner. In addition, if the number of individuals is odd the majority relation coincides with the preference relation around which there is such consensus and consequently it is transitive. Furthermore, if the level of consensus is sufficiently strong, the Condorcet winner is chosen by all the scoring rules. Level consensus therefore ensures the Condorcet consistency of all scoring rules, thus eliminating the tension between decision rules inspired by ranking-based utilitarianism and the majority rule.","[Mahajne, Muhammad; Volij, Oscar] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Nitzan, Shmuel] Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Bar Ilan University,"Volij, O (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",oscar@volij.co.il,"VOLIJ, OSCAR/F-1267-2012; Volij, Oscar/Q-6239-2019","Volij, Oscar/0000-0003-4724-4240",,,,,25,8,8,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,DEC,2015,45.0,4,,,,,805,817,,10.1007/s00355-015-0882-7,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CX5AA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365711200009,0

I explore the disciplining discourse and tactics of gynaecologists as experts who aim to orient women towards properly planned and prepared pregnancy. Gynaecologists are important agents of reproductive control because they instruct women in detail about reproductive health and contraception. However, these disciplining medical discourses and professional practices are characterised by inconsistency. In accordance with the demographic priorities of the state, doctors are more oriented towards pregnancy treatment than consultation on contraception, and they are inconsistent in their regulation of contraceptive use. This biopolitical regime reflects the demographic priorities of the Russian stateto increase the population of Russiaand the role of women as the primary objects of this policy.","[Temkina, Anna] European Univ St Petersburg, Dept Polit Sci & Sociol, Sociol Publ Hlth & Gender, St Petersburg 191187, Russia",European University at Saint Petersburg,"Temkina, A (通讯作者)，European Univ St Petersburg, Dept Polit Sci & Sociol, Sociol Publ Hlth & Gender, Gagarinskaya 3, St Petersburg 191187, Russia.",temkina@eu.spb.ru,"Темкина, Анна/AAU-5329-2020",,,,,,49,7,7,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,NOV 26,2015,67.0,10,,,SI,,1527,1546,,10.1080/09668136.2015.1100371,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,CZ3LF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367004900002,0

The case of Estonia challenges this view. Although effective economic institutions eventually arose, Estonia began its transition bereft of the institutions that supposedly serve as the requisites of robust achievement. The institutions only emerged after an ideologically driven core of leaders implemented policies that laid the groundwork. In particular, the imposition of hard budget constraints sidelined political capitalists opposed to the rule of law by severing them from the state subsidies, soft loans, and other privileges on which they thrive. In the absence of a powerful class of political capitalists, Estonian governments were free to forge and continually improve a collection of institutions that sets the country apart among its postcommunist peers. Good institutions are desirable but not necessary for policy reform, and they are better seen as auspicious knock-on effects than as prime movers.","[Abrams, Neil A.; Fish, M.

Constructivists generally suggest that during economic crises liberal economists persuaded decision-makers to adopt pro-market policy ideas as solutions for economic turbulence. While this answer is true, it is also only partial because it disregards the role played by governance-related ideas and institutional entrepreneurship in the political actions of liberal economists. I argue that ideas regarding decision-making mechanisms provided liberal economists with the basis for creatively exploiting pre-liberalisation institutions, such as central banks and central budget offices, through which these economists enhanced their long-term political influence. An in-depth examination of a paradigmatic case of economic liberalisation driven by liberal economists - Israel's Stabilisation Plan - exemplifies that argument. The existence of like-minded economists and similar pre-liberalisation policy-making institutions in many other countries hints that the Israeli experience is not unique.","Van Leer Jerusalem Inst, IL-9104001 Jerusalem, Israel",,"Mandelkern, R (通讯作者)，Van Leer Jerusalem Inst, POB 4070, IL-9104001 Jerusalem, Israel.",ronen.mandelkern@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Mandelkern, Ronen/0000-0002-4213-9313",Department of Political Science and the Cherrick Center at the Hebrew University; Israel Science Foundation [1463/08],Department of Political Science and the Cherrick Center at the Hebrew University; Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),"This research was funded by fellowships from the Department of Political Science and the Cherrick Center at the Hebrew University, as well as by Israel Science Foundation grant #1463/08 to Michael Shalev.",,64,22,23,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Most studies of the robustness of PTN have focused on network topology and considered vulnerability in terms of connectivity reliability. While these studies provide insights on general design principles, there is lack of knowledge concerning the effectiveness of different strategies to reduce the impacts of disruptions. This paper proposes and demonstrates a methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of a strategic increase in capacity on alternative PTN links to mitigate the impact of unexpected network disruptions. The evaluation approach consists of two stages: identifying a set of important links and then for each identified important link, a set of capacity enhancement schemes is evaluated. The proposed method integrates stochastic supply and demand models, dynamic route choice and limited operational capacity. This dynamic agent-based modelling of network performance enables to capture cascading network effects as well as the adaptive redistribution of passenger flows. An application for the rapid PTN of Stockholm, Sweden, demonstrates how the proposed method could be applied to sequentially designed scenarios based on their performance indicators. The method presented in this paper could support policy makers and operators in prioritizing measures to increase network robustness by improving system capacity to absorb unexpected disruptions.

This approach has often resulted in efficiency and quality of service improvement. However, there remains a growing concern as to whether the utilities invest sufficiently and efficiently in maintaining and modernising their networks. This paper studies the relationship between investments and cost efficiency in the context of incentive regulation with ex-post regulatory treatment of investments using a panel dataset of 129 Norwegian distribution companies from 2004 to 2010. We introduce the concept of no impact efficiency as a revenue-neutral efficiency effect of investment under incentive regulation that makes a firm investment efficient in cost benchmarking. Also, we estimate the observed efficiency effect of investments and compare these with the no impact efficiency. Finally, we discuss the implications of cost benchmarking for investment behaviour of network companies.","[Poudineh, Rahmatallah; Jamasb, Tooraj] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham DH1 3LB, England",Durham University,"Jamasb, T (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Sch Business, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",tooraj.jamasb@durham.ac.uk,,"Poudineh, Rahmatallah/0000-0003-1894-5187",UK ESRC; Research Council of Norway (Sustainable Grid Development Project-SusGrid),UK ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Research Council of Norway (Sustainable Grid Development Project-SusGrid)(Research Council of Norway),The authors are very grateful to Luis Orea and two anonymous referees for valuable comments on this paper.

If national policy makers choose support schemes to maximize domestic welfare, a trade policy motive arises operating independently of any direct benefit of renewable electricity. The model predicts electricity importing (exporting) countries to choose policies which reduce (increase) electricity prices. A narrow pursuit of domestic objectives distorts transmission investment, and thereby market integration, below the efficient level. Distortions cannot be corrected by imposing national renewable targets alone. Instead, subsidies to transmission investment and a harmonization of and reduction in the number of policy instruments can improve welfare.","Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Tangerås, TP (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Grevgatan 34,Box 55665, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",thomas.tangeras@ifn.se,,,research program The Economics of Electricity Markets,research program The Economics of Electricity Markets,"Many thanks to Henrik Horn, Jonas Teusch, Bert Willems, two anonymous reviewers and seminar/conference participants at IFN, Lund University, MEC Mannheim, SNEE Wile and the 37th IAEE International Conference for helpful comments, and to Christina Lonnblad for editorial assistance.

After a brief reassessment of the main features of Ricardo's views on foreign trade, some basic questions are examined, concerning the method of analysis and the alleged invalidity of the labour theory of value at the international level. The enquiry goes on to state that, for Ricardo, there are no significant differences between domestic and international exchanges, and on this basis, proposes a simple and general rule explaining the flows of trade. The principle of comparative advantage and the gains from trade thus appear as simple unintended consequences of the decisions of agents in free markets. Finally, the characteristics of an international equilibrium and the nature and impact of destabilising shocks are analysed.","Pantheon Assas Univ, F-75006 Paris, France",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Faccarello, G (通讯作者)，Pantheon Assas Univ, 92 Rue Assas, F-75006 Paris, France.",gilbert.faccarello@u-paris2.fr,,,,,,,33,15,15,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Arule on the set of preference profiles consists of a partition function and a solution. Given a preference profile, a partition is selected and as many units of the good as the number of coalitions in the partition are allocated, where each unit is shared among all agents belonging to the same coalition according to the solution. Arule is stable at a preference profile if no agent strictly prefers to leave his coalition to join another coalition and all members of the receiving coalition want to admit him. We show that the proportional solution and all sequential dictator solutions admit stable partition functions. We also show that stability is a strong requirement that becomes easily incompatible with other desirable properties like efficiency, strategy-proofness, anonymity, and non-envyness.","[Bergantinos, Gustavo] Univ Vigo, Fac Econ, Res Grp Econ Anal, Vigo 36310, Pontevedra, Spain; [Masso, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; [Masso, Jordi] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona 08193, Spain; [de Barreda, Ines Moreno] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 1NF, England; [de Barreda, Ines Moreno] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England; [Neme, Alejandro] Univ Nacl San Luis, Inst Matemat Aplicada San Luis, San Luis, Argentina; [Neme, Alejandro] Univ Nacl San Luis, COCINET, San Luis, Argentina",Universidade de Vigo; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Barcelona School of Economics; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Universidad Nacional de San Luis; Universidad Nacional de San Luis,"de Barreda, IM (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, New Rd, Oxford OX1 1NF, England.",gbergant@uvigo.es; jordi.masso@uab.es; ines.morenodebarreda@economics.ox.ac.uk; aneme@unsl.edu.ar,"Bergantinos, Gustavo/AAF-3415-2020","Masso, Jordi/0000-0003-3712-0041; Bergantinos, Gustavo/0000-0003-2592-5213","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2011-23460]; FEDER; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [SEV-2011-0075, ECO2008-0475-FEDER]; Universidad Nacional de San Luis [319502]; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 112-200801-00655]; Generalitat de Catalunya [SGR 2009-419]; [2014-515]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Universidad Nacional de San Luis; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya);,"We thank two referees of this journal for helpful comments.

Theoretical insights from a stylized search-and-matching model illustrate that such indicators can be associated with subsequent home price appreciation. The empirical analysis employs listings data on residential units offered for sale through a real estate broker in the Netherlands and for certain U.S. regions. Individual records are used to construct quarterly home price indices, an index that measures seller's bargaining power and (quality-adjusted) home sale probabilities. Using conventional time-series models we show that current sale probabilities and bargaining power can significantly reduce home price appreciation forecast errors and help to predict turning points in local area housing markets. The measures and approaches in this article help to demonstrate ways in which researchers and practitioners can leverage listings data to gain knowledge about the current and future state of the housing market.","[Carrillo, Paul E.] George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [de Wit, Eric R.] Univ Amsterdam, QuantVille Finance & Dept Finance, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Larson, William] Bur Econ Anal, Washington, DC USA",George Washington University; University of Amsterdam,"Carrillo, PE (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",pcarrill@gwu.edu; erikrdewit@gmail.com; larson@gmail.com,,,,,,,36,19,21,0,32,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2015,43.0,3,,,,,609,651,,10.1111/1540-6229.12082,0.0,,,43,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,CO2BU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358961100003,0

Based on the wavelet transform for decomposing systematic patterns and noise, in this paper we propose a new integrated wavelet denoising method, named smoothness-oriented wavelet denoising algorithm (SOWDA), that optimally determines the wavelet function, maximal level of decomposition, and the threshold rule by using a smoothness score function that simultaneously detects the global and local extrema. We discuss the properties of our method and propose a new evaluation procedure to show its robustness. In addition, we apply this method both in simulation and empirical investigation. Both the simulation results based on three typical stylized features of financial data and the empirical results in analyzing high-frequency financial data from Frankfurt Stock Exchange confirm that SOWDA significantly (based on the RMSE comparison) improves the performance of classical econometric models after denoising the data with the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) methods.","[Sun, Edward W.] KEDGE Business Sch, F-33405 Talence, France; [Chen, Yi-Ting; Yu, Min-Teh] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Hsinchu 530010, Taiwan; [Chen, Yi-Ting] CC Tech LLC, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",Kedge Business School; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Sun, EW (通讯作者)，KEDGE Business Sch, 680 Cours Liberat, F-33405 Talence, France.",edward.sun@kedgebs.com; mtyu@nctu.edu.tw,"Yu, Min-Teh/ABB-7718-2021; Sun, Edward W./J-7488-2015","Yu, Min-Teh/0000-0003-4686-1327; Sun, Edward W./0000-0001-6680-0738",,,,,45,7,7,0,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

We first compute the residual (or net) variable factor productivity using the multilateral index number method and then apply robust cluster random effects model in order to evaluate the importance of corruption. We find strong evidence that corruption has negative impacts on airport operating efficiency; and the effects depend on the ownership form of the airport. The results suggest that airports under mixed public-private ownership with private majority achieve lower levels of efficiency when located in more corrupt countries. They even operate less efficiently than fully and/or majority government owned airports in high corruption environment. We control for economic regulation, competition level and other airports' characteristics. Our empirical results survive several robustness checks including different control variables, three alternative corruption measures: International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) corruption index, Corruption Perception Index (CPI) and Control of Corruption Index (CCI). The empirical findings have important policy implications for management and ownership structuring of airports operating in countries that suffer from higher levels of corruption.

A growing literature has examined the impacts of Big Box stores on other retailers and consumers, but relatively little is known about how Big Box stores choose locations. Because Big Box stores offer highly standardized products and compete primarily on price, it is likely that they will seek to establish spatial monopolies, far from competitor stores. In this paper, I examine where new Big Box stores locate with respect to three types of existing establishments: own-firm stores, other retailers in the same product space (competitors), and retailers in other product spaces (complements). Results indicate that new Big Box stores tend to avoid existing own-firm stores and locate near complementary Big Box stores. However, there is little evidence that new Big Boxes seek to avoid competitors. Firms in the same product space may not be perfect substitutes, or firms may prefer to share consumers in a desirable location rather than cede the entire market to competitor firms.

Both pricing proposals were debated for several years and neither was introduced. Our findings show that space allocation for type of overall tone (e.g. negative or positive towards a pricing proposal) and the range of issues and polity actors in the media coverage were very different for the two proposals, and for each proposal fluctuated greatly over time. Our analysis suggests that such a variation in the media coverage was a reflection of changes in the content of the policy debate (e.g. caused by the specific design features of pricing proposal under discussion, the different policy actors engaged in the debate and their messages about the proposal). This indicates that policy-makers can influence the media coverage of road pricing policies to some extent by managing the policy debate. Our findings also show not only that changes in the content of the policy debate were reflected in the media coverage, but also that the media coverage influenced the policy debate: the statements or actions of policy actors received media coverage, which then in turn stimulated the policy debate. However, the influence of media on the policy debate was rather indirect, in that policy actors mostly reacted to the messages from other policy actors reported in the media and to a lesser extent to the media coverage itself.

This paper introduces an innovative multi-layered framework to assess, predict and mitigate potential harm. The proposed approach addresses known restrictions of risk assessments in shipping. These restrictions are the lack of scalability to apply risk assessments over large areas using an automated routine, the absence of recognizing that the world fleet is heterogeneous, the lack of integrating location specific environmental conditions such as wind, currents or waves and most importantly, the lack of recognizing the uncertainties associated with each factor especially for predictions. The proposed framework is based on the idea of integrating various layers representing the most important factors that can influence risk in order to estimate and predict risk exposure for a given area. As proof of concept of the underlying ideas, the outcome of a pilot project with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority is presented which demonstrates the integration of the first two layers and is based on a unique and comprehensive combination of data. The results of selected endpoints of risk exposure compare well with observations. The article also discusses the integration of the remaining layers including the recognition and addition of uncertainties in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

But the alternative (no action) also has a cost. Therefore, mitigation costs netted of the damage costs avoided are the only figure that can seriously be considered as the genuine cost of a policy. We elaborate on this view of a policy's cost by distinguishing between its direct cost component and its avoided damage cost component; we then confront the two so as to evaluate its genuine cost. As damages avoided are equivalent to the benefits generated, this brings climate policies naturally in the realm of benefit-cost analysis. However, the sheer benefit-cost criterion may not be a sufficient incentive for a country to be induced to cooperate internationally, a necessary condition for an effective global climate policy. We therefore also explore how to make use of this criterion in the context of international climate cooperation.","[Brechet, Thierry; Tulkens, Henry] Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain Sch Management, Ctr Operat Res & Econometr, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Brechet, Thierry] Catholic Univ Louvain, Chair Lhoist Berghmans Environm Econ & Management, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Bréchet, T (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Louvain Sch Management, Ctr Operat Res & Econometr, Voie Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",thierry.brechet@uclouvain.be; henry.tulkens@uclouvain.be,,,,,,,28,3,3,0,8,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2015,36.0,3,,,,,155,169,,10.5547/01956574.36.3.tbre,0.0,,,15,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CK8CN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356466100006,0

While we do not disagree with this argument, our objective is to shed light on the European Commission's entrepreneurship, an element which appears to be somewhat bereft of scholarly attention. We show how, by displaying social acuity, defining problems and building teams, the Commission has actively promoted a policy agenda focused on liberal market building at the expense of socially minded regulation. This was however only made possible by a new constellation among the Member States after 2004. We substantiate this claim by documenting the activity of the Commission in two crucial policy domains of the post-Lisbon era: the liberalization of service provision, and the impact of the new macro-economic governance on social policy after the financial and debt crisis.","[Crespy, Amandine] Univ Libre Bruxelles, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Menz, Georg] Univ London Goldsmiths Coll, London SE14 6NW, England",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Crespy, A (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, Ctr Detude Vie Polit Ave Jeanne 44 CP 124, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",acrespy@ulb.ac.be,,,,,,,47,62,62,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Job-seekers choose between searching locally and searching in both regions. Search-matching externalities are amplified by the latter possibility and by the fact that some workers can simultaneously receive a job offer from each region. The rest of the framework builds upon Moretti (2011). Increasing the matching effectiveness out of the region of residence has an ambiguous impact on unemployment rates. While it reduces the probability of remaining unemployed, it also decreases labor demand because of a lower acceptance rate. We characterize the optimal allocation and conclude that the Hosios condition is not sufficient to restore efficiency. A numerical exercise indicates that the loss in net output is non-negligible and rising in the matching effectiveness in the other region. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The results indicate that the value of a 1 cm reduction in the husband's height relative to his wife's height is about 3% of his earnings. 3% of the mean of yearly earnings amounts to Rp. 492,000 or US$54 in 2007. That value is reduced to 1% when earnings-generating attributes are controlled for. This difference of 2% points can be considered the value that women attach to their husbands' earnings-generating attributes; meanwhile, the remaining 1% suggests that there are still other attributes that women look for in male height.

However, the relationship among pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain, and newborn birth weight has not been well established. This study uses a very large dataset of sibling births and a within-family design to thoroughly address this issue. The baseline analysis controlling for mother fixed effects indicates maternal preconception overweight, preconception obesity, and excessive gestational weight gain significantly increase the risk of having a high birth weight baby, respectively, by 1.3, 3 and 3.9 percentage points, while underweight before pregnancy and inadequate gestational weight gain increase the low birth weight incidence by 1.4 and 2 percentage points. The benchmark results are robust in a variety of sensitivity checks. Since poor birth outcomes especially high birth weight and low birth weight have lasting adverse impacts on one's health, education, and socio-economic outcomes later in life, the findings of this research suggest promoting healthy weight among women before pregnancy and preventing inappropriate weight gain during pregnancy can generate significant intergenerational benefits.

Since customs duties are already low, the success of the liberalisation process hinges on the elimination of non-tariff barriers. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on two possible liberalisation scenarios: a less ambitious liberalisation and a comprehensive liberalisation. In contrast to classic studies, our paper builds on the modern trade literature, accounting for the dominance of intra-industry trade in both economies and the existence of heterogeneous firms. Furthermore, we model a search-and-matching labour market, allowing us to quantify employment effects of trade liberalisation. We find that a comprehensive liberalisation increases Japanese GDP by 0.86 per cent, whereas the EU experiences only an additional 0.21 per cent of real GDP growth. Most of the growth in real GDP is due to firms' efficiency gains, whereas unemployment is reduced by only a small amount. Other world regions experience small reductions of GDP due to trade diversion effects.","[Benz, Sebastian] Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany; [Benz, Sebastian; Yalcin, Erdal] Univ Munich, Ifo Inst, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Munich, Germany; [Yalcin, Erdal] Univ Munich, CESifo, Munich, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Ifo Institut; University of Munich; University of Munich; Ifo Institut,"Benz, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.",,,"Yalcin, Erdal/0000-0001-9459-1718",,,,,31,5,5,3,45,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2015,38.0,6,,,,,935,961,,10.1111/twec.12205,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CL1AV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356675500003,0

National Travel Surveys (NTS) and time use surveys (TUS) are two major data sources for travel behaviour and activity participation. The aim of this paper is to systematically compare both survey types regarding travel activities and non-travel activities. The analyses are based on the German National Travel Survey and the German National Time Use Survey from 2002. The number of trips and daily travel time for mobile respondents were computed as the main travel estimates. The number of trips per person is higher in the German TUS when changes in location without a trip are included. Location changes without a trip are consecutive non-trip activities with different locations but without a trip in-between. The daily travel time is consistently higher in the German TUS. The main reason for this difference is the 10-min interval used. Differences in travel estimates between the German TUS and NTS result from several interaction effects. Activity time in NTS is comparable with TUS for subsistence activities. Our analyses confirm that both survey types have advantages and disadvantages. TUS provide reliable travel estimates. The number of trips even seems preferable to NTS if missed trips are properly identified and considered. Daily travel times are somewhat exaggerated due to the 10-min interval. The fixed time interval is the most important limitation of TUS data. The result is that trip times in TUS do not represent actual trip times very well and should be treated with caution. We can use NTS activity data for subsistence activities between the first trip and the last trip. This can potentially benefit activity-based approaches since most activities before the first trip and after the last trip are typical home-based activities which are rarely substituted by out-of-home activities.

In some regimes, offering to compensate affected parties renders a violation permissible; in others, compensation serves at most a provisional function, with full compliance the only satisfactory outcome. While allowing for breach-and-pay in instances where it leaves all parties better off appears optimal, institutions vary a great deal in the extent to which they tolerate such efficient breach. To account for this variation, we consider how the design of the agreement affects the odds of mobilization of domestic groups. We argue that when the benefits from violations accrue mainly to government itself, efficient breach does leave governments better off. Yet when governments benefit only indirectly, through the political support offered by interest groups who are the direct beneficiaries of violations, the possibility of efficient breach increases the payoffs from mobilization. In those cases, allowing for efficient breach strengthens the domestic opposition to the very liberalization pursued by the treaty. Our model predicts that international trade agreements should spurn efficient breach, while investment agreements should favor it. We test these implications by considering dispute settlement and enforcement mechanisms in both regimes.","[Pelc, Krzysztof J.] McGill Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Urpelainen, Johannes] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",McGill University; Columbia University,"Pelc, KJ (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",kj.pelc@mcgill.ca; ju2178@columbia.edu,,,,,,,52,12,13,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

This negative correlation is stronger on larger plantations but weaker when the slaveholder is a woman. A similar correlation is not present for white children, slave children with white fathers, or slave children born prior to the Fugitive Slave Law. The negative correlation suggests that the promise of freedom played an important role in the everyday lives of slaves.","Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Allen, T (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,"Allen, Treb/0009-0007-2501-3800",National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"I thank Costas Arkolakis, David Atkin, Tim Guinnane, Sriya Iyer, Nancy Qian, Mark Rosenzweig, and Chris Udry for their substantial guidance and support.

Because land costs are not subsidized, it may incentivize developers to produce buildings with too much capital from the viewpoint of optimal production. Using data on construction in Los Angeles County between 1993 and 2007, this paper estimates how the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit subsidy affects the size of newly constructed apartment buildings. Holding land area constant, I find the average subsidized building includes 25 to 29% more square footage than unsubsidized buildings constructed in the same year and zip code. The effect is primarily driven by subsidized buildings including more, instead of larger, housing units. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the effects are strongest in locations with low market rent. This input distortion is one reason that housing subsidies that fund the construction of low-income housing may be less cost-effective than subsidies given directly to tenants. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To do so, we develop and estimate an arbitrage-free dynamic term-structure model which accounts for regime shifts in monetary policy and price of risk. Our results for US data from 1985 through 2008 indicate that (i) the Federal Reserve's reaction to inflation has changed over time, switching between active and passive monetary policy regimes; (ii) on average, the term spread in the active regime was wider than in the passive regime; and (iii) the yields in the active regime were considerably more volatile than in the passive regime. The wider term spread in the active regime reflects higher term premia associated with a more sensitive response of the short-term interest rate to inflation. Additionally, our analysis suggests that the model fit improves substantially when we account for regime switching in monetary policy and price of risk.","[Abdymomunov, Azamat] Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Charlotte, NC 28202 USA; [Kang, Kyu Ho] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Richmond; Korea University,"Abdymomunov, A (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, 530 East Trade St, Charlotte, NC 28202 USA.",azamat.abdymomunov@rich.frb.org,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Previous literature found that caps on damages lead to both changes in the number of physicians and changes in treatment patterns. This paper investigates whether the changes in procedures are attributable to changes in incentives or to selection when new entrants could have a different practice style than incumbents. First, I find that the relationship between non-economic damages caps and the number of physicians and procedures identified in previous literature is not robust to the inclusion of the newer policy changes. Second, over the period when such changes were observed, the impact on procedures is concentrated in areas with the greatest changes in the number of obstetricians/gynecologists per capita, suggesting that most of the effect on procedures is driven by differences in practice style between entrants and incumbents.

It becomes even more critical for the case of toll roads, which in recent decades has become an increasingly common device to fund road projects. However, literature regarding demand elasticity estimates in toll roads is sparse and leaves some important aspects to be analyzed in greater detail. In particular, previous research on traffic analysis does not often disaggregate heavy vehicle demand from the total volume, so that the specific behavioral patterns of this traffic segment are not taken into account. Furthermore, GDP is the main socioeconomic variable most commonly chosen to explain road freight traffic growth over time. This paper seeks to determine the variables that better explain the evolution of heavy vehicle demand in toll roads over time. To that end, we present a dynamic panel data methodology aimed at identifying the key socioeconomic variables that explain the behavior of road freight traffic throughout the years. The results show that, despite the usual practice, GDP may not constitute a suitable explanatory variable for heavy vehicle demand. Rather, considering only the GDP of those sectors with a high impact On transport demand, such as construction or industry, leads to more consistent results. The methodology is applied to Spanish toll roads for the 1990-2011 period. This is an interesting case in the international context, as road freight demand has experienced an even greater reduction in Spain than elsewhere, since the beginning of the economic crisis in 2008.

The rewarding nature of care work, altruistic motivations and gendered social norms have all been used to explain why subjective job satisfaction is high despite poor pay and terms and conditions. Using data collected in case-study research with domiciliary and residential care workers, this article offers a new direction for care worker research that contextualizes the taken-for-granted assumption that care workers tolerate poor pay and conditions because women find the work satisfying and intrinsically rewarding. The article draws on cultural analyses of class to offer an alternative framework that identifies the wider social processes that can shape care workers' job satisfaction.","[Hebson, Gail; Grimshaw, Damian] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England; [Rubery, Jill] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Human Resources, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Hebson, G (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Booth St West, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",gail.hebson@mbs.ac.uk,,"Hebson, Gail/0000-0003-0943-9848; Grimshaw, Damian/0000-0002-4564-4841",Department of Health as part of the Social Care Workforce Initiative [056/0015],Department of Health as part of the Social Care Workforce Initiative,"This research was funded by the Department of Health as part of the Social Care Workforce Initiative.

Here, we utilize several nonparametric metrics to assess the evolution of weight and body mass index (BMI) across the entire distribution during early childhood. We find that movements within the distribution of weight - both upward and downward - are quite high prior to primary school and then decline noticeably. For BMI, we find that movements within the distribution - both upward and downward - are highest at the start of kindergarten and at the start of middle school. However, there are important sources of heterogeneity, including race, gender, and age that should prove insightful to researchers and policymakers. For instance, comparing males versus females who are initially in the bottom quartile of the distribution of BMI, we find that males have a higher probability of moving up at least 10 percentile points between kindergarten and eighth grade (53% versus 50%). Comparisons among racial groups indicate that whites who are initially in the top quartile of the distribution of BMI have a higher probability of moving down at least 10 percentile points between kindergarten and eighth grade than blacks and Hispanics (46% versus 37% and 40%, respectively).

This paper investigates some of these effects by analyzing annual kilometers traveled (AKT) of private vehicle owners in Stockholm in 2008. The difference in emissions associated with EEV adoption is estimated, along with the effect of a congestion-pricing exemption for EEVs on vehicle usage. Propensity score matching is used to compare AKT rates of different vehicle owner groups based on the treatments of: EEV ownership and commuting across the cordon, controlling for confounding factors such as demographics. Through this procedure, rebound effects are identified, with some EEV owners found to have driven up to 12.2% further than non-EEV owners. Although some of these differences could be attributed to the congestion-pricing exemption, the results were not statistically significant. Overall, taking into account lifecycle emissions of each fuel type, average EEV emissions were 50.5% less than average non-EEV emissions, with this reduction in emissions offset by 2.0% due to rebound effects. Although it is important for policy-makers to consider the potential for unexpected negative effects in similar transitions, the overall benefit of greatly reduced emissions appears to outweigh any rebound effects present in this case study.

The magnitude of this relationship is larger in competitive markets without low-cost carriers and for flights with shortest scheduled times.

The paper focuses on an important special case of this, that is, comparisons of poverty that make use of incomes at different time periods. The ordering criteria extend the power of earlier multidimensional dominance tests by making (reasonable) assumptions on the relative marginal contributions of each time dimension to poverty. Inter alia, this involves drawing on natural symmetry and asymmetry assumptions as well as on the mean/variability framework commonly used in the risk literature. The resulting procedures make it possible to check for the robustness of poverty comparisons to choices of intertemporal aggregation procedures and to areas of intertemporal poverty frontiers.

We implement a novel experimental design that mimics this phenomenon and explores bottom-up approaches for its mitigation. In different setups we examine how monitoring by citizens affects public official's tendency to demand bribes and whether citizens are more willing to engage in monitoring if they can recommend rather than report. Our results are mixed. Recommendations seem to perform better in environments with personal and repeated interactions, where reports might cause discontent and further disadvantaged treatment by public officials. In contrast, reports and the sanctions these potentially cause are more likely to deter public officials from extortive behavior in settings similar to the stranger matching protocol. Regarding citizen's monitoring involvement, we find a strong preference for recommendations over reports, even among stranger matching treatments. Moreover, independent of the matching protocol and the endogenous monitoring mechanism, we find that agents in both roles are sensitive to monitoring and detection rate variations: public officials in their decision to demand a bribe and citizens in their decision to monitor.","[Khachatryan, Elina] Univ Kassel, Dept Microecon, D-34127 Kassel, Germany; [Kube, Sebastian] Univ Bonn, Inst Appl Microecon, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Vollan, Bjoern] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",Universitat Kassel; University of Bonn; University of Innsbruck,"Khachatryan, E (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Dept Microecon, Nora Platiel Str 4, D-34127 Kassel, Germany.",elina.khachatryan@uni-kassel.de; kube@uni-bonn.de; bjoern.vollan@uibk.ac.at,"Vollan, Björn/AAN-9265-2020","Vollan, Björn/0000-0002-5592-4185",Leibniz Center for Tropical Marine Ecology,Leibniz Center for Tropical Marine Ecology,"We are appreciative of the financial support granted by the Leibniz Center for Tropical Marine Ecology.

The test statistics and the estimators are computed using mixed integer programming methods. The results show that the equally weighted (fixed weights) composite WGI index is not the best-case scenario and that governance indicators at different years should be weighted differently. Furthermore, we revisit the institutions hypothesis in the empirical growth literature, where institutional quality is the main determinant of long-term development.

J,"Zudenkova, G",,,,"Zudenkova, Galina",,,Political cronyism,SOCIAL CHOICE AND WELFARE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SOCIAL NETWORKS; ACCOUNTABILITY; BUREAUCRATS,"This paper analyzes incentives for cronyism in politics within a political agency model with moral hazard. The analysis focuses on the institutional features, which define contractual and appointment procedures within political organizations. The institutional framework does not allow explicit contracting with politicians. They are motivated by reelection incentives and just need to guarantee that their team performance exceeds the minimum threshold required for reelection. This lowers the returns to bringing in efficient individuals in the politician's team. Moreover, the nature of political promotions (such that a crony's career is tied to that of his patron) leads to the alignment between political objectives of the politician and his cronies. This further increases the politician's incentives to appoint less efficient friends.","Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Zudenkova, G (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, L7,3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",galina.zudenkova@gmail.com,"Zudenkova, Galina/KCJ-5560-2024","Zudenkova, Galina/0000-0002-0008-2427",Karin-Islinger-Stiftung foundation; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2011-25203],Karin-Islinger-Stiftung foundation; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),"I am grateful to Luis Corchon, Montserrat Ferre, Kai Konrad, Humberto Llavador, Massimo Morelli, an anonymous referee, an associate editor, and John Duggan, the managing editor, for helpful comments, suggestions and encouragement.

Such a tool allows me to deal with a natural notion of continuity in social choice theory. In addition, and in order to have the choice problem as close as possible to its beginnings, the social evaluation functionals considered are assumed to satisfy both ordinal measurability and interpersonal non-comparability, and unanimity. I present two results concerning the characterization of projective social evaluation functionals (which means that the social utility function is exactly the utility of the dictator). The first one needs a strong form of welfarism called social state separability. The second one uses continuity in combination with a new axiom called ordinal-scale-preserving.","Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Anal Econ, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Candeal, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Anal Econ, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",candeal@unizar.es,"Candeal, Juan C./H-2593-2015",,,,,,11,5,5,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2015,44.0,2,,,,,369,388,,10.1007/s00355-014-0832-9,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CA5YG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348984000008,0

Associated with the debate is an emotional (or ideological) bias by communities in favour of one mode, especially rail, which carries much sway at the political level as if there is no budget constraint. This paper presents a stated choice experiment to investigate this context as two unlabelled options described by 20 potential drivers of community preferences for improved public transport, where each choice scenario is conditioned on an estimated construction cost and a total annual transport infrastructure budget for the relevant geographical jurisdiction. This is followed by a labelling of each alternative to reveal whether the option is bus rapid transit (BRT) or light rail (LRT) and to establish whether this additional information influences preference revision. Data is collected in all eight capital cities of Australia in mid 2014. Mixed logit models with heteroscedastic conditioning in terms of the cost of the project infrastructure and whether the alternative is labelled BRT or LRT, provide new evidence on the nature and extent of community modal bias in a budget-constrained choice setting. The conclusions are twofold. On the one hand, if a fully compensatory choice rule is assumed (as is common in all previous modal comparison studies), LRT is predominantly preferred over BRT despite budgetary constraints, similarities in quality of service attributes and the opportunity to choose a greater network coverage for a given construction cost. However, when we allow for attribute non-attendance (a semi-compensatory choice rule), the modal bias is no longer a significant driver of preferences. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A mechanism through which to obtain a common knowledge of payoff functions measured in units of utility (or common priors over predetermined sets of such functions) is not part of the model. This paper describes an operational method of constructing a state of common knowledge of the key parameters of the players' utility functions in terms of conditional small bets on the game's outcome. When the rationality criterion of joint coherence (no arbitrage) is applied in this setting, the solution of a game is typically characterized by a convex set of correlated equilibria. In the most general case, where players are risk averse, the parameters of the equilibria are risk-neutral probabilities, interpretable as products of subjective probabilities and relative marginal utilities for money, as in financial markets. Risk aversion generally enlarges the set of equilibria and may present opportunities for Pareto-improving modifications of the rules of the game.","Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Nau, R (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",robert.nau@duke.edu,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2015,78.0,2,,,,,171,188,,10.1007/s11238-013-9413-0,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AZ3JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348124200001,0

While independent directors push to hold conference calls, they may also prefer to have shorter conference calls to avoid potential lawsuits, proprietary costs, and/or loss of reputation that can arise from releasing too much information. Entrenched executives seek to minimize risk (such as employment and/or litigation risk) by limiting the length of conference calls or by avoiding conference calls altogether.

Specifically, I offer an examination of the Swiss response to large capital inflows during the early stages of the global financial crisis. Why did the Swiss National Bank (SNB) intervene in the foreign exchange market and introduce an exchange rate floor? Why did the SNB gamble with its highly valued anti-inflationary reputation in attempting to stem the appreciation of the Swiss franc? To answer these questions, this paper suggests a broader and more complete explanation than one that focuses solely on the configuration of domestic interests. Specifically, the paper argues that a thorough explanation of the SNB's response requires accounting for the changing monetary paradigm of the central banking community. This emerging monetary paradigm influenced the SNB's policy decisions by making the SNB particularly sensitive to financial stability risks and by providing it with the policy space to experiment with (macroprudential) tools to manage these risks.","Univ Turin, Dept Culture Polit & Soc, I-10124 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Moschella, M (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Culture Polit & Soc, I-10124 Turin, Italy.",,,,,,,,64,19,19,0,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Objectively, Russia's economic development, political stability, and ability to project power abroad rest on its oil and gas resources. Subjectively, however, Russians are somewhat reluctant to accept that oil and gas dependency is part of their national identity. This is particularly true of the elites who play a crucial role in defining the dominant national narrative. Ordinary Russians generally have quite positive attitudes about the role of Gazprom and Russia's emergence as an energy superpower - while at the same time being wary of becoming a raw materials appendage of the outside world. One of the unexpected findings to emerge from the survey data is the strong regional differences on the question of whether Russia should be proud of its reliance on energy. Gazprom is popular in the Central Federal District, but less so as one moves east. The article concludes with an analysis of the factors constraining the role of energy in Russia's national narrative: the prominent history of military victories and territorial expansion; a strong commitment to modernization through science and industry; and concerns over corruption, environmental degradation, and foreign exploitation.","Wesleyan Univ, Dept Govt, Middletown, CT 06459 USA",Wesleyan University,"Rutland, P (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Dept Govt, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",prutland@wesleyan.edu,"Rutland, Peter/AAU-4263-2020",,,,,,88,50,54,1,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

It involves the production, sale, management and maintenance of plants used for environmental, recreational and leisure purposes. In Australia, this specialised sector of horticulture has become one of the more profitable and rapidly growing primary industries since World War II. This paper discusses the significance of the Australian lifestyle horticulture industry in terms of its environmental, aesthetic, social and recreational values in the urban environment where 87% of Australians live, work and play, as well as the impact of these commodities and services on the health and well-being of those communities. The industry also generates substantial direct and indirect economic benefits. However, the few available statistics from which the size of the industry can be assessed are, at best, unreliable. While these do indicate that the lifestyle horticulture industry is one of the largest agricultural industry groupings, they grossly underestimate the full value of lifestyle horticulture activities in Australia. As a result, the commodities and services associated with the lifestyle horticulture industry have been poorly recognised and undervalued by the wider agricultural sector. Governments at all levels, as well as the community at large, can be said to take the value and benefits from the lifestyle horticulture industry for granted. Greater discussion needs to take place between the government, industry and community to increase teaching, research and extension funding into the lifestyle horticulture industry that contributes so much to Australia's livelihood, lifestyle and quality of life.","[Aldous, D.

In this regard our research was based on different bibliographic sources that we mentioned in the article. In our approach we started by defining the two concepts, innovation and growth, the ways of interaction between them and the role of innovation in delivering economic growth. Innovation is a process for obtaining a new product or service, and marketing it. Hence the distinction from invention. The invention consists of creating a new configuration, compositions or materials, device or process being the first appearance of a new idea (concept) for a new product or process, while innovation is the first marketing of the new idea. Economic growth is a complex process aimed at the economic system as a whole and in its dynamics. By its content, it means a positive development, an upward trend of the national economy, without excluding cyclical fluctuations and even some temporary regressions. There are many reasons for businesses and organizations to innovate, including: increasing market share, the conquest of new markets, improving product quality, expanding the range of products, replacing outdated products, reducing the environmental impact etc. Like any process, innovation must be created, financially supported by investments which in turn will create new products and/or services. This is where the state must intervene through specific mechanisms. At governmental level research and development (R&D) must be supported by national policies and strategies, particularly through applied research. This will create innovative capacity capable of creating a national economic competitiveness.","[Bolan, George; Telespan, Constantin] Romanian German Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania; [Dragolea, Larisa] 1 Decembrie 1918 Univ Alba Iulia, Alba Iulia, Romania",Romanian-German University of Sibiu; 1 Decembrie 1918 University Alba Iulia,"Bolan, G (通讯作者)，Romanian German Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania.",,"Dragolea, Larisa-Loredana/AAC-4778-2021","Dragolea, Larisa-Loredana/0000-0002-3780-1018",,,,,7,0,0,5,10,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,469,475,,,,,,7,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400059,0

I present a theoretical framework that parses rebound into economic income and substitution effects. The framework leads to new insights about the magnitude of rebound when goods are not priced at marginal cost and when consumers are imperfect optimizers, as well as the role of technological progress in rebound. I then explore the implications of this framework with illustrative calculations for improved auto fuel economy and lighting efficiency. These suggest that rebound is unlikely to more than offset the savings from energy efficiency investments (known as backfire), but rebound likely reduces the net savings by roughly 10% to 40% from these energy efficiency improvements.","[Borenstein, Severin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Borenstein, Severin] Univ Calif Energy Inst, Berkeley, CA USA; [Borenstein, Severin] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Borenstein, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",borenste@haas.berkeley.edu,,,California Energy Commission,California Energy Commission,"I benefited from discussions with Carl Blumstein, Lucas Davis, Paul Joskow, Chris Knittel, David Rapson, Alan Sanstad, Catherine Wolfram and audience participants at U.C.

However, due to lack of information on inheritance of rind colour in citrus, the breeder faces a difficult task when planning crosses for breeding new cultivars. Therefore a study was undertaken to investigate the variation in rind colour, as chroma coordinates L*, a* and b*, in six mandarin families, where female parent Kiyomi tangor (Citrus unshiu x C. sinensis) was crossed with male parents Dancy, Hansen, Rishon, Roma, Shani and Sunburst mandarins (C. reticulata). A significant level of variation was found between both the parents and the families for all the colour coordinates. A greater variation was found within the families than between the families, indicating a high level of genetic variation within the families, while the within tree variation was lower than the within family variation. All the families showed an improvement in the population for rind colour over the female parent Kiyomi for L* and b*, while all the families except for the Kiyomi x Dancy family showed an improvement for a*. The Kiyomi x Dancy and Kiyomi x Roma families were found to have a population with a lighter, more yellow-orange rind colour, while the Kiyomi x Hansen, Kiyomi x Rishon, Kiyomi x Shani and Kiyomi x Sunburst families had a population with a deeper, more orange-red rind colour. The intraclass correlation coefficient relevant to selection within the families was fairly low, indicating the variation was only partly genetic and the environment contributed to the phenotypic variation. Therefore a mean performance of multiple years data should be used for effective selection.","[Combrink, Nicola K.] Agr Res Council, Inst Trop & Subtrop Crops, Addo, South Africa; [Bijzet, Zelda; Sippel, Arthur D.] ARC ITSC, Plant Improvement, Nelspruit, South Africa; [Booyse, Marde] Agr Res Council Biometry, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Labuschagne, Maryke T.] Univ Orange Free State, Dept Plant Sci, Bloemfontein, South Africa","Agricultural Research Council of South Africa; Institute for Tropical & Subtropical Crops, Agricultural Research Council; Agricultural Research Council of South Africa; Institute for Tropical & Subtropical Crops, Agricultural Research Council; Agricultural Research Council of South Africa; University of the Free State","Combrink, NK (通讯作者)，Agr Res Council, Inst Trop & Subtrop Crops, Addo, South Africa.",combrinkn@arc.agric.za,"Labuschagne, Maryke T/Z-5433-2019","Labuschagne, Maryke T/0000-0003-0593-2678",,,,,10,3,3,1,3,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,439,447,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.54,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600054,0

CVEs are increasingly used in many areas: eLearning [2], eEntertainment [3], eMarketing [4], cultural heritage [5], eMeeting [6], and entrepreneurship [7]. Currently, the development of the 3D environment often lead designers to define action/interaction rules on the basis of the environment facilities offered by it. Then it is needed a design approach, supported by a suited architecture, that let the designers focus the attention over the goals that the collaborative session is aiming. Design/methodology/approach - We propose an ICT X3D compliant architecture that allows the design and automatic generation of collaborative session for multiple virtual environments. We have been driven by the need to capture all the relevant abstractions embodied in CVEs for several domains, particularly the entrepreneurial domain.. Domain experts can design 3D collaborative experience without any CVE and technological skill because of the choice to use the Theater Metaphor [8] to abstract the CVE concepts. We introduced the concept of modeling primitives, used by different authoring profiles, which are involved in distinct phases of the design process: training designer, trainer/domain expert, CVE engineer. Originality/value - Comparing our contribution with the state of the art, we can affirm that new is the proposal of a system to generate collaborative sessions compliant with different virtual environments. The many advantages that we can demonstrate are: expressiveness to capture all of the collaborative features needed to support the creative processes of the entrepreneurs of the feature; semi-formality to facilitate the establishment of a common ground between designers of entrepreneurship platforms and CVEs engineers, and guidance to enable non-experts to cope with all the relevant aspects of a 3D virtual world. Practical implications - The growth of CVEs for entrepreneurship (but also for other domains) calls for new concrete tools that enable domain experts and engineers to model and keep under control the design complexity unleashed by technologically heterogeneous 3D virtual worlds. Two characteristics of our conceptual approach help designers during the modeling phases: abstraction (the metaphor) and separation of concerns (model views). By this ways, trainers and start up incubators in general are free to model the formative experience for the entrepreneurs of the future, designing its objectives and concentrating on the method, without the pain on facing with the technological details.","[Coppola, Giovanni; Fiore, Alessandro; Mainetti, Luca; Vergallo, Roberto] Univ Salento, Dept Innovat Engn, I-73100 Lecce, Italy",University of Salento,"Fiore, A (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Innovat Engn, Via Monteroni, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",,"Mainetti, Luca/N-4360-2015","Mainetti, Luca/0000-0001-9387-9277",,,,,9,0,0,0,4,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,929,940,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200070,0

So, the work wants to highlight through the analysis of an empirical case of success in Catanzaro's district - what might be the indicators that demonstrate the virtuous relationships among cultural organization and social and economic context.

It is a strong concern for triploid breeding programs aiming to produce seedless mandarin cultivars. In the present work, we have taken advantage of the particular genetic structures of unreduced megagametophytes resulting from second division restitution (SDR) (leading to triploid hybrid recovery) to map a genome region linked to ABS resistance in citrus. The monolocus dominant inheritance of susceptibility, proposed on the basis of diploid population studies, was corroborated in triploid progeny. Bulk segregant analysis coupled with genome scan using a large set of genetically mapped SNP markers and targeted genetic mapping by half tetrad analysis, using SSR and SNP markers, allowed locating a region linked to ABS resistance near the centromere of chromosome III. SSR and SNP markers were developed for efficient early marker-assisted selection (MAS) of ABS resistant hybrids.","[Cuenca, Jose; Aleza, Pablo; Iborra, Enrique; Vicent, Antonio; Ollitrault, Patrick; Navarro, Luis] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain; [Ollitrault, Patrick] CIRAD, UPR 75, Montpellier, France",Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA); CIRAD,"Navarro, L (通讯作者)，Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain.",lnavarro@ivia.es,"Antonio, Vicent/W-6375-2019; Aleza, Pablo/M-3710-2014; Cuenca, Jose/N-7047-2014; Aleza, Pablo/ABF-4339-2020; Ollitrault, Patrick/HLQ-0557-2023; Vicent, Antonio/D-1306-2014; Navarro, Luis/D-1001-2012","Antonio, Vicent/0000-0002-3848-0631; Aleza, Pablo/0000-0002-8936-1448; Aleza, Pablo/0000-0003-3554-5337; Vicent, Antonio/0000-0002-3848-0631; Navarro, Luis/0000-0001-5163-5960; CUENCA, JOSE/0000-0002-3094-9933; Ollitrault, Patrick/0000-0002-9456-5517",,,,,44,3,3,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,415,425,,,,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600051,0

Findings will contribute to our understanding of which explanation (deterministic vs. institutional) might be the most relevant to directly predict adopters' behaviour, and whether institutional and rational factors are correlated, or represent two separate entities. Design/methodology/approach - Our model incorporates constructs from the Technology Accepts Model, i.e. perceived usefulness and ease of use, along with constructs associated with institutional explanations, i.e. organizational expectations, technological culture and alignment of meaning systems. We surveyed the literature to identify valid measures for related constructs and adapted existing scales to measure the different constructs. We developed a questionnaire and collected data from four public hospitals in Northern Italy that are early adopters of EMRs. We have run a hierarchical regression to test our hypotheses. Originality/value - The results provide full support to the TAM model, and only partial support to the hypothesis that institutional factors have a direct and indirect (i.e. mediated by TAM) effect on technology use. Results reveal, in fact, significant direct and mediated relationships only for organizational expectations. Practical implications - Comprehensively, our results provide healthcare managers with new insights on how to trigger and facilitate the adoption and the continuative usage of EMR within their operations. On the one hand, they have to understand how professionals evaluate the benefits and shortcomings of the innovations and provide them with clear, evidence-based information about EMRs. On the other hand, they cannot mandate change easily by means of top-down, hierarchical actions, but they can create the premises and the organizational facilitations that are conducive of change by professionals.","[Gastaldi, Luca; Lettieri, Emanuele; Corso, Mariano] Polytech Univ, Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, I-20156 Milan, Italy; [Radaelli, Giovanni] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Polytechnic University of Milan; University of Warwick,"Gastaldi, L (通讯作者)，Polytech Univ, Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Via Lambruschini 4b,Bldg 26b, I-20156 Milan, Italy.",,"Gastaldi, Luca/O-8066-2019","Gastaldi, Luca/0000-0003-1997-8423",,,,,63,0,0,0,10,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1915,1929,,,,,,15,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200148,0

A program of monitoring winter temperature and rainfall data for farms from near Conchal, SP to north of Frutal, MG was instituted starting in 2008 and reported here through 2012. Controlled irrigation experiments were also instituted at two locations in the northern third of SP State, one of which was abandoned due to severe greening disease. Cool temperature induction hours (19 degrees C or less) ranged from <200 to more than 1300 h depending on location and year. Based on an ultralow volume irrigation scheme, deficits in cool temperature induction were compensated for by a moderate drought stress management system (MDSM) to achieve adequate flower bud induction without excessive drought stress. In the ultralow volume drip irrigation experiments soil moisture tensiometers indicated that keeping just the surface 20 cm with adequate moisture levels prevented severe drought and required less than 1 mm/day. These treatments kept trees in adequate condition without initiating bud sprouting for up to 120 days until released by full irrigation to allow normal bloom. The moderate stress could be released at any time in order to initiate an earlier bloom as long as water was available for normal irrigation until the rainy season started. Thirty-five to 40 days were required from initiating full irrigation until full bloom. Yields were very satisfactory in four of five years under this program which is now being used on over 10,000 ha.","[Gene Albrigo, L.] Univ Florida, Citrus Res & Educ Ctr, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA; Sucocitr Cutrale Ltda, Araraquara, SP, Brazil",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Albrigo, LG (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Citrus Res & Educ Ctr, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA.",albrigo@ufl.edu,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,5,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1251,1255,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600159,0

The goal is to create value that would provide long-term existence of business, support on keep-going and maintain the running of operations and contribute to the development and growth. All those terms can be replaced by modern concept serving as synonym, i.e. to sustain. Competence or ability to sustain in business stands for still more frequently used term of sustainability. From rather narrow original understanding of term meaning focusing attention and effort of managers on financial or economic aspects of entrepreneurial activities prevalently, its contemporary comprehension has been broadened to other horizons. Even though they can be named differently, it is possible to include them in the so called Tripple Bottom Line where except the economic part of the needed entrepreneurial thinking and behaviour also two other parts belong, namely social and environmental matters. However, firms have to engage also to more or less backward operations. Such operations can be initiated either by external stakeholders (in most cases by customers) or by internal stakeholders (employees and/or managers on the grounds of several reasons), can be solved and managed within the boundaries of individual firm, but usually are under way among the members of some supply chains or networks within the reverse logistics or reverse supply chain processes. Their occurrence and dealing with can have significant impact on all three parts (or pillars) of Triple Bottom Line aspects of business itself and the society, both negative and positive. Sustainability orientation of entrepreneurs and managers is the core to make use of these backward (or reverse) flows to be sustainable in business and to be able to create sustainable value and competitive advantage. The purpose of this paper is to gain more knowledge of the complex area of sustainable oriented entrepreneurship from the point of view of reverse logistics management. Design/methodology/approach - A theoretical framework based on literature review was developed to determine variables of sustainability orientation of entrepreneurs and reverse logistics practices related to sustainable entrepreneurship. Statistical analysis (multiple regression) of empirical data gathered by means of questionnaire was applied to test the relationship among employed independent and dependent variables. Originality/value - To our best knowledge this paper is among just few existing, which investigate a combination of several Triple Bottom Line conceptualization of sustainable entrepreneurship and sustainability orientation of reverse logistics management. The paper and presented findings can serve as a spring board for future research on the topic. Practical implications - The outcomes of the analysis stress the need for understanding of reverse flows management impact and relation to sustainability performance criteria of entrepreneurial activities.","Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Klapalová, A (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",,"Klapalová, Alena/N-3854-2015","Klapalová, Alena/0000-0002-7169-6223",,,,,25,0,0,0,34,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1987,2000,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200154,0

Environmental concerns have prompted governments to promote alternatives to applying synthetic chemicals in order to reduce the risks and impacts of pesticide use. The development of novel resistance-inducing chemicals is an alternative to protect crops against pathogens. In recent years, strategies based on using natural compounds have shown that soildrench treatments with hexanoic acid (Hx) protect mandarins against Alternaria alternata. The present work analysed both the effectiveness of Hx in controlling the ABS disease in 'Fortune' trees, and the physiological and metabolic changes associated with Hx treatment. The preliminary results indicate that all the analysed physiological parameters improve, including transpiration, photosynthesis or chlorophyll levels. Moreover, the metabolomics study of A. alternata infection and Hx treatment has found significant changes in the metabolic profile of the plant associated with both infection and treatment. In conclusion, these studies shed light on the complexity underlying induced disease resistance (IR). Hx-IR is an attractive tool for the molecular characterisation of the priming phenomenon and integrated pest management strategies, and it offers the advantage of using a natural compound.","[Llorens, Eugenio; Fernandez-Crespo, Emma; Camanes, Gemma; Lapena, Leonor; Garcia-Agustin, Pilar] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Ciencias Agr & Medio Nat, Area Fisiol Vegetal, Grp Bioquim & Biotecnol Vegetal, Castellon De La Plana, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"García-Agustín, P (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Ciencias Agr & Medio Nat, Area Fisiol Vegetal, Grp Bioquim & Biotecnol Vegetal, Castellon De La Plana, Spain.",garciap@uji.es,"Llorens, Eugenio/E-5917-2015; García-Agustín, Pilar/AAB-3073-2020; Camañes, Gemma/H-6131-2016; Fernandez-Crespo, Emma/L-2221-2017","Llorens, Eugenio/0000-0003-1931-1071; Camañes, Gemma/0000-0001-6407-9246; Garcia Agustin, Pilar/0000-0001-7238-8524; Fernandez-Crespo, Emma/0000-0003-2746-334X",,,,,19,0,0,2,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,979,986,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600122,0

Creativity is recognized as an economic driver for generating wealth and employment, sustainable development of world cities, technological changes, scientific and business innovation, personal and social development and enhancement of competitiveness of firms, enterprises, individual cities and countries which would shed light on how we live in the 21st century (Landry, 2000; DCMS, 2004, 2002, 2001, Howkins, 2001). The creative economy is considered as a leading component of economic growth, especially for developing countries, able to create and circulate intellectual capital, to generate income, employment, innovation and trade earnings while at the same time promoting cultural diversity, social inclusion and human development. It consists on those activities based on creativity, individual talent and skill and that have the potential to create jobs and wealth through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property (DCMS, 2003). In realizing a creative economy three key pillars are needed to be developed and sustained: talent, technology and innovation, and the social context. 1. Talent captures the dimension of Human capital as the key driver of economic development. Talent and creativity are the forces behind technological progress, new inventions, and new frontiers in science, technology and the arts. Research has shown that the ability of people to contribute to the full development of a real creative economy is closely linked to their knowledge, education, and their daily activity and occupation. Therefore, the talent, the ability to use, exploit and generate knowledge and insights through the creativity process is becoming the most important and distinctive economic resource for industries and places as well (Florida 2002). 2. Technology empowers enormously creativity as it provides the means through which new ideas can become new products, new businesses, generating wealth and prosperity. Especially, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have an immense impact on the productivity and innovativeness of human talent and creativity. The rapid progress of these technologies opens completely new opportunities to attain higher levels of development of new business models, market structures and governance as well as to leverage the development of new links in the value chain in virtually all creative industries. The capacity of these technologies to reduce many traditional obstacles, especially those of time and distance, for the first time in history makes it possible to use the potential of these technologies for the benefit of millions of people in all corners of the world. 3. The social context or else Tolerance is another important factor, which according to Florida comes into play. Because creativity is a social process it takes place indeed only in socially and culturally open favorable contexts that favors the emergence of new ideas, encourages people of all background, beliefs, and interests to blend together and learn from each other, paving the way for the creation of something new able to nurture, attract and mobilize these creative assets. Creativity is highly dependent on the ability to exploit external knowledge through the collaboration with diverse stakeholders, groups, and partners and even competitors. The locus of creativity is found in a network of inter-organizational relationships that allows the access to the resources of others, increase the possibility to acquire new knowledge and as result develop new products, services, new distribution and production methods etc. Design/methodology/approach - the methodology used in this study consists on using the dataset of World Economic Forum, British council and other national datasets to extract those data that provide the measures for the creative economy. We aim to provide a snapshot of the state of the art of creative economy of Balkan countries and their dynamics in time, by focalizing on three main elements: talent, technology and social context. Originality/value - This methodology puts in evidence the dynamics and the potentialities of Balkan countries to progress toward a creative, by exploiting their knowledge based assets of countries as key sources of competencies and capabilities that are deemed essential for economic growth and competitive advantage. Practical implications - The outcomes of the application is to provide a snapshot of the progress of Balkan countries toward the Creative economy and based on that define some policy implications and recommendations for further development.","[Ndou, Valentina] Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, Lecce, Italy; [Hasani, Esmeralda] Marin Barleti Univ, Dept Int Law, Tirana, Albania",University of Salento,"Ndou, V (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, Lecce, Italy.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,1,19,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1278,1290,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200098,0

Most commercial orchards in Japan receive significant amounts of rain during the maturation period. To obtain the highest quality fruit, water vapor-permeable sheets are used to cover the ground (mulching) in approximately 20% of the very early ripening Satsuma mandarin orchards in Japan. However, these sheets are ineffective in citrus fields converted from paddy fields. Chemicals, such as ethyclozate, might be used to improve fruit quality as a substitute for mulching for applying water stress and reducing water uptake through roots. This effect was notable in young trees, but there was no report of effects in mature trees. In this experiment, seasonal changes in the volumetric water content (VWC) in the trunks of mature trees were monitored using time domain reflectometry (TDR) along with the effects of the chemical. The results suggested that VWC decreased in the treated trees from early July immediately after treatment until early September. In addition, coloring began to develop one week earlier, and the Brix increased by about one degree at harvest. These results suggest that the application of ethyclozate in early summer might play a role in applying water stress to improve fruit quality.","[Okuda, Hitoshi] Mie Univ, Fac Bioresources, Tsu, Mie 514, Japan; [Ichinokiyama, Hiromichi] Mie Prefecture Agr Res Inst, Mihama, Mie, Japan; [Noda, Katsuji] Chiba Univ, Ctr Environm Hlth & Field Sci, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan",Mie University; Chiba University,"Okuda, H (通讯作者)，Mie Univ, Fac Bioresources, Tsu, Mie 514, Japan.",,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1237,1241,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600157,0

Drainage system effectiveness is highly dependent on efficient analyses of the leachate collection systems. One of the most important factors of the present study is represented by the maximum saturated depth of infiltration with a net value of 98 cm/year. The hydraulic conductivity determined for this value of net infiltration reveals that, in some cases, the vertical drain leachate drainage is prevalent. The study covered a span of two years. In order to identify groundwater pollution levels in Muntenia region five sampling points were established; their focus was to analyse COD, BOD, pH and TSS values.

Thirteen-year-old trees grown on gray upland soil in Japan were used. Treatments were defined by a factorial combination of three levels of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers (PK0%; 0, 0 or PK50%; 60, 120 or PK100%; P2O5= 120 kg . ha(-1), K2O= 240 kg . ha(-1)), and two fruit load treatments (FL1; 25-30 in 2010 and 50-100 in 2011 or FL2; leaf/fruit ratio of 50-70 in 2010 and 25-30 in 2011). There was no influence on fruit quality by reducing the application rates of phosphate and potassium fertilizers. Furthermore, reducing the rate of phosphate application did not alter available phosphoric acid levels in the soil. The phosphorus concentration of leaves from PK0%-treated trees was lower than that of leaves from PK50%-and PK100%-treated trees; however, the concentration of phosphorus in leaves remained within the standard range for citrus leaves. The exchangeable potassium content in the soil of PK0%-treated trees was lower than that in the soil of PK100%-treated trees. These results show that lower levels of phosphorus fertilizer may be applied to Satsuma mandarin orchards to prevent the accumulation of available phosphoric acid in the soil. In contrast, exchangeable potassium levels in the soil declined. Hence, further soil analysis is required to determine the extent to which this fertilizer may be reduced. Fruit bearing volume was influenced by potassium in the leaves, peel, and pulp, as well as fruit quality.","[Yoshikawa, Kiminori; Nakamura, Akihiro] Shizuoka Prefectural Res Inst Agr & Forestry, Fruit Res Ctr, Shizuoka, Japan; [Baba, Akiko] Shizuoka Prefecture Community & Environm Affairs, Shizuoka, Japan; [Kusaba, Shinnosuke] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Inst Fruit Tree Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",National Agriculture & Food Research Organization - Japan,"Yoshikawa, K (通讯作者)，Shizuoka Prefectural Res Inst Agr & Forestry, Fruit Res Ctr, Shizuoka, Japan.",kiminori1_yoshikawa@pref.shizuoka.lg.jp,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,8,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1801,1805,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600230,0

The efficiency how individual Slovak commercial banks utilized resources in their provision of depository and creditory services was decomposed into a technical component and into an allocative component, and the sources of efficiency of individual commercial banks were evaluated on the basis of this decomposition.

Both large-scale (188 macroeconomic series) and small-scale (20 macroeconomic series) slab-and-spike variable selection, and Bayesian semi-parametric shrinkage, and factor-augmented predictive regressions, as well as 20 bivariate regression models, capture the influence of fundamentals in forecasting residential investment. We evaluate the ex post out-of-sample forecast performance of the 26 models using the relative average mean square error for one-, two-, four-, and eight-quarter-ahead forecasts and test their significance based on the McCracken (2004, J Econom 140:719-752, 2007) mean-square-error F statistic. We find that, on average, the slab-and-spike variable selection and Bayesian semi-parametric shrinkage models with 188 variables provides the best forecasts among all the models. Finally, we use these two models to predict the relevant turning points of the residential investment, via an ex ante forecast exercise from 2006Q1 to 2012Q4. The 188 variable slab-and-spike variable selection and Bayesian semi-parametric shrinkage models perform quite similarly in their accuracy of forecasting the turning points.

This paper adds to the limited Canadian literature while also introducing a causal model, which can be applied to future Canadian studies. A general working-class sample group is utilized with personal income, which removes many biases introduced in other studies. The evidence suggests that a 1-unit increase in lagged BMI is associated with a 0.7% decrease in personal for obese Canadian females. Similar to other studies, the male results are inconsistent. The evidence brought forward in this study can provide an effective financial incentive for health promotion among Canadians for law and policy makers.

Electric buses employing lithium titanate batteries can provide uninterrupted transit service thanks to their ability of fast charging. However, fast charging may result in high demand charges which will increase the fuel costs thereby limiting the electric bus market penetration. In this paper, we simulated daily charging patterns and demand charges of a fleet of electric buses in Tallahassee, Florida and identified an optimal charging strategy to minimize demand charges. It was found that by using a charging threshold of 60-64%, a $160,848 total saving in electricity cost can be achieved for a five electric bus fleet, comparing to a charging threshold of 0-28%. In addition, the impact of fleet sizes on the fuel cost was investigated. Fleets of 4 and 12 buses will achieve the lowest cost per mile driven when one fast charger is installed.

This study analyses 1546 individual reservations of semen by women from a private Australian assisted reproductive health facility across a ten year period from 2006 to 2015. Using the time that each sample was available at the facility until reservation, we explore women's preference for particular male characteristics. We find that younger donors, and those who hold a higher formal education compared to those with no academic qualifications are more quickly selected for reservation by women. Both age and education as proxies for resources are at the centre of Parental Investment theory, and our findings further build on this standard evolutionary construct in relation to female mate preferences. Reproductive medicine not only provides women the opportunity to become a parent, where previously they would not have been able to, it also reveals that female preference for resources of their potential mate (sperm donor) remain, even when the notion of paternal investment becomes redundant. These findings build on behavioural science's understanding of large-scale decisions and human behaviour in reproductive medical settings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This research note explores the conceptual and methodological challenges associated with capturing change in response to the economic crisis in Europe, specifically focusing upon the environment. The environment is typically touted as a European Union success story, but there is good reason to suspect that this policy sector may have been - and continues to be - negatively affected by the economic downturn.

We first model the shock associated with the structural equation for the I(0) consumer sentiment variable as having a permanent effect on the I(1) variables. Here it appears to convey news about future productivity. The contribution of the accumulated consumer sentiment shock to the permanent component of consumption and GDP increases substantially from 2000 to 2007, a finding we relate to recent work on boom-bust productivity episodes. We then model the sentiment shock as having a transitory effect on the I(1) variables. Here it appears to convey little news and is best thought of as an 'animal spirits' shock unrelated to productivity.

This paper investigates the extent to which the global financial crisis of 2008-09, which was triggered by the US subprime crisis in 2007, and the European debt crisis that started at the end of 2009, affects the interdependence of the leading emerging markets of the BRICS countries with those of the United States and Europe. Our empirical analysis makes use of the FIAPARCH model combined with the Dynamic Equicorrelation (DECO-FIAPARCH), which allows for the estimation of market linkage for a large group of countries as a whole, while controlling for asymmetric volatility and long memory. The results reveal the presence of important changes in the time-varying linkages of the BRICS stock markets with the US and European ones. In particular, the average linkages have significantly been higher between 2007 and the first half of 2012 than the remaining part of the sample, and there is also evidence of a structural change around the Lehman Brothers collapse. We also show the effects of these stylised facts on portfolio risk assessment and forecasting.","[Hammoudeh, Shawkat] Drexel Univ, Lebow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hammoudeh, Shawkat] Montpellier Business Sch, Energy & Sustainable Dev CESD, Montpellier, France; [Kang, Sang Hoon] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Business Adm, Busan, South Korea; [Mensi, Walid] El Manar Univ, Tunis, Tunisia; [Mensi, Walid] Al Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ IMSIU, Dept Finance & Investment, Coll Econ & Adm Sci, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Duc Khuong Nguyen] IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France",Drexel University; Montpellier Business School; Pusan National University; Universite de Tunis-El-Manar; Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU); IPAG Business School,"Hammoudeh, S (通讯作者)，Drexel Univ, Lebow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Hammoudeh, S (通讯作者)，Montpellier Business Sch, Energy & Sustainable Dev CESD, Montpellier, France.",,"Nguyen, Duc Khuong/AAE-6889-2020; mensi, walid/R-6139-2016","Nguyen, Duc Khuong/0000-0002-7796-8787;",,,,,38,8,8,1,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2016,39.0,11,,,,,1703,1727,,10.1111/twec.12433,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,EB7FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387552900002,0

Analysing 687 contested legislative proposals voted upon between 1999 and 2014, it is found that a Member State is indeed less likely to vote against a proposal by the Commissioner from that Member State. Likewise, if the responsible Commissioner is a member of the same European Party Group as at least one of the governing parties, contestation is less likely.

Panel data, fixed effects, regression results indicate that a higher rate of effective residential property taxation increases the amount of land used for a given population (greater sprawl).","[Wassmer, Robert W.] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Publ Policy & Adm, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA",California State University System; California State University Sacramento,"Wassmer, RW (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Sacramento, Dept Publ Policy & Adm, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA.",rwassme@csus.edu,,,Lincoln Institute of Land Policy,Lincoln Institute of Land Policy,Support for this research received from a 2014-15 David C.

The findings suggest that the automotive industry has a disproportionate impact across Alabama in terms of a series of indicators including gross state product, employment, and household welfare. Benefits accrue primarily to counties in which the auto plants and their suppliers are located. The spillover effects into nonautomotive-plant counties are modest and about evenly distributed. Middle-income households are the largest gainers, and this is true across all counties, including the Black Belt, a region across the South where rural poverty is concentrated. Despite its rapid growth, the auto industry continues to constitute a small fraction of the state's economy (less than 3% of gross state product). Thus, overdependence on a cyclical industry is as yet not an issue for policy makers.","[Zhang, Lei] Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Kinnucan, Henry] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Gao, Jing] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China",Shandong University; Auburn University System; Auburn University; Capital University of Economics & Business,"Gao, J (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China.",jinggao96@163.com,"Kinnucan, Henry W./A-5808-2008","Kinnucan, Henry/0000-0002-0577-2224",Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station (AAES),Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station (AAES),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors-received Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station (AAES) financial support for this research.",,40,5,6,1,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

In Russia, global CSR norms interact with weak formal institutions and the strong informal expectations of state officials and local communities that companies bear responsibility for welfare and infrastructure. As a result, the concept of citizens as stakeholders' is underdeveloped. Instead, local residents remain subjects within a neo-paternalist system of governance that mimics some elements of the Soviet past. Compensation for damages to indigenous peoples has blurred legal obligations and the voluntary nature of CSR. However, the CSR in the region is constantly developing and formal methods of compensation may assist in clarifying the scope and practice of CSR.","[Henry, Laura A.] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Govt & Legal Studies, 9800 Coll Stn, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Nysten-Haarala, Soili] Univ Lapland, Commercial Law, Rovaniemi, Finland; [Nysten-Haarala, Soili] Lulea Univ Technol, Law, Lulea, Sweden; [Nysten-Haarala, Soili] POB 122, FI-96101 Rovaniemi, Finland; [Tulaeva, Svetlana] Russian Presidential Acad, POB 122, FI-96101 Rovaniemi, Finland; [Tulaeva, Svetlana] Natl Econ & Publ Adm, POB 122, FI-96101 Rovaniemi, Finland; Univ Lapland, POB 122, FI-96101 Rovaniemi, Finland; [Tysiachniouk, Maria] Wageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Tysiachniouk, Maria] Ctr Independent Social Res, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Bowdoin College; University of Lapland; Lulea University of Technology; Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration; University of Lapland; Wageningen University & Research,"Henry, LA (通讯作者)，Bowdoin Coll, Dept Govt & Legal Studies, 9800 Coll Stn, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA.",lhenry@bowdoin.edu; soili.nysten-haarala@ulapland.fi; svett07@mail.ru; tysiachn@yandex.ru,"Tysiachniouk, Maria/Y-8418-2019; Tulaeva, Svetlana/AAU-8782-2020","Tysiachniouk, Maria/0000-0002-0754-6829; Tulaeva, Svetlana/0000-0002-8481-8816; Henry, Laura/0000-0001-7112-7568; Nysten-Haarala, Soili/0000-0003-4176-2805","Swedish Institute ('The Interdisciplinary Network for Studying Company-Community Relations in Resource Extracting Sectors in Russia and Sweden); Finnish Academy Arctic Program ('Oil Production Networks in the Russian Arctic') [286791]; National Council for Eurasian and East European Research ('National Interests and Transnational Governance: Russia's Changing Environmental Policy') [827-06]; NWO, the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, Arctic Program ('Developing benefit sharing standards in the Arctic') [866.15.203]","Swedish Institute ('The Interdisciplinary Network for Studying Company-Community Relations in Resource Extracting Sectors in Russia and Sweden); Finnish Academy Arctic Program ('Oil Production Networks in the Russian Arctic'); National Council for Eurasian and East European Research ('National Interests and Transnational Governance: Russia's Changing Environmental Policy'); NWO, the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, Arctic Program ('Developing benefit sharing standards in the Arctic')","This research was supported by the Swedish Institute ('The Interdisciplinary Network for Studying Company-Community Relations in Resource Extracting Sectors in Russia and Sweden', 2011-2012), the Finnish Academy Arctic Program ('Oil Production Networks in the Russian Arctic', No. 286791), the National Council for Eurasian and East European Research ('National Interests and Transnational Governance: Russia's Changing Environmental Policy', No. 827-06), the NWO, the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, Arctic Program ('Developing benefit sharing standards in the Arctic', No. 866.15.203).",,53,47,50,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,OCT,2016,68.0,8,,,,,1340,1368,,10.1080/09668136.2016.1233523,0.0,,,29,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,EC0BT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387763300003,0

By omitting information relevant to the spouse in IOp estimations, the implicit assumption has been full responsibility for the spouse's income, effort and circumstance variables. In this paper, we discuss whether or not the spouse's characteristics should be treated as responsibility factors. Using German micro data, we analyze empirically, how IOp estimates are affected when a spouse's circumstance or effort variables are included in the analysis. We find that including spousal variables can increase IOp measures by more than 20 (35) percent for gross (net) earnings.

In addition, there are notable racial differences in adolescent smoking. We use Add Health data and apply a nonlinear decomposition method to determine the extent to which racial differences in observable characteristics account for (i) the racial smoking gaps in adolescent smoking (ages 12-18) and (ii) racial gaps in the probability of becoming a smoker in young adulthood (ages 18-24), conditional on being a non-smoker in adolescence. The model includes a host of explanatory factors, including individual, family socioeconomics, smoke exposure, school characteristics, and county crime rate. Of the 19 (9) percentage-point gap in white-black (white-Hispanic) smoking in adolescence, these factors together account for 22-28% (39-77%) of the smoking gap; and of the 18 (13) percentage-point gap in white-black (white-Hispanic) smoking up-take in young adulthood, these factors together account for 26-50% (48-100%) of the gap, depending on which set of coefficients are used for the decomposition. The biggest drivers of racial smoking gaps in adolescence are differences in friends' smoking and school peer smoking, while only school peer smoking contributes to the explained portion of racial gaps in smoking up-take in young adulthood.

It documents a statistically and economically significant positive relationship between prominent involvement in medieval trade and regional economic development today. The analysis indicates that a long-lasting effect of medieval trade on contemporary regional development is transmitted via its effect on agglomeration and industry concentration. Further empirical analyses show that medieval trade positively influenced city development both during the medieval period and in the long run; they also reveal a robust connection between medieval city growth and contemporary regional agglomeration and industry concentration. This research thus highlights the long-run importance of medieval trade in shaping the development of cities as well as the contemporary spatial distribution of economic activity throughout Europe.

Dynamic portfolio decisions are concerned with simultaneous decisions on savings and asset allocation whereby asset returns, such as on equity and bonds, are stochastic as in Campbell and Viceira (Strategic asset allocation, portfolio choice for long-term investors, 2002). In contrast to CV (2002) we do not use a local approximation method to solve the stochastic model but rather use a global solution procedure such as DP. Whereas CV (2002) solve their model by assuming a constant consumption-wealth ratio and equity premium, we can allow both to be time varying. Different variances of equity and bond returns are explored in their impact on saving and asset allocation decisions and on the value function. The stochastic dynamic portfolio decision method proposed here allows for online decisions as data on asset returns are available in real time. The method is set up in a way such that it also helps to make fund decisions online for various types of investment opportunities.","[Semmler, Willi] New Sch Univ, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Semmler, Willi] ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Semmler, Willi] CEM Bielefeld Univ, Mannheim, Germany; [Mueller, Maik] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany",The New School; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); University of Bayreuth,"Semmler, W (通讯作者)，New Sch Univ, New York, NY 10011 USA.;Semmler, W (通讯作者)，ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.;Semmler, W (通讯作者)，CEM Bielefeld Univ, Mannheim, Germany.",semmlerw@newschool.edu,,"Semmler, Willi/0000-0002-8384-8159",,,,,14,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

In this line of the literature, the leakages of tourism activities and their weak linkages with the local and national economy are ignored. To outlay the leakages, it is necessary to examine in-depth the precise nature of leakages as well as the way they occur. This study investigates leakages of hotel industry for Marmaris, Turkey, by using data obtained by a self-generated semi-structured questionnaire applied to the managers of four- and five-star hotels.

This study uses microeconomic theory and a panel data set of metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States to uncover elasticity estimates of the market demand for real estate services with respect to own price, income, business cycle fluctuations, and other variables. The empirical findings yield a number of important insights regarding the market demand characteristics associated with real estate services. First, own-price elasticity equals roughly -1.20, suggesting an elastic demand for real estate services exists at the market level. Second, the income elasticity is found to be approximately 0.40, indicating that real estate services represent a normal good. Third, business cycle fluctuations, as represented by changes in the unemployment rate, are shown to influence the real estate services market but not to a significant extent. Finally, crime rates are shown to have no independent impact on the demand for real estate services despite earlier studies finding that crime reduces housing values and sales.","[Bates, Laurie J.] Bryant Univ, Dept Econ, Smithfield, RI USA; [Santerre, Rexford E.] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Dept Finance, 2100 Hillside Rd Unit 1041, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Bryant University; University of Connecticut,"Santerre, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Dept Finance, 2100 Hillside Rd Unit 1041, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",lbates@bryant.edu; rsanterre@business.uconn.edu,,,,,,,14,1,1,1,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

It then investigates European institutions' reaction to the conflict in order to understand to what extent Russia's exclusion (as a result of the West's policy of containment and deterrence) or self-exclusion now constitutes a structural factor in the security politics of the wider Europe.

We use a sample of 34,500 home sales and the population of delinquent properties for Chicago, Illinois during the period 2010 to 2013. We focus on the delinquency discount for properties within the same Census Block. We also examine the effect of delinquency duration on neighboring properties, as this measures the level of their financial distress. We estimate the magnitude of the delinquency discount using several alternative estimation methods, in each case controlling for local foreclosure activity. Our preferred method is a matching estimator, as it works to eliminate the potential for omitted variable bias that is common in this type of estimation. We find large, negative, and statistically meaningful effects of delinquent properties for which the local government has placed a tax lien and has put the lien up for sale to private investors. For properties with a tax lien that are not successfully sold, we estimate a negative spillover of 5.1% ($12,872) on surrounding properties. Properties with a tax lien that are sold to private investors have a smaller, but still negative impact on surrounding property values of 2.5% ($6310). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our three-stage RMR estimate shows an average NOI growth of about 1.8 % during 1993-2011, which is lower than inflation rate and significantly lower than what is usually perceived by investors. Based on the RMR estimates, we find that the whole portfolio of Fannie Mae multifamily properties outperforms NCREIF multifamily properties in NOI growth, especially during the 2000-2001 recession and the Great Recession, which helps explain the superior performance of Fannie Mae multifamily mortgage loans during the recent crisis. In the cross section, multifamily properties in supply-constrained areas have substantially larger NOI growth. Workforce housing performs better than low-income housing even after we control for locational differences and property features. We do not find a size effect in NOI growth once we control for supply constraints. We also find EGI growth to be much less volatile than NOI growth, which implies that changes in operating expenses are the main driving factor of the cyclicality of NOI. Operating expenses also tend to be pro-cyclical - they grow faster during recessions. EGI growth (decline) leads PGI growth (decline), which supports the stock-flow model of rental adjustment where vacancy changes before rent. From a methodological perspective, we find that the conventional methods such as simple average and weighted average over-estimate multifamily NOI growth, likely due to significant sample selection bias and outlier influence. In contrast, the RMR indices control for changes in property quality and are much more robust in the presence of data errors and outliers.","[An, Xudong] San Diego State Univ, Dept Finance, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Fisher, Jeffrey D.] Homer Hoyt Inst, North Palm Beach, FL USA; [Geltner, David] MIT, Ctr Real Estate, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"An, XD (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Finance, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",xan@mail.sdsu.edu; fisher@indiana.edu; dgeltner@mit.edu,"Deitsch, Haysha/C-2019-2017","Deitsch, Haysha/0000-0002-0215-4340",,,,,33,2,2,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

More specifically, we examine to what extent (multiple) contract renewals and introduction of competitive tendering for long-term public transport contracts affect ridership, operational costs and subsidies in concession areas governed by public transportation authorities from 2001 until 2013 in the Netherlands. Our identification strategy improves on the literature as we are able to control for all time-invariant unobserved factors, such as network and area characteristics by using panel data. We show that when renewing long-term contracts, operational costs are reduced by at least 10%, whereas subsidies fall even stronger. For contracts that are renewed at least twice, the reduction in costs is even more substantial and in the order of 16%. We find that the effect of competitive tendering is completely absent, suggesting that the threat of competitive tendering is sufficient in a market where the majority of concessions is competitive tendered. Contract renewal not only reduces costs and subsidies, but simultaneously increases public transport ridership by 7.7%. Furthermore the vehicle-hours elasticity of operational costs is 0.40, pointing to strong economies of density. The geographical scale elasticity of operational costs is around one, which indicates constant returns to scale with respect to the geographical size of the concession area. This suggest that the current size of the Dutch concession area is optimal with respect to costs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Given their role in behaviour and policy making, the accurate measurement of attitudes is of critical importance. Traditional satisfaction scales are prone to bias and on their own they are only a partial measure of attitudes. Given that satisfaction scales have been used to assist with large scale transport infrastructure investment decisions, to aid policy makers examining reactions to alternative policy changes and reform, and to measure the success of new initiatives, deriving robust satisfaction scales should be of critical importance. This paper introduces a dual version of best worst scaling as' an alternative measure of satisfaction. Best worst scaling is free of the biases inherent in traditional response scales and is ideal for handling the comparative evaluation of large amount of attributes, particularly those which are inherently qualitative. The paper makes a further innovative contribution by proposing a model structure for the joint estimation of satisfaction and importance. Our model shows a better delineation between the attributes used to measure attitudes towards bus use and a more detailed understanding of the relationship between importance and satisfaction; enabling transport operators to better understand what counts most and assess their performance.

Central to the method is a new way to classify bicycling stress using marginal rates of substitution which are commonly developed through empirical behavioral research on bicyclist route choice. MRS values are input parameters representing bicycling stress associated with the number of lanes and speed limit of a street. The method was programmed as a geographic information system tool and requires commonly available data. The tool is demonstrated on three improvement scenarios that were recently proposed for Seattle, Washington. The full build-out scenario consists of 771 projects that include various new bike lanes, protected bike lanes, and multi-use trails. The tool produces priority rankings based on a project's ability to improve low-stress connectivity between homes and important destinations. The analysis identifies specific areas and neighborhoods that can be expected to exhibit better bikeability. Transportation planners can use the tool to help communicate anticipated project impacts to decision-makers and the public. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Contrary to previous works in which elicited beliefs are compared to an objective benchmark, we consider a purely subjective belief framework (confidence in one's own performance in a cognitive task and a perceptual task). The performance of different elicitation rules is assessed according to the accuracy of stated beliefs in predicting success. We measure this accuracy using two main factors: calibration and discrimination. For each of them, we propose two statistical indexes and we compare the rules' performances for each measurement. The matching probability method provides more accurate beliefs in terms of discrimination, while the quadratic scoring rule reduces overconfidence and the free rule, a simple rule with no incentives, which succeeds in eliciting accurate beliefs. Nevertheless, the matching probability appears to be the best mechanism for eliciting beliefs due to its performances in terms of calibration and discrimination, but also its ability to elicit consistent beliefs across measures and across tasks, as well as its empirical and theoretical properties.","[Hollard, Guillaume] Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, Palaiseau, France; [Hollard, Guillaume; Vergnaud, Jean-Christophe] CNRS, Paris, France; [Massoni, Sebastien] Queensland Univ Technol, QuBE Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Vergnaud, Jean-Christophe] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Massoni, S (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, QuBE Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",guillaume.hollard@univ-paris1.fr; sebastien.massoni@gmail.com; jean-christophe.vergnaud@univ-paris1.fr,,"Massoni, Sebastien/0000-0001-6980-7505; Vergnaud, Jean-Christophe/0000-0001-6604-4186","ANR [ANR-08-RISKNAT-007-01, BLAN07-2_192879]",ANR(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),Financial support from ANR grants are acknowledged (Riskemotion-ANR-08-RISKNAT-007-01; Feeling of control-BLAN07-2_192879).

The societal repercussions of neoliberal policy and reform in terms of moral economy remain understudied. This article seeks to address this gap by analysing moral economy characteristics and dynamics in neoliberalised communities, as perceived by traders in Uganda and sex workers in Kenya. The interview data reveal perceived drivers that contributed to a significant moral dominance of money, self-interest, short-termism, opportunism and pragmatism. Equally notable are a perceived (i) close interaction between political-economic and moral-economic dynamics, and (ii) significant impact of the political-economic structure on moral agency. Respondents primarily referred to material factors usually closely linked to neoliberal reform, as key drivers of local moral economies. We thus speak of a neoliberalisation of moral economies, itself part of the wider process of embedding and locking-in market society structures in the two countries. An improved political economy of moral economy can help keep track of this phenomenon.","[Wiegratz, Joerg; Cesnulyte, Egle] Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Wiegratz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Polit & Int Studies, Social Sci Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",j.wiegratz@leeds.ac.uk; egle.cesnulyte@gmail.com,,"Cesnulyte, Egle/0000-0002-1981-4157",University of Sheffield and University of Leeds; British Institute in Eastern Africa; Gilchrist Educational Trust,University of Sheffield and University of Leeds; British Institute in Eastern Africa; Gilchrist Educational Trust,"This research was supported by University of Sheffield and University of Leeds (PhD scholarships), the British Institute in Eastern Africa and the Gilchrist Educational Trust.",,85,25,28,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

It is argued that these cases exemplify two contradictory attitudes towards Islamic religiosity: a strong protection of 'traditional religions', but also tightening control and the wish to keep non-Orthodox religiosity outside the public space. The opposition to new mosques reveals an attitude towards Islam as something alien, but the protection of religious sensitivities, including Islamic ones, finds much support. These two examples reflect the simultaneous projects of the desecularisation and secularisation of Russian society.","[Aitamurto, Kaarina] Univ Helsinki, Aleksanteri Inst, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Aitamurto, K (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Aleksanteri Inst, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",,"Aitamurto, Kaarina/P-1474-2017","Aitamurto, Kaarina/0000-0002-8182-2035",,,,,57,9,12,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2016,68.0,1,,,SI,,182,202,,10.1080/09668136.2015.1119250,0.0,,,21,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,DL1UZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000375419400010,0

In our model, every group member is characterized by his opinion, which is represented as a point on the real line. The group evolves in discrete time steps through a voting process carried out by the group's members. Due to homophily, each member votes for the candidate who is more similar to him (i.e., closer to him on the line). An admission rule is then applied to determine which candidate, if any, is admitted. We consider several natural admission rules including majority and consensus. We ask: how do different admission rules affect the composition of the group in the long term? We study both growing groups (where new members join old ones) and fixed-size groups (where new members replace those who quit).

Firms can invest in quality, and quality investment is relatively skill intensive. The model is used to account for two findings in the empirical literature on traded goods prices, lacking a formal explanation in the theoretical literature thus far. First, the model provides a theoretical explanation for Schott's (Quarterly Journal of Economics 2004, 119, 647) empirical finding that relatively skill-abundant countries export higher priced goods. Firms in these countries invest more in quality and therefore sell higher quality, higher priced goods. Second, the opposite effects of importer market size on traded goods prices at the firm level (positive) and at the aggregate level (negative) identified in the empirical literature can be explained with the model. In a larger market, the incentive to invest in quality is larger for each firm, leading to higher firm-level prices. Due to a selection effect, also less productive firms selling goods of lower quality can export to larger markets, implying lower aggregate prices.","[Bekkers, Eddy] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Bekkers, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,43,4,4,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2016,39.0,1,,,,,72,96,,10.1111/twec.12244,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DC1UK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000369002300004,0

Intellectual property creates incentives to search, develop, produce and distribute new and authentic products. From protection of these goods and services all citizens benefit and therefore national economies and global economy. There is no doubt that solid and predictable IPRs frameworks create environment conducive to innovation and sustainable development. Nowadays proper protection of intellectual property rights is particularly important for strengthening and accelerating economic growth and development. The increase of global attention connected with intellectual property rights) protection has caused the readiness and necessity of international comparison between countries. The most serious problem in conducting such research has been the creation of common and accurate measure (index) of IPRs protection. The specific features of intellectual property (inter alia such as its open and diversified character) have caused many problems. The paper shows the current state of knowledge connected with attempts to build such a measure of IPRs protection and describes the most well-known and popular IPRs protection measures used nowadays in international comparisons.

We argue that such a promise is immanent albeit historically marginalized in the project of European integration itself, exemplified in the article with a tradition called integral federalism. The article then evaluates such a `postmodern promise' in current practices of European integration against the background of a poststructuralist-informed critique of the violent effects of desires for bordered entities and identities. Such a poststructuralist sensibility enables the article to point to the problems of `scaling up' the state in a project of integration that also set out to challenge and subvert its organizing principles.","[Borg, Stefan] Swedish Inst Int Affairs, S-10251 Stockholm, Sweden; [Diez, Thomas] Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Borg, S (通讯作者)，Swedish Inst Int Affairs, Drottning Kristinas Vag 37,Box 27035, S-10251 Stockholm, Sweden.",stefan.borg@ui.se,,"Diez, Thomas/0000-0001-8056-6693; Borg, Stefan/0000-0002-9398-8382",,,,,73,16,17,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Therefore, it is not surprising that the drop in oil prices has become increasingly discussed also in the area of monetary policy.

Unlike existing extensions, we address issues not yet covered by Czech monetary policy models, such as the incidence of motor fuel excise taxes.

Using models for NAIRU forecasting indicators of different groups of institutional factors show their impact on structural and cyclical unemployment. To these institucional factors belong employment protection legislation, wage bargaining structure, active labour market policies, labour tax burden and system of social benefits. Each of them has its own idicators which are used for determining impacts on labour market. NAIRU values will be estimated only using the Kalman filter with the coefficient for smoothing 0.6. Based on results of previous analyses of NAIRU in the conditions of V4 countries, it is a method that provides the most probable results for the unstable environment of a small open economy. Forecasts obtained from the model used are compared with real institutional factors performance and with real rate of unemployment.

To examine this role and connect it to shadow banking, the paper develops the concept of the 'repo trinity', which captures a set of policy objectives that central banks outlined after the 1998 Russian crisis, the first systemic crisis of collateral-based finance. The repo trinity connected financial stability with liquid government bond markets and free repo markets. It further reinforced the dominance of the US government bond market as institutional template for states adjusting to a world of independent central banks, market-based financing and global competition for liquidity. Central banks and the Financial Stability Board recognized the impossible nature of the trinity after 2008, attributing cyclical leverage (financial instability) and elusive liquidity in collateral markets to deregulated repo markets, markets systemic to shadow banking. The new approach triggered radical changes in crisis central banking but has not powered significant regulatory interventions in the absence of an alternative mode of organizing government bond markets.","[Gabor, Daniela] Univ West England, Fac Business & Law, UWE Bristol Frenchay Campus, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of West England,"Gabor, D (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Fac Business & Law, UWE Bristol Frenchay Campus, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",daniela.gabor@uwe.ac.uk,,,,,,,108,114,118,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

However, today modern hospitality industry faces a generational change in the labor market. Although generation Y employees create an increasing pool of hospitality workforce, their characteristics may pose real challenges for human resources management (see Kong et al., 2015). This may result from the fact that work does not play a central role in their lives, thus they may be less engaged in work and more likely to leave the organization than the older generations in the hospitality workplace (Park and Gursoy, 2012; Solnet et al., 2012). Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify the importance that employees of generation Y attach to the work-life balance and what its consequences are for the work process in the hospitality setting. More specifically this study develops and tests a research model that investigates the relationships between both work-family conflict (WFC) and workplace support for work-life balance (WSWLB) with work engagement (WE) and its correlation with employees' intention to leave (ItL). Additionally, direct correlations between WFC and WSWLB with intention to leave (ItL) are examined. The research was conducted among contact employees of hotels located in Northern Poland (Pomeranian Voivodeship). Data were collected using a questionnaire survey. The findings of this study provide empirical support that young people want to have more control over their own lives with less interference from their work. Only then will they be more likely to engage in their work and stay in a hotel organization for longer. The research value of this study may result from the fact that, to the best of authors` knowledge, this is the only attempt to measure the correlations between the proposed study context taking into account generation Y employees in the context of the Polish hospitality industry.","[Grobelna, Aleksandra] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland; [Tokarz-Kocik, Anna] Univ Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University; University of Szczecin,"Grobelna, A (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland.",a.grobelna@wpit.am.gdynia.pl; anna.tokarz@wzieu.pl,"Grobelna, Aleksandra/R-3357-2018","Grobelna, Aleksandra/0000-0002-1765-6757",,,,,44,7,8,0,19,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,489,497,,,,,,9,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400050,0

After the industrial revolution, the process of urbanization was accelerated, the rapid expansion of urban areas, urban land area was a geometric growth, and the city is constantly changing the natural landscape. At the same time, human beings intensified the usages and development of rivers, causing the obvious change of rivers' function in the city and the ability of fighting flood is declining. Once the torrential rain came constantly, in many cities a large area of water will come into being. River pollution and the ecological environment are also increasingly degraded, affecting people's daily life. With the progress of the times, people began to reconsider the relationship between the city and the river and pay more and more attention to the issue of the city.

The cost of human capital is estimated via two methods: the cost method proposed by Russian scientist M.M. Kritskiy, and the income method developed by the OECD. Current study reflects on the modified OECD method, which is applicable for statistical information disaggregated by five-year age intervals. Calculations show that in 2012 the total value of the human capital in Russia amounted to 768.7 trillion rubles if counted using M. M. Kritskiy method and 504.6 trillion rubles using OECD method. In real terms, growth in comparison with 2007 was 40 percent using the first method 10 percent using OECD method. The comparison of the estimates on the value of Russia's human capital by age groups showed that the younger ages are 'richer' than those in older age groups. Comparison of macro characteristics of the Russian economy showed that the gross stock of human capital at times exceeds the GDP and the stock of physical capital.","[Ivanova, Tatiana; Trofimova, Violetta; Valyaeva, Galina; Reent, Natalia] Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Lenina St 38, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia",Nosov Magnitogorsk State Technical University,"Ivanova, T (通讯作者)，Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Lenina St 38, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia.",jun275@mail.ru; violat@mail.ru; valyaevag@list.ru; natalyareyent@mail.ru,"Ivanova, Tatiana/C-4546-2016","Ivanova, Tatiana/0000-0002-5600-1841",,,,,10,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,680,690,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100068,0

A robust service system design is usually performed so that the design complies with specified scenarios by minimizing the maximal objective function of the individual instances corresponding with particular scenarios. The minmax link-up constraints represent an undesirable burden in any integer programming problem due to bad convergence of the branch-and-bound method. Within this paper, we try to overcome the drawback following from the link-up constraints by usage of the homogenous radial formulation of the problem, which can considerably accelerate the associated solving process especially when combined with bisection process.","[Kvet, Marek] Univ Zilina, Univ Sci Pk,Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Janacek, Jaroslav] Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina; University of Zilina,"Kvet, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Univ Sci Pk,Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",marek.kvet@uvp.uniza.sk; jaroslav.janacek@fri.uniza.sk,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,2,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,495,500,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500085,0

Thus, the main aim of this article is to apply coalitional values - viability and blockability values - on real voting data. In order to cover all possible outcomes of real voting data, it was necessary to add uncertainty issues into the concept of coalitional values - namely the concept of Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy sets approach. Real voting data are in this case represented by a voting data from the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic for two consequent periods.

Competition was essentially a market-type of behaviour in a non-market-oriented society.

Practice has proved that the system is superior to the traditional parallel processing technology in the computing power, the stability, the scalability and other aspects, and can effectively solve the large concurrent access of the massive data. In many industries and institutions, the rapid batch processing of the large data sets of the large and medium-sized databases and data warehouses has the wide range of the application requirements. How to realize the fast and interactive batch processing of the massive data is an increasingly prominent problem in the management information system, and it is also the key problem to be solved in the engineering of the data sets. The traditional data platform based on the parallel processing has been unable to meet the actual requirements of the massive data processing, and the architecture of the massive information technology urgently needs the dynamic and scalable storage and calculation model, in order to achieve the rapid response mechanism. In the large-scale database, the data query, analysis, extraction, updating and other batch processing processes are facing the serious practical problems. First, the traditional database is complex, and the query time is too long. When we are faced with a query task with the large amount of the data, it even cannot complete it. Second, when the system is faced with the data task of the concurrency, the performance of the system will be drastically reduced. Third, the expandability of the traditional database is poor, and the additionally expandable hardware cannot effectively improve the performances of the system processing. Fourth, the cost of the massive data retrieval and processing is high, with the high maintenance cost. In the researches on the massive data, the processing technology in time with the high efficiency will effectively improve the application performances of the computer system, so as to provide the better social basic services, and promote the growth of the economic efficiency. As a new business computing model based on the Internet, the cloud computing provides the flexible computing capability and the efficient method for processing the massive data.

Proponents reported its justification in particular related to the task of ensuring income to workers, which guarantees them their basic needs. Opponents argue the impacts of rising unemployment. Legislative and institutional setting of the lower limit for wages in the economy does not allow the wages of certain employees to decline to the level of equilibrium wages in the event of adverse economic activity, which may cause barriers in employing particular risk groups in the labor market. The modification of the minimum wage is a serious problem, since it represents the fundamental elements of the macroeconomic and macro-regulation in the country, the impact on the revenue policy, price policy, pension policy, as well as their own employees and employers and other groups. The aim of this paper is to examine the correlation between the increase in the minimum wage and the unemployment rate in the Slovak Republic with a focus on specific groups in the labor market and regional differentiation. Our contribution contains a justification of the existence and function of the minimum with a proposal for its modification, while it also focuses on the future shape of minimum wages in Slovakia within the changed socio-economic conditions. Consumption and investments are the driving force of the economy but the investment is to some extent driven by the anticipated consumption. Only household consumption accounted for a significant upward impetus to the Slovak economy, which would not be possible without increasing the employment and wage growth.","[Sika, Peter] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Social Dev & Labour, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Sika, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Social Dev & Labour, Bratislava, Slovakia.",peter.sika@euba.sk,"Sika, Peter/ADT-5146-2022","Sika, Peter/0000-0001-6393-7325",,,,,20,1,1,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,587,596,,,,,,10,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400060,0

The authors maintain that the knowledge of such a specific sector as the sector of the maritime economy increases the probability of finding a job in line with the education. Additionally the national economy can benefit from the employees with well-planned career paths in the maritime sectors. This is particularly important nowadays, when shortages of seamen affect especially the developed countries, including the members of the European Union. To achieve the goal of the research - the questionnaire method was used. The study was conducted at two European universities, which educate future officers for the needs of the maritime economy: Gdynia Maritime University in Gdynia (Poland) and the University of Dubrovnik (Croatia). The respondents were students of navigation and marine engineering. The point of reference for the assessment of students' knowledge was developed on the basis of the desk research of the most important benefits that the development of the maritime economy based on seamen's employment brings to the EU economy and both national economies: Polish and Croatian. The most important conclusion pointed out is a general lack of awareness of the importance of seafarers for the national economy among Polish students. A slightly better situation is among Croatian students. The conclusions of the research confirmed that there is a necessity to change the approach of decision-makers to the issue of promoting maritime labour on the university level, as well as on the level of local and state authorities. Young people not realising the importance of work of seafarers and ex-seafarers do not know much about possible career paths, which are being opened by work at sea. And this is just work for shipping, rather than shipping itself, which brings bigger economic benefits for the economy. With extensive maritime education and long-standing traditions and still the largest group as far as the number of officers is concerned (among the EU countries), Poland and Croatia should skilfully exploit this competitive advantage, especially in the face of increasing shortages of officers on the sea labour market.","[Skrzeszewska, Katarzyna] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland; [Beran, Ivona Milic] Univ Dubrovnik, Dubrovnik, Croatia",Gdynia Maritime University; University of Dubrovnik,"Skrzeszewska, K (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland.",k.skrzeszewska@wpit.am.gdynia.pl; imberan@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,4,4,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,577,586,,,,,,10,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400059,0

Therefore, it is of great and practical significance to understand the current situations of the rural meteorological services and put forward the countermeasures of improving the meteorological services in the rural areas for the defense and mitigation of the meteorological disasters and giving full play to the roles of the meteorological services in the construction of the new socialist countryside. The basic industry of the national economy is the agriculture, and therefore, some related problems of the maintenance and stability of the rural stability and harmony, the improvement of the agricultural productivity and efficiency, and the increase of the income of the farmers and the agricultural products and so on are closely linked to the meteorological work. After the reform and opening up, the social and economic development is very rapid, which makes the objects, conditions and environments of the agricultural production have undergone different changes. And in addition, the changes of the climate, and the ecology and environments have caused the tension in the meteorological and ecological environment, and now the disastrous weather is more frequent, which makes the meteorological services for the traditional agriculture cannot be of great help to the big agriculture and the precision agriculture. We should improve the modern agricultural meteorological services, in order to meet the needs of the big agriculture and the precision agriculture under the premise of the construction of the new socialist countryside. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Sixteenth National Congress of the CPC put forward the construction of the socialist new countryside as the major task, so the meteorological work must improve and enhance the services, which can also provide the rare opportunities for the development and the broad space for the development while providing the challenges for the meteorological causes at the same time, and we can faster and better develop the meteorological services. The Third Plenary Session of the Seventeenth National Congress of the CPC considered and adopted the Decisions of the Central Committee of the CPC on promoting a number of the major issues on the rural reform and development. Since 2004, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has focused the reform on the rural areas for 6 consecutive years. We should put the solutions to the agricultural meteorological problems for the agriculture, rural areas and farmers in the first place, and offer the optimal meteorological services to the farmers, and provide the good technical support and help for the construction of the new socialist countryside. These need the meteorological departments to carry out the in-depth research and exploration.","[Tsering, Phuntsok] Meteorol Bur Milin Cty Linzhi Tibet, Linzhi 860500, Tibet, Peoples R China",,"Tsering, P (通讯作者)，Meteorol Bur Milin Cty Linzhi Tibet, Linzhi 860500, Tibet, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7914-0,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,58.0,,,,,,677,682,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7QX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391643800129,0

We investigated the case of a nightly charging program where the electric utility can control home PEV charging. To explore consumer acceptance of this form of UCC, we implemented a web-based survey of new vehicle buyers in Canada (n = 1470). The survey assessed interest in PEVs, explained UCC, and elicited openness to UCC through attitudinal questions and a stated choice experiment. We find potential for UCC support among one-half to two-thirds of respondents interested in purchasing a PEV, depending on the scenario. However, some respondents express concerns with privacy and loss of control. To quantify preferences for UCC, we estimated a latent class choice model where respondents chose between different PEV charging programs. The model identified four distinct respondent segments (or classes) that vary in their acceptance of UCC, as well as their valuation of renewable electricity, saving money on their electrical bill, and undergoing charging inconvenience. The overall sample was more sensitive to cost incentives than to renewable incentives, where cost-based UCC programs garnered 63-78% enrollment while renewable-based programs garnered only 49-59% enrollment. Overall, we observe the potential for widespread acceptance of UCC programs among Canadian PEV buyers, but program design and deployment will need to carefully acknowledge the various motivations and concerns of different vehicle buyer segments.

Results show that the commonly used Delta method, producing symmetric intervals around the point estimate, often fails to account for skewness in the estimated willingness to pay distribution. Both the Fieller method and the likelihood ratio test inversion method produce more realistic confidence intervals for small samples. Some bootstrap methods also perform reasonably well, in terms of effective coverage. Finally, empirical data are used to illustrate an application of the methods considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The MPA aims at stopping copyright violations by framing materially and discursively markets. For this reason, it maintains a worldwide spectrum of relations with other business associations, workers of the motion picture industries and governments. These relationships serve the MPA in a multitude of ways, from intergovernmental negotiations and litigations to anti-copyright violation efforts in association with law enforcement. Although the MPA has acquired an authoritative position beyond audiovisual sectors, its policy remains unachieved owing to pluralizing world spheres. This neopluralist perspective underlines first the fundamentally multicentered, crosscut and fragmented aspects of globalized politics which lead actors to resort increasingly to coalitions. Second, it takes a broader perspective at politics showing not only the strengths but also the weaknesses of assumed all-powerful organizations. Third, neopluralism argues strongly for a reconsideration of the dominant views on firms, economies and governments in international political economy.","[Bohas, Alexandre] Univ Paris 01, Dept Polit Sci, F-75231 Paris 05, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Bohas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Dept Polit Sci, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",,,,,,,,136,3,3,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The magnitude and significance of impacts were determined and knowledge of network robustness was built up based on existing climate data and on future trends. Various spatial databases were integrated and a four-stage transport model was used to explore the likely impacts of network degradation. The pattern of the network was assessed via both node- and link-based measurements, where different road databases, namely TRANS-TOOLS and Tele Atias/TomTom, were employed in order to analyze the impact of spatial resolution within network connectivity analyses. This general framework developed for European Union, was tested on a specific and articulated case study area; namely, the north-east coastal region of Spain. The research conducted, yielded useful methods for the analysis of network vulnerability, where impacts are more significant in regional accessibility patterns. Accessibility indicators at the regional level changed drastically, with some regions showing up to a 26% decrease. According to the results of network connectivity indicators, the changes in network topology have reduced the number of alternative routes and placed more pressure on the transport system. The implementation of this framework and quantitative assessment methodologies outlined in this paper could be employed to assist policy makers to recognize the opportunities that may arise or diminish the adverse effects.

There are two views of impact fees: (a) an old view, that fees are a tax on development increasing prices and reducing quantity and (b) a new view, that fees provide services and reduce future taxes, thus increasing demand and prices. The research presented in this study, based on data from Florida counties, finds that the relationship between fees on commercial development and fees on employment differs across different categories of economic activity. The use of fees is positively related to service-sector employment growth and negatively related to manufacturing employment growth. This result suggests that different sectors realize different levels of benefits from infrastructure provided through fee revenue and that policy decisions based on total employment may suffer from overaggregations and lead to unintended consequences.","[Jones, Adam T.] Univ N Carolina, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Wilmington,"Jones, AT (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ & Finance, 601 S Coll Rd, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA.",jonesat@uncw.edu,,,,,,,15,1,1,1,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Results from a panel data of production areas between 2003 and 2013 show that once a basic supply-past production (or reserve) relationship is modeled, other often mentioned effects become non-significant. Chiefly among them are firm specific effects that were used as a central argument for the nationalization of YPF in 2012. Rather, the evidence shows that the observed downcycle conforms to the prediction of a simple model of depressed economic incentives acting upon mature conventional natural gas fields and hindering investment in reserve additions or new technologies. The results are robust to the nationalization of YPF, after which aggregate production continued a downward trend for two years, although are insufficient to capture an ongoing reconfiguration of incentives and risks in the forthcoming transition to shale gas production.","[Barril, Diego; Navajas, Fernando] Univ La Plata, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Navajas, Fernando] Univ Buenos Aires, RA-1053 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Navajas, Fernando] FIEL, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",National University of La Plata; University of Buenos Aires,"Navajas, F (通讯作者)，Univ Buenos Aires, RA-1053 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",navajas@fiel.org.ar,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,17,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,OCT,2015,36.0,4,,,,,23,39,,10.5547/01956574.36.4.dbar,0.0,,,17,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CS5XP,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362151900002,0

Evidence from Taiwan,TOURISM ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,advertising; price elasticity; hotel industry; Taiwan,HOTEL MANAGERIAL EFFICIENCY; PRODUCT VARIETY,"This paper empirically studies the role played by advertising on the price elasticity of lodging demand in the Taiwanese hotel industry. There are two theoretical views regarding the role of advertising. The persuasive view emphasizes that advertising creates brand royalty and reduces customers' price sensitivity. By contrast, the presumptive view is that advertising lifts marginal consumers' willingness to pay, flattens the demand curve and increases the equilibrium price elasticity. Using data from operation reports of Taiwanese international tourist hotels during 1995-2008, an ordinary least squares (OLS) analysis finds that advertising reduces consumers' price sensitivity. However, the quantile regression results suggest that the change in price elasticity generated by advertising is of an unequal pattern. In other words, the influence of advertising on price elasticity exists but varies by the level of price elasticity. The authors also examine empirically the moderating influence of advertising on the pricing strategy-hotel performance link. The estimation results indicate that the interaction term of room rate and advertising expenditure has a positive effect on room revenue. The results lend some support to the view that advertising has a moderating influence on the relationship between hotel price and financial performance.","[Chen, Chiang-Ming] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, Nantou, Taiwan; [Lin, Yu-Chen] Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Tsai, Yi-Chun] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Grad Inst Adult & Continuing Educ, Nantou, Taiwan",National Chi Nan University; Soochow University; National Chi Nan University,"Lin, YC (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",ming@ncnu.edu.tw; liny@scu.edu.tw; yctsai@ncnu.edu.tw,,,,,,,15,5,5,2,21,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We focus on classes taken during a student's first term at Northwestern and employ an identification strategy in which we control for both student-level fixed effects and next-class-taken fixed effects to measure the degree to which contingent faculty contribute more or less to lasting student learning than do other faculty. We find consistent evidence that students learn relatively more from contingent faculty in their first-term courses. This result is driven by the fact that the bottom quarter of tenure track/tenured faculty (as indicted by our measure of teaching effectiveness) has lower value added'' than their contingent counterparts. Differences between contingent and tenure track/tenured faculty are present across a wide variety of subject areas and are particularly pronounced for Northwestern's averages and less-qualified students.,"[Figlio, David N.; Schapiro, Morton O.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Figlio, David N.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Soter, Kevin B.] Greatest Good, Chicago, IL USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Figlio, DN (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,,,,,12,70,133,6,29,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

The empirical quantitative evidence regarding any such added worker effect' is mixed, and, to investigate why this might be, the article explores processes behind couples' responses to job loss. Drawing on in-depth qualitative interviews conducted with a purposive sample selected from the Understanding Society Innovation Panel, the analysis examines: (a) anticipation surrounding job loss and job search responses; (b) the extent to which couples adopt long- or short-term labour market perspectives; and (c) whether couples seek to preserve their established division of paid and unpaid labour or re-configure their joint labour supply. Findings indicate that the use of additional spousal labour is only one response among many alternatives and it is typically invoked in cases of serious financial hardship.","[Gush, Karon; Laurie, Heather] Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Scott, James] Univ Essex, Dept Sociol, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex; University of Essex,"Gush, K (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",kegush@essex.ac.uk,,"Gush, Karon/0000-0001-5113-172X; Laurie, Heather/0000-0002-1875-8827","UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [RES-062-23-3284]; ESRC [ES/I037628/1, ES/K005146/1, ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K005146/1, ES/H00811X/1, ES/I037628/1] Funding Source: researchfish",UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This research was supported by funding from the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the grant 'Understanding the impact of recession on labour market behaviour in Britain' (award no.

While these new approaches have highlighted the imaginary dimensions of crisis, they have neglected the specifically historical forms of imagination through which events are construed and constructed as crises. In particular, they have yet to adequately theorise how the recollection of prior crises might interact with efforts to diagnose and resolve a crisis in some later present. I respond to this lacuna by developing a novel set of tools for analysing the meta-historical dimensions of crisis. These include a typology that identifies three distinct ways of recalling past crises, and a concept of history-production', which captures how different interpretive practices feed into the diagnosis and negotiation of crisis episodes. Taken together these tools help illuminate a complex interaction not only between historical analogies, narratives, and lessons, but also between these representational modes and the imaginary dimensions of crisis.","[Samman, Amin] City Univ London, Dept Int Polit, London EC1V 0HB, England",City University London,"Samman, A (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Int Polit, London EC1V 0HB, England.",Amin.Samman.1@city.ac.uk,,"Samman, Amin/0000-0003-4721-4877",,,,,68,17,17,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

One prominent example of using mudflats in a tourism context is the Boryeong Mud Festival. To understand the role of the touristic experience in shaping the need for preservation, this study: (a) examines the effect of experiences in a nature-based festival on visitors' willingness-to-pay (WTP) to preserve mudflats; and (b) estimates the preservation value of mudflats by using a contingent evaluation method. In particular, the perceived value of festival experiences is included in the proposed models when estimating visitors' WTP. The results indicate that the experience of festival visitors was positively associated with WTP by showing that festival visitors perceived a higher level of utility for preserving mudflats as the functional value of festival experience increased. Based on the error-reduced WTP results, the average respondents' WTP and the annual aggregate preservation value of mudflats were estimated at KRW 11,039 (US$8.64) and KRW 22,818 million (US$17.85 million), respectively.","[Choi, Youngjoon; Dattilo, John] Penn State Univ, Dept Recreat Pk & Tourism Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Lee, Won Seok] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Convent Management, Seoul 130701, South Korea; [Lee, Choong-Ki] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Hotel & Tourism Management, Seoul 130701, South Korea",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Kyung Hee University; Kyung Hee University,"Lee, CK (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Hotel & Tourism Management, 26 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 130701, South Korea.",yzc123@psu.edu; lws79877@gmail.com; cklee@khu.ac.kr; jxd8@psu.edu,"Lee, Choong-Ki/AAH-9113-2020","Dattilo, John/0000-0001-9332-0932; CHOI, Youngjoon/0000-0001-6888-3952",,,,,58,17,18,1,35,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Because many of the policy options under consideration are market-based (e.g., gasoline tax, carbon tax), it is important to consider how the impacts would vary across space and affect different subpopulations. Evaluating incidence is relevant for both the expected costs and benefits of a particular policy, however detailed data on vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) and fuel consumption allowing for the distributions of these variables to be estimated at a fine geographic scale is rarely available. This paper uses a unique dataset with more than 20 million vehicles in California to derive estimates of VMT and fuel consumption in order to examine the spatial distribution of impacts for an increase in the price of gasoline as well as the consequences of using different statistics for policy evaluation. Results show that VMT and fuel consumption distributions are not symmetrically distributed and vary significantly within transportation planning regions. To understand the potential implications of this asymmetry, we do a back of the envelope comparison using the mean and mode of the VMT or fuel consumption distribution for policy analysis. We find that assuming a symmetric distribution can lead to a divergence of 20-40% from the estimates based on the empirical distribution. Our results, therefore, introduce caution in interpreting the incidence of policies targeting the transportation sector based on averages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the results of current comparisons with conventional vehicles are not always in favor of electric vehicles. We outline that this is not only due to the different assumptions in the time of charging and the country-specific electricity generation mix, but also due to the applied assessment method. We, therefore, discuss four assessment methods (average annual electricity mix, average time-dependent electricity mix, marginal electricity mix, and balancing zero emissions) and analyze the corresponding CO2 emissions for Germany in 2030 using an optimizing energy system model (PERSEUS-NET-TS). Furthermore, we distinguish between an uncontrolled (i.e. direct) charging and an optimized controlled charging strategy. For Germany, the different assessment methods lead to substantial discrepancies in CO2 emissions for 2030 ranging from no emissions to about 0.55 kg/kWh(el) (110 g/km). These emissions partly exceed the emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles. Furthermore, depending on the underlying power plant portfolio and the controlling objective, controlled charging might help to reduce CO2 emissions and relieve the electricity grid. We therefore recommend to support controlled charging, to develop consistent methodologies to address key factors affecting CO2 emissions by electric vehicles, and to implement efficient policy instruments which guarantee emission free mobility with electric vehicles agreed upon by researchers and policy makers.

Using data from the 2002 International Social Survey Programme, this article investigates whether work-hour regulations have a significant effect on household allocation of paid labour and gender work-hour inequality. Two main types of work-hour regulations are examined: standard weekly work hours and the maximum allowable weekly work hours. Results show that households in countries with shorter maximum weekly work hours had less work-hour inequality between spouses, as each additional allowable overtime hour over the standard working week increased the work-hour gap between couples by 20 minutes. These results indicate that couples' inequality in work hours and gender inequality in labour supply are associated with country-level work-hour regulations.","US Bur Census, Washington, DC 20233 USA",,"Landivar, LC (通讯作者)，US Bur Census, 4600 Silver Hill Rd, Washington, DC 20233 USA.",liana.c.landivar@gmail.com,,,National Science Foundation Dissertation Improvement Grant,National Science Foundation Dissertation Improvement Grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research was supported by a National Science Foundation Dissertation Improvement Grant.,,34,23,27,5,45,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Our objective is to analyze the effects and consequences of the construction of a tramway line in some neighborhoods and municipalities of the agglomeration. These localizations are confronted to isolation and concentration of unfavorable socio-economic characteristics. Among other things, this line has permitted to facilitate the access to the historical job center of Bordeaux for inhabitants concerned. We use difference-in-differences methods to compare labor market outcomes of inhabitants who benefit from this better access with others who do not, before and after the construction. Results show that if unemployment rate has globally decreased on the period observed, the decrease is more important for neighborhoods located close to tramway stations. More generally, it seems that the tramway project helped to reduce some socio-economic inequalities in the agglomeration of Bordeaux. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We find 2.3% too many Chinese births on these auspicious birth dates, whereas Whites show no corresponding increase. The increase in Chinese births is driven by higher parity C-sections: the number of repeat C-sections is 6% too high on auspicious birth dates. Sons born to Chinese parents account for the entire increase; daughter deliveries do not seem to be timed to achieve lucky birth dates. We also find avoidance of repeat C-section deliveries on the 4th, 14th, and 24th of the month, considered unlucky in Chinese culture. Finally, we replicate earlier work finding that Friday the 13th delivery dates are avoided and document a particularly large decrease among Chinese.

This paper reverses this thinking and shows that when a regime provides institutionalized dispute settlement, states sometimes seek to undo it. The settlement of maritime boundaries is a case in point. Governed by the Law of the Sea regime, which provides four institutional mechanisms for states to solve disputes, the vast majority of agreements specify bilateral negotiations as the only way to deal with future conflicts. The reason for this is that states pay attention to both the cost and flexibility of conflict resolutions mechanisms. We find that poorer states are more likely than wealthy states to specify bilateral negotiations, the cheapest and most flexible conflict resolution mechanism. Wealth differentials are also associated with greater demands for flexibility.","[Asgeirsdottir, Aslaug] Bates Coll, Dept Polit, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA; [Steinwand, Martin] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Polit Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Asgeirsdóttir, A (通讯作者)，Bates Coll, Dept Polit, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA.",aasgeirs@bates.edu; martin.steinwand@stonybrook.edu,,"Steinwand, Martin/0000-0002-4218-0164",Bates College Faculty Development Fund,Bates College Faculty Development Fund,"The authors wish to thank Bates College Faculty Development Fund for supporting this project.

The authors find three types of response to the new TFW members: resistive, facilitative and active. Furthermore, these responses were dynamic and changing over time. The different responses are best explained not by the unions' institutional context, but by internal factors shaping each union's response. Drawing upon the concept of referential unionisms, the study explores how unions' self-identity shapes their responses to new challenges such as the influx of migrant workers.","[Foster, Jason] Athabasca Univ, Ind Relat, Edmonton, AB T5H IR1, Canada; [Taylor, Alison] Univ British Columbia, Educ Studies, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Khan, Candy] Univ Alberta, Educ Policy Studies, Fac Educ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada",Athabasca University; University of British Columbia; University of Alberta,"Foster, J (通讯作者)，Athabasca Univ, 10224-89 St, Edmonton, AB T5H 1R1, Canada.",jasonf@athabascau.ca,,,,,,,53,8,11,1,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Using individual-level census data, we first estimate 204 homeownership regressions stratified by household age (21, 22, ..., 89) and survey year (2000, 2005 and 2009). Shift-share methods confirm that changes in the model coefficients that reflect household attitudes, lending standards and other market conditionsbut not population socioeconomicswere the primary driver of the boom and bust in homeownership over the decade. This pattern holds for nearly all age groups and is more pronounced for recent movers. Results also suggest that homeownership rates may have come close to bottoming out in early 2013 at 65% after falling roughly four percentage points from their peak in 2006. This suggests little lasting effect of the grand homeownership policy experiment of recent decades.","[Gabriel, Stuart A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Rosenthal, Stuart S.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Rosenthal, Stuart S.] Syracuse Univ, Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Syracuse University; Syracuse University,"Gabriel, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",stuart.gabriel@anderson.ucla.edu; ssrosent@maxwell.syr.edu,,,Research Institute for Housing America (RIHA),Research Institute for Housing America (RIHA),"Funding for this article from the Research Institute for Housing America (RIHA) is gratefully acknowledged.

The fall in the wage share of value added is now accepted as a stylised fact in the empirical economic literature. This paper argues that the punctuated pattern of the development validates the regulation theoretical narrative of an epochal shift from Fordism to finance-led accumulation. Furthermore, synthesising econometric studies supports a class-centred explanation. In the last instance, the falling wage share is due to successful transnational class rule in the form of a neoliberal hegemonic paradigm. Crucially, such class rule restructured the environment of trade unions, rendering increasingly ineffective its relational power resources. The paper concludes by considering the contradictory implications for organised labour of the current financial crisis. On the one hand, the financial crisis offers an opportunity to link its particular interests to the general interest of macroeconomic management since low wage share inhibits growth rates. But how might trade unions assert a higher wage share in the face of the structural power of (financial) capital?","[Bengtsson, Erik] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ & Soc, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Ryner, Magnus] Kings Coll London, Dept European & Int Studies, London WC2B 6NR, England",University of Gothenburg; University of London; King's College London,"Bengtsson, E (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ & Soc, Box 720, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",erik.bengtsson@econhist.gu.se; magnus.ryner@kcl.ac.uk,,"Ryner, Magnus/0000-0002-7492-2986",Lindley Foundation of the Transport Workers' Union of Sweden,Lindley Foundation of the Transport Workers' Union of Sweden,"We gratefully acknowledge the generous financial and logistical support of the Lindley Foundation of the Transport Workers' Union of Sweden, as well as the logistical support of Arenagruppen and the Northern Office of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation.

Difficulties mainly arise from the lack of appropriate data, the non-normality of returns, and the inapplicability of many of the traditional methodologies. As a result, calculation of this risk measure has rarely been done in the real estate field. However, following a spate of new regulations such as Basel II, Basel III, NAIC and Solvency II, financial institutions have increasingly been required to estimate and control their exposure to market risk. As a result, financial institutions now commonly use internal Value at Risk (V a R) models in order to assess their market risk exposure. The purpose of this paper is to estimate distribution functions of real estate V a R while taking into account non-normality in the distribution of returns. This is accomplished by the combination of the Cornish-Fisher expansion with a certain rearrangement procedure. We demonstrate that this combination allows superior estimation, and thus a better V a R estimate, than has previously been obtainable. We also show how the use of a rearrangement procedure solves well-known issues arising from the monotonicity assumption required for the Cornish-Fisher expansion to be applicable, a difficulty which has previously limited the useful of this expansion technique. Thus, practitioners can find a methodology here to quickly assess Value at Risk without suffering loss of relevancy due to any non-normality in their actual return distribution. The originality of this paper lies in our particular combination of Cornish-Fisher expansions and the rearrangement procedure.","[Amedee-Manesme, Charles-Olivier] Univ Laval, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate Pavillon Pal, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Barthelemy, Fabrice] Univ Versailles St Quentin En Yvelines, CEMOTEV, F-78047 Guyancourt 33, France; [Keenan, Donald] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France",Laval University; Universite Paris Saclay; CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Amédée-Manesme, CO (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate Pavillon Pal, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",charles-olivier.amedee-manesme@fsa.ulaval.ca,"Amedee-Manesme, Charles-Olivier/M-7304-2019","Amedee-Manesme, Charles-Olivier/0000-0002-9192-7228",Labex MME D-II program; University of Cergy-Pontoise; Fondation Palladio,Labex MME D-II program; University of Cergy-Pontoise; Fondation Palladio,"The authors wish to thank Labex MME D-II program, the University of Cergy-Pontoise and Fondation Palladio for their generous support.",,35,10,10,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Very recently, hybrid DSGE models have become popular for dealing with some of the model misspecifications. Major advances in estimation methodology could allow these models to outperform well-known time series models and effectively deal with more complex real-world problems as richer sources of data become available. In this study we introduce a Bayesian approach to estimate a novel factor augmented DSGE model that extends the model of Consolo et al. [Consolo, A., Favero, C.A., and Paccagnini, A., 2009. On the Statistical Identification of DSGE Models. Journal of Econometrics, 150, 99-115]. We perform a comparative predictive evaluation of point and density forecasts for many different specifications of estimated DSGE models and various classes of VAR models, using datasets from the US economy including real-time data. Simple and hybrid DSGE models are implemented, such as DSGE-VAR and tested against standard, Bayesian and factor augmented VARs. The results can be useful for macro-forecasting and monetary policy analysis.","[Bekiros, Stelios] European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, I-50133 Florence, Italy; [Bekiros, Stelios] RCEA, I-47900 Rimini, Italy; [Paccagnini, Alessia] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ, I-20126 Milan, Italy",European University Institute; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Bekiros, S (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Dept Econ, Via Piazzuola 43, I-50133 Florence, Italy.",stelios.bekiros@eui.eu,"Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/K-4041-2014","Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/0000-0002-9376-8726; Paccagnini, Alessia/0000-0002-2421-7242","European Community [FP7-PEOPLE-2011-CIG, 303854]; Dote ricercatori: FSE, Regione Lombardia","European Community; Dote ricercatori: FSE, Regione Lombardia(Regione Lombardia)","Stelios Bekiros is supported by the Marie Curie Fellowship (FP7-PEOPLE-2011-CIG, No 303854) under the 7th European Community Framework Programme.

Recent research on the determinants of height suggests that postneonatal mortality predicts height because it is a measure of the early life disease environment to which a cohort is exposed. This article advances the literature on the determinants of height by examining the role of early life mortality, including neonatal mortality, in India, a large developing country with a very short population. It uses state level variation in neonatal mortality, postneonatal mortality, and pre-adult mortality to predict the heights of adults born between 1970 and 1983, and neonatal and postneonatal mortality to predict the heights of children born between 1995 and 2005. In contrast to what is found in the literature on developed countries, I find that state level variation in neonatal mortality is a strong predictor of adult and child heights. This may be due to state level variation in, and overall poor levels of, prenatal nutrition in India. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In our empirical strategy, we proceed in two steps: in the first step, using as starting point the traditional control approach method to estimate total factor productivity, we consider a more general process driving the law of motion of productivity in which we recognise the potential role that export and R&D experience might have in shaping future firms' productivity, and test whether this assumption holds; in the second step, we estimate a bivariate dynamic model of the firm's decision to invest in R&D and export, in which we analyse the linkages among investing in R&D, exporting and productivity. Using a representative sample of Spanish manufacturing firms for the period 1990-2009, we find that both export and R&D positively affect future productivity, which will drive more firms to self-select in those activities.","[Manez, Juan A.] Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain; ERICES, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Máñez, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain.",,"Manez, Juan/K-6780-2014; ROCHINA BARRACHINA, MARIA ENGRACIA/K-8929-2014; Sanchis Llopis, Juan A./K-8923-2014","Manez, Juan/0000-0003-1105-0815; ROCHINA BARRACHINA, MARIA ENGRACIA/0000-0002-9263-1023; Sanchis Llopis, Juan A./0000-0001-9664-4668","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2011-25033, ECO2011-30323-C03-02]; Generalitat Valenciana [PROMETEO/068]",Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)),"We wish to thank two anonymous referees and participants in the EARIE 2013, JEI 2013 and INTECO 2013 conferences for their comments and suggestions on previous versions of this paper.

The crux of Savage's objection is the possibility that a decision maker would choose to ignore even extensive information. More recently, Parmigiani (Theor Decis 33:241-252, 1992) has suggested that minimax regret suffers from the same flaw. He demonstrates the existence of relevant experiments that a minimax regret agent would never pay a positive cost to observe. On closer inspection, I find that minimax regret is more resilient to this critique than would first appear. In particular, there are cases in which no experiment has any value to an agent employing the minimax negative income rule, while we may always devise a hypothetical experiment for which a minimax regret agent would pay. The force of Parmigiani's critique is further blunted by the observation that relevant experiments exist for which a Bayesian agent would never pay.

Classical mean-variance analysis of alternative investments has been hampered by the lack of a systematic treatment of volatility in these markets. In this paper we propose a hedonic regression framework which explicitly defines an underlying stochastic process for the price index, allowing to treat the volatility parameter as the object of interest. The model can be estimated using maximum likelihood in combination with the Kalman filter. We derive theoretical properties of the volatility estimator and show that it outperforms the standard estimator. We show that extensions to allow for time-varying volatility are straightforward using a local-likelihood approach. In an application to a large data set of international blue chip artists, we show that volatility of the art market, although generally lower than that of financial markets, has risen after the financial crisis of 2008-09, but sharply decreased during the recent debt crisis.

However, when the endogeneity problems in absorptive capacity such as R&D and export activity variables are considered, the role of absorptive capacity becomes too insignificant to alleviate the negative spillovers from FDI. In addition, the results from simultaneous quantile regression indicate that the effect of R&D and export activity to absorb the additional spillovers is heterogeneous depending on the conditional productivity distribution.","Hyundai Res Inst, Seoul 110470, South Korea",,"Kim, M (通讯作者)，Hyundai Res Inst, 1-7 Yeonji Dong, Seoul 110470, South Korea.",mk5tc@virginia.edu,,"Kim, Minjung/0000-0001-7980-4885",,,,,37,26,31,2,46,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Agents facing a dichotomous decision might prove biased toward one of the options facing them. That is, they may be more likely to decide correctly when one of the options is correct than when the other option is. A juror might be more likely to convict a guilty defendant than to acquit an innocent one. Agents may display opposing biases. This paper identifies the optimal committee composition in the presence of such bias. This composition depends upon both the prior probability that each option is correct and the relative costs of the two types of possible error (e.g., convicting an innocent defendant versus acquitting a guilty one). Optimal committee composition will be expressed in terms of the absolute (not relative) margin that a group with one form of bias should enjoy over the other.","Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Stone, P (通讯作者)，Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dept Polit Sci, 3 Coll Green, Dublin 2, Ireland.",pstone@tcd.ie,"Stone, Peter/H-3838-2017","Stone, Peter/0000-0001-8343-6843",,,,,23,7,7,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2015,78.0,3,,,,,399,409,,10.1007/s11238-014-9426-3,0.0,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CB0ON,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349326000004,0

Numerous studies investigating the determinants of tourists' expenditure limit their investigation to the actual expenditure of tourists. This paper extends the existing literature on tourists' spending by introducing mental accounts theory. Mental budgets set the limit on the expenditure on a particular category of goods in order to avoid overspending in situations in which a rational approach to spending is not possible. The authors apply this theory to a case of visitors' spending at a Christmas market in Merano. Data were analysed with the Heckman selection model to understand the determinants of mental budgets and the actual spending of visitors and to study how well their intentions are met by their real behaviour. The findings of the paper indicate that the mental budget is an important component for the analysis of tourists' expenditure.,"[Brida, Juan Gabriel; Tokarchuk, Oksana] Free Univ Bolzano, Competence Ctr Tourism Management & Tourism Econ, Fac Econ & Management, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"Brida, JG (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bolzano, Competence Ctr Tourism Management & Tourism Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Piazza Univ 1, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy.",juangabriel.brida@unibz.it; oksana.tokarchuk@unibz.it,"Tokarchuk, Oksana/AAJ-3468-2021; Brida, Juan Gabriel/H-3727-2015","Tokarchuk, Oksana/0000-0001-7602-9780; Brida, Juan Gabriel/0000-0002-2319-5790","Autonomous Province of Bolzano; project 'Le attrazioni culturali e naturali come motore dello sviluppo turistico.

We provide empirically implementable criteria that coincide with the unanimity, over a reasonably large class of such individual preferences, of anonymous and Pareto-inclusive Von Neuman Morgenstern social rankings of risks.

Meanwhile, current methods of analysis are subjective and highly diversified; they are also ones of the best tools for artificial insemination using cryogenic preserved semen for the contemporary livestock producer. The aim of the present study was to determine if there are differences associated with sperm head morphometric dimensions in individuals with different sexual maturity ratings. For the present results, there was setting off ram groups depending on age: 12, 36 and 72 months of age. There were used random images from fresh sperm and each head spermatozoon was measured with the aid of a specialized soft for four primary parameters (length, L; area, A; width, W and perimeter, P) and four derived parameters (ellipticity, L/W; rugosity, 4 pi A/P-2; elongation, L - W/L + W and regularity, pi LW/4A). The analyzed data were statistically processed, being recorded the main population parameters: the average, its error, the standard deviation, the coefficient of variability. There were no significant differences in the sperm head dimension or shape among middle-aged and old individuals (P > 0.05). However, significant differences were detected in area, perimeter and width (lower values) and length, ellipticity and elongation (higher values) in old or middle-aged individuals compared with young individuals (P < 0.01). As a conclusion, this study confirms that ram age is related to sperm morphometric size. Therefore, the present study provides information regarding the maturation of ram sperm and supports the idea that the dimensions of ram spermatozoa may be taken as an approximate indication of its relative maturity.

Gibberellins and ethylene treatments have been used for delaying or accelerating color development in citrus fruit peel, respectively, indicating a prominent role of these hormones in the regulation of the external ripening process. Late ripening mutants constitute an extremely useful tool to decipher the molecular bases regulating the timing and the rate of color development in citrus fruits. Although the causes for these phenotypes may be diverse, there is recent evidence in the literature linking delayed degreening with altered ethylene sensitivity. 'Tardivo' is a late ripening mutant of clementine mandarin that displays a delay in peel degreening, color development and expression of carotenoids biosynthetic genes. In the present work we have explored if this phenotype is associated with altered sensitivity to ethylene. Therefore, we have examined the expression of genes involved in carotenoids, ABA biosynthesis, and ethylene signaling and biosynthetic pathways in response to ethylene. The results indicated that 'Tardivo' fruits displayed a transient response to ethylene but it was unable to sustain subsequent ethylene-induced gene expression.

It uses internationally recognised frameworks and locally grounded key performance indicators (KPIs) to simultaneously enable learning for sustainability, meet compliance requirements and verify environmental, social, production and business performance. Most KPIs are regularly scored and uploaded by the growers and viticulturists so that participation is inexpensive, rapid and does not require specialist knowledge. Some secondary or aggregate KPIs will be automatically calculated by accessing national and regional databases and maps (e.g. weather and soil maps) or models (e.g. a carbon footprint calculator). The grower's KPIs are instantly benchmarked against neighbours' performance and matched enterprises to incentivise improvement, and compared against their own previous scores for trend analysis. KPIs will be scaled against amber and red alert thresholds to flag when intervention is required. 'What-if' decision modules will be linked to the KPIs so that the growers can optimise investments to improve performance. Survey modules will allow the network of growers to guide industry strategy. Key challenges and opportunities encountered when designing and testing the prototype New Zealand Sustainability Dashboards are balancing generalisability and specificity, scientific reliability, cross-scale linkage and participation by growers. The Sustainability Dashboard needs to be trusted by multiple stakeholders if it is to secure food integrity, food safety, environmental stewardship and future-proof market access by verifying market assurance claims.","[Benge, J.; Barber, A.; McCusker, K.; Le Quellec, I.; Manhire, J.; Hunt, L.] Lincoln Univ, Lincoln, New Zealand; [Moller, H.; Rosin, C.] Univ Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand; [MacLeod, C.

The reason for this study stems from the fact that micro-enterprises are key drivers of economic growth, and that women entrepreneurs are key developers of these businesses. So it's important to know factors affecting their existence and their success or failure. Our aim is to describe some typical woman-family relationship profiles, characterized by families playing a central role in influencing female firms' choices, behaviors and activities, in positive or negative ways. Design/methodology/approach - We address the research question adopting a qualitative research approach based on multiple case studies (Yin, 2009). Case studies are particularly suited to look at the meaning of the experiences of people, as it is a research strategy particularly suitable to examine in depth current events of real life. Data collection is based on direct interviews (McKenzie, 2007) with Italian women entrepreneurs, through a semi-structured questionnaire (Qu & Dumay, 2011), guided by a checklist. Originality/value - This analysis help to better focus one of the key issue of women's life when they try to balance family life with their work and their professional aspirations. This means that in order to support women entrepreneurship is essential to address this issue. Finally, it's important to know and understand the role of family in women entrepreneurial experiences in order to clearly interpret the reasons of women-owned businesses success or failure, as family ties will inevitably have an impact on their performances. Practical implications - The analysis presented in this paper shows the existence of an unbreakable bound between female entrepreneurs and their families. Under a methodological profile, the main conclusion of our analysis is that female entrepreneurial experiences - women's choice to become an entrepreneur and characteristics of their businesses - cannot be truly understood if attention is not paid also on family dimension. This latter aspect underlines a very profound difference between the entrepreneurial experiences of men and women, as it's very difficult to find similar situations when men entrepreneurs are analyzed.","[Cesaroni, Francesca Maria] Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dept Econ Soc Polit, Urbino, PU, Italy; [Paoloni, Paola] Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dept UNISU, Urbino, PU, Italy",University of Urbino; University of Urbino,"Cesaroni, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dept Econ Soc Polit, Via Saffi 42, Urbino, PU, Italy.",,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,16,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,889,899,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200067,0

By focusing on knowledge spillovers, we study the pattern and evolution of knowledge flows within the EU and between the EU and two frontier innovators: the United States and Japan. This research question is motivated by increased concern that the fragmentation of EU renewable energy research and innovation systems may hamper the ability to address climate challenges at socially acceptable costs. Design/methodology/approach - Following a well-established tradition, we measure the intensity and the direction of knowledge flows by looking at patent citations. We use the EP_CRIOS database to collect information on EPO patent applications in renewable energy technologies by inventors residing in the US, Japan and the EU15, between 1985 and 2010. Since the number of citations depends on countries' characteristics and on the total number of patents, the analysis focuses on the probability of citations, estimated with a double exponential lag model, as proposed in Jaffe and Trajtenberg (1999), which allows to control for several factors affecting the likelihood of citation. Originality/value - This is the first work studying the fragmentation of EU technological space in the renewable energy sector and examining whether environmental policies can contribute to a strengthening of knowledge networks in this area. Our results suggest that after 1997 Member States' national innovation systems have evolved towards a more integrated innovation space at the EU level. Environmental policies seem to have pushed the EU to become a frontier innovator, since the EU15's role as a source of knowledge for the US increased. However, innovative activity at EU level is still poorly integrated if compared to the American and Japanese systems. Practical implications - The redesign of EU renewable energy policy will benefit from a clearer understanding of the links between research and innovative activities across Member States and of their evolution over time. Grasping whether environmental policy can contribute to a strengthening of knowledge networks, lowering the costs of climate mitigation and the burden for firm's competitiveness, is hence a relevant question for both researchers and policy makers. This study also offers insights for the design and the implementation of specific technology-push initiatives for the renewable energy sector, such as those envisaged by the 2008 SET-PLAN and the 2015 Energy Union package.","[Conti, Chiara; Sanna-Randaccio, Francesca; Sestini, Roberta] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn Antonio Ruber, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Mancusi, Maria Luisa] Catholic Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Milan, Italy; [Mancusi, Maria Luisa] Bocconi Univ, CRIOS, Milan, Italy; [Verdolini, Elena] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei FEEM, Milan, Italy; [Verdolini, Elena] Euromediterranean Ctr Climate Change CMCC, Milan, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Bocconi University; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC),"Sanna-Randaccio, F (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn Antonio Ruber, Via Ariosto 25, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",,"Mancusi, Maria Luisa/F-7584-2013","SESTINI, Roberta/0000-0003-0497-9394",,,,,19,1,1,0,9,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1378,1390,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200106,0

The yeast strain Yarrowia lipolytica CMGB32 was characterized using morpho-physiological observations and PCR-RFLP analysis of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region. The amplicon had 360 bp and the phylogenetic position of Y. lipolytica CMGB32 compared to reference yeast strains was determined by constructing an UPGMA dendrogram based on the Hinf I restriction profiles. After 72 hours of cultivation on Yeast Peptone media supplemented with 1% petroleum, the strain Y. lipolytica CMGB32 showed a high multiplication rate, forming elaborate pseudohyphae and petroleum mini-droplets invaded by yeast cells. The biosurfactant production was estimated using the emulsification index (E-24). High values were obtained against toluene (52%), n-hexadecane and n-dodecane. The stability studies showed that the biosurfactants had an increased activity at 4 degrees C (57%) while the values decreased significantly by the addition of NaCl (27% for a NaCl solution 10%). The antimicrobial assays using cell-free broth containing biosurfactants revealed no activity against seven tested potential pathogen yeast strains. The screening tests showed that Y. lipolytica CMGB32 had good lipolytic activity in the presence of 1% Tween 80. The present study suggests an important biotechnological potential for the strain Y. lipolytica CMGB32. Therefore, our further research will aim the complex characterization of the purified biosurfactants and the study of a possible relation between biosurfactant production and lipase synthesis.

The partial results of this research show that Bucovina is a very appreciated tourist destination due to the rich natural and anthropic patrimony. However, some obstacles in the development of Romanian tourism, and especially receptive tourism, are highlighted. The weak points are the insufficient promotion of this destination abroad, the reduced accessibility, and the poor road infrastructure and public transport services.

About 80% of the production is located in the arid southeast regions. In these areas, shade screens reduce leaf temperature and light intensity at midday in summer and spring periods, resulting in increased photosynthetic leaf water use efficiency (WUEphy = A(CO2)/E-leaf). In this work we analyzed the effect of shading with Aluminet-50 screen (which reduces about 50% the incident photosynthetically active radiation) on the production, fruit quality, leaf mineral composition, and growth parameters of ` Fino 49' lemon trees grafted on two rootstocks, Citrus macrophylla (CM) and sour orange (SO) over a four-year period (2008-2011), using six-year old trees at the beginning of the experiment. Shade screen had similar effect on trees grafted on either rootstock. Shading increased tree height and canopy perimeter producing trees with about 60% larger canopy volume than control trees grown under full sunlight. However, while trees on Citrus macrophylla and sour orange under full sunlight produced 81 and 45 kg/tree, similar trees under shade produced 70 and 33 kg/tree, respectively. Shading affected the physical characteristics of the fruits from trees on Citrus macrophylla with fruits under shade being smaller than fruits from trees under full sunlight. Leaf water potential (Psi(w)) was greater in trees under shade screen. Leaf mineral concentration was affected by shading that decreased B and Cu on either rootstock.","[Gimeno, Vicente; Martinez, Vicente; Garcia-Sanchez, Francisco] CEBAS, Dept Nutr Vegetal, Murcia, Spain; [Simon, Inma; Lidon, Vicente] EPSO, Alicante, Spain; [Shahid, Muhammad A.] Univ Sargodha, Dept Hort, Sargodha, Pakistan",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Edafologia y Biologia Aplicada del Segura (CEBAS); University of Sargodha,"Garcia-Sanchez, F (通讯作者)，CEBAS, Dept Nutr Vegetal, Murcia, Spain.",fgs@cebas.csic.es,"Lidon, Vicente/L-1269-2014; Garcia-Sanchez, Francisco/C-5966-2009; martinez, vicente/C-5731-2011; Gimeno, Vicente/AAC-4036-2020","Garcia-Sanchez, Francisco/0000-0002-5884-4818; Gimeno, Vicente/0000-0001-6658-8140; Simon Vilella, Inmaculada/0000-0002-0679-7554",,,,,21,5,5,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1845,1852,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600236,0

Raf.) rootstock. Trees were flooded for 30 days with 10 cm water above the soil surface using a 60 cm high aluminum barrier which was buried to depth a 45 cm around the trees. Flooding began at flower anthesis and lasted until early fruit set. Flooding reduced the soil oxygen levels from 5 to 2 mu g O-2 cm(-2) min(-1). Relative fruit drop rate was higher in flooded trees than in non-flooded trees and the spring flush shoot numbers was reduced by flooding but not shoot length. Shoot water potential was reduced but leaf chlorophyll was not affected in leaves. Flooding immediately reduced net CO2 assimilation rate (ACO(2)), stomatal conductance and reduced quantum yield efficiency of the PSII after 3 weeks. There were only small changes in internal CO2 concentration in leaves and no changes in maximum quantum efficiency (F-v/F-m) or basal chlorophyll florescence (F-o). This suggested that non-stomatal factors were more important than stomatal factors in limiting ACO(2). Root function was reduced and an accumulation leaf starch was related to early fruit drop.

Using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and about 17,000 respondents from 11 countries, we find that height is positively and significantly associated with cognitive functioning in later life despite controlling for a myriad of possible confounding factors. A 10 cm increase in height is associated with a 0.04 standard deviation increase in a summary cognitive score (mean 0.02, std. dev. 0.77). We find that being born in a country where the infant mortality rate at the time of birth is high has a negative and significant influence on cognitive functioning in later life. A 10% increase in the infant mortality rate is associated with a 0.1 standard deviation decrease in the summary cognitive score. We also find some evidence that height serves as a protective factor against age related deterioration in cognitive functioning. For persons of average stature, age related decreases in cognition scores are 3-5 percentage points smaller if they move up a quartile in the height distribution. Our results also suggest that there is a significant positive association between height and cognitive abilities across countries for this pre-1950 birth cohort of respondents, with correlations ranging from 0.4 to 0.8.

We present a theoretical valuation framework that consistently accounts for the impact of fluctuations over time, forecast errors, and the location of generators in the power grid on the marginal value of electricity from renewables. Then the optimal share of wind and solar power in Northwestern Europe's generation mix is estimated from a calibrated numerical model. We find the optimal long-term wind share to be 20%, three times more than today; however, we also find significant parameter uncertainty. Variability significantly impacts results: if winds were constant, the optimal share would be. 60%. In addition, the effect of technological change, price shocks, and policies on the optimal share is assessed. We present and explain several surprising findings, including a negative impact of CO2 prices on optimal wind deployment.","[Hirth, Lion] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Hirth, Lion] Vattenfall GmbH, D-10115 Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Hirth, L (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Chausseestr 23, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",lion.hirth@vattenfall.com,,"Hirth, Lion/0000-0002-5563-3310",,,,,115,76,79,1,29,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JAN,2015,36.0,1,,,,,149,184,,10.5547/01956574.36.1.6,0.0,,,36,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,AW9BG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346552100006,0

In this study, the food safety management activities of 118 primary producers located in the EU and non-EU countries is explored. Data was collected using a diagnostic instrument to assess the status of food safety management activities (low, basic, average, advanced), their output (poor, moderate, good), and the riskiness of the context factors (low, moderate, high). Results demonstrated that stringent private standards and a supportive supply chain led to more advanced food safety activities in export oriented companies. However, companies in the local market still struggle with implementing even basic activities. Furthermore, many SMEs in both industrialised and developing countries face challenges with tailoring food safety requirements to their specific organisation.","[Kirezieva, K.; Luning, P.

To attract investments in the economy of the country is very important. Rise in the standard of living of the population, the increase in the scale of the real sector and other effects of investments in the region result in improving regional infrastructure, which, in turn, improves the investment attractiveness of the region. The paper will present the results of empirical research of described regularities. So purpose of this article is research of correlation between the investment attractiveness of Russian regions and the dynamics of development of the real sector in these regions. Methods. To evaluate the performance results of enterprises of the real sector of Russia the method used by the author earlier for the study of the economy of Northwestern Federal District has been adapted. Integral values for each activity of the into are calculated. According to the results of calculations the regions are divided into 6 groups. And then this results compared with the numerical values of the investment potential and investment risk of regions. Results. The data only partially evidence on the direct dependence of the successful work of the real sector on the level of investment attractiveness of the region in the years preceding the period in question. Consideration of backflow, i.e. influence of successful work of the real sector on the increase of the investment attractiveness of the region, gave results similar to the previous case. Conclusions. It can be said that the hypotheses advanced in the beginning of the article have been confirmed, although not in full. Most regions that had unfavorable investment climate at the beginning of the years 2000 showed low integral indices of the real sector performance in subsequent years. The conclusion is clear the absence of attractive environment for investors, deprives the real sector of opportunity to obtain funds for the development and, accordingly, there is no development. Without the development of the real sector the region has neither the funds nor the incentives to improve their investment climate.","[Kolchinskaya, E.] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Kolchinskaya, E (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,3,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,493,499,,,,,,7,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400062,0

It appears as a specific factor which causes that financial instruments' prices are highly changeable which causes problems with accuracy of their forecasts. When the market is dynamically developing, regulation of its volatility forecasts and magnification of their accuracy have particular significance, even though calculating it is complex and its values are hard to be interchangeably determined. That is the reason why model-based forecasts and especially their accuracy should be constantly modified and improved to as precisely as possible. The aim of this paper is extended analysis of the implied volatility VIX index volatility forecasts quality by examining various errors of forecasts based on the GARCH class model which allows to decide whether model-based forecasts are sufficiently accurate. These forecasts are next compared with realised VVIX index quotes from the appropriate period of time. The VVIX is established as an estimator of volatility of VIX, because financial market and model-free implied volatility appear to be the most accurate representation of this unobservable variable. It is not only the problem with volatility itself. By estimating the appropriate volatility estimator for VIX index, the result is an unobservable variable of unobservable basic instrument - implied volatility index. The chosen periods consider both calm and fluctuating periods, market tendencies (analysis of quasi-stable ups or downs) and their interdependencies.","[Leczycka, Katarzyna] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Financial Investments & Risk Management Dept, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Leczycka, K (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Financial Investments & Risk Management Dept, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",katarzyna.leczycka@ue.wroc.pl,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-05-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,136,144,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE9WH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378308600014,0

This has necessitated the evaluation of novel reduced-risk compounds. This study evaluated the effects of spinosad, fipronil, malathion and chlorpyrifos mixed with fruit fly protein bait (Mauri Pinnacle protein (R)) on attraction, feeding and mortality of the Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt). The effects of outdoor weathering of these mixtures on fly mortality were also determined. In field-cage experiment, proteinstarved flies showed the same level of attraction to baits containing spinosad, fipronil, malathion, chlorpyrifos and protein alone used as control. Female proteinstarved flies were deterred from feeding on baits containing malathion and chlorpyrifos compared to baits containing spinosad, fipronil and protein alone. Baits containing malathion and chlorpyrifos caused higher fly mortality and rapid fly knock down than spinosad and fipronil. However, spinosad acted slowly and caused an increase in fly mortality over time, causing up to 90% fly mortality after 72-h. Baits containing malathion and chlorpyrifos, applied on citrus leaves and weathered outdoors, had longer residual effectiveness in killing flies than spinosad and fipronil. Residual effectiveness of the spinosad bait mixture waned significantly after 3 days of outdoor weathering. Results suggest that spinosad and fipronil can be potential alternatives for malathion in protein bait sprays.","[Mahat, Kiran] Natl Plant Protect Ctr, Dept Agr, Thimphu, Bhutan; [Drew, Richard A.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between job characteristics and employee well-being and their utility function in German horticulture. An investigation was conducted with a paper-and-pencil and web-based questionnaire, using a modified Kunin-scale. Responses from 145 employees from different businesses were analysed. This study supports the assertion of Warr's vitamin model that non-linear relationships exist between job characteristics and employee well-being. A linear regression of job satisfaction on 28 job features attained a remarkable R-2 of .627. The highest correlations were found with items measuring good future prospects, an organization's morality in society, significance to self, work-home conflict and the availability of adequate equipment. This identifies the potential to increase employee well-being and social sustainability, and demonstrates that the indicator of employee subjective well-being is a valuable indicator for measuring social sustainability. Most notably, non-linear evaluations of job features are superior to the assumption of linearity.","[Meyerding, S.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Meyerding, S (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany.",,,"Meyerding, Stephan/0000-0001-9540-3205",,,,,15,1,1,1,11,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-91-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1103.0,,,,,,211,217,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1103.31,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BF0DT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378599800031,0

Information on postharvest losses was obtained through a socioeconomic field survey of various actors in vegetable supply chains with the aid of a semi-structured questionnaire complemented by physical measurement of produce samples for damage, disease incidence and severity. An analysis of marketing systems highlighted the influence of key market traders and brokers on handling practices-particularly in the preparation of produce for and during transportation - and in setting prices for vegetable crops. Variation in the size and style of packaging was due to efforts to minimize costs, but this affects the level and type of damage observed in the marketing chain. Information on produce quality along the vegetable value chain was obtained and the attitudes of the various actors toward produce quality assessed. While it is generally understood that losses do occur during harvesting, handling and marketing, the extent of these problems is only now being realized. The information obtained from the quantitative survey will provide a useful guide in the development of an adaptive research program to improve the quality of vegetables produced by smallholder farmers and reduce the losses they currently experience.","[Nenguwo, N.; Afari-Sefa, V.] World Vegetable Ctr, Arusha, Tanzania; [Hughes, J. d'A.] World Vegetable Ctr, Shanhua Dist, Taiwan",,"Nenguwo, N (通讯作者)，World Vegetable Ctr, Arusha, Tanzania.",,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,3,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-91-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1103.0,,,,,,219,224,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.110.3.32,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BF0DT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378599800032,0

The fraudsters could originate from both internal (employees) and external sources (customers, supplier, contractor, and lawyer). As banking institutions engage in a wide range of activities, fraud could potentially affect many parties, including the shareholders, the depositors, the borrowers, the staff as well as the banking institution itself. A study was conducted among management levels in banking institutions in Malaysia, with a focus on branch managers and assistant managers that handle the mortgage loan and hire purchase loan, to examine the types and extent of fraud occurrences in the portfolio of mortgage loans and hire purchase loans. Results show that in general, the most common fraud cases in branches that handled mortgage was money laundering, whereas for branches that handle hire purchase loan which were a common fraud occurrence in the banking sector of Malaysia. This paper will also showcase various attempted frauds and fraud cases for both internal and external fraud scheme in the banking institutions.

A structured questionnaire was used and 97 private hospitals registered with the Association of Private Hospitals Malaysia were included in the survey. In total, 39 responses were received which resulted in an overall usable response rate of 40.2%. The descriptive results illustrated that the majority of the private hospitals that adopt the Balanced Scorecard are highly centralized and formalized. These private hospitals subscribed to formalized rules and written formal procedures to ensure the management and governance of the health providers act in accord with espoused values. As such, there is a legitimate link to improved performances within this sector on the key aspects: internal business processes, patient quality services, safety and satisfaction, organizational learning and growth, and financial. Thus far, despite the evidence from this study that can be attributed to becoming responsible healthcare providers, drivers used which incorporate responsibility, integrity, accountability and transparency in assessing performances can be taken up.

Extant research has captured how the formal knowledge base of professionals establish and maintain the credibility and elite status of professionals. However, assessing professional competence is often difficult due to the knowledge asymmetry between clients and professionals and individual formal knowledge and firm reputation are commonly used as proxies. At the same time, there is surprisingly little empirical research that focuses directly on how knowledge resources are assessed from a client's point of view. To address this disparity we ask: How is knowledge valuated and valued by clients of professional service firms? Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on an in depth qualitative research design suitable for inductive theory building. By building on observations from meetings in four in-depth case studies and interviews with 80 buyers and sellers of professional services, this paper describes how knowledge is assessed by clients. In particular, we compare and analyse this extensive qualitative data to single out important dimension of how clients assess professional competence. Originality/value - Value creation in PSFs has to an increasing degree been recognized as co-produced with clients and customized to their needs. Correspondingly, an interest in client-centric valuations have emerged. In spite of this, relatively limited research has been done to understand the client and competitive advantage from a client perspective in relation to professional competence. This paper offers such a client-centric perspective. By extending theory on professional service firms' knowledge assets it provides a conceptual framework detailing important dimensions emphasised by clients when assessing professional knowledge. Practical implications - The paper offers a framework that details the interrelationships between knowledge, experience and references as assessed by the clients. This framework has implications for the practice of PSFs and buyers of professional services as it details the way in which clients evaluate and value knowledge. Contrary to extant research that emphasize organizational reputation and individual formal education as key indicators of professional knowledge, our study reveals that these are perceived as mere hygiene factors by clients. The study also shows how the clients assess knowledge assets based on multiple levels and factors.","[Skjolsvik, Tale] Oslo & Akershus Univ Coll, Fac Technol Arts & Design, N-0130 Oslo, Norway; [Breunig, Karl Joachim] Oslo & Akershus Univ Coll, Sch Business, N-0130 Oslo, Norway",Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet); Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),"Skjolsvik, T (通讯作者)，Oslo & Akershus Univ Coll, Fac Technol Arts & Design, PB 4 St Olavs Pl, N-0130 Oslo, Norway.",,"Breunig, Karl Joachim/P-5003-2019","Breunig, Karl Joachim/0000-0001-5955-3943",,,,,30,0,0,0,5,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,514,525,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200040,0

This literature stream, called strategic patent management, has never been subject to a systematic review. Thus, in order to do so, we adopted two bibliometric techniques that allow us to identify its structure, highlighting in particular research subfields that received more attention from scholars and the ones that could benefit from a deeper investigation. Design/methodology/approach - After selecting main papers focused on strategic patent management, we tested whether these articles form a coherent body of literature analysing the patterns of citations among them. Then, based on the similarity of bibliographic coupling profile, papers were grouped into homogeneous factors, that we labelled patent value, competitive and technological landscape and strategic decision. Finally, each factor has been described and discussed. Originality/value - Re-organizing and systematizing the different contributions on the topic of strategic patent management, we contribute to reduce the risk of further developing a quite fragmented literature. In addition, bibliometric techniques, thanks to their quantifiability and objectivity, allow to avoid potential subjective biases Practical implications - Revising patent management practices, methods and strategies can provide useful insights to practitioners that can apply them in order to improve firm competitive advantage.","[Soranzo, Benedetta; Nosella, Anna] Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy",University of Padua,"Soranzo, B (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, Stradella San Nicola 3, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy.",,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,17,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1024,1036,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200078,0

The findings are there are papers that in the last 4 years there are numerous papers discussing each variable that are affecting performance measurement implementation such as leadership involvement and organization culture. There are also independent variables affecting firm performance with the absence or no indication of a performance management system such as knowledge management, human resource management. The paper concluded that the most discovered variables are management information system, PMS frameworks, organizational and leadership. Limitations of this study are that the study is based on accessible journals by the writer and each study has their own limitations respectively such as the amount of unit analysis which will further limit generalization.

Prices provide a vague measurement because the source of information varies. Furthermore, price margins vary along the chain and investment decisions in off-farm inputs are not made on the basis of margins. Nor does the reporting approach provide a road map for interventions to improve the efficiency of the chain. The reform approach used in Balochistan, Pakistan, has evolved through working on value chains for different agricultural products in countries in the Pacific and Asia. It uses a simple three-stage chain of production, marketing, and the bit in the middle that links the two with the clear intention of increasing returns to growers. Over twenty elements have been identified in the three stages that are applicable to a host of rural products in the horticultural, agricultural and livestock sub-sectors. The principle elements in each of the three stages are outlined along with their associated generic interventions to improve performance. A case study of the Balochistan grape industry is used to illustrate the usefulness of the reform approach. The approach has resulted in improved returns to growers of around 30%.","[Vinning, G.

The estimated VAR model can then be used to define not only effects of acquisitions on performance, but also effects of firm's performance on new acquisitions, effects between marketing and word of mouth acquisitions or their behaviour in time, which can serve as valuable insights for managers.

Accordingly, this essay reviews Tullock's scholarship in such fields as public choice, law and economics, rent seeking, bureaucracy, social conflict, and non-human societies. Tullock is often cast as exemplifying a reductionist style of homo economicus reasoning. This is a severe misreading of Tullock, a caricature of Tullock. To the contrary, Tullock was a social theorist who thought in terms of interaction among heterogeneous agents who in no way reduced those agents to some representative agent. Tullock's primary orientation was to theorize from inside his phenomena, in contrast to most social theorists who seek to theorize from some position outside their phenomena. Tullock was also a warm and sensitive man who was filled with a zest for whimsy, which is a quality that often accompanies highly creative people, though he sometimes had trouble directing that whimsy as he might have hoped.","George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Wagner, RE (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, 3G4, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",rwagner@gmu.edu,,,,,,,23,2,2,0,4,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

We introduce a random walk hierarchy prior for each regime-specific mean growth rate and impose a cointegrating relationship between the mean growth rates in recessionary and expansionary periods. By applying the proposed model to postwar U.S. real GDP growth (1947:Q4-2011:Q3), we uncover the evolving nature of the regime-specific mean growth rates of real output in the U.S. business cycle. Additional features of the postwar U.S. business cycle that we uncover include a steady decline in the long-run mean growth rate of real output over the postwar sample and an asymmetric error-correction mechanism when the economy deviates from its long-run equilibrium.","[Eo, Yunjong] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Kim, Chang-Jin] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Sydney; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Eo, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",,"Kim, Chang-Jin/AAN-4657-2020; Eo, Yunjong/J-4319-2012","Eo, Yunjong/0000-0002-9172-2265",University of Sydney; Bryan C.

In this paper we consider the relation between the number of doctor consultations and the frequency of patient physical activity. We use a novel application of the Dose-Response Function model proposed by Hirano and Imbens (2004) to deal with treatment endogeneity under the no unmeasured confounding assumption. Our application takes account of unobserved heterogeneity and uses dynamic non-linear models for the treatment and outcome variables of interest. Using seven waves of the British Household Panel Survey, we find that higher treatment intensity and frequency of physical activity are inversely related. We show that accounting for both treatment selection and unobserved heterogeneity halves the size of this relationship. An additional doctor consultation is associated with a 0.5 percentage point reduction in the probability of undertaking vigorous physical activity. Our results hold for a sub-sample visiting the doctor for health check-ups, and are shown to be robust using instrumental variables. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

It is tested on data for 83 countries using system GMM, the results showing freedom reduces inequality across countries. If the freedom level in a country 5 years ago were 1 % higher than another, its income inequality would be 1.33 % lower than the other. The results reveal a nonlinear inverted U-shaped relationship between freedom and inequality. The total effect evolves slowly over a long period of almost 25 years after democratisation takes place. A robust finding is that freedom reduces inequality only in democracies, not in others. Economic development, culture, and institutions cause inter-country income differences. Primary education lowers inequality, and secondary education has little effect.","[Islam, Muhammed N.] Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, 1455 Maisonneuve Blvd West, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada",Concordia University - Canada,"Islam, MN (通讯作者)，Concordia Univ, Dept Econ, 1455 Maisonneuve Blvd West, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.",nurul.islam@concordia.ca,"Islam, Muhammed Nazmul/ABA-4228-2020","Islam, Muhammed Nazmul/0000-0001-9831-6086",,,,,25,11,11,0,23,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This article illustrates how the social and moral texture of the social relationships between branch workers and their managers deteriorated after the implementation of PMS, resulting in the rise of hostile forms of engagement.","[Laaser, Knut] Univ Stirling, Sch Management, Stirling, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Laaser, K (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",knut.laaser@stir.ac.uk,,"Laaser, Knut/0000-0002-3230-3423",,,,,39,26,27,1,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

J,"Le Vine, S; Polak, J",,,,"Le Vine, Scott; Polak, John",,,A novel peer-to-peer congestion pricing marketplace enabled by vehicle-automation,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Peer-to-peer; Congestion pricing; Automated vehicle,TRANSPORTATION; URBAN; TIME; MANAGEMENT; NETWORKS; SYSTEM,"This paper proposes a novel concept of congestion pricing based on voluntary peer-to-peer exchange of money between motorists in exchange for one ceding priority to another in a traffic stream. While in the classical congestion charging paradigm payments are compulsory and flow only towards the system operator, in the proposed marketplace participation is voluntary and motorists directly compensate each other. A particular motorist may find that he/she is a 'payer' at certain points in a given journey and a 'payee' at others. Humans would not be expected to successfully seek, negotiate and execute a continuous series of peer-to-peer trades involving micro-payments while also handling the cognitively-demanding task of driving; real-world implementation will therefore require vehicles operating under fully-automated control in both the longitudinal and lateral dimensions during the time periods that they seek and engage in trades. The automated vehicle control algorithms must be sufficiently intelligent and adaptable to enable alternative maneuvers on short timescales, given the inherent uncertainty of whether or not a potential trade will in fact be executed. The peer-to-peer trading would be executed algorithmically, subject to strategic-level guidance given by a vehicle's occupant(s) regarding the occupant's relative valuation of money and priority in the traffic stream. In this paper we detail the prospective marketplace and present a simple simulation model to expose its properties. We show that the proposed peer-to-peer marketplace could lead to both desirable and undesirable outcomes; which of these would be predominant is a matter requiring empirical study. The paper concludes with a discussion of further research needs to refine and develop these concepts into practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, existing empirical evidence ignores that (i) both effects are likely to occur simultaneously (necessitating a joint estimation approach), and (ii) capital mobility might play a critical moderating role for the strength of both effects. Using a panel data set comprising 24 OECD countries over the period 1982-2007, we address both these deficiencies. This clearly illustrates the simultaneous existence of tax incidence and fiscal compensation effects. Moreover, capital mobility (and the ensuing relative bargaining power of economic agents) has a significant influence on both the prevalence and strength of these effects.","[Exbrayat, Nelly] Univ Lyon, GATE Lyon St Etienne, St Etienne, France; [Geys, Benny] Norwegian Business Sch BI, Oslo, Norway; [Geys, Benny] VUB, Brussels, Belgium",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; BI Norwegian Business School; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Exbrayat, N (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, GATE Lyon St Etienne, St Etienne, France.",,,"Exbrayat, Nelly/0000-0002-0566-504X; Geys, Benny/0000-0003-4524-1820",,,,,39,5,6,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2016,39.0,11,,,,,1792,1811,,10.1111/twec.12323,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,EB7FW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387552900005,0

The second version is built using year-on-year inflation of 30 OECD countries (excluding Chile). We show sound in-sample and pseudo out-of-sample evidence indicating that these international factors do help forecast Chilean inflation at several horizons by reducing the root-mean squared prediction error of our benchmarks models. Our results are robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. Several transmission channels from international to domestic inflation are also discussed.

Moreover, automotive and electrical innovations (quintessential general-purpose technologies) had a greater positive impact on employment than those in mechanical innovations. The overall results, compatible with the predictions of the real business cycle model, raise questions about the anemic recovery in employment after 1934 since the strong upsurge in technical change failed to be accompanied by vigorous job expansion.","[Alexopoulos, Michelle; Cohen, Jon] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Alexopoulos, M (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,,,,,,48,14,17,0,33,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Additionally we also examine the values of individuals when their choices also impact on the salary and commute of their partner, finding that incomes, income differentials, driving behaviour when carpooling, division of housework and car user decisions significantly explain the values assigned to others and variations in an individual's own values once their partner is affected.

It then empirically derives the combination of activation thresholds, experience rating, eligibility criteria and benefit generosity which define the systems offering the highest stabilization for given levels of redistribution. The analysis suggests that the shock absorber should: (1) give rise to macro cross-national transfers, mimicking those that would be generated by a notional euro-wide unemployment benefit scheme of minimal coverage and generosity, (2) be activated by a trigger and (3) feature partial experience rating. The simulation results, confirmed by robustness checks, show that even systems that do not redistribute resources between countries can have a non-negligible stabilization impact in the medium run. Low benefit take-up rates in southern Europe reduce the stabilization properties and the size of the scheme.","[Brandolini, Andrea; Carta, Francesca; D'Amuri, Francesco] Bank Italy, Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"D'Amuri, F (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, DG Econ Stat & Res, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",francesco.damuri@bancaditalia.it,"Brandolini, Andrea/G-9772-2016","Brandolini, Andrea/0000-0002-2853-8721",,,,,45,6,6,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We explore the pairwise cointegration between Asian local currency bond returns indices using stepwise multiple testing. This helps to identify which pairs of bond indices are cointegrated, while avoiding over-rejection of the null hypothesis or the multiplicity problem. This method is adjusted to deal with possible cross-sectional correlation among the countries. In addition, we assume linear as well as nonlinear models in order to capture potential gradual and asymptotic adjustment of a linear combination of bond indices toward its mean. We find long-term stable relationships among local currency bond returns for some pairs of countries. Specifically, close interlinkages captured as nonlinear cointegration are evident for at least four pairs of countries, namely Indonesia and the Philippines, Malaysia and the Philippines, the Philippines and Thailand, and Singapore and Thailand.

In accordance with the panel data analysis of the quantile regression that is calculated with the Bootstrap Method, more consistent results were obtained. The results indicate that international agreements, such as the trading partnership between the European Union and Turkey and the Black Sea Economic Cooperation agreement, have been observed as important determinants of citrus exports. Transportation costs, proxied by distance, are observed to have a negative influence on citrus exports. In addition, an increase in the real exchange rate in Turkey is estimated to benefit countries that produce cheaper citrus.","[Ozer, Osman Orkan] Adnan Menderes Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Aydin, Turkey; [Koksal, Ozdal] Ankara Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Ankara, Turkey",Adnan Menderes University; Ankara University,"Özer, OO (通讯作者)，Adnan Menderes Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Aydin, Turkey.",osman.ozer@adu.edu.tr,"Köksal, Özdal/AAG-9271-2020; Ozer, Osman Orkan/B-7915-2018; Köksal, Özdal/AAM-6268-2020","Ozer, Osman Orkan/0000-0003-0926-008X; Köksal, Özdal/0000-0001-9909-3005",,,,,45,5,6,1,18,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2016,15.0,3,,,,,37,42,,,,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EF2VS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390184300005,0

This article examines how vegetable prices in the Tokyo Metropolitan Central Wholesale Market were affected in the wake of the nuclear accident. This study exploits the quasi-experimental condition generated by this accident to test market price changes using monthly panel data on the price of six types of fresh vegetables from each of the 47 prefectures in Japan. Our estimation results show that the prices of vegetables grown in Fukushima Prefecture decreased by 10-36% after the disaster compared with the counter-factual estimates in the absence of a perceived radiation risk. This effect has persisted even after radioactive detection tests showed negative results in subsequent years. The consumer behavior of avoiding vegetables from Fukushima and instead buying vegetables grown in other areas may explain the price gap. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Airports across the globe experience both taxi shortages and excesses due to various factors such as the airport's proximity to the city center, timing and frequency of flights, and the fare structure. Since taxi drivers are independent entities whose decisions affect the taxi supply at airports, it is important to understand taxi drivers' decision mechanisms in order to suggest policies and to maintain taxi demand and supply equilibrium at the airports. In this paper, New York City (NYC) taxi drivers' decisions about airport pick-ups or cruising for customers at the end of each trip is modeled using logistic regression based on a large taxi GPS dataset The presented approach helps to quantify the potential impacts of parameters and to rank their influence for policy recommendations. The results reveal that spatial variables (mainly related to proximity) have the highest impact on taxi drivers' airport pickup decisions, followed by temporal, environmental and driver-shift related variables. Along with supplementary information from unstructured taxi driver interviews, the model results are used to suggest policies for the improvement of John F. Kennedy (JFK) airport's ground access and passenger satisfaction, i.e. the implementation of taxi driver frequent airport server punch cards and a time-specific ride share program.

We develop a model in which a minor league team serves two functions: talent development and local entertainment. The model predicts different modes of organizing the relationship between majors and minors based on the value of these parameters. We then develop a discursive history. Consistent with the model's predictions, we find that when the value of minor league baseball's training function was low but the value of its entertainment function was high, major and minor league franchises operated independently, engaging in arms'-length transactions. However, as the training function became more important and the local entertainment function less important, formal agreements ceded control of minor league functions to major league franchises. Finally, as the value of local entertainment rose once again in the late 20th century, the two roles were split, with control of local functions accruing to local ownership and training functions to major league teams. This analysis helps shed light on factors that influence the boundaries of the firm.","[Hanssen, F.

This gives new possibilities to speedup statistical and numerical simulations, but it also introduce many challenges we need to deal with. In order to improve the performance metrics, we need to consider different key points as: core communications, data locality, dependencies, memory size, etc. This paper describes a series of optimization steps done on the SYMBOL model meant to enhance its performance and scalability. SYMBOL is a micro-funded statistical tool which analyses the consequences of bank failures, taking into account the available safety nets, such as deposit guarantee schemes or resolution funds. However, this tool, in its original version, has some computational weakness, because its execution time grows considerably, when we request to run with large input data (e.g. large banking systems) or if we wish to scale up the value of the stopping criterium, i.e. the number of default scenarios to be considered. Our intention is to develop a tool (extendable to other model having similar characteristics) where a set of serial (e.g. deleting redundancies, loop enrolling, etc.) and parallel strategies (e.g. OpenMP, and GPU programming) come together to obtain shorter execution time and scalability. The tool uses automatic configuration to make the best use of available resources on the basis of the characteristics of the input datasets. Experimental results, done varying the size of the input dataset and the stopping criterium, show a considerable improvement one can obtain by using the new tool, with execution time reduction up to 96 % of with respect to the original serial version.","[Muresano, Ronal; Pagano, Andrea] Commiss European Communities, IPSC, JRC, Financial & Econ Anal Unit, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Muresano, R (通讯作者)，Commiss European Communities, IPSC, JRC, Financial & Econ Anal Unit, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy.",ronal.muresano@jrc.ec.europa.eu; andrea.pagano@jrc.europa.ec.eu,"Muresano, Ronal/GLU-0420-2022","Muresano Caceres, Ronal Roberto/0000-0002-3636-0871",,,,,20,3,3,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Unlike previous literature that typically focuses on the ability of FSIs to foresee banking crises, we estimate ordered response models to assess the power of these indicators to explain sovereign risk. Our results show that evaluations made by the rating agencies are related to the lagged values of core FSIs such that an improvement in these indicators leads to improvements in upcoming sovereign ratings. Hence, reinforced banking soundness would reduce the sovereign risk. Accordingly, governments, supervisors and central banks should pay close attention to the evolution of certain FSIs related to the banking sector, in addition to other variables that have traditionally been taken into account in analysing sovereign risk.","[Parrado-Martinez, Purificacion; Partal-Urena, Antonio; Gomez Fernandez-Aguado, Pilar] Univ Jaen, Financial Econ & Accounting, Jaen, Spain",Universidad de Jaen,"Parrado-Martínez, P (通讯作者)，Univ Jaen, Financial Econ & Accounting, Jaen, Spain.",,"Gómez-Fdez.-Aguado, Pilar P./AAJ-1362-2021; Parrado Martinez, Purificacion/G-1541-2017","Gómez-Fdez.-Aguado, Pilar P./0000-0002-4327-4197; Parrado Martinez, Purificacion/0000-0001-9309-2706",,,,,67,1,1,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2016,39.0,8,,,,,1172,1193,,10.1111/twec.12357,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DS7BY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380938700006,0

The results reveal that tourism growth did not automatically create the expected positive impacts on the economic performance of the other sectors, as was expressed by the objectives defined in the regional development strategies over the last two decades. The positive impacts of tourism were concentrated in the production of non-tradable goods and the construction sector, leading to a significant reduction of the weight of the tradable sector within the regional economy, similar to a process of deindustrialization described as the Dutch disease'. The decline of construction activities after 2007 has led to a significant increase of regional unemployment, although tourism growth has returned to pre-crisis' levels, revealing the lack of regional resilience.","[Romao, Joao] Univ Algarve, CEFAGE UAlg, Faro, Portugal; [Guerreiro, Joao] Univ Algarve, CIEO, Faro, Portugal; [Rodrigues, Paulo M.

Based on a sample of 340 debt announcements made by REITs in Japan (J-REITs) between 2002 and 2011, we observe that they are associated with a positive stock price reaction, averaging 1.05 % over a 4-day window. Stratifying the sample into debt raising and debt refinancing, we find strong evidence that the positive economic gains associated with debt announcements flowed from the pool of debt refinancing announcements. They registered a significant mean return of 1.20 % over the 4-day window, as opposed to 0.07 % for the pool of debt raising activities. Further investigation shows that the positive market reaction to debt refinancing is more pronounced during the credit crunch of 2007 to 2009.

Together, these outcome variables capture the overall health of the labour market and the aggregate welfare of workers. Yet, to our knowledge, there seems to be no other comprehensive empirical investigation in the existing literature of the impact of structural reforms at the cross-country macro-level on labour-market outcomes other than the unemployment rate. After documenting the average trends across countries in the labour-market outcomes up to 10years on either side of each country's structural reform year, we run fixed-effects ordinary least squares and instrumental variables regressions to account for the likely endogeneity of structural reforms to labour-market outcomes. Overall, the results suggest that structural reforms lead to positive outcomes for labour. Redistributive effects in favour of workers, along the lines of the Stolper-Samuelson effect, may be at work.","[Hollweg, Claire H.] World Bank, Trade & Competitiveness Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Lederman, Daniel] World Bank, Latin Amer & Caribbean, Off Chief Economist, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Mitra, Devashish] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Maxwell Sch Citizenship & Publ Affairs, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",The World Bank; The World Bank; Syracuse University,"Hollweg, CH (通讯作者)，World Bank, Trade & Competitiveness Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,,,,,52,5,5,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2016,39.0,7,,,,,925,963,,10.1111/twec.12279,0.0,,,39,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DR5OU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379953100002,0

Growth in DAR ridership is reported across the United States and this tendency will likely continue due to aging population. Such trends encourage development of models that can provide decision support in planning new DAR systems or expanding existing ones. Several statistical models were previously developed to predict the required DAR system capacity, given various characteristics of the service region, level-of-service requirements and operator constraints. Our work contributes to this line of research by proposing statistical and machine learning approaches that provide more accurate predictions over a wider range of scenarios. This is accomplished through transformation of variables and application of generalized linear model and support vector regression. Proposed models are built into an online tool that can help transit planners and policy makers: (a) estimate the capacity and operating cost of a DAR system needed to provide the desired level of service, (b) explore tradeoffs between system costs and levels of service, and (c) compare the cost of providing DAR service with other transportation alternatives (e.g., taxi, conventional transit).

In fact, long-term vacancy is more strongly correlated with indicators of housing market distress than standard measures of vacancy. At the national level, long-term vacancy is relatively uncommon. However, the stock of long-term vacant housing is concentrated in a small number of neighborhoods with high long-term vacancy rates.

This relationship is interpreted as the continued influence of source country gender role attitudes on women's labour market behaviour. This article argues that the effect of source country female labour force participation rates extends beyond gender role attitudes by also contributing to labour market skills which help immigrant women navigate the host country labour market. When gender role attitudes are accounted for, source country female labour force participation rate is a strong predictor of immigrant women's earnings in Canada.

The identification and inference of these models, however, highly depend on the availability of rich longitudinal data. To overcome the common problem of data scarcity, this paper proposes to combine datasets that each identify some part of the likelihood, thereby recovering the identification of the complete model. The performance of the approach is demonstrated by a Monte Carlo experiment. We apply this technique empirically to study the impact of locus of control on education and wages. Our strategy allows us to elicit the distribution of pre-market locus of control from a sample of young individuals, and to measure its impact on education and wages in a sample of adults. Our findings indicate that the effect of locus of control on wages mainly operates through education.

The authors also find a significant number of inner cities are competitive over this periodincreasing their share of metropolitan employment in 144 out of 281 metropolitan statistical areas. Also described is the pattern of job growth within the inner city. The authors find that tracts that grew faster tended to be closer to downtown, with access to transit and adjacent to areas with higher population growth.

We consider intrauterine exposure to the month of Ramadan as a natural experiment that might cause shocks to the inflow of nutrients essential for fetal development. Specifically, we use administrative data from Denmark to investigate the impact of exposure to Ramadan in utero on labor market outcomes of adult Muslim males, including employment status, annual salary, hourly wage rate, and hours of work. Our findings indicate that potential exposure to nutritional disruptions during a critical stage of fetal development is likely to have scarring effects on the fetus expressed as poor labor market outcomes later in life. Specifically, exposure to Ramadan around the 7th month of gestation results in a lower likelihood of employment and, to a lesser extent, a lower salary, and reduced labor supply. For example, the 7th month intrauterine exposure to Ramadan is associated with a 2.6 percentage points reduction in the likelihood of employment among Muslim males. We do not find an impact on the wage rate.

By controlling for distressed market conditions (vacant, foreclosure, and short-sale transactions) and spillover pricing effects, we find significant but heterogeneous values for proximity to five types of open space amenities. Furthermore, proximity values for parks and golf courses are found to drop by more than 20 % in the bust period relative to the boom period. Results show that failing to capture distressed market conditions and market phases, when the housing market is out of equilibrium, leads to biased results. In addition, our findings suggest that ignoring spatial dependence and spillover pricing effects presents a potential bias in estimating open space amenity values. The SDM, which considers spatial dependence and spillovers at a finer scale in the neighborhood, outperforms region fixed effects models when spatial spillovers are significant.","[Fan, Qin] Calif State Univ Fresno, Craig Sch Business, Dept Econ, Fresno, CA 93740 USA; [Hansz, J.

The original study by Zimmer (2012) employs a finite-mixture copula to illustrate that the symmetry of the Gaussian copula may not be tenable, especially for US housing price data during the time period from 1975:Q2 to 2009:Q1. We undertake a replication of his study in a wide sense. First, we replicate the study by incorporating revised data and then extending the dataset to include the most recent data. Second, we implement a nonparametric copula estimator recently proposed by Racine (Mixed data kernel copulas', Empirical Economics forthcoming) to the parametrically filtered data used in Zimmer (2012). Our replication finds that the application of the nonparametric copula to the same and extended filtered data provides an alternative flexible specification for copulas.

Using longitudinal data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe for the years 2004, 2007 and 2011, we estimate a job satisfaction equation which includes a set of explanatory variables measuring worker's obesity and disability status (non-disabled, non-limited disabled, and limited disabled). The results show that, after controlling for other variables, obese workers are more likely to be satisfied with their jobs as compared to those workers with normal weight (0.066 points). In addition, being limited disabled or having poor health contribute to reducing (by 0.082 and 0.172 points, respectively) this positive effect of being obese on job satisfaction. However, we do not find any differential effect of obesity on job satisfaction by disability status, except for those underweight individuals who are not limited in their daily activities. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis of lower expectations about jobs for obese workers, especially if they also have poor health. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We show that during the 2003 U.S.-France dispute over the Iraq War, the market share of French-sounding, U.S. supermarket brands declined. The dispute was a negative shock to U.S. consumers' associations with France. French-sounding brands, which consumers perceive to be French imports but are not, allow us to isolate the dispute's effect on economic behavior, as these brands' only link to France is through consumers' associations. Our estimates, derived from a nationwide sample of weekly supermarket sales for over 8,000 brands, are robust to a variety of alternate explanations. We also show that supermarkets with a higher proportion of customers who are U.S. citizens (i.e., who more strongly identify with the U.S. national identity) exhibited sharper boycotts.","[Pandya, Sonal S.; Venkatesan, Rajkumar] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,"Pandya, SS (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",,,,Behavioral Research at Darden Lab; Bankard Fund for Political Economy,Behavioral Research at Darden Lab; Bankard Fund for Political Economy,"For their feedback and suggestions, we thank the editor, referees, Sean Carr, Christina Davis, Peter Debaere, James Harrigan, David Leblang, Ariell Reshef, Sheetal Sekhri, Robert Urbatsch, Hans-Joachim Voth, Frank Warnock, and seminar participants at Berkeley, the Darden School of Business, and the UVa Quantitative Collaborative.

On the basis of common correlated effects pooled (CCEP) estimator (Pesaran in Econometrica 74:967-1012, 2006), the generalized moments (GM) procedure suggested by Kelejian and Prucha (Int Econ Rev 40:509-533, 1999) is employed to estimate the spatial autoregressive parameters. These estimators are then used to define feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) procedures for the regression parameters. Given N and T (jointly), this study provides formal large sample results on the consistency of the proposed GM procedures, as well as the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed feasible generalized least squares (FGLS). It is proved that FGLS is more efficient than CCEP. The small sample properties of the various estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments, which confirmed the theoretical conclusions. Results demonstrate that the popular spatial correlation analysis used in previous empirical literature may be misleading because it neglects common factors.","[Qian, J.

An econometric approach,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article; Proceedings Paper,Pan-American Conference on Traffic and Transportation Engineering,2014,SPAIN,,,Fare evasion; Transantiago; Unethical behaviour; Count regression models,UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR; CRIME,"Fare evasion is a problem in many public transport systems around the world and policies to reduce it are generally aimed at improving control and increasing fines. We use an econometric approach to attempt explaining the high levels of evasion in Santiago, Chile, and guide public policy formulation to reduce this problem. In particular, a negative binomial count regression model allowed us to find that fare evasion rates on buses increase as: (i) more people board (or alight) at a given bus door, (ii) more passengers board by a rear door, (iii) buses have higher occupancy levels (and more doors) and (iv) passengers experience longer headways. By controlling these variables (ceteris paribus), results indicate that evasion is greater during the afternoon and evening, but it is not clear that it is higher during peak hours. Regarding socioeconomic variables, we found that fare evasion at bus stops located in higher income areas (municipalities) is significantly lower than in more deprived areas. Finally, based on our results we identified five main methods to address evasion as alternatives to more dedicated fine enforcement or increased inspection; (i) increasing the bus fleet, (ii) improving the bus headway regularity, (iii) implementing off -board payment stations, (iv) changing the payment system on board and (v) changing the bus design (number of doors or capacity).

In this study, the Metropolitan Development Index is created to measure development and quality of life in large, urban areas in the United States. The researchers then test the sensitivity of city rankings to the data used in constructing the index. These tests indicate that the index is a substantive conception of development and quality of life. Additionally, the index is positively correlated with both economic prosperity and an individual's desire to reside in areas that offer higher levels of development and quality of life.","[Peach, Nathanael D.] George Fox Univ, Coll Business, Newberg, OR 97312 USA; [Petach, Luke A.] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",George Fox University; Colorado State University,"Peach, ND (通讯作者)，George Fox Univ, 414 N Meridian St,6263, Newberg, OR 97312 USA.",npeach@georgefox.edu,,,Paul K.

However, in developing countries including Indonesia, most farmers perceived that the price of certified seed is too expensive for potato cultivation. Farmers, therefore, often produce and use their own seed which is usually derived from the certified seed. In East Java, some farmers usually act as local seed growers and sell their seed to others in their villages. The complexity of the buying situation faced by East Javanese farmers whenever they are willing to purchase seed prompted this study of the extent to which buyer-supplier relationships influence farmers' decision to purchase seed potato. A total of 209 farmers from the highlands of East Java were interviewed in this study. The data were analyzed using factor analysis and multiple regression analysis. The findings generally suggest that farmer-supplier relationships in the East Java seed potato market were established based on high levels of satisfaction, trust and long-term commitment. A significant positive relationship was observed between supplier's offer quality and farmers' relationship satisfaction. Such would suggest that the high level of farmers' relationship satisfaction was derived from the adequate suppliers' offer quality. However, it was the seed and service quality dimension, rather than delivery and pricing, which significantly improved the farmers' relationship satisfaction. (C) 2016 The Authors.

This signaling problem is the natural design question motivated by uncertainty in games and has attracted much recent attention. We present new hardness results for signaling problems in (a) Bayesian two-player zero-sum games, and (b) Bayesian network routing games. For Bayesian zero-sum games, when the principal seeks to maximize the equilibrium utility of a player, we show that it is NP-hard to obtain an additive FPTAS. Our hardness proof exploits duality and the equivalence of separation and optimization in a novel way. Further, we rule out an additive PTAS assuming planted clique hardness, which states that no polynomial time algorithm can recover a planted clique from an Erdos-Renyi random graph. Complementing these, we obtain a PTAS for a structured class of zero-sum games (where obtaining an FPTAS is still NP-hard) when the payoff matrices obey a Lipschitz condition. Previous results ruled out an FPTAS assuming planted-clique hardness, and a PTAS only for implicit games with quasi-polynomial-size strategy sets. For Bayesian network routing games, wherein the principal seeks to minimize the average latency of the Nash flow, we show that it is NP-hard to obtain a (multiplicative) (4 0-approximation, even for linear latency functions. This is the optimal inapproximability result for linear latencies, since we show that full revelation achieves a 4-approximation for linear latencies.","[Bhaskar, Umang] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Bombay, Maharashtra, India; [Cheng, Yu] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Ko, Young Kun] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Swamy, Chaitanya] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR); University of Southern California; Princeton University; University of Waterloo,"Bhaskar, U (通讯作者)，Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Bombay, Maharashtra, India.",umang@tifr.res.in; yu.cheng.1@usc.edu; yko@cs.princeton.edu; cswamy@uwaterloo.ca,,"Cheng, Yu/0000-0002-0019-2570",,,,,31,21,24,0,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,479,496,,10.1145/2940716.2940753,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300041,0

Alternation is due to the need to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of businesses. The proof is going on the example of retailers, since they have separate subdivisions and hence well-defined organizational structure. Ease of access to information determined the choice of the Czech Republic retailers, but at the same time it was limited the scope of the study. A two-step cluster analysis demonstrates that all retail enterprises of one country may be represented as groups of five clusters, each of which unifies together enterprises with the same structure and similar efficiency parameters. Independent variables used in the analysis are sales volume, number of employees, labor productivity, number of locations, the number of activities types. The competitiveness of each next cluster enterprises increases. Knowledge of development pattern allows each entrepreneur to clearly determine his cluster and to develop strategy to improve current business process or elaborate a strategy for jumping to the next level of development.","[Denisov, Igor] Univ Econ, Prague VSE, Dept Management, Fac Business Adm, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Denisov, I (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague VSE, Dept Management, Fac Business Adm, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",deni01@vse.cz,"Denisov, Igor/C-2191-2019; DENISOV, IGOR/R-2423-2016","Denisov, Igor/0000-0002-8718-9023;",,,,,14,1,1,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,323,333,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100032,0

It is assumed that the customers come to the system in the Poisson stream, service times are Erlang distributed. The capacity of the system is given by the number of arrival tracks in the marshalling yards. All the requests for secondary shunting are considered to be non-preemptive failures of the system because primary shunting cannot be carried out during secondary shunting. Times between non-preemptive failures are exponentially distributed and times to repair are Erlang distributed. The queueing system is modelled as a quasi-birth death process for which its state transition diagram and linear equation system are presented. By solving the equation system in Matlab stationary probabilities are calculated and on their basis some performance measures can be computed.","[Dorda, Michal; Teichmann, Dusan; Graf, Vojtech] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Mech Engn, Inst Transport, 17 Listopadu 15, Ostrava, Poruba, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Dorda, M (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Mech Engn, Inst Transport, 17 Listopadu 15, Ostrava, Poruba, Czech Republic.",michal.dorda@vsb.cz; dusan.teichmann@vsb.cz; vojtech.graf@vsb.cz,"Graf, Vojtěch/AAP-3215-2021; Dorda, Michal/B-4396-2013","Graf, Vojtěch/0000-0002-8101-8098;",,,,,8,0,0,0,3,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,165,170,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500029,0

Our analysis of panel data shows that the appointment of connected directors did not increase equity returns (as measured by the capital gain plus dividend yield on bank shares). In fact, we find that the appointment of MPs to directorships had negative effects on bank equity returns. Our event-study analysis corroborates this finding, showing that a bank's shares exhibited negative abnormal returns when their directors were elected to Parliament. Taken together, our results indicate that connected directors yielded little or even negative economic payoff to bank shareholders in pre-war Britain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The outperformance can be understood in several different ways. In this paper, we focus on the mean maximization under third-order stochastic dominance constraints. The third-order stochastic dominance constraints are approximated by so called super-convex third-order stochastic dominance constraints which compare the semivariance functions in various grid points. First, we compute the optimal solution of the problem when an ultra-fine grid is used, i.e. super-convex third-order stochastic dominance is a very good approximation of the third-order stochastic dominance. Then, we decrease the number of grid (partition) points (and consequently increase the speed of computations) and we compare the optimal solutions and optimal objective values for various numbers of partition points between each other. Finally, we use the second-order stochastic dominance constraints instead of the third-order ones and we again analyze the changes in the optimal solution and the optimal objective value.","[Kopa, Milos] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Kopa, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic.",kopa@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,"Kopa, Miloš/H-4481-2014","Kopa, Miloš/0000-0002-9438-4484",,,,,23,0,0,0,1,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,436,441,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500075,0

Let us have the matrix with uncertainty elements giving the profit gained by work of i-th vehicle on j-th day. The total profit produced by i-th vehicle is the sum of elements in row i of matrix. If there is a big difference between the profits gained, the drivers of vehicles will have very different wages and workloads. This can be improved by suitable permutations of elements in the individual columns of matrix so that the row sums are well balanced. It means that we need to split the total workload to given number of approximately equal parts. The level of regularity is expressed by irregularity measure. The lower measure implies the higher regularity. The goal is to minimize the total irregularity of parts of schedule with uncertainty.

Similarity measure is built in Hilbert space of infinite dimension as follows. Parzen estimate of probability density function was used to obtain scalar products of stock segment pairs. This product and corresponding metrics were expressed analytically as double sum over segment items to enable the use of Principal Component Analysis, Cluster Analysis and Self-Organized Maps for the description of stock similarities and differences.

The related design of a realistic strategy of poverty reduction in Indonesia should be based on an integrative management approach which seeks to provide a combination of different services at the community level.","[Swaningrum, A.] Leiden Univ, Leiden Ethnosyst & Dev LEAD Programme, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Swaningrum, A (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Leiden Ethnosyst & Dev LEAD Programme, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",a.ayu.swaningrum@umail.leidenuniv.nl,,,,,,,38,1,1,2,6,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-264-0,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,18.0,,,,,,122,130,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390913100019,0

The modeling is based on the empirical findings from the online retail consumers' behavior study. Selected data allowed confirm the statement that even the small data sets using the classification data analysis methods can display the significant Ecological Validity. The modeling was performed in three steps. First, the number of primary indicators was reduced using the factor analysis. Based on it several latent variables were created. Second, the k-mean cluster analysis instead of secondary factor analysis was used for development of three cluster variables that represent six clusters in total. Third, all three variables were used for development of the final latent variable which is categorical and represents the eight theoretically possible and five empirically confirmed categories.","[Vaitkevicius, Sigitas; Zakareviciute, Evelina] Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Management, Donelaicio G 20-405, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Valentova, Vladimira Hovorkova] Tech Univ Liberec, Dept Econ Stat, Studentska 2, Liberec, Czech Republic",Kaunas University of Technology; Technical University Liberec,"Vaitkevicius, S (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Management, Donelaicio G 20-405, Kaunas, Lithuania.",sigitas.vaitkevicius@gmail.com; vladimira.valentova@tul.cz; evelina.zakareviciute@gmail.com,"Hovorkova Valentova, Vladimira/M-1370-2018","Hovorkova Valentova, Vladimira/0000-0001-5718-315X",,,,,17,0,0,1,5,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,869,874,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500149,0

We investigated and analyzed the course of gratitude education in colleges and summarized its experiences and inadequacies by employing questionnaires and interviews. The result shows that the current situation of gratitude consciousness among college students can be summarized as follows: no gratitude towards parents, no gratitude towards teachers, lack of kindness and gratitude consciousness, and disrespect of life and neglect of social responsibility. There are 3 reasons account for the lack of gratitude education: the misconception of family education, insufficiency of gratitude education in colleges, and the misleading of social value orientation.

One of them is widely present perception that any dispute arising from on-line cross-border transaction would remain unsolved due to expensiveness and inefficiency of potential court procedure. Such lack of confidence that often prevents consumers from on-line shopping and creates a serious obstacle to the development of the internal market corresponds with the growing understanding that the alternative dispute resolution provides numerous advantages compared to the classic litigation. Such development has been recognized in the ADR Directive 2013/11/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on alternative dispute resolution for consumer disputes and amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 and Directive 2009/22/EC which provides improved mechanisms for functioning of the ADR in the cross-border transactions.

The role of the station in place making is disputed with stations seen as both creating and destroying a sense of place within a community. Our study is located within the railway stations of Scotland and explores how local communities have been empowered to reclaim, customise, and re-appropriate stations to simultaneously create a sense of place and better promote their community to the outside world. Drawing on ethnographic research we refute the notion that stations are somehow 'placeless'. We show how through a process of legitimisation, a sense of ownership and appropriation of the station environment, communities are able to transform the station, improving hedonic value and recapturing a sense of place.

Intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) is a risk factor for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Mexico has one of the largest per capita consumption of soft drinks worldwide and high rates of obesity and diabetes. Fiscal approaches such as taxation have been recommended as a public health policy to reduce SSB consumption. We estimated an almost ideal demand system with linear approximation for beverages and high-energy food by simultaneous equations and derived the own and cross price elasticities for soft drinks and for all SSB (soft drinks, fruit juices, fruit drinks, flavored water and energy drinks). Models were stratified by income quintile and marginality index at the municipality level. Price elasticity for soft drinks was -1.06 and -1.16 for SSB, i.e., a 10% price increase was associated with a decrease in quantity consumed of soft drinks by 10.6% and 11.6% for SSB. A price increase in soft drinks is associated with larger quantity consumed of water, milk, snacks and sugar and a decrease in the consumption of other SSB, candies and traditional snacks. The same was found for SSB except that an increase in price of SSB was associated with a decrease in snacks. Higher elasticities were found among households living in rural areas (for soft drinks), in more marginalized areas and with lower income. Implementation of a tax to soft drinks or to SSB could decrease consumption particularly among the poor. Substitutions and complementarities with other food and beverages should be evaluated to assess the potential impact on total calories consumed. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We find strong evidence of linear cointegration in Canada, France, Japan, the UK, and the USA, with nonlinear attractors characterized by asymmetry in Canada, France, and the USA.

There are as yet relatively few recent studies that examine systematically the influences on the travel of employed adults from such perspectives, particularly regarding possible transport disadvantages of the fastest growing segments of workers. A robust analysis requires systematic data on a wide range of explanatory variables and multiple travel outcomes including accessibility, mobility and trip frequency for different trip purposes. The UK NTS data does meet the majority of this demanding data requirement, but its full use has so far been hampered by methodological difficulties. To overcome complex endogeneity problems, we develop novel, integrated structural equation models (SEMs) to uncover the influences of latent land use characteristics, indirect influences on car ownership, interactions among trip purposes as well as residents' self-selection and spatial sorting. This general-purpose method provides a new, systematic decomposition of the influences on travel outcomes, where the effects of each variable can be examined in turn with robust error terms. The new insights underline two direct policy implications. First, it highlights the contributions of land use planning and urban design in restraining travel demand in the 2000s, and their increasing influence over the decade. Secondly, it shows that there may still be a large mobility disadvantage among the fastest growing segments of workers, particularly in dense urban areas. This research further investigates trend breaking influences before and after 2007 through grouped SEM models, as a test of the methodology for producing regular and timely updates regarding the main influences on personal travel from a system level.

Rather than undergoing a process of Europeanization, whereby a fundamental transformation in the underlying rationale and processes of decision-making occurred, as some have argued, the changes in Serbia's policy are in fact based on material concerns. By tracing relations in the EU-Serbia-Kosovo triangle, the article shows that change in Serbia's approach towards Kosovo is based on pragmatism and political opportunism, rather than absorption, adaptation, convergence or identity formation. What we have witnessed is a more short-term, interest based policy shift serving very specific economic purposes. In conceptual terms, this is better understood as a policy of rationally instrumental pre-Accession Europeanization' rather than as a process of adaptive normative Europeanization as more conventionally understood in the literature.","[Economides, Spyros; Ker-Lindsay, James] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Economides, S (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",s.economides@lse.ac.uk,"Ker-Lindsay, James/Q-1003-2019",,National Bank of Greece,National Bank of Greece,We would like to thank Kevin Featherstone for his advice and suggestions and Slobodan Markovitch for his assistance on this article.

Thus, this work aimed to characterise the main effects of the economic crisis on the wine sector in a case study area (region of Tuscany - central Italy). The research focused on top and medium-small brand name capital wine farms. Potential policy actions and managerial activities to improve the local sector were depicted. Due to the multifaceted characteristics of the examined topic, the selected methodology for evaluation is a nonlinear analysis instrument. Specifically, Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, network indexes and scenario analysis were adopted. Among the results, the need for association and cooperation, long-term scheduling and planning, and the capability to obtain critical funding were highlighted.","[Fabbrizzi, Sara; Sacchelli, Sandro; Menghini, Silvio; Bernetti, Iacopo] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food & Forest Syst Management, I-50121 Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Sacchelli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food & Forest Syst Management, I-50121 Florence, Italy.",sandro.sacchelli@unifi.it,"Bernetti, Iacopo/ABZ-1446-2022","Bernetti, Iacopo/0000-0003-2297-1070; Menghini, Silvio/0000-0002-5304-3536; SACCHELLI, SANDRO/0000-0002-7031-1125",Tuscany Region,Tuscany Region(Regione Toscana),This work is a part of the project Scenario analysis for rural policies and wine sector in Tuscany funded by Tuscany Region.

To obtain a more efficient estimator, we develop a system method that combines the Taylor rule and a standard exchange rate model to estimate half-lives. Further, we propose a median unbiased estimator for the system method based on the generalized method of moments with non-parametric grid bootstrap confidence intervals. Applying the method to real exchange rates of 18 developed countries against the US dollar, we find that most half-life estimates from the single equation method fall in the range of 3-5 years, with wide confidence intervals that extend to positive infinity. In contrast, the system method yields median-unbiased estimates that are typically shorter than 1 year, with much sharper 95% confidence intervals. Our Monte Carlo simulation results are consistent with an interpretation of these results that the true half-lives are short but long half-life estimates from single-equation methods are caused by the high degree of uncertainty of these methods.

Additionally, as a test of a proposition from prior studies, major renovations are found to be equivalent to teardown sales, where the property is valued only for the underlying land.

Using simulated out-of-sample experiments, we assess and compare the performance of the simple regression estimates, which exploit the available information on selected indicator variables, with factor-based estimates. These estimates use up to 65 variables to obtain new factors that embody most of the potential information and handle it in a systematic way following the Stock-Watson approach. Additionally, we compare the performance of the nowcast factor MIDAS with the quarterly factor (static-SW) models based on time-aggregated data, which neglect the most recent information. Our empirical findings can be summarised as follows. First, using more information does not help to produce more accurate results. Preselected indicator variables can clearly improve the forecast performance in comparison with the use of large dataset. Second, quarterly factor models are in general outperformed by the nowcast factor models that directly relate low-frequency data to those of high frequency. Third, the best forecasting performance can be reached using simple regression estimates with a handful of variables. However, it fails in density forecast evaluation tests. Thus, the alternative factor-MIDAS model is considered as an optimal model that passes all the performance evaluation tests. Fourth, concerning the difference between MIDAS projection methods, the results indicate that MIDAS with exponential distributed lag functions outperforms the MIDAS with unrestricted lag polynomials. The best performing projection based on the number of factors is the model with three factors. They can pick up the rapid switch in the utility of the indicators automatically. Finally, although the most accurate Flash estimates are obtained at 84 days, nowcasting using industrial production into a bridge equation witnessed insignificant loss in accuracy at 54 days only.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Naser, H (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",ecp10hsn@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Naser, Hanan/0000-0002-9062-0603",,,,,70,3,3,0,17,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

An exploration of mode choice variability in Great Britain using the National Travel Survey,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Intrapersonal variability; Mode choice; Multimodality; Modal variability; Mobility constraints,PATTERNS; MULTIMODALITY; CAR,"The main focus of travel behaviour research has been explaining differences in behaviour between individuals (interpersonal variability) with less emphasis given to the variability of behaviour within individuals (intrapersonal variability). The subject of this paper is the variability of transport modes used by individuals in their weekly travel. Our review shows that previous studies have not allowed the full use of different modes in weekly travel to be taken into account, have used categorical variables as simple indicators of modal variability and have only considered a limited set of explanatory indicators in seeking to explain modal variability. In our analysis we use National Travel Survey data for Great Britain. We analyse modal variability with continuous measures of modal variability (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the difference in mode share between the primary and secondary mode, the total number of modes used). Taking inspiration from Hagerstrand (1970), we conceive that modal variability is determined by different types of spatial mobility constraints and find that reduced modal variability is predicted for having mobility difficulties, being aged over 60, being non-white, working full-time, living in smaller settlement, lower household income, having regular access to a car, having no public transport pass/season ticket and not owning a bicycle. The findings can support a change in perspective in transport policy from encouraging people to replace the use of one mode with another to encouraging people to make a change to their relative use of different transport modes.

Most analysts contend that this process forces states to converge upon laissez-faire policies that systematically disadvantage smaller states. However, broader research in comparative political economy suggests that domestic institutions drive states to adapt in distinct ways independently of their size. Indeed, the Varieties of Capitalism (VoC) approach argues that national institutions shape both how states develop adjustment strategies and their firms' comparative advantages. This article examines two small states - Israel and Sweden - to ascertain whether defence-industrial transformation drives them to converge upon common laissez-faire policies or, contrarily, whether distinct VoC shaped their adaptation strategies along different lines. To preview the conclusions, institutions impel states to respond to defence-industrial transformation in divergent ways. Liberal market states, such as Israel, respond by introducing greater competition for contracts and liberalising their import/export policies. In coordinated market states, such as Sweden, government cooperates with business groups to selectively open industries to foreign capital and position them to compete globally. Although they adapt differently to transformation's common challenge, these cases demonstrate that even small states can retain robust defence-industrial bases, albeit ones with increasingly distinct comparative advantages and disadvantages.","Univ St Andrews, Sch Int Relat, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland",University of St Andrews,"Devore, MR (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Int Relat, Arts Bldg, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland.",mrd7@st-andrews.ac.uk,,,Stiftung Deutsch-Amerikanische Wissenschaftsbeziehungen (SDAW/Foundation German-American Academic Relations),Stiftung Deutsch-Amerikanische Wissenschaftsbeziehungen (SDAW/Foundation German-American Academic Relations),"For valuable comments and suggestions, the author would like to thank Moritz Weiss, Eugene Gholz, Jacques Gansler, Mark Thatcher, James Davis, Magnus Christiansson and Kristen Harkness.

Russia's policy toward its western neighbor has evolved from unhappy relations with Victor Yushchenko to rapprochement with Victor Yanukovich and then confrontation over the revolutionary power change in Kiev in February 2014. The paper argues that Vladimir Putin's actions following February revolution in Kiev demonstrate both change and continuity in Russia's foreign policy. Although these actions constituted a major escalation, relative to Russia's previous behavior toward Ukraine, the escalation of relations with Kiev also reflected a broader policy pattern of Russia's assertive relations with the Western nations adopted by the Kremlin since the mid-2000s. What made Russia's conflict with Ukraine possible, even inevitable, was the West's lack of recognition for Russia's values and interests in Eurasia, on the one hand, and the critically important role that Ukraine played in the Kremlin's foreign policy calculations, on the other. The paper provides an empirically grounded interpretation of Russia's changing policy that emphasizes Russia-Ukraine-West interaction and a mutually reinforcing dynamics of their misunderstanding. It also addresses four alternative explanations of Russia's Ukraine policy and discusses several dangers and possible solutions to the crisis.","[Tsygankov, Andrei] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Int Relat & Polit Sci, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA; [Tsygankov, Andrei] Nizhnii Novgorod State Univ, Ctr Polit Anal & Forecast, Nizhnii Novgorod, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia",California State University System; San Francisco State University; Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod,"Tsygankov, A (通讯作者)，San Francisco State Univ, Dept Int Relat & Polit Sci, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",andrei@sfsu.edu,,"Tsygankov, Andrei/0000-0002-4314-1116",,,,,63,123,138,3,150,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

From Corporate Self-Regulation to State Capture,NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,crisis; neoliberalism; corporate governance; director interlocks; state capture,CRISIS,"After the financial crisis of 2007-8, neoliberal capitalism by all appearances has entrenched instead of being displaced. Its political-economic programme or 'comprehensive concept of control' continues to hold society in thrall. This was different in the crisis of 1974-5 when the corporate liberalism of the postwar years and its industry-centred class compromise were beginning to be replaced by finance-led neoliberalism and a compromise with asset-owning middle classes. Under corporate liberalism, real capital accumulation was protected from the 'rentier'/'money-dealing' fraction of capital associated with speculative investment; neoliberalism has allowed its resurgence. Large corporations in the first phase of the transition ('systemic neoliberalism') embarked on a strategy of transnational restructuring no longer dependent on 1960s-style state support. In the process, financial group formation, here measured by dense director interlocks (>= 2) amongst the largest corporations in the North Atlantic economy (where this type of corporate governance obtains), was intensified. The resurgence of money-dealing capital and rentier incomes in the 1990s led to a decline in real accumulation ('predatory neoliberalism'), and after the crisis of 2007-8, to a demise of the financial group structure of Atlantic capital as the network of dense interlocks radically thins out and capital comes to rely on states again, this time to protect it from a democratic correction of the neoliberal regime and with state autonomy greatly reduced by public debt.","[Yurchenko, Yuliya] Univ Greenwich, Business Sch QM258, Dept Int Business & Econ, London SE109LS, England",University of Greenwich,"van der Pijl, K (通讯作者)，Vrijzicht 125, NL-1068 CH Amsterdam, Netherlands.",lafe3@sussex.ac.uk; y.yurchenko@greenwich.ac.uk,,,British Academy [SG100972],British Academy,"This work was supported by the British Academy, grant number [SG100972].",,68,15,16,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This study analyzed the various factors influencing cycling frequency among 1707 cyclists from Montreal, Canada using an ordinal logistic regression. A segmentation of cyclists is used in a series of ordinal logistic models to better understand the different impacts of variables on the frequency of cycling among each group of cyclists for commute and for utilitarian purposes. Our models show a variation in the impacts of each dependent variable on frequency of cycling across the various segments of cyclists. Mainly making cyclists feel safe not only on bicycle specific infrastructure but also on regular streets, emphasizing the low cost, convenience and improving the opinion on cycling in the population are effective interventions to increase bicycle usage. Also, it was shown that women were less likely to cycle to work than men, but more likely to cycle for other utilitarian trips, pointing at the presence of specific barriers to commuting for woman. Although the findings from this study are specific to Montreal, they can be of interest to transportation planners and engineers working toward increasing cycling frequency in other regions.

We reevaluate the evidence using a new methodology, synthetic control, and find a persistent and still continuing adverse impact of the quake on the economy of Kobe more than a decade after the event. Using the methodology developed by Abadie et al. (Journal of the American Statistical Association, 2010), we construct counterfactual dynamics for the Kobe economy. We identify a decline in per capita GDP that is attributable to the quake and is persistent, long-term, and clearly observable even 13 years after the quake. GDP per capita for 2008 was yen400,000 per person lower (12% decrease) than it would have been had the earthquake not occurred.

Nevertheless, the majority of LTSS student graduates does not start an apprenticeship immediately after graduation. This paper analyzes career planning, school grades, and the first transition after graduation for LTSS students in Freiburg during the late 2000s. Only about 10% of LTSS students start an apprenticeship immediately after graduation. About half, typically those with better grades, participate in additional general teaching (AGT) and rather continue schooling after graduation, expecting that this will improve their future career options. The majority of students with poor school grades, especially male students with a migration background, continue with pre-vocational training, even though career guidance was effective in terms of the career planning activities reported by students. Our results suggest that a focus of career guidance on the immediate start of an apprenticeship after graduation may be misplaced for those students continuing in further schooling. Furthermore, such a focus potentially raises hopes for an immediate start of an apprenticeship among the other students, which may later on be frustrated when a student continues with pre-vocational training.","[Fitzenberger, Bernd] Humboldt Univ, Sch Business & Econ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Fitzenberger, Bernd] IZA, Munich, Germany; [Fitzenberger, Bernd] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Fitzenberger, Bernd] IFS, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Fitzenberger, Bernd] ROA, London, England; [Fitzenberger, Bernd] ZEW, Berlin, Germany; [Licklederer, Stefanie] Univ Freiburg, Abt Empir Wirtschaftsforsch & Okonometrie, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Ifo Institut; University of Freiburg,"Fitzenberger, B (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Spandauer Str 1, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",bernd.fitzenberger@wiwi.hu-berlin.de; stefanie.licklederer@vwl.uni-freiburg.de,,,"Baden-Wurttemberg-Stiftung; Arbeitsagentur Freiburg, the City of Freiburg; University of Freiburg; Ministry of Science and Art in Baden-Wurttemberg [31-7532.20/068]; DFG [Fi 692/11-1]","Baden-Wurttemberg-Stiftung; Arbeitsagentur Freiburg, the City of Freiburg; University of Freiburg; Ministry of Science and Art in Baden-Wurttemberg; DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG))","We thank two anonymous referees and Friedhelm Pfeiffer for many useful comments and suggestions received in the review process.

Moreover, the average BMI of Japanese women is lower than that of Japanese men, and the age-specific BMI of Japanese women has decreased over time. The average BMI of Japanese women at age 25 decreased from 21.8 in 1948 to 20.4 in 2010 whereas that of men increased from 21.4 to 22.3 over the same period. We examine the long-term BMI trend in Japan by combining several historical data sources spanning eleven decades, from 1901 to 2012, to determine not only when but also how the BMI decline among women began: whether its inception was period-specific or cohortspecific. Our nonparametric regression analysis generated five findings. First, the BMI of Japanese women peaked with the 1930s birth cohort. This means that the trend is cohort-specific. Second, the BMI of men outpaced that of women in the next cohort. Third, the BMI of Japanese children, boys and girls alike, increased steadily throughout the 20th century. Fourth, the gender difference in the BMI trend is due to a gender difference in the weight trend, not the height trend. Fifth, these BMI trends are observed in urban and rural populations alike. We conclude that the BMI decline among Japanese women began with those who were in their late teens shortly after World War II. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The careers of more than 720,000 male apprenticeship graduates from the cohorts of 1978 to 1980 are followed over 24 years. On average, early-career unemployment has substantial negative effects on earnings accumulated later in life. An identification strategy based on plant closure of the training firm at the time of graduation suggests that the revealed correlation is not the result of unobserved heterogeneity. Scarring effects also vary considerably across the earnings distribution. Workers with a high earning potential are able to offset adverse consequences of early-career unemployment to a large extent. Workers who are located at the bottom of the prime-age earnings distribution, in contrast, suffer substantial and persistent losses. Our findings imply that a policy with the aim of preventing early-career unemployment would have long-lasting beneficial effects on future earnings.","[Moeller, Joachim; Umkehrer, Matthias] Inst Employment Res JAB, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany; [Moeller, Joachim] Univ Regensburg, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany; [Moeller, Joachim] Inst Study Labor, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Regensburg; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Möller, J (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res JAB, Regensburger Str, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",Schaum-joachim.moeller@iab.de; matthias.umkehrer@iab.de,,,,,,,45,13,13,0,25,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Transit agencies can raise revenue or relieve overcrowding via fare increases, but they are always confronted with the possibility of heavy ridership losses. Therefore, the outcome of fare changes should be evaluated before implementation. In this work, a methodology was formulated based on elasticity and exhaustive transit card data, and a network approach was proposed to assess the influence of distance-based fare increases on ridership and revenue. The approach was applied to a fare change plan for Beijing Metro. The price elasticities of demand for Beijing Metro at various fare levels and trip distances were tabulated from a stated preference survey. Trip data recorded by an automatic fare collection system was used alongside the topology of the Beijing Metro system to calculate the shortest path lengths between all station pairs, the origin-destination matrix, and trip lengths. Finally, three fare increase alternatives (high, medium, and low) were evaluated in terms of their impact on ridership and revenue. The results demonstrated that smart card data have great potential with regard to fare change evaluation. According to smart card data for a large transit network, the statistical frequency of trip lengths is more highly concentrated than that of the shortest path length. Moreover, the majority of the total trips have a length of around 15 km, and these are the most sensitive to fare increases. Specific attention should be paid to this characteristic when developing fare change plans to manage demand or raise revenue. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Demographic and fiscal pressures created the desire to reform and a more cooperative Duma made it possible to do so. These points do not explain why Putin chose the pension privatisation option. Russia's pension reform is best understood as part of a state-building strategy to diminish the role of powerful bureaucracies. Russia's welfare state was not merely the product of a powerful and popular president, but rather a tool to create a stronger executive.","Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80301 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Sokhey, SW (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, UCB 333, Boulder, CO 80301 USA.",sarah.sokhey@colorado.edu,"Sokhey, Sarah/GWU-9290-2022","SOKHEY, SARAH/0000-0001-7786-9351",International Research & Exchange Board (IREX),International Research & Exchange Board (IREX),"I would like to thank Dinissa Duvanova, Jennifer Fitzgerald, Amy Liu, Irfan Nooruddin, Thomas Remington and an anonymous reviewer for incredibly helpful comments and feedback.

This benchmark is built from the supply side using the value of church tithes combined with contemporary parish accounts. Two main findings emerge: first, per capita agrarian output was similar in the recently conquered South and the North, hinting that internal migration after the Reconquista led to the equalization of marginal product across the country; second, that Portuguese real per capita agrarian output was above subsistence and higher than that of contemporary England and Wales. This result, which is robust to the assumptions used, confirms that by 1320 Portugal was a frontier economy with a high land/labor ratio and a high per capita output. This seems to reinforce the Malthusian theory that the amount of land per person was key in determining living standards. The article discusses the implication of these results for the inequality among nations.","[Henriques, Antonio] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Henriques, Antonio] Univ Lisbon, Inst Ciencias Sociais, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal","Universidade do Porto; Universidade de Lisboa; Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon (ICS-UL)","Henriques, A (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal.",ahenriques@fep.up.pt,,"Henriques, Antonio/0000-0003-2796-374X",,,,,74,9,11,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

It is argued that a set of domestic factors, such as political miscalculations, tensions within the ruling coalition and opportunistic actions, facilitated the success of EU material leverage to halt democratic deterioration in Romania. The comparison drawn with the anti-democratic turn in Hungary demonstrates that facilitating domestic conditions, available in the Romanian case but lacking in the Hungarian one, can affect the exercise of EU post-accession leverage to contain democratic regression in the Member States.","[Iusmen, Ingi] Univ Southampton, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Iusmen, I (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Sch Social Sci, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",i.iusmen@soton.ac.uk,,"IUSMEN, INGI/0000-0001-6658-0667",,,,,36,27,29,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We then estimate the covariance matrix of the latent states through a Kalman smoother and expectation maximization (KEM) algorithm. Iterating between the two EM steps, we obtain a covariance matrix estimate which is robust to both asynchronicity and microstructure noise, and positive-semidefinite by construction. We show the performance of the KEM estimator using extensive Monte Carlo simulations that mimic the liquidity and market microstructure characteristics of the S&P 500 universe as well as in a high-dimensional application on US stocks. KEM provides very accurate covariance matrix estimates and significantly outperforms alternative approaches recently introduced in the literature.

A range of hypothetical pathways is discussed, highlighting the Janus-faced character of social capital as a medium for both the effectuation of progressive social change and the perpetuation and creation of social inequalities. An analysis is provided of the extent to which the recent transport-related literature supports or rejects the hypothesised pathways, and key avenues for future research are identified.

Two categories of restaurant consumption are examined: non-incentivized spend and incentivized spend. Aggregate macroeconomic activity is measured by gross domestic product. Non-incentivized spend is found to be a procyclical coincident indicator of aggregate macroeconomic activity in the USA.

While environmental studies have intensely investigated national climate policies and their determinants over the last few decades, little attention has been paid to the bargaining positions the same governments assume in climate negotiations. We argue that their bargaining positions reflect structural, economic, and domestic factors, but less so strategic factors. A country's vulnerability to climate change, its power and its democratic status are among the best predictors of its choice of negotiation position; its international interconnectedness, on the other hand, does not seem to have an influence. By comparing two negotiation issues - reducing emissions and financing climate mitigation - we can show that democracies choose very different negotiation positions, depending on the issue. When it comes to compensation mechanisms, serious climate reduction measures democracies do not commit to substantial emission reduction targets due to pressure from industry at home. They are, however, more prepared than other states to pay for projects that help to reduce emissions in the sense of a compensation mechanism. By understanding the choice of negotiation positions we can thus explain why the more or less cooperative bargaining positions adopted by states led to a breakdown of the Copenhagen negotiations. We investigated this question using a novel dataset on the UNFCCC negotiations, in which the positions of all participating governments were collected by hand-coding protocols from the negotiations as well as expert interviews with negotiators.","[Bailer, Stefanie] ETH, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Weiler, Florian] Univ Bamberg, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Bailer, S (通讯作者)，ETH, Haldeneggsteig 4, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",bailers@ethz.ch; florian.weiler@uni-bamberg.de,"Weiler, Florian/GVU-1958-2022; Weiler, Florian/AAS-2330-2020","Weiler, Florian/0000-0003-3287-395X",,,,,83,24,25,2,55,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

In this paper, we argue that WROs can be powerful actors in advancing women's status, especially when they adopt a specific advocacy strategy: naming and shaming of governments or non-governmental agents. We assert that a targeted naming and shaming publicity strategy is necessary to exert pressure on the government to enforce women's internationally recognized rights. Using a new dataset on the advocacy activities of over 1,595 WROs, we test the implications of our argument in a global statistical model from 1991 to 2005. The results indicate that WRO shaming is likely to improve women's economic and social rights while having no discernible impact on women's political rights. We also find that the mere presence of WROs is unlikely to have a significant impact on women's rights. One major implication of the findings is that any significant improvement in respect for women's rights partly requires a strong voice in advocacy. The findings also suggest that governments that face pressure from advocacy groups are more inclined to promote and enforce only the rights that do not threaten their own political power and status, such as women's social and economic rights.","[Murdie, Amanda] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Peksen, Dursun] Univ Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Memphis,"Murdie, A (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",murdiea@missouri.edu; dpeksen@memphis.edu,"Murdie, Amanda/GQB-5152-2022","Murdie, Amanda/0000-0002-6459-0594",,,,,77,47,54,8,53,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Toward these ends, researchers have always regarded suitable strategies and algorithms with the least computations. Since linear programming (LP) has been introduced, interest in it spreads rapidly among scientists. To solve an LP, the simplex method has been developed and since then many researchers have contributed to the extension and progression of LP and obviously simplex method. A vast literature has been grown out of this original method in mathematical theory, new algorithms, and applied nature. Solving an LP via simplex method needs an initial basic feasible solution (IBFS), but in many situations such a solution is not readily available so artificial variables will be resorted. These artificial variables must be dropped to zero, if possible. There are two main methods that can be used to eliminate the artificial variables: two-phase method and Big-M method. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) applies individual LP for evaluating performance of decision making units, consequently, to solve these LPs an IBFS must be on hand. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a closed form of IBFS for conventional DEA models, which helps us not to deal with artificial variables directly. We apply the proposed form to a real-data set to illustrate the applicability of the new approach. The results of this study indicate that using the closed form of IBFS can reduce at least 50 % of the whole computations.","[Toloo, Mehdi] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Masoumzadeh, Atefeh] Islamic Azad Univ, Cent Tehran Branch, Dept Math, Tehran, Iran; [Barat, Mona] Islamic Azad Univ, Mahshahr Branch, Dept Math, Mahshahr, Iran",Technical University of Ostrava; Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University,"Toloo, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",m_toloo@yahoo.com,"Toloo, Mehdi/F-7575-2019; Barat, Mona/AAN-3112-2021; Toloo, Mehdi/C-2679-2014","Toloo, Mehdi/0000-0002-6977-4608; Barat, Mona/0000-0002-1067-1196;",Czech Science Foundation (GACR) [14-31593S]; European Social Fund [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296],Czech Science Foundation (GACR)(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),The research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (GACR project 14-31593S) and through European Social Fund within the project CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296.,,8,9,10,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Governments of small islands in the Indian Ocean, Caribbean and Pacific have seemingly put most of their eggs into one development basket - the all-inclusive holiday in a luxury hotel, resort or cruise ship. While this industry generates employment, foreign direct investment, and income for island governments and the private sector, it also brings with it dependencies which are borne from the transnational ownership of these all-inclusive accommodations, the risks from exogenous factors - many of which are tied to the wider security of the global system - as well as the domestic economies in the source markets in Europe and North America. We reflect upon these dependencies and risks through a case study of the Seychelles based on fieldwork research conducted in 2012. Our findings highlight that the international tourism industry in the Seychelles - even in a situation of high or growing demand - creates structurally driven precarity for tourism workers who are predominantly low paid, low-skilled, and increasingly recruited from overseas. These findings provide new evidence that contributes to the growing research into tourism in IPE. Our findings highlight the precarious condition of labour in this fast growing service sector of the world economy and in so doing also adds much needed empirical insights from the South to recent debates about an emerging precariat in contemporary capitalism.","[Lee, Donna] Univ Kent, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Hampton, Mark; Jeyacheya, Julia] Univ Kent, Kent Business Sch, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Kent; University of Kent,"Lee, D (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Canterbury, Kent, England.",,"Jeyacheya, Julia/M-6336-2019; Jeyacheya, Julia/ABG-6647-2020; Hampton, Mark/AAC-1250-2020","Jeyacheya, Julia/0000-0003-4245-9453; Hampton, Mark/0000-0003-1481-4665",,,,,61,57,65,1,67,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Accordingly, urban wastes can be valued in new products or energy, able to reduce the amount of wastes landfilled and the amount of inputs purchased from external sources. In particular, we focus on small cities. We are interested to identify which urban features are able to influence the amount of produced urban wastes that can become inputs for processes of industrial symbiosis. As urban features, we take into account household features and the economic and productive structure of cities. Design/methodology/approach - We adopted a multiple case study approach for six small municipalities located in the Alto Bradano Area (South Italy). For each municipality, we collected data of produced urban wastes which can be used for symbiotic processes. In particular, we analyze the influence of two kinds of urban features: i) socio-economic parameters reflecting household features; ii) the area of nonresidential activities, which we consider a proxy for the economic and productive structure of cities. Originality/value - This paper spreads new light on the industrial symbiosis application at the urban level. Differently from previous studies about waste production, we focused on small cities and we analyzed the effect of the economic and productive structure of cities on the amount of urban wastes. The value of this work lies in the identification of which urban features should be considered in evaluating the implementation of symbiotic projects at the urban level. Practical implications - This study provides interesting managerial implications about the industrial symbiosis approach at the urban level. In particular, the present work can offer a useful guide to define the symbiotic loops that could be significant for a city.","[Albino, Vito; Fraccascia, Luca; Savino, Tommaso] Politecn Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management, Bari, Italy",Politecnico di Bari,"Fraccascia, L (通讯作者)，Politecn Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management, Viale Japigia 182, Bari, Italy.",,"Fraccascia, Luca/I-8078-2019","Fraccascia, Luca/0000-0002-6841-9823",,,,,26,0,0,0,15,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1363,1377,,,,,,15,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200105,0

This 1947 essay is most important also because it portrays innovation as the result of a creative reaction conditional to the characteristics of the context into which it takes place anticipating the notion of innovation as an emergent property of system dynamics.","[Antonelli, Cristiano] Univ Turin, Dipartimento Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, I-10124 Turin, Italy; [Antonelli, Cristiano] Coll Carlo Alberto, Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Antonelli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dipartimento Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, I-10124 Turin, Italy.",cristiano.antonelli@unito.it,"ANTONELLI, CRISTIANO/HTN-7364-2023",,European Union D.

The present paper explores the objective/subjective, explanation/understanding or quantitative/qualitative dichotomy within the methodological dispute between mainstream and more recent trends in Economics. The methodological differentiation towards mainstream economics and Austrians, Institutionalists and others, consists in the awareness of what might and might not be known in economic reality and which is the best way to express this knowledge, by mathematical precision or metaphorical contextual explanations. The main conclusion of the paper is that standard pattern predictions in which a particular circumstance may occur, as well as contextual explanations, the understanding of human action in dynamics, are as exact and scientific as those theories expressed using mathematical language. Scientific progress would be a consequence of recognizing such a fact, since the approach to the human being as an integral piece does not represent a threat to the scientific character of Economics, but on the contrary, it highlights the premise of heightened credibility.","[Baciu, Livia; Ghiviriga, Teodora] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Baciu, L (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,13,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,561,567,,,,,,7,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400071,0

In a partial equilibrium environment, ruling out the macroeconomic consequences of UI benefits, we characterize the stationary equilibrium of an economy where policyholders may be employed in the formal sector, short-run unemployed receiving UI benefits or long-run unemployed without UI benefits. We perform comparative static exercises to understand how UI benefits affect unemployed workers' effort to secure a formal job and their labor supply in the informal sector. Our model reveals that an increase in UI benefits generates two opposing effects for the short-run unemployed. First, since search efforts cannot be monitored it generates moral hazard behaviors that lower effort. Second, it generates an income effect as it reduces the marginal cost of searching for a formal job and increases effort. Even though in general it is ambiguous which effect dominates, we show that for short durations UI benefits increase unemployed worker's effort to secure a formal-sector job and decreases informal-sector work.","[Bardey, David; Pena, Ximena] Univ Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia; [Jaramillo, Fernando] Univ Rosario, Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); National University of Rosario,"Peña, X (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia.",d.bardey@uniandes.edu.co; fernando.jaramillo@urosario.edu.co; xpena@uniandes.edu.co,"Jaramillo, Fernando/D-8763-2016","Jaramillo, Fernando/0000-0001-5978-9884",,,,,8,2,4,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

To pay attention on organizational knowledge is over time a critical issue, especially in the phase of generational change, where the replacement of the entrepreneur can cause a leakage of knowledge that could invalidate the process of value creation. It's necessary to avoid the leak of knowledge across the organization's boundaries (Brown and Duguid, 2000, Coles et al., 2006). The paper aims to identify the ways used by some entrepreneurs to manage knowledge leakage in family businesses, during the process of generational change. Design/methodology/approach - Due to the explorative nature of this study, the paper follows a qualitative research design using different organization cases. Some local important firms involved in the generational change are interested. The purpose of each interview was to determine how each organization manages and controls knowledge leakage in the generational change. Originality/value - The paper contributes to improve understanding of the impact and ways in which entrepreneurs in family businesses manage knowledge leakage. We think also that this methodology could put in evidence some interesting elements that can contribute to reducing the leakage of knowledge in the complex process of generational succession in SMEs. Practical implications - The outcome of this study provide implications for future research on the role and the impact of knowledge leakage in the growth of family firms specifically linked to the stage of generational change; in addition, it's possible to suggest and test the empirical tools that can be used in organizations, in order to avoid or manage knowledge leakage.","[Cristofaro, Concetta Lucia; Melina, Anna Maria; Reina, Rocco; Ventura, Marzia] Univ Catanzaro, Dept Law Hist Econ & Social Sci, I-88100 Catanzaro, Italy",Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro,"Reina, R (通讯作者)，Univ Catanzaro, Dept Law Hist Econ & Social Sci, Magna Graecia Campus Salvatore Venuta Viale, I-88100 Catanzaro, Italy.",,,,,,,,31,0,0,1,6,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,619,631,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200048,0

Depending on the classification, lemons and limes are classified either into two species, C. limon and C. aurantifolia (Swingle and Reece, 1967) or into more than 30 (Tanaka, 1977). In order to study the molecular phylogeny of this citrus group, we analyzed 23 targeted sequenced nuclear genes and used three mitochondrial and five chloroplastic markers for 15 lemons and limes compared with representatives of the four basic taxa. We observed three main groups, each one derived from direct interspecific hybridizations: (1) the Mexican lime group (C. aurantifolia), including C. macrophylla, arising from hybridizations between papeda (C. micrantha) and citron (C. medica); (2) the yellow lemon group (C. limon) that are hybrids between sour orange (C. aurantium, which is believed to be a hybrid between C. maxima and C. reticulata) and citron; and (3) a rootstock lemon/lime group (Rough lemon and Rangpur lime) that are hybrids between an acid mandarin and a citron. We also identified different probable backcrosses and genotypes with more complex origin. None of the analyzed limes and lemons shared the C. medica cytoplasm, while this taxon is the common nuclear contributor of all limes and lemons. Limes and lemons appear to be a very complex citrus varietal group with the contribution of the 4 basic taxa.

Salt stress has two effects on plants, an initial osmotic shock followed by a toxic phase due to ion. Moreover, a high cellular NaCl concentration causes enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To avoid such salt stress-derived injuries, tight regulation of ROS homeostasis is necessary and is provided by a network through complex loops between oxidants and scavengers. NH4+ is a paradoxical nutrient ion because it is a main N source, but high concentrations of this ion in soil may have damaging effects. In this study, we have analyzed influences of NH4+ nutrition on Carrizo citrange plants undergoing 90 mM NaCl. Pants were grown with 1 mM NH4NO3 (control) and 5 mM de N-NH4+. To clarify the relationship between the antioxidant mechanisms induced by NH4+ nutrition and salt tolerance, we analyzed antioxidant activities (SOD, CAT, GR) and the role of ascorbate and glutathione pools. Carrizo citrange plants showed optimal growth in both treatments and we confirmed that N-NH4+ treatment enhanced resistance to salt stress. Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that N-NH4+ treatment triggers mild chronic stress which could be the prime Carrizo citrange defenses by stress imprinting, thus conferring plants resistance. Moreover, sub-lethal concentration of NH4+ could act as a mild oxidative stressor triggering antioxidant cellular machinery against subsequent salt stress.","[Fernandez-Crespo, Emma; Scalschi, Loredana; Camanes, Gemma; Garcia-Agustin, Pilar] Univ Jaume 1, ESTCE, Depto Ciencias Agr & Medio Nat, Grp Bioquim & Biotecnol Vegetal,Area Fisiol Veget, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Gomez-Pastor, Rocoo; Matallana, Emilia] Univ Valencia, Dept Bioquim & Biol Mol, Valencia, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; University of Valencia,"García-Agustín, P (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, ESTCE, Depto Ciencias Agr & Medio Nat, Grp Bioquim & Biotecnol Vegetal,Area Fisiol Veget, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",garciap@uji.es,"Camañes, Gemma/H-6131-2016; Matallana, Emilia/L-4619-2014; Scalschi, Loredana/AAB-1665-2019; García-Agustín, Pilar/AAB-3073-2020; Fernandez-Crespo, Emma/L-2221-2017","Camañes, Gemma/0000-0001-6407-9246; Scalschi, Loredana/0000-0002-6314-4402; Garcia Agustin, Pilar/0000-0001-7238-8524; Fernandez-Crespo, Emma/0000-0003-2746-334X",,,,,25,1,1,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1325,1333,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600168,0

It relies on a newly compiled dataset and provides fresh labour productivity estimates, disaggregated by industrial branch. Its main finding is that the switch to a more interventionist industrial policy enacted by the Fascist regime circa 1926-7 caused a marked slowdown in productivity growth. Nor was the government's decision to relocate resources from the traditional to the more modern industrial branches successful in lifting productivity dynamics: our shift-share analysis shows that the contribution of (static and dynamic) structural change from old to new industries to productivity growth was negligible. Finally, we find that the increase in the levels and growth rates of concentration, induced by specific Fascist policies, were associated with lower productivity levels and growth rates. This paper thus casts a shadow on the optimist accounts of Fascist industrial policy and confirms the findings of a revisionist literature minimising the positive role played by the State in the earlier stages of Italian industrialization.

Developing countries are more active than before: their role as recipients of FDI has markedly increased and their transnational corporations' (TNC) activity in investing abroad has also significantly grown. There is a change in equity FDI structure for the benefit of reinvested profits; some TNCs reduce the volume of their foreign assets through divestments and use to a greater extent than before non-equity modes of entry into the economies of host countries. The last two decades have witnessed a number of dramatic changes in the location of international business activity and of our understanding of its determinants. Globalization, technological advances, the emergence of several new players on the world economic stage, and a new focus on the role of institutions and belief systems in the resource allocation process have been the main triggers for change (Dunning, 2010).

In banking institutions, the frontline officers who are dealing with customers for banking activities such as opening an account, savings, withdrawal and remittance are the frontline of defense responsible to undertake money laundering risk assessment. A series of interviews conducted with compliance officers who supervise the assessment of money laundering risk and a central banker who supervise the regulation on anti-money laundering are analyzed in order to understand how frontline officers discharge their duties in assessing money laundering risk in Malaysian banking institutions. Interview findings suggest that money laundering risk is a real risk in the banking institutions, and the frontline officers should be adequately competent in discharging their duties. Even if the banking institutions are equipped with automated risk management solutions, manual (human expertise) is indispensable in assessing money laundering risk. Support provided by the compliance department is seen as complementary for the roles played by the frontline officers and monitoring ensued by the regulatory authority should have enhanced the compliance intensity in the banking institutions.

These factors are important for determining the seismic vulnerability of existing buildings. Seismic risk is the probability of loss at a given site and is obtained through the convolution of exposure, vulnerability and seismic hazard. Vulnerability is defined as the degree of loss to a given element at risk resulting from a given level of hazard. The vulnerability of an element is defined as a ratio of the expected loss to the maximum possible loss on a scale from 0 to 1.

In many aspects, B2C social media practices are not directly useful for inter- organizational and business-to-business (B2B) purposes. The main aim of this paper is to increase the understanding of the current applications of social media in external B2B transactions. This is carried out through an extensive survey of companies in the technology industry which are operating purely in B2B markets, having only other companies as customers. We wanted to understand how industrial B2B companies currently apply social media in their own inter- organizational applications, what potential they see for social media in this context, and what kind of support they need to better adopt social media together with their customers and partners. A population of 2488 Finnish decision makers from the Federation of Finnish Technology Industries were observed. Based on the answers of 143 different companies, 125 companies were found to wholly (100%) represent B2B markets, and these were chosen as the sample of this particular study. Studies on social media, especially survey-based studies, have not focused soley on B2B companies, particularly on the inter-organizational applications of social media in B2Bs, except for the B2B-marketing oriented study of Michaelidou et al. (2011) and the study of social media utilization in B2B relationships by Pettersson et al. (2014). This study extends these previous studies by creating new understanding of the maturity of social media integration in businesses, organizational business problems that companies perceive can be solved with social media, and approaches that can support social media adoption in B2B companies. Managerially, the results can be used, for instance, to better understand the various possibilities of applying social media for inter-organizational use in B2Bs, which are currently only superficially understood by a significant portion of managers. This can help support and facilitate external social media use in B2Bs.","[Jussila, Jari J.; Karkkainen, Hannu] Tampere Univ Technol, Informat Management & Logist, Tampere 33720, Finland; [Aramo-Immonen, Heli] Tampere Univ Technol, Ind Management & Engn, Pori 28100, Finland; [Ammirato, Salvatore; Felicetti, Alberto Michele; Della Gala, Marco] Univ Calabria, Dept Mech Energy & Management Engn, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy",Tampere University; Tampere University; University of Calabria,"Felicetti, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Mech Energy & Management Engn, Via P Bucci 42-C, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",,"Jussila, Jari Juhani/P-9416-2019; Kärkkäinen, Hannu T/G-4356-2014; Ammirato, Salvatore/AAI-9056-2020; FELICETTI, ALBERTO MICHELE/ACE-0225-2022","Jussila, Jari Juhani/0000-0002-7337-1211; Ammirato, Salvatore/0000-0001-6617-3789;",,,,,20,0,0,0,16,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1930,1940,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200149,0

It is also investigated how the internal stock of intangibles is linked to context features and performances of firms. Design/methodology/approach - The data sources the methodology relies on are audited financial statements of companies. The analysis is performed on a sample of 234 world top R&D spending firms, ranked by The EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard, for the period 2010-2012, for a total of 702 consolidated annual reports examined. In order to delineate portfolio composition, we first grouped all the intangibles disclosed in annual reports in different categories and then calculated composition ratios. Furthermore, five adoption models are defined - collaboration, outsourcing, licensing, trading, and incorporation - depending on the costs, revenues, new investments and divestments in intangibles and knowledge assets related to OI. Originality/value - Our methodology points out a set of accounting indicators for both outlining companies' portfolio composition and evaluating their OI models. With this assumption, the paper contributes to the current debate on OI by investigating both its inbound and outbound aspects after a pecuniary perspective, starting from the acquiring and selling forms of openness introduced by Dahlander and Gann (2010). Moreover, all adoption models are defined over a continuous scale, so that we do not state whether a company collaborates or not, but rather assess its degree of collaboration. Further, the work improves the understanding of the relevance of intangible assets in OI activities, estimating how the portfolio composition is linked to the implementation of OI models. Practical implications - The devised framework constitutes a useful tool for managers after both an internal and an external perspective. From an internal point of view, the tool allows to monitor the impact of the investment in intangibles on companies' innovation processes after an open-oriented approach. As a matter of fact, it proposes a set of metrics enabling to typify companies' internal stock of intangibles and relate its composition to the OI models adopted. From an external standpoint, given the availability and objectivity of annual report figures, the framework can be exploited as a method of comparability in order to benchmark the OI strategy of a firm, resulting from the mix of OI models, against those of its competitors.","[Lamberti, Emilia] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Enterprise Engn, I-00133 Rome, RM, Italy; [Caputo, Mauro; Cammarano, Antonello; Michelino, Francesca] Univ Salerno, Dept Ind Engn, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Salerno,"Lamberti, E (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Enterprise Engn, Via Politecn 1, I-00133 Rome, RM, Italy.",,"Cammarano, Antonello/AAA-3770-2020; Caputo, Mauro/N-2857-2015","Cammarano, Antonello/0000-0002-7922-5864; Caputo, Mauro/0000-0003-3500-4290",,,,,17,1,1,0,12,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1477,1491,,,,,,15,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200114,0

Each cultivar also bears vegetative shoots that produce fewer inflorescences (208) and more vegetative shoots (202) than floral shoots on a similar number of nodes. Canopy sections in which floral shoots develop contribute a greater percent of tree total yield than those dominated by vegetative shoots. We hypothesized that trees propagated from buds taken from floral shoots would retain the internal physiological status of a floral mother shoot to produce more floral daughter shoots than trees propagated from buds taken from vegetative mother shoots and thus be more productive. Buds from the two types of mother shoots collected from 'Tahiti' lime and 'Washington' navel orange were budded on 'Carrizo' citrange rootstocks. Forty trees were established in a field at UC-Riverside. At age 3 years, 'Tahiti' lime trees propagated from buds from floral mother shoots produced 28% more fruit than trees propagated from vegetative mother shoot buds. Similarly, 3-yr-old 'Washington' navel orange trees produced with buds from floral mother shoots yielded 26% more fruit than trees produced with buds from vegetative mother shoots. For 'Washington' navel orange trees propagated with buds from floral mother shoot, 4-year cumulative and 4-year average yield as number of fruit per tree was significantly greater than trees propagated with buds from vegetative mother shoots; the same relationship was true for 'Tahiti' lime, but the results were not significant at the 5% confidence level.","[Lovatt, Carol J.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Krueger, Robert R.] ARS, USDA, Natl Clonal Germplasm Repository, Riverside, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Lovatt, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Bot & Plant Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",carol.lovatt@ucr.edu,,,,,,,4,4,4,0,1,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1831,1837,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.234,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600234,0

However at present there is an ongoing state when the importance of tourism is verbally declared by state, but in reality, residual finances from state and municipal budgets are placed to this particular field.

The analysis carried out in this paper with the purpose to evaluate the influence that the exchange rate fluctuation has on the volume and the commodity structure of import shows that in the short term the weakening of the national currency has little influence on the structure of the goods import. A deep devaluation results in the acceleration of the inflation rate, together with the growth of expenses measured in the internal prices.

The traditional use as food is limited to the thick albedo after removal of the flavedo tissue and of the acid, non-edible pulp. This research had as its objective a characterization by molecular markers of nine accessions selected from four orchards of 'Pompia', in order to compare these genotypes with some Citrus species candidate to be the parents of this hybrid. AFLP, RAPD, and SCAR analysis allowed the comparison of 'Pompia' with six Citrus species: citron, lemon, 'Volkamer' lemon, pummelo, grapefruit, sour orange, and mandarin. The analysis with molecular markers demonstrated a close genetic relationship among 'Pompia', lemon, and citron.

Although, the EU Cohesion Policy has contributed to reduction of economic, social and territorial disparities over the past decade, overall a wide gap remains between the less developed and the highly developed EU regions. Visegrad Four countries (V4; the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia) belong to states that have joined the EU in the year 2004 and their regional development of the last 10 years has been strongly linked to the EU Cohesion Policy funding. The aim of the paper is to evaluate and compare the development of regional disparities in Visegrad Four over the period from 2004 to 2012 (period before economic crisis and after it) by utilizing selected multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods (namely entropy, TOPSIS and VIKOR methods). The information entropy is used to derive the objective weights of the regional indicators and the TOPSIS and VIKOR methods are employed to rank the NUTS 2 regions in V4 according to their socio-economic development in the context of EU cohesion. Applying MCDM methods, the paper solves the problem of an alternative approach to quantitative evaluation of the regional disparities.","[Minarcikova, Eva] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Minarcíková, E (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic.",eva.minarcikova@vsb.cz,"Polednikova, Eva/J-5333-2018","Polednikova, Eva/0000-0001-8645-5716",,,,,11,7,7,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1128,1137,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000107,0

As part of the analysis, not only legislation and strategic documents are evaluated that are essential for creating a business environment in the transport sector, but also the structure of the industry, its temporal evolution, competition in the industry. Information was obtained partly from public databases, partly from an empirical research conducted in selected transport companies. On the basis of synthesized knowledge about the current state of the business environment in the Czech Republic and estimates of future trends in transport, a partial SWOT analysis was conducted, namely an analysis of opportunities and threats that transport companies may encounter. The SWOT analysis also includes an analysis of identified opportunities in terms of their attractiveness and analysis of risks in terms of their severity and probability of their occurrence. In the SWOT analysis, both qualitative and quantitative criteria were used and the relationships between the measured factors were evaluated not only in terms of possible causalities, but also taking into account their significance. This allowed the authors to better identify opportunities that the management of transport companies should utilize and threats it should pay attention to.

The work starts from the analysis of scientific and political debates of the governance's dynamics of Italian state museums ( in particular focusing on the recent reform of the Italian museums' system - Franceschini's Decree) from which emerges some recurring themes. In particular the research group focuses its attention on the necessity to 'modernize' the process of cultural heritage management, which means 'managerialization' and, so, 'professionalization' of specific roles in the strategic sectors of heritage's protections, conservations, and valorization ('cultural manager' as directors/executives). Design/methodology/approach - The research group adopts the 'situationist' approach, focused on: the concrete context of human action and the role played by directors/executive; the institutional pressure able to orient the conducts of the latter; the activation of isomorphic processes by directors. In particular, this work investigates the presence of normative isomorphism, connected to the professionalization, and its role in the institutionalization of the rules. Based on the assumption that Universities have a crucial role in the development of new skills, we test our hypothesis on a sample of professionalizing master (first/second level) about the professionalization in the field of cultural heritage. Originality/value - The work links the governance of the artistic-cultural heritage with the 'training process' that universities make for professionalizing human resources. The current regulatory framework puts at the centre of every strategic board the need to start a training process in collaboration with specialized entities to this purpose: universities and training institutions are, in the opinion of the writes, appropriate as well as necessary. University nowadays are conducting projects training for 'cultural manager', sometimes anticipating the decision of Public Administration, trying to condition them (lobbying), sometimes following its strategic directions (conceding pressures). Practical implications - The adoption of this approach, trough the reconstruction of actions actually undertaken by experts for protection and valorization of artistic-cultural heritage (directors/executive), allow us to observe the following: the governance dynamics started by actors responsible for Italian cultural heritage seems, at best, informed at decoupling process, due to strong institutional pressures leading the organizations manager to 'look like'. The latters, in fact, in an effort to gain social legitimation, decided to adopt strategic conducts of institutional isomorphism. The decoupling should create, for the benefits of those who adopt these conducts, a 'legitimacy facade', aimed at achieving results only apparently performing.","[Nigro, Claudio; Iannuzzi, Enrica; Petracca, Miriam] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, I-71121 Foggia, Italy",University of Foggia,"Iannuzzi, E (通讯作者)，Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Via R Caggese 1, I-71121 Foggia, Italy.",,"NIGRO, CLAUDIO/A-7334-2017","NIGRO, CLAUDIO/0000-0002-8478-8127; Petracca, Miriam/0000-0003-0812-0034",,,,,37,0,0,1,12,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1837,1848,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200142,0

In lemon (Citrus limon (L.) Burm. f.), fungal diseases cause economic losses in the field as well as in postharvest management. In this study, fruits collected from two different transgenic lemon clones (E23 and E24) expressing a chitinase gene (chit42) from Trichoderma harzianum were tested to investigate the level of resistance against Penicillium digitatum, P. italicum, Colletotrichum gloesporioides and Botrytis cinerea. Fruits were inoculated with conidial suspensions of these fungi, incubated in a climatic chamber and symptom development was evaluated at 6, 14 and 21 days after inoculation. While fruits from either transgenic clone inoculated with C. gloesporioides and B. cinerea did not show mould symptoms during the whole evaluation period, similar fruits inoculated with P. digitatum or P. italicum showed reduced lesion area (50%) in comparison with the non-transgenic control fruits after 6 days and no difference after 14 days. The transgenic lemon clones, obtained from a highly appreciated lemon cultivar, did not show any difference in morphological and qualitative fruit traits compared to the non-transgenic control. These results suggest that their use could represent an alternative for sustainable management of lemon postharvest diseases.","[Oliveri, Cinzia; Distefano, Gaetano; La Malfa, Stefano; La Rosa, Rosa; Gentile, Alessandra] Dipartimento Sci Prod Agr & Alimentari DISPA, Catania, Italy; [Deng, Ziniu N.] Hunan Agr Univ, Hort & Landscape Coll, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan Agricultural University,"La Malfa, S (通讯作者)，Dipartimento Sci Prod Agr & Alimentari DISPA, Catania, Italy.",slamalfa@unict.it,,"Gentile, Alessandra/0000-0002-4135-5620; Distefano, Gaetano/0000-0002-6080-6466; La Malfa, Stefano/0000-0001-5869-0348",,,,,14,6,6,0,5,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1639,1645,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600210,0

Project-based organizations (PBO) are widely used to execute and realize innovation. PBO as temporary and flexible organizations have advantages to address dynamics and generate new knowledge in innovation projects. Dynamic capabilities in prior literature describe an organization's ability to respond dynamism in its environment. Knowledge sharing as a central process of knowledge management is considered to enhance dynamic capabilities of organizations. However, there are few studies investigating dynamic capabilities and knowledge sharing in PBO in literature. This study aimed to understand the nature of dynamic capabilities and their components in PBO and explored the relationships among dynamic capabilities, their components and knowledge sharing in innovation projects. Design/methodology/approach - This paper developed a system dynamic model that incorporated a dynamic adjustment mechanism of resource allocation to improve dynamic capabilities of PBO. The model included three component factors of dynamic capabilities: adaptive capability, absorptive capability and innovative capability. The model showed the feedback loop about knowledge sharing, dynamic capabilities and their component factors during the lifecycle of PBO. Originality/value - We conducted simulation of the system dynamic model. The results indicate the system dynamic model could reflect real changing tendency of dynamic capabilities in PBO. Considering the synergetic effects of the three component factors on the level of dynamic capabilities, this paper built an auto-adjustment mechanism to balance the development of the component factors. The resource allocation to the three factors can be adjusted automatically once they show unbalanced development. Our results also showed knowledge sharing has effects on dynamic capabilities during lifecycle of PBO when external environment changed from moderate to high velocity dynamic. Practical implications - The system dynamic model developed in this study can be applied to evaluate dynamic capabilities of PBO. PBO could examine changing tendency of their dynamic capabilities given the conditions of resources allocation and market environment. The model also provides guidance for PBO to adjust the development of component factors of dynamic capability to adapt to the internal and external environment.","[Song, Yanqiu; Yang, Lan; Li, Guijun; Gao, Ting] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Song, YQ (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",,"Li, Guijun/AAZ-6202-2021",,,,,,22,0,0,0,31,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,209,221,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200017,0

The object of this study is partnership program as one of the pillars of Corporate Social Responsibility at PT Telkom Indonesia, with the speakers chosen purposively. Data were collected through in-depth interviews, participant observation, and documentation study. The result of this study have shown that PT Telkom Partnership Program is a program to improve small business in order to become strong and independent through the utilization of funds from the company's profit plus interest on deposits and savings funds accumulated since the partnership program from 2001 until now. There are two forms of activity in PT Telkom Partnership Program, they are provision of a loan with a 6 percent annual administrative services, and grants in the form of coaching, training, apprenticeship, and exhibition for the partners. The response and participation of the partners in PT Telkom Partnership Program is really excellent. The drawback of implementing PT Telkom Partnership Program is the absence of BUMN database center that triggers potential duplication of aid loans to the partners, the paradigm of community that is not independent yet, and the attitude of trust partners who are still lacking discipline. Partnership Program as a community development program has significantly increased the progress and independence of the partners, which in turn can improve the economic welfare of community.","[Sukoco, Iwan] Padjadjaran State Univ, Jatinangor 45363, Indonesia",Universitas Padjadjaran,"Sukoco, I (通讯作者)，Padjadjaran State Univ, Bandung Sumedang Km 21, Jatinangor 45363, Indonesia.",wansukoco@gmail.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-62520-86-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2015,5.0,,,,,,365,371,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0MZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366326900052,0

Our empirical survey aims to investigate the effect of a long term company culture in terms of a firm's economic performance and intellectual capital. Design/methodology/approach-Using a quantitative research approach, the survey tests a panel dataset of Italian wine companies, developing the statistical model of parametric correlation to verify the relationship between some performance indicators with a set of variables, such as the year of foundation of the company, as well as single aspects of corporate governance. Originality/value -This methodology results in a deep analysis of the wine business, which is one of the most stable industries in Italy. We found some industry-specific peculiarities. One is the family buy out strategy implemented recently by several wine companies. That feature, often moving the companies out of the family business, could also be threatening the terroir inspiration. Secondly, we found a large presence of cooperatives within the main Italian wine companies, which are non-family entities, but are made of several family firms working in joint cooperation (a mixed family/non-family governance model). Practical implications - The survey represents an empirical support to fill the limited empirical evidence existing on wine industry value creation in relation to the corporate governance structure. The research findings support the hypothesis that a family firm could add value over the generations through generating an internal cumulative knowledge process and a strong brand image. The main implications are that a family firm is an efficient governance model. In addition, the presence of a CEO external to the founder's family is positively correlated to performances, as well as a limited amount of board members.","[Tartaglione, Andrea Moretta; Palumbo, Emanuela; Buttaro, Tiziana] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, I-03043 Cassino, FR, Italy",University of Cassino,"Palumbo, E (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, I-03043 Cassino, FR, Italy.",,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,9,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,808,821,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200061,0

Careful evaluation is necessary because the effects of chemical mixtures can be neutral, additive, synergistic or antagonistic. Generally, research strategy has two main aims; sour rot spore control in water suspensions, and sour rot control on fruit. The first approach involves the evaluation of sanitisers, such as calcium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, chloro-bromo-dimethyl-hydantoin and peroxyacetic acid, in 'simulated' packing line processes. Sanitisers added to fungicide dips can reduce sour rot spore loads but chemical incompatibility is common: Sanitisers can quickly lose activity rendering them ineffective. The response varies with sanitiser active, fungicide active and fungicide formulation, making evaluation an on-going task as new actives and formulations are commercialised. The second approach aims to enhance sour rot control on fruit by combining fungicides and GRAS compounds. Currently, citrus packers combine mineral salts, such as sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate, to improve sour rot control. Organic salts, such as potassium sorbate, also have demonstrated efficacy. Sanitising these solutions is problematic, with the choice of fungicide, salt and sanitiser influencing compatibility and efficacy.","[Taverner, Peter; Cunningham, Nancy M.; Leo, Annunciata T.] South Australian Res & Dev Inst, Waite Res Precinct, Urrbrae, SA, Australia",South Australian Research & Development Institute (SARDI),"Taverner, P (通讯作者)，South Australian Res & Dev Inst, Waite Res Precinct, Urrbrae, SA, Australia.",Peter.Taverner@sa.gov.au,,,,,,,13,2,2,0,7,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1555,1562,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600198,0

Therefore, companies may be more or less innovative depending on the characteristics of the territory where they are established or embedded. (Tremblay et al, 2010;. Matteaccioli and Muriel, 2007; Camagni and Maillat, 2006; Maskell, 2001; Porter, 1990). In recent years, the concept of industrial cluster has attracted interest and investment. Inspired by Michael Porter, the term cluster refers to a geographic concentration of interconnected companies, specialized suppliers, related industries and associated institutions in a particular field, also called intermediate bodies. They are not only in competition, but they cooperate together and support firms in training, financing, etc. In our article, we focus on the contributions of close relationships or networks to knowledge development, innovation and business management by relying on a survey of corporate actors in the field of information technology (IT) and mainly multimedia. We will analyze in particular the role of intermediary organizations and their impact on the knowledge development and innovation process of companies in the sector, and their role in entrepreneurship development, including incubator activities. Purpose - The goal of our research is to highlight the role of intermediary bodies, their roles in training or supporting learning in the workplace, as well as the development of companies, in entrepreneurship development in IT and multimedia. We also wanted to identify the role of proximity and to determine if relational or physical proximity is more important. Do firms need to be close to each other physically in order to develop cooperation, entrepreneurship and innovation ? Or is relational proximity, exchanges and interactions, more important? Design/methodology/approach - We conducted a study of the computer industry, multimedia and video game based on the consultation of the literature and semi-structured interviews with representatives of the sector between 2009 and 2015. Interviews with representatives companies focused on their vision of intermediary organizations, innovation policies and their contribution to innovation in the Montreal economy and their business. We achieved a good sixty interviews over the years, but retain here a set of 23 interviews, the latest interviews, which focus more on knowledge development and training, enterprise collaboration and competitiveness of the IT sector. The interviews were all transcribed, coded and analyzed in depth. Not to reveal the identity of the companies surveyed, we indicate that about half were in the area of video games, or more broadly interactive services and digital media (video games often providers), while others are in the broader IT sector. Originality/value - Our study seeks to demonstrate that there is an ongoing effort to value and promote the importance of knowledge development and cooperation for development of the IT, gaming and multimedia industry. We highlight the importance of the concept of cluster, and the determining effect of its dynamics.

OPENNESS is the main outcome of the italian research project VINCENTE (A Virtual collective INtelligenCe ENvironment to develop sustainable Technology Entrepreneurship ecosystems) and is an Enteprise Social Software for knowledge workers whose aim is to connect users that share their knowledge creating and finding solutions and new services for young innovative entrepreneurs and already existing SMEs. As described in [Elia2014] the four pillars of the OPENNESS platform are people, activities, resources and actions. The actions represent the means to link the other three pillars among them and to connect the communities, the knowledge base, the achieved objectives and the completed/uncompleted activities. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper we present a new implicit personalization and recommendation approach, based on a hybrid system, built on top of an arithmetical model, a semantic network, a distributional semantics context and time aware recommender [Musto2012, Basile2015] and a goal-oriented model in order to infer relationships with other user groups and behavioural patterns. Originality/value - This methodology puts in evidence how the knowledge about interests, preferences and goals of a user is the basis of the concepts of recommendation and personalization. In a collective intelligence environment we can extend the user profile information for profiling system with additional data that comes with the collaborative environment, like the group the user belongs, what or who the users follow and like, what a user is talking about more. The audit log of the platform is the sensing feature of the recommender, is the sensor that listens to the resource social life and analysing it, the system in able to provide the most suitable resources, activities and groups to join. Practical implications - The hybrid system proposed in this paper, goes beyond the individual systems that deal only with recommendation or practical reasoning by exploiting the potential that their integration ensures. The system is able to work even on small data volumes or without any explicit input from the user (thanks to the configurable weights available for user actions) and on inferences made by exploiting the cascade of inferences triggered by the implicit profiling system. We need to consider that PRACTIONIST (a framework for developing agent systems according to the Belief-Desire-Intention model as described in Morreale2006), the semantic network and the recommendation algorithms CASPERI and STARS taken individually or even by their sub-components, can still be used in a modular way for working on their specific field of application.","[Vella, Giuseppe; Morreale, Vito] Engn Ingn Informat SpA, Dept R&D Lab, I-90148 Palermo, Italy; [Ingrassia, Daniele] Engn Ingn Informat SpA, Dept R&D Lab, I-38123 Povo, TN, Italy; [Caputo, Annalina; De Gemmis, Marco; Semeraro, Giovanni] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dept Comp Sci, I-70126 Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Vella, G (通讯作者)，Engn Ingn Informat SpA, Dept R&D Lab, Viale Reg Siciliana, I-90148 Palermo, Italy.",,"de Gemmis, Marco/E-9490-2014; Semeraro, Giovanni/AAC-2156-2020; Caputo, Annalina/AAT-5741-2021","Semeraro, Giovanni/0000-0001-6883-1853; Caputo, Annalina/0000-0002-7144-8545",,,,,29,0,0,0,9,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,978,988,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200074,0

We have developed a cryopreservation method by which we can back up citrus genetic resources for the long term at liquid nitrogen temperatures. We excise shoot tips directly from greenhouse or screenhouse source plants, surface sterilize, and then treat with cryoprotectants. These solutions dehydrate and allow the shoot tips to survive liquid nitrogen exposure. Plants are recovered by micrografting thawed shoot tips onto ` Carrizo' seedling rootstocks. Experiments that compared survival after freezing in cryovials vs. on aluminum foil strips reveal higher levels and more uniform survival when foil strips were utilized. High viability was maintained for at least 1 year.

This paper uses three rounds of household survey data, collected before and after the introduction of the CBHI pilot, to assess the impact of the scheme on household consumption, income, indebtedness, and livestock holdings. We find that enrollment leads to a 5 percentage point-or 13%-decline in the probability of borrowing and is associated with an increase in household income. There is no evidence that enrolling in the scheme affects consumption or livestock holdings. Our results show that the scheme reduces reliance on potentially harmful coping responses such as borrowing. This paper adds to the relatively small body of work that rigorously evaluates the impact of CBHI schemes on economic welfare.","[Yilma, Zelalem; Mebratie, Anagaw; Bedi, Arjun S.] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Sparrow, Robert] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Dekker, Marleen] Leiden Univ, African Studies Ctr, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Alemu, Getnet] Univ Addis Ababa, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Bedi, Arjun S.] Georgetown Univ, Sch Foreign Serv Qatar, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Australian National University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Addis Ababa University; Georgetown University,"Yilma, Z (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",debebe@iss.nl; mebratie@iss.nl; robert.sparrow@anu.edu.au; MDekker@ascleiden.nl; galemu2001@yahoo.com; bedi@iss.nl,,"Sparrow, Robert/0000-0001-8613-0495; dekker, marleen/0000-0002-3584-8664",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO-WOTRO) [W07.45.103.00],Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO-WOTRO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO-WOTRO), grant number W07.45.103.00.

The main result is that the typical economic freedom indicators do not play a statistically significant role with respect to the number and wealth of billionaires, except the protection of property rights.

This paper studies parental escort on children's school trips in Germany. It uses binary logit regression models to look at social and spatial context factors simultaneously, as well as considering the gendering of parental escort, i.e. the allocation of escort trips to fathers and mothers. The results generally support other studies in terms of parental and children's sociodemographics, and trip attributes. The results for parental employment complement previous, somewhat inconsistent results. Descriptive analysis sheds some light on the interplay between escort and travel mode, as well as on age and gender structures and their intersections with spatial context. The effects of spatial context in regression are mixed. Urban locations seem to be more suitable for the independent mobility of adolescents, but less suitable for smaller children. Within municipalities escort is less common in inner city areas with mixed land-use and a well-established public transport system. Shorter distances to school in areas with mixed land-use further encourage independence. As in other countries, women carry a disproportionate burden of escorting. In large cities fathers are more involved in child escort, suggesting more gender equity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The results reveal that we cannot rely upon the estimates of fiscal policy multipliers in countries with a sizeable unreported production, unless the dynamics of the hidden and regular components of the GDP are disentangled. Changes in public spending and the tax rate generate a reallocation from underground to the regular economy which contributes to obscure the spending and tax effect on total GDP. In addition, the restrictive policy harms economic growth for the perverse effects that impinge on the regular-irregular dynamics of the GDP, highlighted by our model. Finally, the interaction between regular and unreported production demonstrates that the link between the two sectors is very harmful in the long term, since there is strong evidence that shocks to the unreported production have long-lasting negative effects for the regular economy.","[Basile, Raffaella] Minist Econ & Finance, Dept Treasury, Rome, Italy; [Chiarini, Bruno; Marzano, Elisabetta] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, Naples, Italy; [De Luca, Giovanni] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Management & Quantitat Methods, Naples, Italy; [Marzano, Elisabetta] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Parthenope University Naples; Parthenope University Naples; Ifo Institut,"Marzano, E (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, Naples, Italy.;Marzano, E (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.",elisabetta.marzano@uniparthenope.it,"MARZANO, ELISABETTA/ABG-5797-2022",,"PRIN Tax evasion, irregular employment and corruption: cyclical features and structural problems","PRIN Tax evasion, irregular employment and corruption: cyclical features and structural problems","We are indebted to Claudio De Vincenti, Massimo Florio, Alessandro Missale, Sandro Momigliano, Renzo Orsi and Stefano Pisani for their helpful comments.

The few studies to consider whether they instead exhibit club convergence-i.e., convergence to a steady-state equilibrium significantly inferior to that of the developed economies-offer little convincing evidence of this either. We argue that this reflects the limitations of their measure of relative income (which includes their sample's average income) and/or the assumptions underlying the discrete-break unit-root tests they employ. By avoiding these limitations, we obtain evidence of two Latin American convergence clubs.","[King, Alan] Univ Otago, Dept Econ, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Ramlogan-Dobson, Carlyn] Univ Hull, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",University of Otago; University of Hull,"King, A (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Econ, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",alan.king@otago.ac.nz; Carlyn.Dobson@hull.ac.uk,,,,,,,28,10,12,0,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Although the mean spillover of EPU on oil returns is negligible in the long run, the mean spillover in the short term and the volatility spillover of EPU are significant for oil spot and futures returns.

While such programs are often implemented electronically in developed countries, in many developing countries with weak financial infrastructure, such transfers are distributed manually, resulting in significant costs to program recipients and the public sector alike. The introduction of mobile money systems in many developing countries offers new opportunities for distributing cash transfers. Using data from a randomized experiment of a mobile money cash transfer program in Niger, we find evidence of benefits of this new system: household diet diversity was 9%-16% higher among households who received mobile transfers, and children ate an additional one-third of a meal per day. These results can be partially attributed to time savings associated with mobile transfers, as program recipients spent less time traveling to and waiting for their transfer. They are also associated with shifts in intrahousehold bargaining power for women. These results suggest that electronic transfers may address key logistical challenges in implementing cash transfer programs in developing countries but that sufficient investment in the payments infrastructure is needed.","[Aker, Jenny C.] Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Aker, Jenny C.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Boumnijel, Rachid] Relief Int, Manila, Philippines; [McClelland, Amanda] Int Federat Red Cross & Red Crescent Soc, Geneva, Switzerland; [Tierney, Niall] Irish Aid Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Tufts University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Aker, JC (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA.;Aker, JC (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,,European Commission; Irish Aid; Hitachi Center; Tufts University,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Irish Aid(CGIAR); Hitachi Center; Tufts University,"We are grateful for financial support from the European Commission, Irish Aid, the Hitachi Center, and Tufts University.

Interregional input-output tables illustrate spatial and economic interdependencies within interregional trade and are considered a key component in input-output modeling. The study and analysis of the interregional trade flows in interregional economic activities often reveal interregional and inter-activity linkages, referred to as feedback loops and/or spatial production cycles in interregional level. Trade theory considering feedback loops is a relatively new approach to the detailed analysis of vertical specialization of trade flows. This approach leads to the decomposition of global trade into feedback loops. Given the analysis of interregional inter-activity feedback loops based on the trade flows data, interregional input-output tables and associated trading patterns can be depicted using programmed functions in MATHEMATICA. Our programmed functions create static and dynamic images presenting the structure and the intensity of feedback loops connecting the regions and the activities of an economy. The generated visual schemes succeed to picture the multilateral trade connections between all regions. The programming codes along with their application in examples from the relevant literature are our methodological contribution in the visualization of trading tables.","[Halkos, George E.; Tsilika, Kyriaki D.] Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, Lab Operat Res, Korai 43, Volos 38333, Greece",University of Thessaly,"Halkos, GE (通讯作者)，Univ Thessaly, Dept Econ, Lab Operat Res, Korai 43, Volos 38333, Greece.",halkos@uth.gr; ktsilika@uth.gr,"Tsilika, Kyriaki/E-2117-2018; HALKOS, GEORGE/AAE-4772-2020","Tsilika, Kyriaki/0000-0002-9213-3120; HALKOS, GEORGE/0000-0002-2772-5306",,,,,13,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Each agent has a preference relation over the set of pairs consisting of a set of objects and a payment. Preferences are not necessarily quasi-linear. Non-quasi-linear preferences describe environments where the wealth effect is non-negligible: the payment level changes agents' willingness to pay for swapping sets. We investigate the existence of efficient and strategy-proof rules. A preference relation is unit-demand if given a payment level, for each set of objects, the most preferred one in the set is at least as good as the set itself; it is multi-demand if given a payment level, when an agent receives an object, receiving some additional object(s) makes him better off. We show that if a domain contains enough variety of unit-demand preferences and at least one multi-demand preference relation, and if there are more agents than objects, then no rule satisfies efficiency, strategy-proofness, individual rationality, and no subsidy for losers on the domain.","[Kazumura, Tomoya] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Serizawa, Shigehiro] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, 6-1 Mihogaoka, Osaka 5670047, Japan",Osaka University; Osaka University,"Kazumura, T (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",pge003kt@student.econ.osaka-u.ac.jp; serizawa@iser.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Serizawa, Shigehiro/A-9300-2012",,"Joint Usage/Research Center at ISER, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [14J05972, 15H05728, 15H03328] Funding Source: KAKEN","Joint Usage/Research Center at ISER, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors are grateful to the editor, the associate editor and two anonymous referees for their many detailed and helpful comments.

Each state imposes restrictions on the amounts and locations of qualifying renewable generation. Using a co-optimization (transmission and generation) planning model, we quantify the long run economic benefits of allowing flexibility in the trading of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) among the U.S. states belonging to the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC). We characterize flexibility in terms of the amount and geographic eligibility of out-of-state RECs that can be used to meet a state's RPS goal. Although more trade would be expected to have economic benefits, neither the size of these benefits nor the effects of such trading on infrastructure investments, CO2 emissions and energy prices have been previously quantified. We find that up to 90% of the economic benefits are captured if approximately 25% of unbundled RECs are allowed to be acquired from out of state. Furthermore, increasing REC trading flexibility does not necessarily result in either higher transmission investment costs or a substantial impact on CO2 emissions. Finally, increasing REC trading flexibility decreases energy prices in some states and increases them elsewhere, while the WECC-wide average energy price decreases.","[Perez, Andres P.; Sauma, Enzo E.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ind & Syst Engn Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Munoz, Francisco D.] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Sci & Engn, Ind Engn & Operat Grp, Santiago, Chile; [Munoz, Francisco D.] Sandia Natl Labs, Dept Discrete Math & Optimizat, POB 5800, Albuquerque, NM 87185 USA; [Hobbs, Benjamin F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Hobbs, Benjamin F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Environm Energy Sustainabil & Hlth Inst, Baltimore, MD USA",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Sandia National Laboratories; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University,"Sauma, EE (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ind & Syst Engn Dept, Santiago, Chile.",esauma@ing.puc.cl,"Muñoz, Francisco/AHD-1365-2022; Sauma, Enzo E/N-7013-2013","Sauma, Enzo E/0000-0002-8555-9123","CONICYT; FONDECYT/Regular [1130781]; FONDAP [15110019]; USDOE; NSF; Department of Energy's Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR); Lockheed Martin Corporation, for USDOE's National Nuclear Security Administration [DE-AC04-94-AL85000]; [IIA 1243482]; [ECCS 1230788]","CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)); FONDECYT/Regular(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); FONDAP; USDOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Department of Energy's Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR); Lockheed Martin Corporation, for USDOE's National Nuclear Security Administration; ;","We thank S.

Few studies have systematically analysed bargaining satisfaction within the Council. This research uses as a measure of bargaining satisfaction the salient weighted distance between a Member State's policy preference and the decision outcome. This is the first analysis to frame EU Member States' satisfaction using the content of the issues and distinguishing among policy domains. The analysis also includes a substantive number of cases from the post-2004 enlargement. The empirical analysis shows, in contrast to previous work, that the level of variation of fulfilment in the decision-making within the Council is considerable across policy domains. The main determinants of bargaining satisfaction are related to both structural and agency factors.","[Arregui, Javier] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Arregui, Javier] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Pompeu Fabra University; Johns Hopkins University,"Arregui, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",javier.arregui@upf.edu,"Arregui, Javier/L-4015-2015","Arregui, Javier/0000-0002-1149-7150",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CSO2012-35554],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"I thank Robert Thomson, Ondrej Moceck, Albert Falco, Bruno Arpino, the editors and the anonymous reviewers for comments that improved previous versions of this article.

Immigrants offer an opportunity to study persistent social influences on health where the social conditions are not endogenous to individual outcomes. This approach provides a clear direction of causality from social conditions to health, and in a second stage to wellbeing. Natives and immigrants from across the world residing in 30 European countries are studied using survey data. The paper applies within country analysis using both linear regressions and two stage least squares. Natives' and immigrants' individual characteristics have similar predictive power for health, except Muslim immigrants who experience a sizeable health penalty. Average health reports in the immigrant's birth country have a significant association with the immigrant's current health. Almost a quarter of the birth country health variation is brought by the immigrants, while conditioning on socioeconomic characteristics. There is no evidence of the birth country predictive power declining neither as the immigrant spends more time in the residence country nor over the life course. The second stage estimates indicate that a one standard deviation improvement in health predicts higher happiness by 1.72 point or 0.82 of a standard deviation, more than four times the happiness difference of changing employment status from unemployed to employed. Studying life satisfaction yields similar results. Health improvements predict substantial increases in individual happiness. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using a data set that matched the details of all nuclear reactors in China with information on land transactions around them before and after the FNA, we find that the accident had dynamic effects on land markets in China. Land prices within 40 km of nuclear power plants dropped by about 18% one month after the nuclear accident. However, the impact of FNA decreased over the longer term, eventually becoming statistically insignificant. Also, the impacts of the disaster varied with plant characteristics such as operating status, construction year, and size. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a two-step procedure to handle non-discretionary factors in DEA models. In the first step, the multiple non-discretionary factors are transformed into a single artificial factor and then, using a slack-based model the performance assessment is done. To highlight the comparison, an analysis using simulated data is performed. The results show that the proposed two-stage approach is relatively better than existing approaches when we apply the slack based measure of efficiency.","[Amirteimoori, Alireza; Maghbouli, Mahnaz] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Appl Math, Rasht, Iran; [Kordrostami, Sohrab] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Appl Math, Lahidjan, Iran",Islamic Azad University; Islamic Azad University,"Amirteimoori, A (通讯作者)，Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Appl Math, Rasht, Iran.",aamirteimoori@gmail.com,"maghbouli, mahnaz/AAN-6386-2021; Amirteimoori, Alireza/JQX-0472-2023; kordrostami, sohrab/V-6787-2019; Amirteimoori, Alireza/I-7703-2019","Amirteimoori, Alireza/0000-0003-4160-8509; kordrostami, sohrab/0000-0003-0081-8008; Maghbouli, Mahnaz/0000-0002-0488-0645","Rasht branch, Islamic Azad University [4.5830]","Rasht branch, Islamic Azad University","Financial support by Rasht branch, Islamic Azad University Grant No. 4.5830 is gratefully acknowledged.",,16,1,2,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Specifying inflation volatility as an unbounded process, as implied by the random walk, conflicts with priors beliefs, yet a stationary process cannot capture the low-frequency behaviour commonly observed in estimates of volatility. We therefore propose an alternative model with a change-point process in the volatility that allows for switches between stationary models to capture changes in the level and dynamics over the past 40 years. To accommodate the stationarity restriction, we develop a new representation that is equivalent to our model but is computationally more efficient. All models produce effectively identical estimates of volatility, but the change-point model provides more information on the level and persistence of volatility and the probabilities of changes. For example, we find a few well-defined switches in the volatility process and, interestingly, these switches line up well with economic slow-downs or changes of the Federal Reserve Chair. Moreover, a decomposition of inflation shocks into permanent and transitory components shows that a spike in volatility in the late 2000s was entirely on the transitory side and characterized by a rise above its long-run mean level during a period of higher persistence.

I demonstrate that the more processed grains, i.e., beer and bread, feature in a basket used to deflate wages, the greater the observed superiority of London over the Polish cities. I also show that Poland was characterised by the widest income gap between the urban and rural sectors. I account for income differences between sectors by weighting the income series by occupational structures. The evidence suggests that England was richer than Poland by 1500.

To improve the fuel economy of vehicles, in 2003 Switzerland introduced a system of fuel economy and CO2 emissions labels for new passenger cars, based on grades from A (best) to G (worst). We have data for all cars approved for sale in Switzerland from 2000 to 2011. Hedonic regressions suggest that there is a fuel-economy premium, but do not allow us to identify whether the fuel economy label has an additional effect on car price, above and beyond the effect of fuel economy. To circumvent this problem, we turn to a sharp regression discontinuity design based on the mechanism used by the government to assign cars to the fuel economy label, which estimates the effect of the A label on price to be 6-11%. Matching estimators find this effect to be 5%.","[Alberini, Anna] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ AREC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Alberini, Anna; Bareit, Markus; Filippini, Massimo] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CEPE, Zurich, Switzerland; [Filippini, Massimo] Univ Lugano, Lugano, Switzerland",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Alberini, A (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ AREC, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",aalberin@umd.edu; mbareit@ethz.ch; mfilippini@ethz.ch,"Filippini, Massimo/K-8155-2013","Filippini, Massimo/0000-0002-5972-4439",,,,,62,10,10,0,16,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2016,37.0,3,,,,,315,342,,10.5547/01956574.37.3.aalb,0.0,,,28,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DP8OL,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378757400013,0

We apply a jump-GARCH model to monthly Case-Shiller housing price indexes of twenty cities in the U.S. during the period January 1991 through December 2011. We document the evidence of large housing price jumps in many cities, during both the financial crisis and non-crisis periods. The housing price jump intensity observed during the whole sample is largely explained by city, state and national-level fundamentals. However, consistent with the development of an asset bubble, there is further evidence of a decoupling between housing price jump intensity and fundamentals during the active or turbulent phase of the U.S. housing market that immediately preceded the onset of the Global Financial Crisis. No evidence of a decoupling from fundamentals is observed during the normal or tranquil phase of the U.S. housing market.","[Webb, Robert I.] Univ Virginia, McIntire Sch Commerce, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Yang, Jian] Univ Colorado, Sch Business, Denver, CO 80217 USA; [Yang, Jian] Nankai Univ, Sch Finance, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jian] Nankai Univ, Sch Econ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jin] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu 610074, Peoples R China",University of Virginia; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver; Nankai University; Nankai University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Yang, J (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Sch Business, Denver, CO 80217 USA.;Yang, J (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Sch Finance, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.;Yang, J (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Sch Econ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.;Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu 610074, Peoples R China.",riw4j@virginia.edu; jian.yang@ucdenver.edu; jin.zhang@swufe.edu.cn,"Yang, Jian/J-5089-2013","Yang, Jian/0000-0002-4073-9796; Webb, Robert/0000-0003-1714-5778",,,,,21,13,12,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

It demonstrates that monetary policy cannot burst rational bubbles in the housing market. Under monetary policy rules of the Taylor-type, there exist global self-fulfilling paths of house prices along a heteroclinic orbit connecting multiple equilibria. From bifurcation analysis, the orbit features a boom (bust) in house prices when monetary policy is more (less) active.

The paper focuses on the taxi apps and their impact on taxi markets. It provides a brief history of taxi regulation before outlining the underlying economic rationales of its current form in many parts of the world, characterised as the QQE framework (quantity, quality and economic controls on operators). It argues that current regulation assumes that taxi markets are subject to three sets of problems that require correction by regulatory intervention, namely: those associated with credence goods, problems related to open access and those resulting from transactions occurring in a thin market. It is then proposed that taxi apps solve both the credence good and thin market problems whilst largely mitigating the problems associated with open access. The paper then presents some potential problems for taxi apps, namely the potential for instability on supply and demand sides, collusion and monopoly. It also discusses concerns about driver background checks and safety. The paper concludes by arguing that instead of restricting the growth of the taxi market, regulators should focus on reducing the likelihood of monopoly and collusion in a taxi market led by apps.

We find that moving-away sellers' houses have a higher sale rate, sell faster and sell for less (even after controlling for moving-away sellers' greater impatience). We also provide evidence that the disciplining effect of concern for referrals is stronger for agents who place a greater value on reputation.

The market price of credit risk is found to be statistically significantly negative, supporting earlier studies. However, a sample-split analysis reveals that this negative payoff is nonexistent in a later subsample, indicating that the credit risk puzzle is based on temporary mispricing related to the earlier subsample. Further investigation shows that mispricing in the earlier period was mainly driven by positive payoffs of low credit risk firms, while high credit risk firms did not generate significant returns in any of the sub-periods.","[Grobys, Klaus] Univ Vaasa, Dept Accounting & Finance, Wolffintie 34, Vaasa 65200, Finland; [Haga, Jesper] Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Stat & Finance, Handelsesplanaden 2, Vaasa 65100, Finland",University of Vaasa; Hanken School of Economics,"Grobys, K (通讯作者)，Univ Vaasa, Dept Accounting & Finance, Wolffintie 34, Vaasa 65200, Finland.",klaus.grobys@uwasa.fi; jesper.haga@hanken.fi,,,,,,,26,3,3,1,18,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Whether influence of the exposures occurring during this window lasts later in life is unclear. Our study investigates changes in associations between birth weight and height, one measure of physical development, over different life-stages and whether greater household wealth promotes better growth for low birth weight (LBW) children. Using longitudinal data from Young Lives, we analyzed associations between birth weight and physical growth and examined differences across ages and by household wealth for 3999 children from Ethiopia, India, Peru, and Vietnam. At 6-18 months, LBW children had 0.53-SD (Standard error [SE]: 0.08) lower HAZ. Over time, the gap between normal and LBW children narrowed significantly to 0.21-SD (SE: 0.05) and 0.24-SD (SE: 0.05) at 4-5 years and 7-8 years, respectively. Prenatal experiences are most salient in establishing the greatest height deficits within the first year. Although disparities in height are reduced in the first year, height differences at age 4-5 years remain at 7-8 years of age. Even among wealthier families, there was no recovery in height for LBW children during the first year and no catch-up growth for these children in later childhood. These findings suggest that prenatal conditions, reflected in birth weight, are more important in setting height trajectories in comparison to postnatal factors, which do not help children recover fully from early growth deficits.

We find that non-Western countries follow the lead of Western countries in some important respects but not in others. While non-Western countries brought their general revenues closer to Western levels and copied important features of Western consumption taxation including higher value added tax revenues and lower revenues from trade taxation, they failed to emulate the hallmark of 20th-century Western taxation: a strong and progressive personal income tax. The taxation trends are closely associated with socio-economic changes (as summarized by GDP per capita) and structural factors (as summarized by country size).

This leads to the puzzle of why states adopt tax incentives. Extant studies of tax incentive adoption overlook the fact that many countries have decentralized fiscal authority, allowing subnational governments to offer tax incentives. Public finance scholars argue that fiscal federalism intensifies tax competition among regions. Hence, drawing on the public finance scholarship, one may ask: Does fiscal decentralization lead to a race to the top among subnational governments and an oversupply of tax incentives in a country? This article argues that fiscal decentralization affects tax incentives in complex ways. When subnational governments are authorized to set tax policies, their politicians have economic and political incentives to engage in tax competition for mobile capital, providing more tax incentives in a country. However, the politicians are less likely to do so if they are held accountable and have to fund most expenditures through own-source tax revenues. An empirical analysis of over 50 developing countries in early 2000s produces robust supporting evidence. This research challenges both the view that fiscal decentralization is always beneficial and the view that horizontal competition invariably produces inefficiently low tax rates. The impact of fiscal decentralization on tax incentives and by implication, revenue mobilization depends on the design of the central-local government relations.","[Li, Quan] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Polit Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Li, Q (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Polit Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",,,,,,,,66,21,25,5,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Given that appropriate deployment decisions are essential to a program's effectiveness, a number of deployment priorities are generally included in most ASE guidelines. However, when implementing,the guidelines, most descriptions of deployment goals are so qualitative that they might have multiple quantitative interpretations, and thus affecting the identification of specific deployment considerations. In addition, limited research has been done to improve the process by which guidelines are implemented. Therefore, this paper proposes quantitative measures for an ASE program, in order to facilitate interpretation of the main ASE principles and improve deployment decisions. To illustrate the various types of high priority deployment considerations, a case study in the city of Edmonton in the province of Alberta, Canada is presented. It explores the deployment outcomes of the mobile photo enforcement (MPE) program in Edmonton, in relation to six priorities identified in the provincial enforcement guidelines. Two performance measures, spatial coverage and enforcement intensity, are assessed for priority sites and non-priority sites. Moreover, the distance halo effects of MPE are considered in the review of spatial coverage. All findings are visualized using Geographic Information Systems, such that high priority sites and coverage of these sites in the historical deployment can be visually assessed. A better understanding of the governing ASE guidelines and how to implement them can help enforcement agencies to improve decision-making and resource allocation, thereby increasing program effectiveness and efficiency.

The process of modernizing the Fire and Rescue Service has increased expectations of workforce diversification and of women more easily entering and progressing within the organization. However, participants' commentary testified to the difficulties faced when seeking recognition as a skilled woman in this context given the persistence of firefighter men as the occupational ideal type. Achieving recognition for both physical and non-physical skills remained an embodied, gendered and contested process and one that was not eased by promotion. Participants identified the heightened visibility that accompanied leadership as especially problematic.

Three competing hypotheses are considered: absolute, conditional and club convergence. The key result of the analysis is twofold. First, consistently with very recent evidence, absolute convergence is found in manufacturing as a whole. Second, convergence tendencies are sector specific. In particular, club convergence characterizes traditional and medium- technology compartments, while the absolute one qualifies high-tech productions. Overall, these findings support the view that cross-country labour productivity convergence might be hindered by the sub-optimal structural reallocation from nonconvergence to convergence activities. Moreover, as the clustering dynamics in traditional and medium-tech sectors is related either to physical capital stock or technological development, laggard economies should purse ad hoc catching-up strategies. Finally, the result of high tech provides supportive evidence for the theory of dynamic comparative advantages. Thus, it seems desirable that emerging countries enter into technology-intense markets and that they develop the necessary capabilities for exploiting such endogenous advantages.","[Dal Bianco, Silvia] London Metropolitan Univ, Econ, 84 Moorgate, London EC2M 6SQ, England",London Metropolitan University,"Dal Bianco, S (通讯作者)，London Metropolitan Univ, Econ, 84 Moorgate, London EC2M 6SQ, England.",s.dalbianco@londonmet.ac.uk,,,,,,,107,9,11,0,16,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The purpose of this study was to review, validate, specify, and prioritize Korea's strategic policies for pedestrian safety enhancement using the classification tree method to model pedestrian injury severities. The findings show that pedestrian age and movement type are the two primary variables contributing to pedestrian fatalities and severe injuries. Traffic operation, road class, crash location, driver violation, and at-fault vehicle type are all secondary variables associated with pedestrian fatalities and severe injuries. Factors that contributed to crashes were compared with strategic polices for senior zones and school zones, road safety facilities, safe walking environments, and legal obligations of the driver in order to understand why certain polices are ineffective versus effective. Consequently, this study provides prescriptive analysis and specific insights pertaining to strategic policies for pedestrian safety enhancements, which can be employed in other countries for the similar purpose. For further research, this study suggests combining several other data-mining techniques with nationwide data collection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using less biased sources I develop an alternative explanation for the Schuman declaration, which emphasizes broad societal preferences, institutional constraints and international interactions. I find that Monnet did play his cards well, but also that there is no reason to believe that his ideas were original, or that any other competent French planning commissioner would not have acted similarly.

Additionally, hours worked by individuals with diagnosed type 2 diabetes are 7 h lower per week for males and 8 h lower per week for females. Further, individuals with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes experience a drop in labor supply somewhat smaller but similar to their diagnosed counterparts.

Such a promotion scheme leads to tournament competition among local government leaders of the same level. We test the hypothesis of tournament competition by studying the spatial effects across Chinese prefectural-level cities. Employing spatial econometrics tools, we document a strong spatial effect for city-level total investment which fuels short-term economic growth. This spatial effect is shown to occur only for cities within the same province, but not for neighboring cities located in different provinces. We also find that within the same province, the spatial effect mainly exists for cities with similar economic ranking but not for cities that are geographically proximate. The spatial effect tends to diminish for city leaders who are close to the end of their political careers. These findings suggest that the spatial effect for investment is driven by strategic interactions among political rivals in tournament competition. We rule out alternative factors, such as economic spillovers and tax competition, as the key drivers of the observed spatial effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, most studies do not take into account transaction costs. Their existence implies that in fact traders might not be able to make abnormal profits. This paper examines whether or not anomalies such as intraday or time of the day effects give rise to exploitable profit opportunities by replicating the actions of traders. Specifically, the analysis is based on a trading robot which simulates their behaviour, and incorporates variable transaction costs (spreads). The results suggest that trading strategies aimed at exploiting daily patterns do not generate extra profits. Further, there are no significant differences between sub-periods (2005-2006-normal; 2007-2009-crisis; 2010-2011-post-crisis).","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, London UB8 3PH, England; [Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] CESifo, Berlin, Germany; [Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Gil-Alana, Luis] Univ Navarra, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain; [Plastun, Alex; Makarenko, Inna] Ukrainian Acad Banking, Sumy, Ukraine",Brunel University; Ifo Institut; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Navarra; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Sumy State University,"Caporale, GM (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, London UB8 3PH, England.",Guglielmo-Maria.Caporale@brunel.ac.uk,"Makarenko, Inna/P-3526-2014; Plastun, Alex/L-7631-2014; Makarenko, Inna/AAE-8453-2020","Makarenko, Inna/0000-0001-7326-5374; Plastun, Alex/0000-0001-8208-7135; Makarenko, Inna/0000-0001-7326-5374",,,,,31,17,17,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Two assumptions are made when estimating these indices: 1) that the house characteristics are unchanged between observed sales and 2) that the underlying shadow prices for those attributes are constant or change proportionally. The second assumption is the focus of this paper. First, using data from the American Housing Survey, we show that certain attribute prices in Chicago changed idiosyncratically between 1985 and 2011. These results confirm earlier reports of changing tastes and attribute prices. We show that such changes can be approximated in a hedonic model with a low order polynomial functional form. We find that a simple extension of the standard repeat sales methodology can be used to test for and estimate changes in characteristic prices attributable to changing tastes. Our results are of interest to all users of repeat sales indices, but especially those portfolio investors interested in estimating current values of homes securing loans in their portfolio to help manage delinquencies and defaults.","[Chen, Tao] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Hagey Hall Humanities, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Chen, Tao] Jianghan Univ, Big Data Res Ctr, 8 Sanjiaohu Rd, Wuhan 430056, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Harding, John P.] Univ Connecticut, 2100 Hillside Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Waterloo; Jianghan University; University of Connecticut,"Harding, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, 2100 Hillside Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",t66chen@uwaterloo.ca; john.harding@business.uconn.edu,,,Center for Real Estate and Urban Economic Studies at the University of Connecticut,Center for Real Estate and Urban Economic Studies at the University of Connecticut,The authors thank Stephen L.

Unlike previous models, we take into account the effects of geometry and the interaction with the demand structure. Models for predicting the bus in-vehicle time benefits of a median dual carriageway bus way against mixed traffic condition on 2 and 3 lanes roads are estimated using data from a case study in Santiago (Chile), using a bus travel time model empirically estimated and considering different base case situations, including mixed traffic operations and bus lanes. Results of the application show that the expected in-vehicle time savings of a median bus way might be reduced by access time losses due to increased walking distances and road crossing delays. Also, that net time benefits can vary significantly according to the base situation and the structure of demand considered. These findings point out to the need of including a wider set of impacts when studying the benefits of median busways, beyond in-vehicle time savings only. The empirical work presented here is completely based on passive data coming from GPS and smartcards, what makes easier and cheaper to conduct this type of analysis as well as to do it with a comprehensive scope at an early stage of the development of a BRT project. This framework can be extended to other types of dedicated bus lanes provided that a corresponding bus travel time savings model is available. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We develop a procedure that reframes the tracking problem as a regulator problem that is then used to simulate the deterministic, stochastic LQG, H-infinity, multiple-parameter minimax, and mixed stochastic/H-infinity control, for quarterly fiscal policy. We compare the results of the five different design structures within a closed-economy accelerator model using data for the United States for the period 1947-2012. When the consumption and investment tracking errors are more heavily emphasized, the H-infinity design renders the most aggressive fiscal policy, followed by the multiple-parameter minimax, mixed, LQG, and deterministic versions. When the control tracking errors are heavily weighted, the resulting fiscal policy is initially more aggressive under the multi-parameter specification than under the H-infinity and mixed designs. The results from both weighting schemes show that fiscal policy remains more aggressive under the robust designs than the deterministic model. The simulations show that the multi-parameter minimax and mixed designs provide a balancing compromise between the stochastic and robust methods when the worst-case concerns can be primarily limited to a subset of the state-space.","[Hudgins, David] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Business, Dept Decis Sci & Econ, OCNR 314,6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA; [Na, Joon] Linde Proc Plants Inc, 6100 South Yale Ave,Suite 1200, Tulsa, OK 74136 USA",Texas A&M University System,"Hudgins, D (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Coll Business, Dept Decis Sci & Econ, OCNR 314,6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA.",david.hudgins@tamucc.edu,,,,,,,32,9,9,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

He analytically characterizes all possible scenarios, showing how different the preferences of tourists (towards crowding) and residents (towards tourism) interact and affect the economic outcome. The paper shows that, when tourists are crowding-averse (crowding lovers), uncertainty leads to deterioration (improvement) of economic performance, while it does not affect performance at all when tourists are crowding-indifferent. However, assessing how this will be reflected in welfare changes is more complex, since it depends also on the degree of tourism aversion among local residents.","[Marsiglio, Simone] Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Marsiglio, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",simonem@uow.edu.au,"Marsiglio, Simone/K-2863-2012",,,,,,26,12,13,3,17,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Not withoutmerits, but considering the financial and eurozone crises fatally, such perspectives elide power relations and attendant contradictions and irrationalities that are constitutive of transatlantic integration itself. Regulation theory, which synthesizes the reformist ethos of Europe's postwar statist tradition and Marxism, and which has produced a considerable body of analysis of the EU published at the margins of EU scholarship, offers a compelling alternative that potentially overcomes these shortcomings. This article critically assesses how regulation theory has interpreted the single market, financial liberalization and EMU as a suppression of alternatives to neoliberal post-Fordism, or finance-led accumulation, in Europe. It argues that understanding the EU's current conjuncture of eurozone crisis management requires a neo-Gramscian extension of regulation theory, stressing transnational patterns of capitalist accumulation and power relations.","[Bieling, Hans-Juergen] Univ Tubingen, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Jaeger, Johannes] Univ Appl Sci BFI Vienna, Vienna, Austria; [Ryner, Magnus] Kings Coll London, London, England",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; University of London; King's College London,"Bieling, HJ (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Dept Polit Sci, Melanchthonstr 36, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",hans-juergen.bieling@uni-tuebingen.de,"Jäger, Johannes/AAW-9804-2021","Jäger, Johannes/0000-0003-2526-2675; Ryner, Magnus/0000-0002-7492-2986",,,,,71,29,32,2,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Therefore, the issue of labour market is in the centre of theoretical and empirical research. The aim of this paper is to determine the effects of five selected labour market institutions on the development of TFP in the member states of the European Union. In particular, by means of an endogenous growth model extended by institutions, we provide a verification of the following hypothesis: Labour market institutions have significant but, in average, more likely negative impact on the development of TFP in the European Union. To estimate the policy augmented productivity equation with a broad measure of TFP we use a panel data model with fixed effect. The analysis is executed on 19 member states of the European Union and covers the period of 1999-2013. Observations for productivity growth are calculated via growth accounting method. The results suggest a statistically significant effect of labour market institutions and confirm the validity of our hypothesis.","[Cekmeova, Petra] Masaryk Univ, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Cekmeová, P (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic.",441117@gmail.com,"Chovancová, Petra/JGM-3243-2023",,,,,,30,1,1,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,108,113,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500019,0

Importantly, different buyers in our setting can have different constraints on the sets of items they desire. Our mechanism is a sequential variant of two-part tariffs. Prior to our work, simple approximation mechanisms for such multi-buyer problems were known only for the special cases of all unit-demand or all additive value buyers. Our work expands upon and unifies long lines of work on unit-demand settings and additive settings. We employ the ex ante relaxation approach developed by Alaei [2011] for reducing a multiple-buyer mechanism design problem with an ex post supply constraint into single-buyer problems with ex ante supply constraints. Solving the single-agent problems requires us to significantly extend a decomposition technique developed in the context of additive values by Li and Yao [2013] and its extension to subadditive values by Rubinstein and Weinberg [2015].","[Chawla, Shuchi; Miller, J.

For modelling the project, we will use the EU methodology for assessing socio-economic evaluation of project utility by means of cost-benefit analysis issuing from Kaldor-Hicks social optimality test. Using the Maple program, the simulation of individual scenarios of nonconventional projects will be presented in 3D presentation and assessed by means of the value of the root function in relation to project parameters.

Different spatial dependence matrices are used to evaluate the stability of the estimated unemployment dynamics in the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and all their EU-neighbors. The analysis is performed at the NUTS2 level. Spatial econometrics and regional competitiveness paradigms are combined into a robust model describing unemployment dynamics. Alternative spatial structures (i.e. neighbor definitions) are used for verification of stability of the estimated model and its properties. Spatial approach to econometric analysis provides important additional insight and robustness to a potentially broad range of spatially defined unemployment analyses that may be carried out using regional (spatial) data.","[Formanek, Tomas; Husek, Roman] VSE Praha, FIS, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Formánek, T (通讯作者)，VSE Praha, FIS, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",formanek@vse.cz; husek@vse.cz,"Formanek, Tomas/Q-5973-2019; Formanek, Tomas/F-6872-2013","Formanek, Tomas/0000-0003-1638-7230; Formanek, Tomas/0000-0003-1638-7230",,,,,8,4,4,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,213,218,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500037,0

We obtained linear cost functions as dependencies of the numbers of beds vs numbers of patients by ordinary least squares. Then by corrected least squares we found relatively efficient regions that lie on deterministic cost frontiers. Kosice region in 2012 was cost efficient from the viewpoint of paediatric patients. In case of adult day surgery relatively the best region was Banska Bystrica region in 2012. This way we found that the overall number of excessive beds in paediatric (adult) day surgery during 2009 - 2013 was 869 (2366).

The objective of this research was to evaluate the best condition of FOE synthesis in fluidized bed reactor (FBR) using the immobilized lipase on modified hydrophobic matrix. Surface of Amberlite IRA 96 was modified with 2-phenylpropionaldehyde to obtain hydrophobic surface. Candida rugosa lipase was immobilized on the modified matrix. Subsequently, it was used for FOE synthesis in FBR system. Factors, such as reaction time, substrate flow rate, amount of water adsorbent, and substrate molar ratio were evaluated based on the conversion of oleic acid into FOE. Results from FTIR analysis showed that modified matrix had a peak at a specific wavelength similar to 1674 cm(-1). It indicated that a group of imine (-C=N-) occurred after surface modification. The highest adsorption of lipase was obtained after adsorption for 45 min (13.28 +/- 0.57 mg lipase/g matrix), which was equivalent to 52.95 +/- 1.67%. The lipase activity was 73.66 +/- 5.35 U/g matrix. The best FOE synthesis condition was obtained at flow rate of 0.4 mL/min, molecular sieve of 12 %, substrate molar ratio (fructose : oleic acid) 1: 4 for 48 h. FOE was confirmed by TLC and FT-IR analysis, which they had Rf 0.72 and specific wave number of similar to 1712 cm(-1), respectively.

A robust service system design is usually performed so that the design complies with specified scenarios by minimizing the maximal objective function of the individual instances corresponding with the particular scenarios. The min-max link-up constraints represent an undesirable burden in any integer programming problem due to bad convergence of branch-and-bound method.

From the perspective of origination and artistic features of Chu opera, this paper gives an analysis of the limitations in development of Chu opera and finally, and finally probes into the combination of Chu opera and music teaching in local universities for the purpose of support to progress of China's local musical culture.","[Jiao, Shuanghong] Hankou Coll, Dept Mus, Wuhan 430212, Peoples R China",,"Jiao, SH (通讯作者)，Hankou Coll, Dept Mus, Wuhan 430212, Peoples R China.",qjjsh@126.com,,,hubei province education scientific planning chu opera into the moment of its strategy research of college music class [2015GA060],hubei province education scientific planning chu opera into the moment of its strategy research of college music class,This work was supported by the key subject of 2015 in hubei province education scientific planning chu opera into the moment of its strategy research of college music class(project numbe: 2015GA060).,,5,0,0,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-263-3,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,85.0,,,,,,83,86,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BI0YD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000405302500022,0

Since the adoption of Directive 90/314/EEC, back in 1990, the market has also undergone considerable changes. In arranging the various components that make up a package holiday, a tour operator enters into contracts with airlines, coach companies, hoteliers and others since it is them who actually provide the transport and accommodation which feature in the package. However, tour operators are responsible for all the elements of the package and primary liability for anything which goes wrong rests with them. In other words, the tour operators face strict liability for any of the services, facilities or goods to be supplied as component parts of the package and are not able to mount a defence on the basis that the services, facilities or goods were supplied by others over whom they had no control. The new Package Travel Directive (EU) 2015/2302 adopted in November 2015 repeals the old Directive (EEC) 90/314 and aims at enhancing transparency and increasing legal certainty for travellers and tour operators alike. Having previously worked for two major Croatian tour operators with a considerable practical experience on this subject, in the following article the author will focus attention on the legal aspects of those involved in travel industry and packaged travel, be they tour operators, travel agents or travellers themselves.","[Klasic, Dario] Univ Cologne, Inst Air & Space Law, Fac Law, Albertus Magnus Pl, Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Klasic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Air & Space Law, Fac Law, Albertus Magnus Pl, Cologne, Germany.",dklasic@smail.uni-koeln.de,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,23,32,,,,,,10,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400003,0

The computed productivity is the value productivity, namely total value productivity and selected partial productivities. The value productivity is an important factor in achieving the enterprise objectives, especially shareholder value maximization. The paper works with productivity indicators based on the contemporary concept, ie. working with the concept of economic costs and economic profit as in the case of the indicator EVA. This contribution shows and compares differences in productivity levels among surveyed businesses, as well as various significant declines and subsequent various fast recovering. It is done both in terms of total value productivity, therefore for all inputs, as well as of main partial productivities. Inputs having similar strong and persistent decline in productivity as revenues had demonstrated small flexibility in the enterprise. It is a productivity decline guided with progression of these respective unit costs.

The paper explores related approaches throughout the different current sources in the body of knowledge. It uses the Web of Science data base and other key literature. The examination of these sources and the specification of the measurement of organisational leanness determine a new approach. This particular approach focuses on the ethnography at an automotive company and non-automotive company. The expected results of the application of this model explore the soft side of the level of leanness in the organisation.

This approach is able to deal with both weak and strong cross-sectional dependence in a flexible manner. Using a dataset of 26 OECD countries over 1970-2010, we provide satisfactory estimation results for the production technology parameters and the associated efficiency ranking of individual countries. We find a positive spillover effect on efficiency, supporting the hypothesis that knowledge spillover is more likely to be induced by technological proximity. Furthermore, our approach enables us to identify efficiency clubs endogenously.

Short-term markets and system operation have to accommodate for the different needs of renewable and conventional generation assets and flexibility options. This can be achieved by pooling resources over larger geographic areas through common auction platforms, realizing the full flexibility of different assets based on multi-part bids while efficiently allocating scarce network resources. For investment and re-investment choices different technology groups like wind and solar versus fossil fuel based generation may warrant a different treatment - reflecting differing levels of publicly accessible information, requirements for grid infrastructure, types of strategic choices relevant for the sector and shares of capital cost in overall generation costs.

Our research was based on the following information resources: data of the annual surveys of regional business education leaders over the period from 2010 to 2015; expert opinions; interviews with 'active learners' (managers and entrepreneurs). The results of the analysis revealed an increasing interest of managers in short-term training and the opposite tendency for long-term programs (MBA). Due to the economic instability, managers are both unable and unwilling to implement long-term strategies of educational behaviour on the individual and corporate levels. The priority of objectives of business 'survival' imposes a necessity to opt for education models which bring practical results fast. Short-term training is also more competitive because it is strongly connected with the regional business. On the contrary, strategic long-term training models, lacking such connection, become irrelevant and less valuable for the business audience.","[Notman, Olga] Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Notman, O (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",o.v.notman@urfu.ru,"Notman, Olga/C-9914-2018","Notman, Olga/0000-0002-3393-9933",,,,,10,4,4,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1344,1352,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100133,0

A case study was done on eight biogas stations in Jihomoravsky region. The data were obtained from real estate server at the beginning of 2. Q of 2016. Price of flats for sale was explained in the regression model by number of rooms, acreage and distance to the biogas station. Linear and log-linear relation was taken into account. As expected, the effect of the distance from biogas station on the flat prices is negative as its presence lowers the price by 0.15% according to linear regression model, or by 0.40% based on log-linear form of the model.","[Pechrova, Marie] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Dept Impacts Agr Policy, Manesova 75, Prague, Czech Republic; [Lohr, Vaclav] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat Technol, Kamycka 129, Prague, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Pechrová, M (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Dept Impacts Agr Policy, Manesova 75, Prague, Czech Republic.",pechrova.marie@uzei.cz; lohr@pef.czu.cz,"Lohr, Václav/S-8581-2016; Pechrová, Marie Šimpachová/X-8982-2018","Lohr, Václav/0000-0002-2688-4049;",,,,,13,1,1,0,3,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,647,652,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500111,0

As one of the forms of alternative care for providing the child with domestic environment, foster care is strongly advocated by the United Nations, Council of Europe and European Union. Being bound by the Convention on the Rights of the Child as well as other relevant international agreements, and being an EU Member State, Croatia is making efforts to improve the foster care for children as part of the wider social welfare system reform.

The outcome of several sociological research projects (arranged in 2012-2015 in Yugra) is the controversy between the numerous amount of educational services for adults, and their ignorance towards the demands of the specific segment of labour migrants. The existing fairly large market of educational services is not oriented towards the specifics of education for migrants as a particular target segment. The need for complex educational strategy for labour migrants based on the continuous learning process principle is discussed. The desired outcome of this process is the successful development of the Yugra region.","[Shuklina, Elena] Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira Str, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Shuklina, E (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira Str, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",shuklina_elena@mail.ru,"Shuklina, Elena/E-6113-2014","Shuklina, Elena/0000-0001-6478-4332",,,,,6,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1647,1655,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100163,0

It presents results of the author's research into 106 enterprises operating in the Mazovian region concerning the period 2010-2014. Four research hypotheses are postulated, concerning the dependence between size of an enterprise and frequency of its innovation activities, reasons for and limitations to implementing innovations by enterprises, and the most common types of innovations introduced to businesses. The research undertaken suggests small enterprises introduce innovations less frequently than medium-sized businesses do. Entrepreneurs normally state the following are the most common reasons for introducing innovations: expansion of the product range, improvement of product quality, increasing market share and improving competitiveness. Shortage of financial resources for such actions is the most frequently declared reason for not introducing innovations, on the other hand. Small and medium-sized enterprises primarily introduce changes that consist in improvement of existing products, introduction of a new product or of new marketing methods, including changes to product packaging, promotion or pricing.","[Wolak-Tuzimek, Anna] Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Econ & Legal Sci, Chrobrego31 St, PL-26600 Radom, Poland",Kazimierz Pulaski University of Technology & Humanities in Radom,"Wolak-Tuzimek, A (通讯作者)，Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Econ & Legal Sci, Chrobrego31 St, PL-26600 Radom, Poland.",awt@uthrad.pl,"Wolak-Tuzimek, Anna/AAK-6383-2021","Wolak-Tuzimek, Anna/0000-0002-2998-909X",,,,,15,14,14,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,2056,2065,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100201,0

While researching on the economic region levels and its areas, we paid attention to the population dynamics indexes, which we used in the comparativist methodology realization. According to the abovementioned, the main figures for analysis were determined: the number of population and its dynamics, natural movement of the population, division of the population into urban and rural, sexual structure of the population, age structure, life expectancy, population reproduction, migration, disease rate and income levels.

This article addresses this gap in knowledge via presenting an analysis of survey-based data collected from business people travelling by plane, train and car. Through disaggregating the data by travel mode, journey stage, technology use and task type the article provides a level of granular detail in the general patterns of business travellers' travel time behaviour not previously provided by other surveys. Utilizing the concept of affordances', the article shows how the type of work activities undertaken are shaped by the dynamic interaction between the characteristics in the travel environment, the type of work tasks undertaken and work technologies utilized in carrying out these tasks and the active choices of business travellers.","[Hislop, Donald] Univ Loughborough, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Axtell, Carolyn] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",Loughborough University; University of Sheffield,"Hislop, D (通讯作者)，Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",d.hislop@lboro.ac.uk,,,British Academy Small Grant [SG-52312],British Academy Small Grant,The data presented here were collected with the aid of a British Academy Small Grant (Grant Reference: SG-52312).,,27,6,7,1,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Aggregate data are, however, commonly used to estimate the New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC), which may very well yield erroneous results if price-setting behaviour is heterogeneous. In this paper, we therefore estimate the hybrid NKPC for the Euro Area using a novel sectoral data set containing quarterly observations from 1999Q1 to 2012Q1. We show that a positive relationship between inflation and real marginal cost cannot be established empirically for a majority of countries and sectors. We also perform a meta-analysis by combining the results of individual significance tests in order to assess the validity of the NKPC in each country across all sectors and in each sector across all countries. We find no empirical evidence for the NKPC in the Euro Area when this meta-analysis is used. Our results therefore raise doubts about the appropriateness of the NKPC for the analysis of inflation dynamics and monetary policy in the Euro Area.","Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Norkute, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",Milda.Norkute@nek.lu.se,,,"Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation [P2009-0189:1, P2014-0112:1]",Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,"The author would like to thank Fredrik N.G.

Analyzing a planning reform launched in the United Kingdom in the 1990s, I show that independent retailers were actually harmed by the creation of entry barriers against large stores. This is because the entry barriers created the incentive for large retail chains to invest in smaller and more centrally located formats, which competed more directly with independents and accelerated their decline. Overall, these findings suggest that restricting the entry of large stores may exert negative competitive effects on independent retailers.","[Sadun, Raffaella] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Ctr Econ Performance, NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Sadun, Raffaella] CEPR, London, England",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Sadun, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Ctr Econ Performance, NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Sadun, Raffaella/0000-0002-0987-8923",,,,,38,15,17,0,5,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

Defense consists of investing in resources that reduce the impact of an attack, and generates a negative externality to other governments, making their countries a more attractive objective for terrorists. In contrast, Prevention, which consists of investing in resources that reduce the ability of the terrorist organization to mount an attack, creates a positive externality by reducing the overall threat of terrorism for all. This interaction is captured using a simple Nested Prisoner's Dilemma game, with a single Nash equilibrium where both countries choose Defense. Due to the structure of this interaction, countries can benefit from coordination of policy choices, and international institutions (such as the UN) can be utilized to facilitate coordination by implementing agreements to share the burden of Prevention. We introduce an institution that implements a burden-sharing policy for Prevention, and investigate experimentally whether subjects coordinate on a cooperative strategy more frequently under different levels of cost sharing. In all treatments, burden sharing leaves the Prisoner's Dilemma structure and Nash equilibrium of the game unchanged. We compare three levels of burden sharing to a baseline in a between-subjects design, and find that burden sharing generates a non-linear effect on the choice of the efficient Prevention strategy and overall performance. Only an institution supporting a high level of mandatory burden sharing generates a significant improvement in the use of the Prevention strategy.","[Kass, Malcolm; Arce, Daniel] Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Fatas, Enrique] Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Eckel, Catherine] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; University of East Anglia; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Fatas, E (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",malcolmkass@utdallas.edu; e.fatas@uea.ac.uk,"Fatas, Enrique/ITV-7431-2023","Fatas, Enrique/0000-0002-0603-2156; Eckel, Catherine/0000-0003-1583-5214","National Science Foundation [BCS-0905060]; ESRC Network for Integrated Behavioral Sciences (NIBS); ESRC [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1356145] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ESRC Network for Integrated Behavioral Sciences (NIBS); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Experiments were conducted in the Center for Behavioral and Experimental Economic Science at the University of Texas at Dallas.

This neat categorization fails to capture the complicated, multiscalarity' of business and overall civil society's role in regional governance. Drawing insights from social constructivism and empirical evidence from fieldwork conducted in 2012 and 2013 on the interactions between the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and region-wide business associations and advocacy networks since the early 1990s, this article shows that although African business groups are relatively new actors at the regional stage, their impact on regional governance is substantial. This is not only in terms of getting governments to adopt particular policies or the ability to hold the state accountable, as functional institutionalists might argue, but also in terms of the regional socialization effects, namely the willingness and ability to frame issues that influence the choices of political decision-makers. Business regional governance roles also straddle competing conventional roles, and sometimes counter the neoliberal vision of regional integration, even among those that owe their emergence to regional organizations. The study also challenges the pervasive view of business actors (especially in Africa) as simply profit-seekers by highlighting the ways business actors have deployed and acted on principled beliefs about regional identity collectively or individually to forge denser and relatively effective policy coalitions that signal unfolding changes in the direction of regional policy in Africa.","[Iheduru, Okechukwu C.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Polit & Global Studies, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Iheduru, OC (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Polit & Global Studies, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",okey.iheduru@asu.edu,,,,,,,95,4,5,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This information is then exploited to restrict the oil price response in a vector autoregression. Impulse responses suggest that such shocks reduce output and raise prices.

The main feature of the model is to allow asymmetries in the leverage effect as well as mean and volatility. In the model the asymmetric effect is modeled by a threshold nonlinear structure that the two regimes are determined by the sign of the past returns. The model parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) method based on the efficient importance sampling (EIS) technique. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to examine the accuracy and finite sample properties of the proposed methodology. The EIS-based ML (EIS-ML) method shows good performance according to the Monte Carlo results. The proposed model and methodology are applied to two stock market indices for China. Strong evidence of the mean and volatility asymmetries is detected in Chinese stock market. Moreover, asymmetries in the volatility persistence and leverage effect are also discovered. The log-likelihood and Akaike information criterion (AIC) suggest evidence in favor of the proposed model. In addition, model diagnostics suggest that the proposed model performs relatively well in capturing the key features of the data. Finally, we compare models in a Value at Risk (VaR) study. The results show that the proposed model can yield more accurate VaR estimates than the alternatives.","[Wu, Xin-Yu; Zhou, Hai-Lin] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China",Anhui University of Finance & Economics,"Wu, XY (通讯作者)，Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China.",xywuchn@gmail.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71101001]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [14YJC790133]; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province of China [1408085QG139]; Anhui Province College Excellent Young Talents Fund of China [2013SQRW025ZD],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province); Anhui Province College Excellent Young Talents Fund of China,"We would like to thank the editor, Bruce Mizrach, and an anonymous referee for their insightful and helpful comments and suggestions that greatly improved the paper.

Naive estimates of MWTP, however, may be biased as a result of spatial dependence, spatial correlation, and/or spatially endogenous variables. In this paper we discuss a class of spatial autoregressive models that control for these spatial effects, and apply them to sample data collected for the Atlanta, Georgia housing market. We provide evidence that a general-to-specific model selection methodology that relies on the generality of the spatial Durbin model (SDM) should be preferred to the classical specific-to-general methodology that begins with an assumption of no spatial effects. We show that applying the SDM raises the estimate of MWTP for transit proximity in Atlanta but also widens its confidence interval, relative to ordinary linear regression. This finding may have implications for risk estimations in land value capture forecasts and transportation policy decisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The methodology provides a relevant contribution to the previous studies since it highlights the complex interaction between the level and composition of satisfaction, negative social safety experiences (NSSEs), urban settings, and the PT mode used. Overall, PT users see the service attributes on-time performance, travel speed, and service frequency as the most important, followed by personnel/driver behaviour and vehicle tidiness. A generic policy aimed at achieving these attributes may yield favourable results with respect to satisfaction. Further, we demonstrate the influence of differences in customer characteristics on satisfaction. A policy aimed at increasing the service frequency and putting new vehicles into operation will probably lead specifically to more satisfied older people (>65), passengers travelling by regional train, and people living in dense urban areas. These findings may be of help to PTAs intending to exert an influence on the actions of PT operators, for instance by using them as a measuring rod in incentive contracts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Although tourism causes negative impacts on the environment, the welfare benefit it enjoys (in terms of consumer surplus) should be considered while taking natural resources management decisions on Maduganga. The study shows that the value of the annual welfare benefit at Maduganga is about SLR 19.96 million, but the total economic value could be many times higher than this. However, the present value of non-market benefits from preserving the site remains at a figure of SLR 199.6 million per year. The revenue from Maduganga could be maximized if the passenger boating fee were raised to SLR 378.56. It is estimated that this may reduce the present number of visitors by 45%, but enhance total revenue by 294%.

Absolute and relative disparities at the provincial level of inbound tourism in China tended to decrease during the 1990s. From 2001 to 2010, the relative disparities gradually decreased, whereas the absolute difference slightly increased. The overall regional disparity in the tourism development level exhibits a non-polarized and unbalanced development tendency along with the emergence of new, secondary tourism economic growth centres.

This finding has significant implications for the pricing of electricity futures since it highlights for the first time the role of carbon market uncertainties as a main determinant of the relationship between spot and futures electricity prices in Europe.

Compared to carbon trading, these policies lead to large shifts in agricultural activity and unexpected social costs. We simulate the 2022 Federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and find that energy crop production increases by 39 million acres. Land-use costs from erosion and habitat loss are between $277 and $693 million A low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) and ethanol subsidies have similar effects while costs under an equivalent cap and trade (CAT) system are essentially zero. In addition, the alternatives to CAT magnify errors in assigning emissions rates to fuels and can over or under-incentivize innovation. These results highlight the potential negative effects of the RFS, LCFS and subsidies, effects that would be less severe under a CAT policy.","[Holland, Stephen P.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA; [Hughes, Jonathan E.] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Knittel, Christopher R.] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Energy Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Holland, Stephen P.; Knittel, Christopher R.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Parker, Nathan C.] Univ Calif Davis, Inst Transportat Studies, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Hughes, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",jonathan.e.hughes@colorado.edu,"Parker, Nathan/JXX-6460-2024",,,,,,51,12,12,3,61,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2015,36.0,3,,,,,35,74,,10.5547/01956574.36.3.shol,0.0,,,40,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CK8CN,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356466100002,0

We consider both the standard setting with strict preferences and the full preference domain which allows for indifference. Two solidarity properties drive our investigation: Welfare dominance under preference replacement, which says that when the preferences of one agent change, the other agents all weakly gain or all weakly lose; and population monotonicity, which requires the same conclusion when one agent leaves. We identify the families of rules satisfying these properties on each preference domain. Additionally requiring efficiency characterizes the consensus rules in each case. We also relate welfare dominance to other properties. Two results highlight the role of indifference: Welfare dominance implies anonymity when preferences are strict, but not otherwise; group strategy-proofness implies welfare dominance when indifference is allowed, but not otherwise. Finally, we introduce a duality operator which structures the space of rules and extends our results to a model in which rules may select neither alternative. Only in this case are our solidarity properties consistent with neutrality.","Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Harless, P (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",pdharless@gmail.com,,"Harless, Patrick/0000-0002-1981-478X",,,,,22,7,8,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2015,45.0,1,,,,,97,121,,10.1007/s00355-014-0868-x,0.0,,,25,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CN1ZL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358219600005,0

In this paper, we propose a new methodology to study the spatial dynamics of firm demography making use of such rich source of information. Exploiting the techniques of stochastic spatial point processes (Diggle, Statistical analysis of spatial point patterns, 2003), it is indeed possible to model the firm birth, growth and death explaining the behavior of the individual economic agent. We consider the spatial distribution of the economic activities as the result of a dynamic process occurring in space and time, and we model the micro-spatial patterns as single realizations of marked space-time survival point processes (Rathbun and Cressie, J Am Stat Assoc 89:1164-1174, 1994). Within such a methodological framework firms are created at some random location and some point of time and then operate, grow, and attract (or repulse) the localization of other firms in their neighborhood. The proposed model is fitted to some empirical data on firms' locations sourced from the ASIA harmonised archive of the Italian National Institute of Statistics. The empirical analysis reveals the presence of local competition behavior in firm creation among small retail food stores, thus shedding light on the phenomena of firm demography.","[Arbia, Giuseppe] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Stat, Rome, Italy; [Cella, Patrizia] Italian Natl Inst Stat ISTAT, Rome, Italy; [Espa, Giuseppe; Giuliani, Diego] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Trento, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli; University of Trento,"Arbia, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Stat, Rome, Italy.",giuseppe.arbia@rm.unicatt.it,"arbia, giuseppe/AAD-1772-2022","Giuliani, Diego/0000-0002-7198-6714",,,,,32,16,16,0,21,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

By using the new national accounts data, over the period 1861-2012, we were able to make Italy the third country to have a historical test of the hybrid Phillips curve (in which both the new Keynesian and the backward-looking Phillips curves are tested), together with the UK and the US. How do economic growth and prices interact in Italy's different stages of economic growth? Unlike the US and the UK, where said interaction was already operating in mid-19th century, in Italy the link between inflation and the economic cycle emerged only after the First World War. We argue that this can be explained owing to Italy's different position in the international economic system and the way foreign conditioning factors (the exchange-rate regime and innovation in transportation) influenced the Italian industrialization. Before the First World War, deflation was imported. This turned out to be compatible with some GDP growth, insofar as the deflationist macroeconomic setting favoured capital inflows and technological upgrading. Whereas, from the First World War until the creation of a common European currency, price variations were mainly a consequence of national policies and domestic conditions: the trade-off with the GDP cycle is now manifest, both in the periods of deflation (the interwar years) and in those of inflation (the second half of the twentieth century). Our findings may also have important implications for present day, since price movements are once again, as in the liberal age, largely imported. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
