The gamma irradiated and grafted buds were grown in commercial nurseries and then transplanted in 2009 to a field trial with 4500 hybrid mandarins, 1200 clementines and 2500 lemons, in Pomaire, Chile (33 degrees 39'S, 71 degrees 10'W). First evaluations of fruit seed content were made between 2010 and 2011. Early productions were achieved by the use of high density planting, minimal pruning managements, fertirrigation and enhancement of cross pollination using 10 to 12 hives/ha. After 2 harvest seasons, most phenotypical variations have been observed in lemons, obtaining 164 seedless selections, 4 thornless selections and a different fruit shape and compact selection interesting for ornamental purposes. In the case of mandarins, 14 individuals have been found as seedless selections and an individual shows narrow leaves, kumquat type fruit with low seed production. Techniques used in this program allow shortening in 5 years the time spent obtaining new citrus varieties. The stability of mutations detected is being evaluated and new commercial field trials will be established with the selected materials.","[Jose Montanola, Maria; Galaz, Andrea; Gambardella, Marina; Martiz, Johanna] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Agron & Ingn Forestal, Dept Fruticultura & Enol, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Montañola, MJ (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Agron & Ingn Forestal, Dept Fruticultura & Enol, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile.",mmontano@uc.cl,"Gambardella, Marina/ISU-0292-2023",Montanola/0000-0002-7463-0844,,,,,8,0,0,0,12,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,543,548,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600068,0

These undertakings are nested in direct and wider institutional contexts that determine many of the opportunities and limitations that apply to the local situation. In addition, locally, there is an interplay between the biophysical characteristics of the region, the social profile of groups contributing to fruit fly risk and the local management group. There is a need for local 'rules of the game' to meet growers' FF control objectives, such as gaining and protecting access to lucrative markets, and to overcome social challenges. This paper presents the preliminary findings from two Australian case studies of AWM to control Queensland fruit fly. Findings are combined with some aspects of socio-ecological systems literature to better understand the social and institutional aspects of industry-driven FF AWM programs. These issues are overlooked in AWM related literature, which predominantly focuses on the biophysical and technical aspects of FF control. This paper explains the need to incorporate concepts such as adaptive management, the need for trade-offs to achieve robust programs and that these come at a cost that is easily overlooked in benefit cost analysis of FF AWM programs.","[Kruger, H.

When it comes to our country, it is all about grandmothers' cooking. Grandmothers are recognized as the highest authority when it comes to cooking. They have lived though hard times and devoted their lives to feeding their husbands and children. When they are gone, valuable links with the past will vanish with them unless their children or grandchildren take time to learn from them. Therefore, their recipes represent a time capsule of generations gone by, but not only from kitchens. A very precious source of information, private collections of handwritten recipes passed down from generation to generation, deserve serious study. There is, namely, a strong connection between the home cookbooks and their historical and social framework. This paper presents the first part of the private collection of recipes collected and written by two or more female family members who according to some sources served at Nustar nobility mansion (Khuen-Belasi) at the end of the 19th and in the beginning of the 20th century. Personal recipe collections may be considered not only as texts, but also as artifacts, which leads to a material culture approach. This methodology calls for inductive research, including a three-step process of description, induction and speculation. Establishment of a historical, geographical and cultural context for each collection allows the scholar to formulate an appropriate hypothesis and test for conclusions. To demonstrate this process, this paper describes the step-by-step implementation of this methodology with a specific example.

Digital knowledge, increasing number of information and standing innovations put more and more stress on leaders and their capabilities. Turbulent environment, changes and new challenges create a new generation of employees, so called generation Y. The different approach to work, the different communication style and more emphasis on the balance between work and family life are the main characteristics of generation Y.

Data on yields, prices, marketing fees and surcharges were collected. The production systems were grouped by size as the most important differentiating factor. Four different production systems were established from small to very large. Results show that larger production systems are equipped with bigger machinery and more advanced technologies. Tillage, fertilisation, plant protection and irrigation were similar. Economies of scale can be observed through mechanisation and labour cost decreased with production volume.

Despite the rigidity and soundness, theoretical models proposed in extant literature can hardly be applied directly to real market data, due to their assumptions being far away from reality. On the other hand, empirical studies of ramping manipulation still lack guidance and support from theories that can better reflect ramping details in practice. This paper addresses this gap by constructing a theoretical model that is closely linked to practical detection, in the framework of behavioral finance. New insights into concrete ramping manipulation tricks are also contributed to the literature. The potential of the model for manipulation detection is demonstrated by applying it to the two most infamous manipulation cases in the history of Chinese stock market.","[Liu, Ke; Lai, Kin Keung] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Management Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yen, Jerome] Tung Wah Coll, Dept Finance & Econ, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Qing] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Int Business Sch, Xian, Shanxi, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong; Tung Wah College; Shaanxi Normal University,"Liu, K (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Management Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",zrkcapital@126.com; mskklai@cityu.edu.hk; risksolution@gmail.com; ZQ-Lab-NCI@163.com,"Zhu, Qing/C-2057-2018; Lai, Kin Keung/AEB-4278-2022","Zhu, Qing/0000-0003-2262-2743; Lai, Kin Keung/0000-0003-0014-2095; Lai, Kin Keung/0000-0003-1478-4996",,,,,19,0,0,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Tourism management literature has recently showed increasing interest in exploring the potential offered by the smart city concept, mainly conceived as the integrated use of ICT solutions, for achieving higher competitiveness. However, the pure adoption of innovative technologies is likely to be ineffective without adequate governance structures and processes that are required for ensuring the commitment and effective coordination and integration of firms, government and communities towards a holistic smart-oriented development plan for the tourism destination. This paper aims at bridging the smart city paradigm with the destination governance literature: the elaboration of a smart tourism destination governance process framework provides a valuable contribution for understanding how to effectively apply smartness principles for increasing the sustainable competitiveness of the destination beyond the mere technology dimension, making explicit the role of collaborative structures, user-driven service, social innovation and local community involvement. Design/methodology/approach - We draw on a critical review of the literature on destination governance and smart cities and tourism to identify the main temporal stages and the crucial actions to take in each stage for designing a smart tourism destination governance. The model makes explicit the linkages existing between relevant theories and all the identified stages of the development pathway for implementing an effective tourism destination smart governance model. For each stage the principles of a smart logic are integrated into the model, being used to define the specific content and form of actions to be taken to move along the destination journey towards smartness. Originality/value - This paper contributes to fill a relevant gap in the literature on tourism management by offering an original and integrative perspective for designing and implementing an effective smart tourism destination governance model. Practical implications - This framework is a flexible tool in the hands of destination managers for increasing the destination competitiveness; it shows how to match the design of governance structures and processes with the destination context, especially in terms of relational and knowledge capital of relevant stakeholders and implement smartness principles for its development following an incremental step by step logic.","[Luisa, Errichiello; Micera, Roberto] CNR, Natl Res Council, Inst Res Innovat & Serv Dev IRISS, I-80125 Naples, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca su Innovazione e Servizi per lo Sviluppo (IRISS-CNR),"Micera, R (通讯作者)，CNR, Natl Res Council, Inst Res Innovat & Serv Dev IRISS, Via Guglielmo Sanfelice 8, I-80125 Naples, Italy.",,"Micera, Roberto/C-1071-2015; errichiello, luisa/AAS-5344-2020","Micera, Roberto/0000-0002-3659-052X;",,,,,48,6,6,4,37,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2179,2191,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200171,0

It is possible to induce polyploids in embryogenic calli or cell suspensions by using antimitotics. Embryogenic calli may be obtained from unfertilized, or fertilized ovules, or from the nucellus. Aiming to establish suspension-cell cultures for further treatment with antimitotics, ovules of 'Ponkan', 'Montenegrina', 'Mexerica-do-Rio' and 'Cravo' tangerines were used. Two experiments were carried out. After asepsis in sodium hypochlorite (3: 1) solution, the ovules were inoculated on Petri dishes containing MT basal medium. In the first experiment, the ovules were cultivated on a growth-regulator free basal medium or with growth regulators BAP (5.0 or 10.0 mg L-1), KIN (5.0 or 10.0 mg L-1) or 2,4-D (1.0 or 2.0 mg L-1). The percentage of responsive explants was evaluated after three months. For the second experiment, the ovules were inoculated in MT basal medium supplied with 5.0 mg L-1 kinetin. After two months, the percentage of embryogenic calli and somatic embryos was recorded. All cultures were subcultivated every four weeks. In the first experiment, the induction of calli from ovules occurred on growth-regulator free basal medium in all studied cultivars. 'Montenegrina' ovules showed the largest percentage of responsive explants (35%) on growth-regulator free basal medium. The second experiment of calli and embryo induction occurred in the eighth week. 'Mexerica-do-Rio', 'Cravo', 'Ponkan' and 'Montenegrina' presented 25, 35, 15, and 9% calli, respectively. Somatic embryos developed rapidly. 'Ponkan' and 'Montenegrina' presented the highest percentage of somatic embryos, 45 and 30%, respectively. The type and concentration of plant-growth regulators, and the cultivar used, may have influenced embryogenic callus induction. The different cultivars used presented different responses to the induction of calli and somatic embryos.","[Machado, Marlia P.; Biasi, Luiz A.] Univ Fed Parana, Lab Micropropagacao Plantas, BR-80060000 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [De Bona, Claudine M.] Inst Agron Parana, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Parana; Instituto Agronomico de Campinas (IAC),"Machado, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Parana, Lab Micropropagacao Plantas, BR-80060000 Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.",ma_rilia10@hotmail.com,"Biasi, Luiz A/C-5345-2013; Biasi, Luiz Antonio/HKF-7052-2023","Biasi, Luiz Antonio/0000-0002-3479-8925; Pereira Machado, Marilia/0000-0002-3209-4780",,,,,12,1,1,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,657,661,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600082,0

The aim of the article is to assess the significance and market potential of this segment, as well as create a complete description of this segment by proposing adequate marketing approaches with emphasis on distribution channels. Typology of Singles has not been yet well defined and foreign research outputs differ in certain aspects. Paper determinates the theoretical concept of consumer buying behaviour and distribution policy in the introductory section. The major part of paper is devoted to primary marketing research. For purpose of collecting data, the method of questioning (combination of off-line and on-line approach) was chosen with the use of social networks. The questionnaire was given to 390 respondents living in the three largest cities in the Czech Republic. The data were analysed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software. The sub-segments of the target group have been formed, characterized and named on the basis of cluster analysis (data processed in analytical program SPSS). This paper describes only a partial output of the primary marketing research with focus on purchasing habits and the use of distribution channels for the defined segment. Generally, it can be said that the goal of marketing research was to evaluate the behaviour of Czech singles in the following areas: tailor-made products, healthy lifestyle, physical environment, distribution channels, the phenomenon of time, branded and domestic goods preferences. Finally, paper determines suitable marketing recommendations in the area of distribution policy, which could be put into practice.","[Matusinska, Katerina; Klepek, Martin] Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance, Opava, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Matusínská, K (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance, Opava, Czech Republic.",,"Matusinska, Katerina/ABG-2950-2020; Klepek, Martin/AAB-6743-2022; Klepek, Martin/AAJ-7774-2021","Matusinska, Katerina/0000-0002-0957-2860; Klepek, Martin/0000-0003-4058-156X; Klepek, Martin/0000-0003-4058-156X",,,,,9,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,691,698,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400088,0

However the profitability of Spanish citrus orchards is threatened by the globalization of markets which has led Spanish citrus growers to be interested in new cultivars in order to obtain greater benefits, and to be more competitive by improving some aspects of the crop and marketing such as productivity, fruit quality and avoiding the concentration of the supply. This study was carried out to evaluate the yield and fruit quality of 'Navelina' and 'Fukumoto', two early ripening sweet orange cultivars, in Andalusia (Spain). The experimental field was established in June, 2006, in a randomized block design, and was located in western Andalusia (Huelva), with 'Carrizo' citrange as rootstock and 'Valencia Late Frost' as interstock, being therefore a double- budded plantation. Several parameters were evaluated during the 2010 season: yield and fruit quality (size, weight, shape, external fruit color, juice content, total soluble solids concentration, total acids concentration and soluble solids/acid ratio). The results showed significant differences between 'Navelina' and 'Fukumoto' in fruit quality. Thus, 'Fukumoto' had more attractive fruit color, while 'Navelina' had more rounded fruits, as a result of a higher height. Eventually, 'Navelina' and 'Fukumoto' produced similar yields.","[Merino, Carlos; Hervalejo, Aurea; Salguero, Arturo; Gonzalez, David; Arenas-Arenas, Francisco J.] Ctr IFAPA Las Torres Tomejil, Inst Invest & Formac Agr & Pesquera Consejeria Ag, Seville, Spain",,"Merino, C (通讯作者)，Ctr IFAPA Las Torres Tomejil, Inst Invest & Formac Agr & Pesquera Consejeria Ag, Seville, Spain.",carlos.merino.luna.ext@juntadeandalucia.es,"Gonzalez, David/IPU-3884-2023; Arenas-Arenas, Francisco José/AAO-1625-2021; GONZALEZ, DAVID/JDD-2892-2023; Merino-Luna, Carlos/AAQ-3838-2021","Merino-Luna, Carlos/0000-0002-8667-3278; Hervalejo, Aurea/0000-0002-7852-9196",,,,,3,3,3,0,1,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,255,259,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600029,0

Exploration, drilling and extraction are associated with direct increases in employment and income in the energy industry, but little is known about the impacts on other parts of local economies. Increased energy sector employment and income can have positive spillover effects through increased purchases of intermediate goods and induced local spending. Negative spillover effects can occur through rising local factor and goods prices and adverse effects on the local area quality of life. Therefore, this paper examines the net economic impacts of oil and gas production from shale formations for key shale oil and gas producing areas in Arkansas, North Dakota and Pennsylvania. The synthetic control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003; Abadie et al., 2010) is used to establish a baseline projection for the local economies in the absence of increased energy development, allowing for estimation of the net regional economic effects of increased shale oil and gas production.

The goal was realized by performing a strict experiment. Celeriac (Diamant cultivar) was the test plant. A controlled-release fertilizer, with NPK content of 18%, 5% and 11%, was used for fertilization. Moreover, the following conventional fertilizers were used: ammonium nitrate, granular triple superphosphate, and potassium salt. The efficiency of the fertilization was evaluated by calculating the following indices: agronomic effectiveness, productivity coefficient and removal efficiency. The most favourable productivity coefficient and agronomic effectiveness were reached when 300 and 400 kg of the slow-acting fertilizer was used along with additional fertilization with ammonium nitrate, and this variant of fertilization under conditions of conducting the experiment would be optimal. In the conventionally fertilized treatments, values of these parameters were several times lower. That is why measures that improve the efficiency of production may bring positive results. Results of the conducted research indicate that optimization of fertilization under conditions of intensive production may significantly increase the efficiency of production. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Until recently it has been considered to be of little economic relevance. Today cereal insects develop better, thanks to the climate warming, simplification of agricultural techniques and extensive farming in large areas. One of the most pervasive species is leaf miners from the Agromyzidae family, which larvae feed on inner side of the cereal leaves. In Poland there is more than a dozen species of leaf miners (Walczak 1995). They may occur locally in large numbers, and cause substantial damage to the crops which reduce quality and quantity of the harvest. Larvae of the leaf miner feed on the parenchyma, causing damages (so-called mines). Effective methodology of fighting the insects with chemical means have not been developed yet. Studies of integrated methods of cereals protection carried out so far, have shown that a good practical method of chemical signaling is to control the number of adults trapped on yellow traps. Monitoring of cereal leaf miner flights in winter wheat was carried out in Slupia Wielka and Baborowko (Greater Poland Voivodeship) in the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 growing seasons. Yellow traps were placed above the tops of wheat during vegetation period. The number of damaged wheat stems was recorded. Fluctuations in weather conditions during the research affected the dynamics of leaf miner flies considerably.

Implementation of these measures needs sensitive and specific methods to discriminate between SP and MS variants in the viral populations. We developed a quantitative real-time RT-PCR method using Taqman locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes that enabled quantification of SP and MS variants in natural CTV populations. Here we used this method to monitor the evolution of the CTV population in Pineapple sweet orange plants pre-inoculated with a MS (T32) or a SP (T318) isolate, and then challenge-inoculated with budsticks infected with a SP or a MS isolate, respectively. While control plants singly inoculated with T32 or T318 only contained the cognate CTV variant in successive flushes, the plants doubly inoculated contained the two sequence variants in tissues derived from both the receptor plant and the inoculum budstick, with no strain impairing systemic invasion by the other. The relative amount of T32 and T318 variants in the co-infected plants differed between flushes. The co-infected plants showed stem pitting symptoms similar to those of plants inoculated only with T318, whereas control plants inoculated only with T32 or non-inoculated remained symptomless.

However, since 2010, Russia faced an acute problem of bankruptcies tour operators. For four years, 45 companies went bankrupt, and the damage amounted to more than 7 billion rubles, which fell to about 130 thousand people, the beginning of the transformation of the tourist market, and consumers are essentially lost confidence in the producers of tourism services. The article presents the results of the collection of information on the bankruptcy of tourist operators in Russia since 2010 by parameters such as the age of the company, timing and causes of bankruptcies, the number of customers affected, the damage to customers, compensation for harm caused to consumers, the size of financial guarantee companies. The materials collected were tabulated and compiled them dynamic graphs by quarters. The largest number of bankrupt firms account for a third and fourth quarter of 2011 (7 companies) and 2014 (21 firms). The greatest damage to consumers of tourism services has suffered in the fourth quarter of 2010 (1.5 billion rubles), the first quarter of 2012 (0.6 billion rubles) and the third quarter of 2014 (more than 4.1 billion rubles). Almost 80% of affected customers travel companies accounted for the 3rd quarter 2014. Based on the analysis, problems were identified tourism industry of Russia and also indicated ways to solve them, and the further development of tourism in the country. To conduct the study used a situational and systemic approaches and methods of mathematics and statistics, survey, comparison, analysis and synthesis, abstraction, induction and deduction. The findings reveal the current state, problems and prospects of development of the sphere of organized tourism of the Russian Federation, which can be the foundation for sound public policy in this area, as well as the choice of strategic directions of development of tourist business in Russia.","[Sarancha, Mikhail] Russian State Univ Tourism & Serv, Pushchino, Russia",Russian State University of Tourism & Service,"Sarancha, M (通讯作者)，Russian State Univ Tourism & Serv, Pushchino, Russia.",,"Sarancha, Mikhail/M-8578-2016","Sarancha, Mikhail/0000-0003-4394-0556",,,,,8,1,1,0,0,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,907,913,,,,,,7,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400116,0

Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband are analyzed in relation to one of the traditional attitudes of the party since the 1950s. It is argued that two trends in attitudes to European integration among Labour leaders can be identified. One is wariness of European integration for fear that Britain could lose its Commonwealth links and its global outlook. The other is seeing strong engagement in the European Community as crucial to Britain's political and economic future. Blair followed these steps, at least rhetorically, in aiming to strengthen British leadership in the EU. Brown and Miliband, though sharing a broad support for the EU, both emphasized the failings of the EU and shared their earlier predecessors' preference for a global' Britain.

Despite the development of molecular protocols for DNA microbial community isolation, there are still many drawbacks dependent of samples composition, and even the commercially available genomic isolation kits have significant limitations in recovering high genomic DNA amounts, especially from soil samples. Our study is aiming to compare and optimize a total microbial community DNA isolation protocol from polluted soil samples, estimating the amount and the purity of genomic DNA per g of soil, versus time requirements for each protocol, taking under consideration that our soil samples have a high content of humic acids. We checked several protocols for total DNA extraction, CTAB based, including a specific Kit for Soil DNA Isolation Kit NorgenBiotek. We estimated the time needed for each protocol, the amount of the DNA per gram of polluted soil, proteins and RNA contamination grade, by spectrophotometric analysis, but also the grade of PCR amplification inhibition. The most efficient method for our soil samples with high content of humic acid, suitable for further molecular analyses was the total DNA microbial community sample retrieved from Sagova et al. (2008) based protocol, with several adjustments. This protocol will be valuable for molecular analysis on microbial community profiling from environmental samples, especially from polluted soils.

On the other hand, special attention has been paid from the human resource management (HRM) field to the link between high performance work systems (HPWSs) and performance. The main objectives of this research are: firstly, to determine whether the utilization of an HPWS exerts a positive influence on OA; secondly, to know the extent to which HPWSs and OA contribute to organizational performance; thirdly, to verify the potential mediating role played by OA on the HPWS-performance relationship. Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical model and the hypotheses proposed were tested using a sample of 100 Spanish hotels. A questionnaire pre-tested by academics and professional experts and sent online to the Human Resource Manager was used to collect information. The data analysis method used was that of Partial Least Squares (PLS). Originality/value - This paper represents a valuable contribution to the literature in several ways. Firstly, this research advances in the understanding the factors that stimulate the OA. It determines the extent to which HRM influences organizations to develop exploration and exploitation learning. This micro approach about the OA complements the current literature about this topic. Secondly, this paper provides empirical evidence on the relationship between OA and performance. And thirdly, our findings demonstrate that the relationship between HPWSs and performance is not direct. This relationship is mediated by OA. This conclusion can be a reference for further research in this area. Practical implications - The practical implications are the following. OA is a decisive element in generating competitive advantages. The ability of the firm to follow, at the same time, exploration and exploitation learning, has a positive effect on organizational performance. However, the managers must be aware that the use of an HPWS is a key antecedent factor in this process. Therefore, those organizations which articulate a complementary group of human resource management practices will improve the firm's capacity to simultaneously carry out exploitation and exploration activities, essentially because they develop a suitable context which encourages workers to the learning exploitation, on the one hand and, furthermore, boosts the support of learning exploration. The managers should include the basic practices that configure an HPWS (i.e. comprehensive staffing; extensive training; development performance appraisal; and equitable reward systems).","[Ubeda-Garcia, Mercedes; Claver-Cortes, Enrique; Marco-Lajara, Bartolome; Zaragoza-Saez, Patrocinio] Univ Alicante, Dept Management, E-03080 Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Ubeda-García, M (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Dept Management, Campus San Vicente del Raspeig S-N, E-03080 Alicante, Spain.",,"Claver-Cortés, Enrique/AAC-5901-2020; Ubeda-García, Mercedes/AAA-1724-2019; MARCO LAJARA, BARTOLOME/R-7634-2018","Ubeda-García, Mercedes/0000-0003-4044-2455; MARCO LAJARA, BARTOLOME/0000-0001-8811-9118",,,,,37,0,0,1,13,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2289,2302,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200180,0

Fruit was harvested in Entre Rios, Argentina, in August 2011. Kumquats were wound-inoculated (0.8 mm long, 0.11 mm in diameter) with a conidia suspension (1x10(6) spores. ml(-1)) and dipped in water at 20, 45, 50 or 53 degrees C, for 2 min, with or without the addition of 2% sodium bicarbonate and then stored at 20 degrees C, 85-90% RH. The counting of rotted fruit was performed after 12 days. Non-inoculated fruits were waxed after water treatments and stored at 5 degrees C for 34 days (transport simulation) and followed by 20 degrees C for 4 days (shelf-life). Weight loss, firmness and physiological disorders were evaluated. In hot water treatments at 50 and 53 degrees C, more than 75% green mold control was observed. The addition of 2% sodium bicarbonate to the water showed no significant effect in controlling green mold. Weight loss increased with the addition of bicarbonate to the bath and with water temperature. However, no differences in firmness were detected after the trial among treatments. Any hot water treatment did not cause physiological disorders. The use of heat treatments such as hot water dips enables control of green mold in kumquats without altering the quality of the fruit.","[Vazquez, Daniel E.; Cocco, Mariangeles; Bello, Fernando; Panozzo, Marina; Meier, Guillermo E.] Inst Nacl Tecnol Agr, Estn Expt Agr Concordia, Concordia, Argentina",Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA),"Vázquez, DE (通讯作者)，Inst Nacl Tecnol Agr, Estn Expt Agr Concordia, Concordia, Argentina.",dvazquez@correo.inta.gov.ar,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,1,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1607,1612,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600205,0

In recent years, studies on metro networks have attracted increasing attention because the consequence of operational accidents is barely affordable. This study proposes to measure the metro network vulnerability from the perspective of line operation by taking the Shanghai metro network as a case study. As opposed to previous studies that focused largely on disruption of important nodes or links, this study investigates the disruption from the line operation perspective. Betweenness centrality (BC) and passenger betweenness centrality (PBC), number of missed trips, weighted average path length, and weighted global efficiency were analyzed considering relative disruption probability of each line. Passenger flow distribution and re-distribution were simulated for different disruption scenarios based on all-or-nothing assignment rule. The results indicate that the metro lines carrying a large number of passengers generally have a significant impact on the network vulnerability. The lines with circular topological form also have a significant influence on passenger flow re-distribution in case of a disruption. The results of this study provide suggestions on metro system administration for potential improvement of the performance of operation, and passengers may meanwhile have an improved alternate plan for their commute trip when a disruption occurs.

Japan was more successful because a growing population had led to an increasing demand for agricultural products, which could only be met by expanding agriculture across its empire. This required investment in land reform to transfer ownership from common to private rights. Conversely, the Americans faced no such domestic pressures, valuing Micronesia only for its strategic location and military testing.

Using Census micro data we study the effects of this increase on the occupations women held after the war. Almost three decades after its end, WWII had lasting effects on the occupational landscape. For women of working age in the early 1940s, the war caused a permanent shift towards blue-collar occupations - particularly in manufacturing and service jobs and a decline in employment in white-collar jobs. A reduction in educational attainment due to the draft, accumulation of occupation - specific experience and relatively high wages in blue-collar sectors can largely account for these patterns.

Soccer production, measured as league points per game, is modeled as a function of a team's total wage bill, the distribution of the team's wage bill, and goals per game. Both the Gini coefficient and the coefficient of variation are utilized to measure salary inequality. The results indicate that production in MLS is negatively responsive to increases in the salary inequality; the estimation model with the best fit uses the coefficient of variation to measure dispersion. Furthermore, MLS teams appear to be constrained in their choices of salary inequality by the salary cap and other regulations.","[Coates, Dennis] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Frick, Bernd] Univ Paderborn, Dept Management, Paderborn, Germany; [Jewell, Todd] Texas State Univ San Marcos, Dept Finance & Econ, San Marcos, TX USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; University of Paderborn; Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos,"Coates, D (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Econ, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA.",coates@umbc.edu,"Coates, Dennis/A-4588-2014","Coates, Dennis/0000-0003-3708-2137",,,,,27,47,52,14,57,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

In the future, the number of eligible households will grow substantially, about 80 % are homeowners, and many of them have substantial equity in their home.

We test the hypothesis that in states where real house prices are volatile and the current level is above the long term norm, seniors rationally anticipate future reductions in house prices and lock-in their housing equity gains by obtaining a reverse mortgage. We test alternative hypotheses, the first being that seniors living in states with high rates of house price appreciation increase their use of HECMs as a means to convert an illiquid wealth capital gain into a more liquid asset. A second alternative hypothesis is that the intertemporal changes in originations of HECMs were a result of changes in the supply of mortgage originators. Our empirical work supports the hypothesis that seniors used HECMs to insure against house price declines, but we find no evidence in support of the alternative hypotheses.","[Haurin, Donald; Ma, Chao; Shi, Wei] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, 1945 N High St, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Moulton, Stephanie; Seligman, Jason] Ohio State Univ, John Glenn Sch Publ Affairs, 1810 Coll Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Schmeiser, Maximilian] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, 20th & C Sts NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Haurin, D (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, 1945 N High St, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",haurin.2@osu.edu,", Don/AAI-8422-2020; Ma, Chao/HKW-2513-2023; Moulton, Stephanie Marie/F-7206-2012","Moulton, Stephanie/0000-0003-4102-0932; Ma, Chao/0000-0002-6099-2457",MacArthur Foundation,MacArthur Foundation,"Funding is from the MacArthur Foundation grant Aging in Place: Analyzing the Use of Reverse Mortgages to Preserve Independent Living, 2012-14, Stephanie Moulton, PI.

The present work aims to investigate the perception of commuters of Kolkata city, India in terms of their willingness-to pay (WTP) for improvement of transfer facilities. A stated preference survey instrument was designed to collect choice responses from metro commuters and the database was analysed by developing random parameter logit (RPL) models. The decomposition effects of various socioeconomic and trip characteristics on mean estimates were also investigated in random parameter logit models with heterogeneity. The work indicates significantly high WTP of metro commuters as compared to the average metro fare for improvement of various qualitative attributes of transfer facility such as 'facility for level change', 'visual communication', 'pedestrian crossing', and 'pedestrian environment'. The WTP values are also found to vary across different groups of commuter formed on the basis of 'trip purpose', 'monthly household income', 'station type' and 'metro fare'. 'Work trip' commuters are found to have higher WTP for improvement of access time, pedestrian environment and use of an escalator over the elevator. On the other hand, 'high-income group' commuters have shown higher WTP for improvement of access time, pedestrian crossing, and pedestrian environment. While 'high fare group' commuters have higher WTP for access time and pedestrian environment, heterogeneity is also observed in WTP for facility for level change, pedestrian crossing, and pedestrian environment across commuters using different 'station type' (underground, at-grade, and elevated). The findings from the study provide a basis for formulating policies for the improvement of transfer facilities in and around metro stations giving due attention to the preference of commuters having different socioeconomic and trip characteristics.

We model interstate relocations for manufacturers in aggregate and for three subgroups characterized by their industry-level research and development (R&D) intensity. The analysis suggests that very few manufacturing firms relocate across state lines in any given year and the vast majority of those that do are small in size and move to adjoining states. Our results also reveal that interstate migration by manufacturing establishments varies with their R&D intensity. Whereas a number of factors considered in this study are statistically significant, marginal effects at the mean are infinitesimal. This implies that states attempting to encourage manufacturing firms to relocate from other states via traditional perspectives on business climate are unlikely to be successful.

For estimation purposes, we combine city-level demographic information with detailed housing price data for 87 German cities over 1995-2014. We show that house prices and key demographic variables exhibit strong cross-section dependence but are panel stationary in first differences when this form of dependence is accounted for. Employing a mixed-regressive spatial panel model that incorporates spatial fixed effects as well as changes in city size, purchasing power and mortgage rates, we find that real urban house price appreciation tends to be substantially lower in cities that age more rapidly. Population aging has heterogeneous effects across housing segments: sales price growth of condominiums and single-family homes is negatively related to stronger growth of the old-age dependency ratio, while a positive association is found for aging and real rent growth.

While PPP holds overwhelmingly during the period when the NTD is under the fixed exchange rate regime, it is present only for some exchange rates during the managed floating rate regime. For exchange rates exhibiting mean reversion, the reversion occurs mainly when the shocks are large.

I argue that rising intra-industry trade in the postwar period has undermined traditional trade coalitions and created new opportunities for individual firms to become politically active. Drawing on new trade theories from economics, as well as work on firm heterogeneity and lobbying, I argue that industry associations become less active as intra-industry trade increases due to competing trade preferences among member firms. At the same time, individual firms become more politically active. My results suggest that firms lobby not only for protection, but liberalization. Using data on lobbying expenditures in the USA, my work takes recent analyses of intra-industry trade and lobbying a step further. I show how intra-industry trade redraws domestic political alignments and changes the composition of societal coalitions organized to influence trade policy.","[Madeira, Mary Anne] CUNY, Queens Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Flushing, NY 11367 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY),"Madeira, MA (通讯作者)，CUNY, Queens Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Flushing, NY 11367 USA.",,"Madeira, Mary Anne/I-9305-2019","Madeira, Mary Anne/0000-0002-9308-3807",,,,,76,43,52,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The economic dimension of the impacts, in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) and employment, is then assessed. This is achieved by combining a world gravity model of tourism flows with an input-output model. The results show that under standard climate change scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Portugal will experience a significant increase in temperature leading to a decrease of inbound tourism arrivals between 2.5% and 5.2%.

In deeply entrenched autocracies, the effect of windfalls is virtually nil, while in moderately entrenched autocracies, windfalls significantly exacerbate the autocratic nature of the political system. To frame the empirical work, we present a simple model in which political incumbents choose the degree of political contestability and potential challengers decide whether to try to unseat the incumbents. The model uncovers a mechanism for the asymmetric impact of resource windfalls on democracies and autocracies, as well as the the differential impact within autocracies.","[Caselli, Francesco] LSE, London, England; [Caselli, Francesco] CFM, Cincinnati, OH 45215 USA; [Caselli, Francesco; Tesei, Andrea] CEP, Bayreuth, Germany; [Caselli, Francesco] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Caselli, Francesco] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tesei, Andrea] Queen Mary, London, England; [Tesei, Andrea] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); National Bureau of Economic Research; Ifo Institut,"Caselli, F (通讯作者)，LSE, London, England.;Caselli, F (通讯作者)，CFM, Cincinnati, OH 45215 USA.;Caselli, F (通讯作者)，CEP, Bayreuth, Germany.;Caselli, F (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC USA.",,,,"CEP; Banco de Espana; Banco de Espana Professorship; ESRC [ES/L500343/1, ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L500343/1, ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish",CEP; Banco de Espana; Banco de Espana Professorship; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are very grateful to Antonio Ciccone for many discussions and to Tim Besley, Silvana Tenreyro, seminar participants at LSE and UPF, and two anonymous referees for comments.

Because height measures are used when other data are unavailable, testing their reliability can be difficult, and concerns over sample selection have led to several vigorous debates within the heights literature. In this paper, I use a unique contemporaneous census to gauge the extent of selection into a contested sample of American Indian heights. I have linked people from the 1892 Boas sample of the Cherokee Nation to the 1890 Cherokee Census. An initial analysis finds evidence of negative selection into the Boas sample. A detailed examination of those measured reveals a more complex story. Two distinct groups are present within the data. The first group consists of 64 members of the Cherokee elite. Their households owned more land, invested more in improvements to their land, and had higher literacy rates. The remainder of the Boas sample is poor relative to both the elite and the rest of the Cherokee Nation. Part, but not all, of this difference is due to their residential location. Forty percent of the Boas sample lived in poorest district of Cherokee Nation. These differences in wealth between the two groups were mirrored by a fairly dramatic difference in average heights. The average height of all men in elite group was 173.9 cm while the non-elite were several centimeters shorter at just 171.2 cm.

The first is the choice among alternative estimation methods. The second is the choice among different data sources of house prices. The choice of the dataset has been regarded as critically important from a practical viewpoint, but has not been discussed much in the literature. This study seeks to fill this gap by comparing the distributions of prices collected at different stages of the house buying/selling process, including (1) asking prices at which properties are initially listed in a magazine, (2) asking prices when an offer for a property is eventually made and the listing is removed from the magazine, (3) contract prices reported by realtors after mortgage approval, and (4) registry prices. These four prices are collected by different parties and recorded in different datasets. We find that there exist substantial differences between the distributions of the four prices, as well as between the distributions of house attributes. However, once quality differences are controlled for, only small differences remain between the different house price distributions.

For the case of separatism in the Moldovan Dniester Valley, research has highlighted the crucial role of industrial factory directors. These managers mobilised their factories' employees. To refine the knowledge of how collective conflict actors are formed, this article asks the question: what enabled directors to mobilise their' workers? The sources show that, on the one hand, the managers' political power was rooted in typical Soviet enterprise structures; on the other, it was further strengthened by perestroika market reforms and the economic crisis entangled to them. These results suggest that separatist mobilisation and internal conflict were entangled to social transformation and functioned as a catalyst to the process of (re-)distribution of capital and power.","[Zofka, Jan] Univ Leipzig, Leipzig Ctr Hist & Culture East Cent Europe GWZO, Reichsstr 4-6, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Geschichte und Kultur des Ostlichen Europa (GWZO); Leipzig University,"Zofka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Leipzig Ctr Hist & Culture East Cent Europe GWZO, Reichsstr 4-6, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",zofka@uni-leipzig.de,,"Zofka, Jan/0000-0002-7420-4001",,,,,55,1,1,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,JUL,2016,68.0,5,,,,,826,846,,10.1080/09668136.2016.1189514,0.0,,,21,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,DT5JV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000381520400002,0

What has generated particular interest and debate is the statement that the development cannot be explained by changes in traditional explanatory factors such as GDP and fuel prices. Instead, it has been argued, the observed trends are indications of substantial changes in lifestyles, preferences and attitudes to car travel; what we are experiencing is not just a temporary plateau, but a true peak car. However, this study shows that the traditional variables GDP and fuel price are in fact sufficient to explain the observed trends in car traffic in all the countries included in our study: the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Sweden and (to a large extent) Australia and Germany. We argue that the importance of the fuel price increases in the early 2000s has been underappreciated in the studies that shaped the later debate. Results also indicate that GDP elasticities tend to decrease with rising GDP, and that fuel price elasticities tend to increase at high price levels and during periods of rapid price increases.

The particular model we use explicitly accounts for the dependency between daily returns and measurement errors of the realized volatility estimate. Within a simulation study we investigate the form of the dependency. In order to capture the long memory property of asset volatility, we explore different autoregressive dynamics for the latent volatility process, including heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) dynamics and a two-component approach. We estimate the model using simulated maximum likelihood based on efficient importance sampling (EIS), producing numerically accurate parameter estimates and filtered state sequences. The model is applied to daily asset returns and realized variances of New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) traded stocks. Estimation results indicate that accounting for the dependency of returns and realized measures significantly affects the estimation results and improves the model fit for all autoregressive dynamics.","[Bekierman, Jeremias; Gribisch, Bastian] Univ Cologne, Inst Econometr & Stat, Univ Str 22a, D-50937 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Bekierman, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Econometr & Stat, Univ Str 22a, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.",j.bekierman@statistik.uni-koeln.de,"Gribisch, Bastian/JZT-8117-2024","Gribisch, Bastian/0000-0002-6289-1799",,,,,42,8,8,1,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

This study evaluates these methodologies by using data from a survey of alumni of Rosen College of Hospitality Management at the University of Central Florida. The results reveal that the highly publicized low ROI for college education might be inaccurate, confusing, and misleading for several reasons, among which is the assumption of zero income while studying, causing debt to be the total of a student's expenses. Data reveal that Rosen College graduates who work in mandatory paid internships and hold part-time jobs could be debt-free within 2 years if they pay 20% of their salary toward their debt.

The potential use of roundabouts with all their inherent benefits may be greatly diminished if they are not able to accommodate oversize/overweight (OSOW) vehicles, sometimes called Superloads. The problem, therefore, is how to accommodate OSOW vehicles without sacrificing the integrity, safety and other benefits of roundabouts. This study uses TORUS software to design six standard roundabouts using guidance from the latest Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) roundabout guide. Six OSOW check vehicles from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation's library were used to modify the designs to accommodate these selected check vehicles at the roundabouts. These six OSOW check vehicles were used to conduct swept path analysis using AutoTURN software at the selected six standard roundabouts for right turn, through, and left turn simulations. The space requirements for these maneuvers were analyzed in detail. Various strategies for better accommodating these OSOW check vehicles were suggested and experimented with in this study using AutoTURN software simulations. The effectiveness of using a straight passage through the center island for OSOW vehicles was also addressed in this study and was found to be effective. All the strategies investigated in this study proved to be effective in accommodating OSOW vehicles when compared to conventional ways of using a roundabout. The needed total truck apron was calculated and used as a reference to determine an effective strategy for accommodating OSOW vehicles. This research can be used as guidance for transportation engineers, planners and decision makers to determine possible ways of designing a roundabout at an intersection where certain OSOW vehicles are expected.

In this framework, workers are assumed to have preferences over latent job opportunities belonging to worker-specific choice sets from which they choose their preferred job. The main contribution of this paper is an analysis of the identification problem under various conditions, when conventional cross-section micro-data are applied. The modeling framework is applied to analyze labor supply behavior for married/cohabiting couples using Norwegian micro data. Based on the empirical model, we discuss further qualitative properties of the model and simulation of counterfactual policy reforms.

The impact is measured by interventions in the series. Such interventions can be related to one-off events, permanent shifts or permanent changes in the slope of the series. The study case is the Malaga airport expansion. The impact distinguishes two effects: the new terminal building and the new runway. The results show that the infrastructure made a difference in attracting additional international tourists, especially those flying with low-cost carriers. The estimations show that the traffic increased by 6% due to the new terminal building, and the growth rate increased by 18% due to the new runway.","[Eugenio-Martin, Juan L.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Modulo D, Despacho D-2-06,Campus Tafira, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Eugenio-Martin, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Modulo D, Despacho D-2-06,Campus Tafira, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",juanluis.eugenio@ulpgc.es,"Eugenio-Martin, Juan Luis/L-3005-2014","Eugenio-Martin, Juan Luis/0000-0002-2444-3338",,,,,17,17,17,1,29,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We distinguish between low-volatility (bull) and high-volatility (bear) markets and employ a TVP-VAR approach with stochastic volatility to assess the evolution of the interest rate in relation to housing and stock returns. We measure the relative importance of housing and stock returns in the movements of the interest rate and their possible feedback effects over both time and horizon and across regimes. Empirical results from annual data on the US spanning the period from 1890 to 2012 indicate that the interest rate responds more strongly to asset returns during low-volatility (bull) regimes. While the bigger interest-rate effect of stock-return shocks occurs prior to the 1970s, the interest rate appears to respond more strongly to housing-return than stock return shocks after the 1970s. Similarly, a higher interest rate exerts a larger effect on both asset categories during low-volatility (bull) markets. Particularly, larger negative responses of housing return to interest-rate shocks occur after the 1980s, corresponding to the low-volatility (bull) regime in the housing market. Conversely, the stock-return effect of interest-rate shocks dominates before the 1980s, where stock-market booms achieved more importance.","[Simo-Kengne, Beatrice D.; Gupta, Rangan; Balcilar, Mehmet] Univ Pretoria, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Miller, Stephen M.] Univ Nevada, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Balcilar, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey",University of Pretoria; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas; Eastern Mediterranean University,"Miller, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",simobeatrice@gmail.com; stephen.miller@unlv.edu; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; mehmet@mbalcilar.net,"BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019; Miller, Stephen M/H-8251-2019; Simo-Kengne, Beatrice/AAA-4303-2019","BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196; Miller, Stephen M/0000-0002-6754-0605; Simo-Kengne, Beatrice/0000-0002-4948-5868",,,,,53,18,17,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Accounting for the effect of rescheduling possibilities in choice of departure time for work trips,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Departure time; Scheduling model; Flexibility constraints; Activity schedule,MODE CHOICE; TRAVEL; VARIABILITY; FLEXIBILITY; ROAD,"In departure time studies it is crucial to ascertain whether or not individuals are flexible in their choices. Previous studies have found that individuals with flexible work times have a lower value of time for late arrivals. Flexibility is usually measured in terms of flexible work start time or in terms of constraints in arrival time at work. Although used for the same purpose, these two questions can convey different types of information. Moreover, constraints in departure time are often related not only to the main work activity, but to all daily activities. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of constraints in work and in other daily trips activities on the willingness to shift departure time and the willingness to pay for reducing travel time and travel delay. We set up a survey to collect detailed data on the full 24-hour out-of-home activities and on the constraints for each of these activities. We then built a stated preference experiment to infer preferences on departure time choice, and estimated a mixed logit model, based on the scheduling model, to account for the effects of daily activity schedules and their constraints. Our results show that measuring flexibility in terms of work start time or constraints at work does not provide exactly the same information. Since one-third of the workers with flexible working hours in the survey indicated that they have restrictions on late work-arrival times, their willingness to pay will be overestimated (almost doubled) if flexibility information is asked only in terms of fixed flexible working hours. This clearly leads to different conclusion in terms of demand sensitivity to reschedule to a later departure time. We also found that having other activities and constraints during the day increases the individuals' willingness to pay to avoid being late at work, where the presence of constraints on daily activities other than work is particularly relevant for individuals with no constraints at work. The important impact of these findings is that if we neglect the presence of constraints, as is common practise in transport models, it will generally lead to biased value-of-time estimates. Results clearly show that the shift in the departure time, especially towards a late departure time, is strongly overestimated (the predicted shift is more than double) when the effect of non-work activities and their constraints is not accounted for.

We argue that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) helps to reduce the likelihood of nationalization because of the direct leverage the Fund holds over borrowers, especially as expropriation is a blatant violation of international property rights. Using expropriation data from 1961 to 2006, and several different measures for the Fund, we find that countries under IMF agreements are less likely to nationalize foreign firms. We also show that the Fund's influence is greatest when the IMF loan represents a larger share of the borrower country's gross domestic product (GDP) as well as in countries with weaker political institutions. The takeaway is that IMF continues to influence policy choices in the developing world.","[Biglaiser, Glen] Univ N Texas, Dept Polit Sci, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Lee, Hoon] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Staats, Joseph L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Polit Sci, Duluth, MN 55812 USA",University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth,"Biglaiser, G (通讯作者)，Univ N Texas, Dept Polit Sci, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",gbiglais@gmail.com; hoon.lee@ttu.edu; jstaats@d.umn.edu,,,,,,,85,15,15,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

However, this price gap is not uniform throughout the price distribution of each type of land. Using decomposition methods, we disentangle the distributional land price differentials between 2007 and 2012 into a composition effect attributable to the varying land characteristics and a coefficient effect due to changes in the gradients on the underlying land price function. We show that the contributions of the composition effect and the coefficient effect to raw price gaps vary with the part of the price distribution and also differ by the type of land.

This linear system is encountered in many research applications and more importantly, it is required to be solved in many contexts in applied mathematics. LU decomposition method, based on the Gaussian elimination, is particularly well suited for spars and large-scale problems. Linear programming (LP) is a mathematical method to obtain optimal solutions for a linear system that is more being considered in various fields of study in recent decades. The simplex algorithm is one of the mostly used mathematical techniques for solving LP problems. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a non-parametric approach based on linear programming to evaluate relative efficiency of decision making units (DMUs). The number of LP models that has to be solved in DEA is at least the same as the number of DMUs. Toloo et al. (Comput Econ 45(2):323-326, 2015) proposed an initial basic feasible solution for DEA models which practically reduces at least 50 % of the whole computations. The main contribution of this paper is in utlizing this solution to implement LU decomposition technique on the basic DEA models which is more accurate and numerically stable. It is shown that the number of computations in applying the Gaussian elimination method will be fairly reduced due to the special structure of basic DEA models. Potential uses are illustrated with applications to hospital data set.","[Toloo, Mehdi] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic; [Jalili, Rahele] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Math, Sci & Res Branch, Tehran 14778, Iran",Technical University of Ostrava; Islamic Azad University,"Toloo, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",m_toloo@yahoo.com; rahele.jalili@yahoo.com,"jalili, rahele/JGL-6599-2023; Toloo, Mehdi/F-7575-2019; Toloo, Mehdi/C-2679-2014","Toloo, Mehdi/0000-0002-6977-4608;",Czech Science Foundation (GACR) [14-31593S]; European Social Fund [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296],Czech Science Foundation (GACR)(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),The research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (GACR project 14-31593S) and through European Social Fund within the project CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296.,,26,8,8,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The target cities are 32 provincial capital cities and the target period is from 2001 to 2011. In order to capture the individual effects (heterogeneity), the fixed and random effect models are adopted and compared, in which 8 explanatory variables are selected to include economic characteristics, urban characteristics, and transportation characteristics. Moreover, double natural logarithm model is employed to measure the elastic relationship between the private car ownership and regressors. The estimated results show that the fixed effect model performs better than pooled regression model and the random effect model. In addition, there are variations of private car ownership among cities and regions. Finally, the influence of factors responsible for these variations is also presented and discussed in this paper.

The benefit of this development is that empirical models which are based on few parameters explain data on bilateral trade flows relatively well, while being consistent with general equilibrium. The latter permits using the estimated parameters for comparative static analysis. In general, in the cross section such models involve country-pair-specific variables and exporter-specific as well as importer-specific variables. The latter are determined through structural model constraints. The disturbances on this model are typically assumed to be independently if not also identically distributed. This paper illustrates that the assumption of independently distributed disturbances is likely flawed in practice. Ignoring such independence leads to inconsistent test statistics and standard errors of the parameters. We present a structural gravity model which permits the disturbances to be cross-sectionally interdependent in up to three dimensions and illustrate the consequences of doing so for inference.","[Egger, Peter] ETH, LEE G101,Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Egger, Peter] CEPR, LEE G101,Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Pfaffermayr, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Innsbruck,"Pfaffermayr, M (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",egger@kof.ethz.ch; Michael.Pfaffermayr@uibk.ac.at,"Pfaffermayr, Michael/AAR-2786-2020","Pfaffermayr, Michael/0000-0002-8558-7757; Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",Czech Science Foundation [GA CR P402/12/0982],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"Egger acknowledges funding from the Czech Science Foundation through grant number GA CR P402/12/0982.

Previous literature on the performance of these estimators has primarily focussed on the role of the variance function for the estimators' behavior. We add to this literature by studying the small sample performance of estimators in a data-generating process that is fully consistent with general equilibrium economic models of international trade. Economic theory suggests that (1) importer- and exporter-specific effects need to be accounted for in estimation, and (2) that they are correlated with bilateral trade costs through general equilibrium (or balance-of-payments) restrictions. We compare the performance of structural estimators, fixed effects estimators, and quasi-differences estimators in such settings, using the GLM approach as a unifying framework.","[Egger, Peter H.] ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Weinbergstr 35, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Staub, Kevin E.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, 111 Barry St, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Melbourne,"Egger, P (通讯作者)，ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Weinbergstr 35, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",egger@kof.ethz.ch; kevin.staub@unimelb.edu.au,,"Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207","Czech Science Fund (GA CR) [P402/12/0982]; Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Melbourne","Czech Science Fund (GA CR); Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Melbourne","The authors gratefully acknowledge helpful comments by Badi Baltagi, Michael Pfaffermayr, Joao Santos Silva, and two anonymous reviewers on an earlier version of the manuscript.

In this approach, the unpaid work is defined in the boundary of activities linked to the upkeep of living spaces and domestic goods, care for health or maintenance of social relationships, for which a person does not receive any remuneration. However, also institutional agents have recently got interested in wider use of unpaid work for business activities. The aim of the paper is to analyze the use of economic unpaid work in Polish family businesses and Non-Governmental Organizations. The analysis is of a descriptive nature and is based on secondary data collected within Labour Force Survey and NGO-related studies carried out in Poland. It revealed existence of noticeable differences between these two types of unpaid work as for socio-demographic features of individuals performing non-remunerated activities. However, it appeared that that unpaid work in both the family businesses and non-profit organizations is performed mainly by women in non-mobile age groups. It means, that this phenomenon affects groups facing significant problems with finding standard employment. Nevertheless, we conclude that unpaid work may be beneficial for workers and organizations if pros and cons are well-balanced. At present, the main economic benefits to individuals providing the unpaid work include gaining professional experience or keeping up the family business which brings incomes to the household.","[Arendt, Lukasz; Kukulak-Dolata, Iwona] Univ Lodz, Dept Econ Policy, Lodz, Poland; [Poliwczak, Iwona] Inst Labour & Social Studies, Warsaw, Poland",University of Lodz; Institute of Labor & Social Affairs,"Arendt, L (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Dept Econ Policy, Lodz, Poland.",larendt@uni.lodz.pl; doiwona@uni.lodz.pl; iwona.poliwczak@interia.pl,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,1,BELIANUM-VYDAVATESTVO UNIV MATEJA BELA V BANSKEJ BYSTRICI,BANSKA BYSTRICA,"TAJOVSKEHO 51, BANSKA BYSTRICA, 974 00, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-557-1089-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15,Economics; Industrial Relations & Labor; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BM2DC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000460873800017,0

The system of these weights is called 'scale of consumption units'. As each additional person realizes economies of scale, the indicator average income per consumption unit provides a better explanation than income per capita. Consumption units for the Czech households are estimated by quantification of household expenditures by using data from household budget surveys. Regression analysis is employed to analyze the relationship between household expenditures and the characteristics of households.

In our study, the cessation of the railway services operated by Keretapi Tanah Malaya (KTM), a firm owned by the Malaysian government, with effect from July 1, 2011 is used in a quasi-experiment design to test the effects of the removal of train noise externalities on real estate values. Based on the nonlanded private housing transactions data from January 2005 to June 2013, we find that average prices for houses located within a 400-m boundary from the railway lines increased by 3.5% relative to prices for houses located outside the 400-m boundary after the cessation agreement has been announced. The removal of train noise externalities increases housing prices in the affected area by 13.7% on average in the postcessation period of the KTM railway services. Realized economic benefits associated with the railway services cessation were estimated at S$0.36 billion based on houses sold in the post cessation period of the KTM railway services.","[Diao, Mi; Qin, Yu; Sing, Tien Foo] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Diao, M (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore, Singapore.",rstdm@nus.edu.sg; rstqyu@nus.edu.sg; rststf@nus.edu.sg,"Qin, Yu/T-8719-2019; Diao, Mi/H-8615-2013; Sing, Tien Foo/J-9381-2013","Diao, Mi/0000-0002-0389-4199; Sing, Tien Foo/0000-0002-4101-851X",,,,,29,31,38,4,44,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,,2016,44.0,4,,,,,878,917,,10.1111/1540-6229.12123,0.0,,,40,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,DZ3DK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385724500004,0

This is achieved by imputing household expenditure data into Labor Force Surveys (LFSs) with models that have been estimated using Household Expenditure Surveys (HESs). In an application to Morocco, where the latest official poverty rate is for 2007, estimates of poverty are obtained for all years (and quarters) between 2001 and 2009. It is found that the approach accurately reproduces the official poverty statistics for the two years these surveys are available. The imputation-based estimates furthermore reveal that poverty has consistently declined over the entire 2001-2009 period. This would suggest that poverty reduction in Morocco was not halted by the global financial crisis. While our focus is on head-count poverty, the method can be applied to any welfare indicator that is a function of household income or expenditure, such as the poverty gap or the Gini index of inequality.","[Van der Weide, Roy; Verme, Paolo] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Douidich, Mohamed; Ezzrari, Abdeljaouad] High Commiss Plan, Rabat, Morocco",The World Bank,"Verme, P (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",douidich@yahoo.fr; ezzrari@yahoo.fr; rvanderweide@worldbank.org; pverme@worldbank.org,"verme, paolo/P-5228-2019","verme, paolo/0000-0002-8754-1138","World Bank program Growth, Employment and Poverty [EW-P127927-ESW-BB]; World Bank's Knowledge for Change Program","World Bank program Growth, Employment and Poverty; World Bank's Knowledge for Change Program","The work was undertaken in the framework of the cooperation agreement between the World Bank and the High Commission for the Plan of Morocco and under the World Bank program Growth, Employment and Poverty (EW-P127927-ESW-BB).

More specifically, we study the ways in which airlines adjust frequencies to delays (as a measure of airport congestion) depending on the network type they operate. Our results suggest that network structure has a fundamental impact. Thus, while airlines operating fully-connected configurations reduce frequencies in response to more frequent delays, airlines operating hub-and-spoke structures increase frequencies. Therefore, network airlines have incentives to keep frequencies high even if this is at the expense of a greater congestion at their hub airports. This result sheds light on previously unclear results in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This approach is very sensitive to the choice of measures. Traditionally the rule of thumb has been used for initial decision about number of inputs and outputs. Recently a growth of interest in the DEA methodology have shown a need to create an approach or model which could identify the optimal number of inputs and outputs and which identifies the contribution of each variable to the measure of efficiency. The practice has been to select the variables by simply choosing the ones that make economic sense or use them according to preferred performance measures. Variable selection is further complicated because it is difficult to measure some attributes of the inputs and outputs that contribute to the efficiency of a DMU.

To address these questions, the paper first unpacks the mechanics of shadow banking and compares them to traditional banking. Based on this stylized explanation, it problematizes the use of the term 'banking'. Indeed, shadow banks turn long-term liabilities into short-term financial instruments, effectively turning traditional banking on its head. Next, it draws on three political science frameworks to bring to the fore and develop the political content of mainstream economic expertise on shadow banks. First, it shows that shadow banks played a significant role in the rent-seeking behavior of the financial sector by extracting regulatory rents and subsidies. Second, in spite of this, the extension of public backstops to shadow banks has largely been treated as logical institutional adaptation to a changing financial landscape. Third, shadow banking emerged alongside and contributed to growing economic inequality. It did so by acting as a credit bridge between giant pools of money seeking returns and a growing number of borrowers, raising further questions about its economic and social utility. These findings contribute to the emerging political economy literature on shadow banking, expert ideas and the relationship between finance and larger societal developments.","[Helgadottir, Oddny] Brown Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University,"Helgadóttir, O (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",oddny_helgadottir@brown.edu,,,,,,,89,20,21,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The elimination of the economic, social and territorial disparities among European regions is the primary objective of the European Union (EU). Thanks to EU Cohesion Policy, the regional disparities decreased over the past decade, however a wide gap has still remained between the less developed and the highly developed regions. In terms of the evaluation of regional disparities there is no uniform methodological approach to determination of weights of regional indicators and regional disparities assessment. The multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods can be considered as a suitable and useful tool. The main aim of the paper is to outline the different weighting methods within MCMD method and compare the effects of their application in the regional disparities analysis namely on case study. The selected weighting methods are used to derive the weights of the regional indicators. The TOPSIS method is employed to rank the NUTS 2 regions in the selected EU countries according to their socio-economic development in the context of EU cohesion. An empirical study demonstrated a feasibility of the weighting and MCDM methods in quantitative evaluation of the regional disparities.","[Minarcikova, Eva] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Minarciková, E (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic.",eva.minarcikova@vsb.cz,"Polednikova, Eva/J-5333-2018","Polednikova, Eva/0000-0001-8645-5716",,,,,14,6,6,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1240,1249,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100123,0

But is this incentive argument strong enough in practice to prefer unproductive workfare to even untargeted cash transfers? A nonparametric survey-based method is used to assess the cost-effectiveness of a large workfare scheme in a poor state of India with high unemployment. Forgone earnings are evident but fall short of market wages. For the same budget, unproductive workfare has less impact on poverty than either a basic-income scheme or transfers tied to the government's assignment of ration cards. The productivity of workfare is thus crucial to its justification as an antipoverty policy.","[Murgai, Rinku; van de Walle, Dominique] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Ravallion, Martin] Georgetown Univ, Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Ravallion, Martin] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",The World Bank; Georgetown University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Ravallion, M (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.;Ravallion, M (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",rmurgai@worldbank.org; mr1185@georgetown.edu; dvandewalle@worldbank.org,,,Spanish Impact Evaluation Fund (SIEF),Spanish Impact Evaluation Fund (SIEF),"This paper draws on data collected and analysis done for a World Bank project co-managed by Puja Dutta and Rinku Murgai.

All cohesion policy interventions aimed at reducing regional disparities were completed in 2015, according to the n + 2 rule. Impact assessment of programs and projects were in the forefront of EU institutions, individual governments and regions. This article aims to evaluate impacts of public support on a tourism area in the selected Southwest NUTS II region in the Czech Republic. Statistical methods, qualitative research, Counterfactual Impact Evaluation (CIE) methods and principles of theory-based impact evaluation are used for the impact assessment. When evaluating the impact of interventions in tourism in the Southwest NUTS II region it was found, from a methodological point of view, that the major barrier to the use of Counterfactual Impact Evaluation methods was poor accessibility and especially quality of data. The evaluation shows that benefits are observable in terms of specific projects or locations, but cannot be seen in the larger territory of a NUTS II region. Here it is evident that tourism is a sensitive segment of the national economy mainly reactive to the economic situation in source countries, the peace situation in the world and, of course, to the purchasing power of the population.","[Plzakova, Lucie] Inst Hospitality Management Prague, Travel & Tourism Dept, Svidnicka 506, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Plzáková, L (通讯作者)，Inst Hospitality Management Prague, Travel & Tourism Dept, Svidnicka 506, Prague, Czech Republic.",plzakova@vsh.cz,"Plzáková, Lucie/AAE-4027-2021","Plzáková, Lucie/0000-0002-0750-7643",,,,,14,1,1,0,3,"UNIV BANSKA BYSTRICA, FAC ECONOMICS MATEJ BEL",BANSKA BYSTRICA,"TAJOVSKEHO, 10, BANSKA BYSTRICA, 975 90, SLOVAKIA",2453-9902,,978-80-89438-04-4,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2016,,,,,,,278,291,,,,,,14,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BH2KW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000399024100028,0

Regardless of the past foreign policy of this country, it has always been focused on the Balkans and Central and Eastern Europe as well as on the issues related to the Middle East. The size of the country, the population, the economic potential, and the military power predispose Turkey to take the responsibility for the entire group of nations situated in this region. The privileged location of Ankara results in both the approval of loyal allies and the strong aversion of other countries that strive to dominate the region. Turkey was one of the greatest empires in the world almost to the end of the 17th century. Until World War I, it was a regional power, influential in the Mediterranean region. It lost the position of the leader after World War II. For several decades, thanks to a remarkable effort of the entire society, Turkey has been regaining its former influences and significance in the world. However, it seems that the increasingly tense situation between the nations complicates the current actions of the Turkish government aimed to achieve its goals. Based on the available economic data and the analysis of the political situation, it is possible to test whether or not Turkey is able to implement the far-reaching plans. To this end, it is necessary to analyse the opportunities for and obstacles to success. Such an analysis may trigger more detailed discussions and interesting considerations.","[Przygoda, Miroslaw] Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Ul Szturmowa 1-3, PL-02678 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Przygoda, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Ul Szturmowa 1-3, PL-02678 Warsaw, Poland.",miroslawprzygoda@wp.pl,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,714,731,,,,,,18,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400074,0

Knowledge of this interconnectedness (i.e., import and export) is an important basis for complex models, which consider the overflow of effects between individual regions. Dependency on regions significantly influences overall results of an input-output analysis since effects may be spread across the country. In this article, two new methods for calculating interregional flows between regions are suggested. The third method proposed is based on self-adjusting of gravitational methods. The aim of this article is to demonstrate utility of these three methods on data for fourteen regions of the Czech Republic. All computations are provided by data based on estimated regional input-output matrices for the Czech Republic, compiled by the Department of Economic Statistics of the University of Economics in Prague for the year 2011.

The National Administering Body of Social Security for Employment (BPJS Employment) stated that many workers in Indonesia are not yet registered in the pension program. Therefore, the participation of informal sector workers in the pension program is quite low. The article aims to describe how informal workers who live dominantly in the village plan their finance related to their pension or when they enter their old age. The possibility of not being able to be engaged with the pension program implemented, and the role of the local custom institutions in helping the people plan their indigenous- based pension. This is a qualitative research, data was collected through interview and documentation. This research was conducted in Ngadisari village of Tengger area, in which local wisdom is used as the approach in the research. The research found that Tengger people save money for their old age. They also keep their own tradition such as Sayan and the concept of Catur Guru Bakti as the social security system to guarantee and protect the elderly people, which is important for the socio-economic development of the indigenous ethno-cultural population of Tengger.","[Wiliandri, R.] State Univ Malang, Fac Econ, Dept Management, Kota Malang, Jawa Timur, Indonesia; [Wiliandri, R.] Leiden Univ, Leiden Ethnosyst & Dev Programme, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands",Universitas Negeri Malang; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Wiliandri, R (通讯作者)，State Univ Malang, Fac Econ, Dept Management, Kota Malang, Jawa Timur, Indonesia.;Wiliandri, R (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Leiden Ethnosyst & Dev Programme, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",ruly.wiliandri@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-264-0,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,18.0,,,,,,27,34,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390913100005,0

We recruited and randomized 233 (115 intervention, 118 control) pregnant women from a socioeconomically disadvantaged community in Dublin, Ireland into an intervention or control group. The treatment includes regular home visits commencing antenatally and an additional parenting course commencing at 2 years. Maternal reports of child health are assessed at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months. Treatment effects are estimated using permutation testing to account for small sample size, inverse probability weighting to account for differential attrition, and both the stepdown procedure and an indices approach to account for multiple hypothesis testing. Following adjustment for multiple testing and attrition, we observe a positive and statistically significant main treatment effect for wheezing/asthma. The intervention group are 15.5 percentage points (pp) less likely to require medical attention for wheezing/asthma compared to the control group. Subgroup analysis reveals more statistically significant adjusted treatment effects for boys than girls regarding fewer health problems (d = 0.63), accidents (23.9 pp), and chest infections (22.8-37.9 pp).

Bicycle sharing is increasingly popular as a sustainable transport system and the number of bike sharing schemes has grown significantly worldwide in recent years. One of the most important elements in implementation of these systems is the location of the stations. In fact the non-optimal locating of bike sharing compromises its success. Municipalities or public-private partnerships are mostly responsible for implementing bike-sharing schemes. The public investment in bicycle mobility (particularly bike-sharing) is complex because it is always subject to a budget. The main concern for public investment is to maximize the benefits through the design and implementation of bike-sharing systems. This work sets out a methodology to help with the decision-making of bike-sharing systems. The research work we present proposes using an optimization method to design the bike sharing system such that it maximizes the demand covered and takes the available budget as a constraint. It combines strategic decisions for locating bike-sharing stations and defining the dimension of the system (stations and number of bicycles) with operational decisions (relocating bicycles). As an outcome, the model determines the optimal location of the bicycle stations, the fleet size, the capacity of the stations and the number of bicycles in each station, considering an initial investment lower than the given budget. In addition, it balances the annual cost of the system and the revenue assuming a possible supplementary budget from the system provider to cover any loss resulting from the shortfall between its operating cost and the revenue from the subscription charges.

More specifically, it asks: (1) Was there such a plan, orchestrated by Stalin? (2) Were preparations undertaken to implement the plan, particularly the compilation of lists of potential Jewish deportees, assembly of cattle car echelons for their transportation, and construction of barracks at destinations? The author begins by briefly tracing the history of Stalin's anti-Semitic campaign after World War II, summarizing the liquidation of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee and the Doctors' Plot in light of the mounting anti-Semitic campaign in the country, which reached alarming proportions during the seven-week period prior to Stalin's last days. In addition to an in-depth review of Russian-language sources, the paper also is based on contacts with authors and observers with access to state archives and a private archival collection. The latter, still in a state of relative disorganization, could become a link to resolving the question of whether the plan and preparations for the anticipated mass deportation had taken place.","Marshall Univ, Int Affairs, Huntington, WV 25755 USA",Marshall University,"Winston, VH (通讯作者)，Marshall Univ, Int Affairs, Huntington, WV 25755 USA.",winstonv@live.marshall.edu,,,,,,,51,6,8,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Total gross state product (GSP) and housing value serve as indicators of the conditions in the overall economy and housing market, respectively. The empirical findings, resulting from a panel data set of U.S. states over the period from 1997 to 2010, yield a number of interesting insights. First, descriptive statistics show that the real estate economy comprises over 10 % of the typical state economy. Thus, a strong and healthy real estate economy is vital for a state macroeconomy to prosper. Second, and not surprisingly, descriptive statistics also reveal that real estate GSP, employment, and wages fluctuated wildly over the 13 years period largely due to the Great Recession. Third, vector error correction modeling finds that a strong causal relationship exists between the macroeconomy and real estate economy in the long run. In addition, the results indicate that the effects of the state macroeconomy on the real estate economy are less cyclical and more immediate in the short run than those from the housing market. Thus, we interpret the findings as suggesting that conditions in the macroeconomy are more important for the real estate economy at the margin. However, we conclude that any real-estate public policy initiatives should be cautiously applied given the complex relationships that are observed between the state macroeconomy, real estate economy, and housing market.","[Bates, Laurie J.] Bryant Univ, Dept Econ, Smithfield, RI USA; [Giaccotto, Carmelo; Santerre, Rexford E.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Finance, Sch Business, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Santerre, Rexford E.] Univ Connecticut, Programs Healthcare Management & Insurance, Sch Business, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Bryant University; University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut,"Santerre, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Finance, Sch Business, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",lbates@bryant.edu; CGiaccotto@business.uconn.edu; rsanterre@business.uconn.edu,,,Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics Studies at the University of Connecticut,Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics Studies at the University of Connecticut,Santerre thanks the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics Studies at the University of Connecticut for providing financial support.

Well-established principles of political economy suggest that the Parliament and Council will exercise their veto powers infrequently. Using an original data set of legislative vetoes of Commission acts by both European legislators from June 2006 to April 2014, we show that levels of formal exercise of the legislative veto to overrule the Commission's regulatory policies are indeed very low. Particularly interesting is the fact that the level of exercise of legislative veto provisions has not increased significantly since the Lisbon Treaty came into effect, suggesting that the ways in which the Treaty formally augmented the powers of legislative scrutiny have not resulted in appreciably greater formal exercise of these powers. Moreover, no significant differences appear between the two European Union legislative bodies.","[Kaeding, Michael] Univ Duisburg Essen, D-47053 Duisburg, Germany; [Stack, Kevin M.] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Law, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",University of Duisburg Essen; Vanderbilt University,"Kaeding, M (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Dept Polit Sci, Lotharstr, D-47053 Duisburg, Germany.",michael.kaeding@uni-due.de,,"Stack, Kevin/0000-0003-0790-1111; Kaeding, Michael/0000-0002-3554-0387",[542458-LLP-1-2013-1-DE-JM-CL],,We thank our three anonymous JCMS referees as well as David Lewis and Alan Wiseman for their constructive comments.

To examine how non-price rationing distorts conventional measures of the cost of living, we examine the case of Belgium following WWI. The economic fallout from WWI to Belgium was so severe that the Commission for Relief in Belgium provided considerable assistance after the war ended. Nonetheless, food shortages persisted even after international assistance ceased in 1919 and production in Belgium did not return to pre-war levels until the end of 1924. A nonparametric revealed preference test for fifteen food categories shows shortages for eggs, butter, potatoes, vegetables, and sugar for periods from 1920 to 1924. Estimated virtual prices for these five foods, in conjunction with actual prices for the other ten goods, show that the actual cost of living was severely underestimated. The virtual prices of these five goods are the prices at which consumers would have willingly paid to purchase them, given the observed quantities, along with their other purchases. In this respect they can be viewed as market clearing prices. Our findings reinforce the view that Belgium's population continued to endure the effects of constrained consumption and a lower standard of living after the war ended. Further the results show how much the welfare of the Belgium people improved when shortages began to decrease. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In a constructive critique of this research, Thrane (2012) has shown that use of these models lacks sound footing on conceptual as well as statistical grounds. In recent studies, length of stay has been thought of as a count variable, and the variation in this variable has accordingly been modelled with count data regression models. The purpose of the present study is to provide a constructive critique of this research. There are two conclusions. First, count data regression models should be used when analysing 'how-many-times-something-happened' data. Consequently, these models are not ideal when the non-discrete dependent variable is length of stay measured in days. Second, since an OLS regression analysis on the natural log of length of stay yields the same results as a far more complicated count data regression model, the former is preferable on the principle of parsimony and with regard to reaching out to an audience not well acquainted with statistics.","[Thrane, Christer] Lillehammer Univ Coll, Fac Econ & Org Sci, N-2604 Lillehammer, Norway; [Thrane, Christer] Inst Transport Econ, N-0349 Oslo, Norway",Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences; Institute of Transport Economics,"Thrane, C (通讯作者)，Lillehammer Univ Coll, Fac Econ & Org Sci, Box 952, N-2604 Lillehammer, Norway.",christer.thrane@hil.no,,,,,,,14,21,22,2,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We derive a robust approximation of lambda and show how to incorporate liquidity constraints, indivisibilities, and adaptation to a changing environment.

At the WTO Hong Kong Ministerial Conference in December 2005, the AfT initiative' was launched and many high-income member countries pledged to increase their AfT contributions, particularly for the least developed member countries (LDC). This paper aims to assess whether and to what extent the WTO's developing member countries have received more AfT. For this purpose, a system generalised method of moments is applied to a sample of 118 recipient countries for the period 2001-10. We find evidence that while LDC WTO members on average receive relatively more AfT than other developing countries, the difference has not increased since launch of the AfT initiative. Among the three categories of AfT, the positive WTO membership effect for LDC members increased for building productive capacity and for trade policy and regulation, but declined for infrastructure.","[Lee, Hyun-Hoon; Shin, Meehwa] Kangwon Natl Univ, Chunchon, South Korea; [Park, Donghyun] Asian Dev Bank, Manila, Philippines",Kangwon National University; Asian Development Bank,"Lee, HH (通讯作者)，Kangwon Natl Univ, Chunchon, South Korea.",,,,Asian Development Bank [111309]; Kangwon National University [120131317],Asian Development Bank; Kangwon National University,We thank the referee and the associate editor of this journal for very useful comments.

An economic model is developed in which globalisation factors generate health externalities and contribute to global obesity growth. The unbalanced panel data set contains the information for 79 countries over the period 1986-2008. Fixed-effects panel data estimation and quantile regression analysis were used to analyse the data. The fixed-effects panel model results indicate that the impact of trade openness and the globalisation social index (GSI) on global obesity rates is positive and significant, which is consistent with prior expectations, while surprisingly the foreign direct investments (FDI) has no impact on global obesity. While these results are interesting, they are hiding the effect of globalisation processes across the conditional distribution of the obesity variable. The use of quantile regression uncovered that the impact of the FDI and the GSI on low and average quantiles (low and average obesity rates in our sample) is positive and significant, while high quantiles are not affected. Since low and average quantiles (low and average obesity rates) are representative of the less- and medium-developed countries, this result implies that social globalisation and FDI adversely impact obesity in less-to-medium developed countries.

In contrast, this paper argues that combating quintessentially transnational crimes like piracy and money laundering increasingly depends on private transnational companies fighting crime for profit by selling their services to other private firms. The paper broadens the literature on private security and global security governance by focusing on transnational responses to transnational threats in previously neglected maritime and financial realms. The rise of such corporate crime-fighters is explained by the recent evolution of environments structured by overlapping sovereignty claims which limit state enforcement while simultaneously creating new markets for security services. These cases represent instances of global governmentality insofar as they are diffuse, networked exercises of indirect power carried out by private actors, situated in markets, who are responsible for policing themselves and others.","[Liss, Carolin] Peace Res Inst, Frankfurt, Germany; [Sharman, J.

In this paper, I look at these phenomena as processes of a 'neoliberalisation of feminism'. I illustrate such neoliberalisation by introducing women's empowerment projects run by transnational consumer products companies, typically in partnership with public development actors. Under the label of 'corporate social responsibility', these companies invest in women in their supply and marketing chains, seeking to empower them within a neoliberal rationality of government. The paper is an effort to go beyond the critiques of feminism as co-opted. Rather than inventing new feminisms or taking a break from feminism - as some have suggested, I propose that it is more fruitful and necessary to examine, in concrete contexts, the way in which select feminist movement ideas are being integrated into neoliberal rationales and logics, what is lost in the process and what is perhaps gained.","Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Dept Int Relat Polit Sci, CH-1211 Geneva 21, Switzerland",,"Prügl, E (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Dept Int Relat Polit Sci, POB 136, CH-1211 Geneva 21, Switzerland.",elisabeth.pruegl@graduateinstitute.ch,"Prügl, Elisabeth/I-5284-2019","Prügl, Elisabeth/0000-0002-4363-3540",,,,,52,227,243,17,119,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This study critically examines assertions of a possible convergence to neo-liberal standards induced by sovereign bond ratings. By arguing that the role of the agencies in the global political economy has been exaggerated, the study finds that CRAs do not have a direct causal effect on domestic economic reforms. Employing a sample that covers the great majority of rated countries, it is shown that there is a robust trend towards deregulation and reform in accordance with neo-liberal standards. Nevertheless, sovereign bond ratings are not directly related to this process. Lower rated countries, or those more frequently downgraded, do not differ significantly from the highly rated countries in their pattern of policy reform. This result holds for policy domains such as regulation of credit, labour and business, inflation levels, legal structure and security of property rights, and the size of the public sector. It is concluded that the role of the CRAs as potential instigators of domestic reform is limited.","Univ Groningen, Dept Global Econ & Management, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Soudis, D (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Global Econ & Management, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,45,9,10,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This paper shows how to derive a fully Bayesian formula which avoids the Garbage-In/Garbage-Out and Borel Paradoxes.

Two groups of subjects were compared: 80 children of alcohol addicted parents (ChAAP) aged from 7 to 14 years and reference group (RG) of 1000 children selected in terms of age and place of residence. Differences in z scores for height and Body Mass Index (BMI), prevalence of underweight and overweight were assessed. Families of ChAAP were characterized by: lower parents' education, higher unemployment rate, a greater number of children than in RG. The differences between ChAAP and RG in z scores for height (z scores: -0.54 vs. 0.45, t=-7.01, p < 0.001) and BMI (z scores: -0.61 vs. 0.29, t=-6.28, p < 0.001) remained significant when impact of the parents' employment (for height: F = 8.88, p = 0.003; for BMI: F = 21.90, p < 0.001) and the number of children (for height: F = 30.89, p < 0.001; for BMI: F = 21.89, p < 0.001) were controlled. Children raised in families with alcohol addicted parents were shorter and had lower BMI than children of the reference group.

Our data consists of residential property transactions from the 23-ward area of Tokyo. Our results show that the unit prices of residential properties in low-risk zones were between 13,970-17,380 JPY higher than those in high-risk zones depending on the type of seismic hazard risk. In addition, we find that information on seismic hazard risk does not significantly affect the prices of newly constructed apartments, which are more resistant to earthquake damage than older residences.

The expansion trends translate into problems at different locations within an airport system and are more evident when the resources to cope with the demand are limited or are reaching to theirs limits. In the check-in areas they are appreciated as excessive waiting times which in turn are appreciated by the customers as bad service levels. The article presents a novel methodology that combines an evolutionary algorithm and simulation in order to give the best results taking into account not only the mandatory hard and soft rules determined by the internal policies of an airport terminal but also the quality indicators which are very difficult to include using an abstract representation. The evolutionary algorithm is developed to satisfy the different mandatory restrictions for the allocation problem such as minimum and maximum number of check-in desks per flight, load balance in the check-in islands, opening times of check-in desks and other restrictions imposed by the level of service agreement. Once the solutions are obtained, a second evaluation is performed using a simulation model of the terminal that takes into account the stochastic aspects of the problem such as arriving profiles of the passengers, opening times physical configurations of the facility among other with the objective to determine which allocation is the most efficient in real situations in order to maintain the quality indicators at the desired level.

We show that cross-country convergence of Manufacturing energy intensity levels is caused by efficiency improvements in lagging countries, while undermined by increasing international differences in sector structure. Particularly, we find that efficiency-driven catching-up processes only began to dominate the diverging impact of structural changes after 1995, reversing gradual cross-country divergence of Manufacturing energy intensity levels into rapid convergence. Subsequently, we link sector structure dynamics to changing global production patterns under influence of international trade and specialization. We conclude that increasing trade and market integration helped reducing energy productivity gaps across countries, despite the contribution of increasing specialization to growing cross-country variation in sector structure. These trends are mainly driven by energy-intensive sectors, while various countries specialize in sectors for which they do not have a comparative energy productivity advantage.","Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Mulder, P (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",p.mulder@vu.nl,"Mulder, Peter/AAE-1682-2022; Mulder, Peter/R-5057-2017","Mulder, Peter/0000-0002-9578-9299",,,,,49,32,33,0,33,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2015,36.0,3,,,,,111,136,,10.5547/01956574.36.3.pmul,0.0,,,26,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CK8CN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356466100004,0

Further analysis shows that diabetes mainly affects the employment probabilities of men and women above the age of 44 and also has stronger effects on the poor than on the rich, particularly for men. We also find some indication for more adverse effects of diabetes on those in the large informal labour market compared to those in formal employment.

The use of such a comprehensive cross-state panel allows for the estimation of the dynamic responses of inequality and per capita income using panel vector autoregressive (VAR) models. Cumulative impulse responses from a baseline bivariate VAR model indicate that shocks to the Gini index of inequality significantly decrease the level of per capita income. This finding is robust to changes in the measures of inequality used, as well as to the estimation of a three-variable model. We also find that the relationship between inequality and per capita income varies over time and is sensitive to particular episodes in history.","[Atems, Bebonchu] Clarkson Univ, Sch Business, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA; [Jones, Jason] Furman Univ, Dept Econ, Greenville, SC 29613 USA",Clarkson University,"Atems, B (通讯作者)，Clarkson Univ, Sch Business, 8 Clarkson Ave, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA.",batems@clarkson.edu,,,,,,,51,27,31,1,38,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Three major forms of critiques are considered. The first, that of a Church (the Encyclopedistes) fighting a rising heresy (the physiocrats), concludes that the fanaticism of the latter is incompatible with the virtues of tolerance that must characterise the true philosophes. In the second form, the Encyclopedistes and the economistes are assimilated. Both led to the destruction of the old taxonomy of society and even to death, to famine and to a chaos of transgression. The third form concerns the dubious parallel between the y-king of ancient China and the Tableau economique. These three types of cultural writings capture and explain something new - physiocratic political economy - thanks to well-known mental constructs. It stages characters and facts in order to give meaning to events the causes of which are difficult to explain. It is, beyond all the irony and mockery, an attempt to understand and to defuse new fears resulting from this incredible endeavour to change reality.","[Orain, Arnaud] Univ Paris 08, LED, F-93200 St Denis, France; [Orain, Arnaud] Univ Paris 08, Inst Etud Europeennes, F-93200 St Denis, France",Universite Paris-VIII; Universite Paris-VIII,"Orain, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 08, LED, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93200 St Denis, France.",arnaud.orain@univ-paris8.fr,,,,,,,88,13,14,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

We find that promoting greater adoption of insurance significantly increases farmers' sow production, and this effect seems to persist in the longer run; moreover, the increase in sow production in response to the sow insurance does not seem to be the result of the substitution of other livestock.","[Cai, Hongbin; Chen, Yuyu; Zhou, Li-An] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fang, Hanming] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Fang, Hanming] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Peking University; University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Cai, HB (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,"Zhou, Li-An/IUM-6354-2023",,Institute for Economic Policy Research at Peking University; Various government agencies of Jinsha County; Bijie Prefecture in Guizhou Province,Institute for Economic Policy Research at Peking University; Various government agencies of Jinsha County; Bijie Prefecture in Guizhou Province,"We thank the editor, Asim Khwaja, and three anonymous referees for extremely thoughtful comments and suggestions that significantly improved this paper.

The pact stipulates various measures to strengthen competitiveness with the ultimate aim of preventing accumulation of unsustainable external imbalances. This article uses Granger causality tests to assess the short-term linkages between changes in relative unit labour costs and changes in the current account balance for the period 1995-2011. The main finding is that changes in the current account balance precede changes in relative unit labour costs, while there is no discernible effect in the opposite direction. This suggests that capital flows from the European core to the periphery contributed to the divergence in unit labour costs across Europe prior to the global financial crisis. The results also suggest that the measures to restrain unit labour costs may have only limited effect on the current account balance in the short term.","[Gabrisch, Hubert] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Halle, Germany; [Staehr, Karsten] Tallinn Univ Technol, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH); Tallinn University of Technology,"Staehr, K (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Akad Tee 3-486, EE-12618 Tallinn, Estonia.",karsten.staehr@ttu.ee,"Staehr, Karsten/G-4707-2016","Staehr, Karsten/0000-0002-2128-6672; Gabrisch, Hubert/0000-0001-8825-4600",Estonian Base Financing grant [B617A]; Estonian Target Financing grant [SF0140059s12],Estonian Base Financing grant; Estonian Target Financing grant,"The authors would like to thank Massimo del Gatto, three anonymous referees and the editor of JCMS for useful comments.

The cost of owning a gun depends on the extent of gun regulations, and the differences in gun policies between jurisdictions in a federal system entail cross-jurisdiction gun buying. By contrast, in a unitary system, gun regulations are uniform across jurisdictions, and cross-jurisdiction gun buying is absent. As cross-jurisdiction gun buying enables residents of a jurisdiction to buy guns from other jurisdictions with less stringent regulations, federalism tends to increase gun ownership relative to a unitary system. In addition, more stringent regulations of a jurisdiction decrease the number of illegal guns that criminals of other jurisdictions can purchase, reducing crimes in other jurisdictions and benefiting other jurisdictions. However, the jurisdiction does not consider the external benefits on other jurisdictions when setting its gun policies, and gun policies tend be too lax relative to the efficient level. The paper also provides an empirical analysis of the effect of federalism on gun ownership, and available evidence suggests that gun ownership depends on federalism. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the institutional determinants of deliberation within joint parliamentary committees (JPCs) - longstanding instruments of EU enlargement policy. The empirical analysis reveals a dynamic relationship between deliberation' and debate' as extreme modes of interaction that co-exist within the same setting. It also suggests that deliberation is a product of participants' constant efforts to maintain equal power relations and low issue-area sensitivity. This study provides new evidence on deliberative politics at the EU level. In addition, it highlights the role of inter-parliamentary deliberation as a catalyst for political co-operation and policy co-ordination, at a time of intensifying enlargement fatigue and growing Euroscepticism both at home and abroad.","[Ozcurumez, Saime; Hoxha, Julinda] Bilkent Univ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Ozcurumez, S (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",saime@bilkent.edu.tr,"Özçürümez, Saime/JMQ-5527-2023","Özçürümez, Saime/0000-0003-3957-6915",,,,,48,4,5,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In this paper, we extend this desirability relation to simple games with coalition structure. In these games, players organize themselves into a priori disjoint coalitions. It appears that the desirability relation defined in this paper is a complete preorder in the class of swap-robust games. We also compare our desirability relation with the preorders induced by the generalizations to games with coalition structure of the Shapley-Shubik and Banzhaf-Coleman power indices (Owen, Lecture notes in economics and mathematical systems: Essays in honor of Oskar Morgenstern.

However, there is very little evidence on how rail passengers value different seating experiences. On the back of exploratory research, and including attitudinal evidence, this paper provides significant and original insights into rail passengers' preferences in this area. The primary evidence base is a Stated Preference experiment, complemented by a novel Revealed Preference exercise that uses CCTV footage to observe where rail passengers prefer to sit. The valuations, expressed as travel time multipliers, obtained from the Stated Preference exercise are generally plausible and exhibit a wide range according to the precise seating configuration, the occupancy level and the seating position within a layout. The innovative Revealed Preference analysis provides an encouraging degree of support to the Stated Preference results which, reassuringly, can themselves be reconciled with related valuations widely used in the railway industry in Britain and also the findings of the exploratory and attitudinal research. Whilst we are interested here solely in obtaining valuations, we demonstrate how they can be used in demand forecasting. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Can instrumental variation better be explained from a realist or from an idealist perspective? Realism would predict that sanctions are more likely in the absence of historical, security or commercial interests. Idealism would suggest that sanctions are more likely in the case of grave violations of democracy and human rights, in countries that are unstable and economically underperforming, and when there is pressure from regional organizations and domestic actors. Empirically, the article compares two cases (Guinea and Niger) where the EU imposed sanctions and two non-cases (Ethiopia and Rwanda) where the EU was reluctant to do so. Contrary to the prevalent thesis in the literature, the article finds stronger evidence for idealism (which is confirmed in all the cases) than for realism (which is only confirmed in the cases of Guinea and Ethiopia).","[Del Biondo, Karen] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Del Biondo, Karen] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Free University of Berlin; Ghent University,"Del Biondo, K (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",karen.delbiondo@gmail.com,,,,,,,90,15,18,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Due to indivisibilities, in certain situations, two agents with equal claims may have to receive unequal amounts. Our main goal is to find rules that deal with these situations in a consistent way. We propose three systematic favorability properties. We define a subfamily of up (down) rules studied in Moulin and Stong (Math Oper Res 27:1-30, 2002). We show that the subfamily are the only rules satisfying our first systematic favorability property, composition up, and bilateral consistency. Another family of rules we study are the sequential priority rules. Given a priority order over agents, we satisfy their claims one agent at a time until the resource runs out. These rules are the only ones that satisfy our second systematic favorability property, composition down, and bilateral consistency. Using duality, we also provide another characterization of the sequential priority rules, with our third systematic favorability property. Besides, we provide an alternative characterization of the rules studied in Herrero and Martinez (Soc Choice Welf 30:603-617, 2008).","Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University,"Chen, SW (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",chensw6@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,"Chen, Siwei/0000-0002-8486-2251",,,,,19,10,10,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2015,44.0,2,,,,,283,300,,10.1007/s00355-014-0828-5,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CA5YG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348984000004,0

Within this framework and on a rich single-crossing domain, the paper characterizes the family of continuous, strategy-proof and individually rational social choice functions whose range belongs to the interior of the set of feasible allocations. This family is shown to be the class of generalized trading rules. This result highlights the importance of the concavification argument in the characterization of fixed-price trading rules provided by Barbera and Jackson (Econometrica 63:51-87, 1995), an argument that does not hold under single-crossing. The paper also shows how several features of abstract single-crossing domains, such as the existence of an ordering over the set of preference relations, can be derived endogenously in economic environments by exploiting the additional structure of classical preferences.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Goswami, MP (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",prabal.prabal@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2015,44.0,2,,,,,389,422,,10.1007/s00355-014-0834-7,0.0,,,34,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CA5YG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348984000009,0

The model predicts that groups of noise traders are busy communicating when market uncertainty is high. In particular, we examine the effects of social interactions on price movements, based on parameter estimation of the group behavior. As traders' reactions to new information act much like an endogenous shock on return volatility, however, we cannot easily find an exact solution for the model with social interactions. Thus, simulation-based inference is used for the model validation; we investigate whether our artificial economy can match the empirical moments observed in five major foreign exchange data sets (as closely as possible).

The experiment used an innovative desktop simulation in which 32 fourth and fifth grade African-American children and 30 parents viewed and explored pairs of virtual walk-through streets manipulated on disorder (across three contexts and two other street and sidewalk characteristics) and picked from each pair the one to walk on (child) or for the child to walk on (parent). Each participant was asked to report the reasons for the choices. The analysis revealed that children and their parents were more likely to walk (or have the child walk) on streets lower in disorder. Reported reasons for choices confirmed the importance of physical disorder in affecting walking choices. Low-cost improvements in order may make streets more desirable for recreational walking.

It then estimates a macro production function using micro models for ICT investment, telecommunication demand, and PC penetration. The estimation results suggest that the three categories of ICT capital stock, together with telephone and PC penetration rates, positively and significantly influence productivity growth in the selected high-income economies.

The use of antioxidants additives in polymers for food packaging is a common practice to reduce their potential thermo-oxidative degradation during processing and they could also prevent the food oxidation reducing the direct addition of antioxidants to the food. Among them, the great interest towards the use of renewable natural resources in the food packaging industry makes natural antioxidants candidates to stabilize biodegradable polymer formulations. In this sense, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) seems to be the most attractive biodegradable polymer for food packaging industry. Thus, the aim of this work was to study the thermal degradation of PLA films stabilized with D-limonene. Kinetic parameters were obtained by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in dynamic mode and the apparent activation energies (Ea) were calculated by the Friedman method. The comparison of Ea between PLA stabilized with D-limonene and non-stabilized polymer furnished information on the thermal stabilization performance.

Identification and characterization of these genes are essential to implementing efficient disease control and prevention systems. The aim of this study is to identify the cell envelope virulence associated genes of B. melitensis strains in Palestine. A total of 80 non-repetitive B. melitensis isolates were obtained from milk samples collected from infected small ruminants in the northern districts of the West Bank, Palestine during 2013 and 2015. The milk were cultured on Brucella agar (Oxoid) then incubated at 37(0)C for 3 to7 days. Positive cultures were identified by standard biochemical methods and confirmed by IS711 and Rev 1 rpsL gene PCR. All samples were negative for vaccine strain Rev 1 rpsL gene-PCR.

Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of family and non-family firms listed on the Milan Stock Exchange over a period of 6 years (2008-2013), we empirically test the two alternative hypotheses of innovation enhancing and innovation stifling by performing a multiple regression analysis. Following previous research, we use firm-level R&D expenditures to capture the firms' creative and inventive activities. As independent variables, we consider the family involvement in ownership and management. We control our results for a set of control variables that likely affect the firm innovation propensity, namely: firm age; growth opportunities; capital intensity; size; profitability, cash flow, leverage and industry. Originality/value - This study analyzes the innovation strategies of family firms compared with non-family firms, within an institutional setting characterized by a high presence of listed family firms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing the R&D spending behaviour of all Italian listed companies (financial and football firms excluded). Our empirical results are based on a sample of 982 firm-year observations covering the period of 2008-2013. Practical implications - The findings may lead the investment community to reevaluate the effectiveness of management policies adopted by family members running the company. In particular, our results are valuable to investors and other stakeholders, suggesting that in setting characterized by high percentage of listed family firms, the involvement of family members in top management could not be detrimental to the value-maximization of the firm, at least in the long run; thereby favoring not only the future well-being for family members but also for other firm stakeholders.","[Biscotti, Anna Maria] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, I-71121 Foggia, Italy; [D'Amico, Eugenio] Univ Roma 3, Dept Polit Sci, I-00145 Rome, Italy",University of Foggia; Roma Tre University,"Biscotti, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Via R Caggese 1, I-71121 Foggia, Italy.",,,,,,,,50,0,0,0,7,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1316,1327,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200101,0

Japan utilized its economic, and financial potential to play an active role in the region in the face of financial crisis 1997-98, attempting to build prestige and support emerging regional frameworks as a leader and institution - supplier. The paper is studying Japan's financial regionalist policy since the 90s through the prism of intra- and extra-regional rivalry over leadership with, respectively, China, and the United States. An analysis is centred around the project of Asian Monetary Fund, announced by Tokyo in the wake of Asian financial crisis, however, blocked by the United States, and, to some extent, China. As a consequence of the global crisis 2007-2009, Chiang Mai Initiative has been multilateralized in the form of a single financial contract. Again, a debate on the Asian Monetary Fund project has been resumed. Finally, recent Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank project by China is addressed. The paper is an attempt to study the evolution of Japan's policy towards financial regionalism to understand hegemonic aspirations of Japan, while considering conflicts of interests of Tokyo, Beijing, and Washington. A theoretical context is drawn basing on financial regionalism and hegemonic stability theories.","[Bobowski, Sebastian] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Bobowski, S (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",sebastian.bobowski@ue.wroc.pl,"Bobowski, Sebastian SB/Q-3884-2018",,,,,,8,1,1,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,188,198,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000018,0

There is significant potential to improve the GDP and reduce poverty by establishing a wholesale market in POM. This study investigated the feasibility of establishing a wholesale market in POM considering the constraints in fresh produce chains from Central Province and the Highlands Provinces. It involved interviews in PNG, New Zealand and Australia, and a survey of existing infrastructure. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and market operations modelled under twelve financial scenarios. The research concluded that the provision of a wholesale market in POM could improve the efficiency and effectiveness of fresh produce supply chains by drawing the majority of fresh produce into one venue promoting price and quality competition, improving the sustainability of supply and reducing supply risk for buyers. In doing so, it would improve the future inclusion of smallholders in the emerging fresh produce marketing system. However, it was also concluded that the investment in fresh produce chain improvements should be staged over 3-5 years to allow capacity development within the chain, to improve security in POM retail markets and ensure the inclusion of the unemployed and working poor in the system whilst a new wholesale market was constructed.","[Bonney, L.

Indian per capita GDP declined steadily during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries before stabilising during the nineteenth century. As British growth increased from the mid-seventeenth century, India fell increasingly behind. Whereas in 1600, Indian per capita GDP was over 60% of the British level, by 1871 it had fallen to less than 15%. These estimates place the origins of the Great Divergence firmly in the early modem period, but also suggest a relatively prosperous India at the height of the Mughal Empire. They also suggest a period of strong deindustrialisation during the first three decades of the nineteenth century, with a small decline of industrial output rather than just a declining share of industry in economic activity.

This is particularly true with reference to culture and cultural diversities. According to the underlined gap, our paper aims to investigate the role of culture, and cultural diversities, in defining Corporate Social Innovation (CSI). Design/methodology/approach - The paper is theoretically grounded and based on an inductive approach. An extensive literary review about Innovation and Corporate Social Responsibility - as well as about their cultural drivers - has been carried to gain a wide understanding of CSI as a trade-off between firms' innovative attitude and their propensity to reach social aims. Hofstede's cultural model has been, finally, used to interpret the cultural insights of CSI in two different contexts, Italy and Iran. Empirical evidences have been collected thanks to the contribution of the University of Asham, Iran. They allow us to complete the theoretical considerations developed about Iranian firms' social orientation. Originality/value - Our paper contribute to the literature improving about CSI by developing a more comprehensive knowledge and culturally-based understanding within a still unexplored field. Practical implications - Our paper will expand the ability of both Academics and Practitioners to recognize culture as key driver of CSI. In doing this, it opens up future exploitations about the way culture and cultural diversities may be managed in order to improve the effectiveness of firms' innovative practices with reference to corporate and collective well-being.","[Canestrino, Rossella] Parthenope Univ Naples, Dept Adm & Quantitat Studies, I-80132 Naples, Italy; [Bonfanti, Angelo] Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, I-37129 Verona, Italy; [Oliaee, Leila] Iran Azad Univ Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran",Parthenope University Naples; University of Verona,"Canestrino, R (通讯作者)，Parthenope Univ Naples, Dept Adm & Quantitat Studies, Via Gen Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy.",,,,,,,,46,0,0,0,17,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,390,402,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200030,0

Worldwide, the development of MOOCs has gained popularity also in the management and entrepreneurship domain, where a number of providers have started to offer MOOCs addressed to diffuse entrepreneurial competencies and skills. This paper presents an application of MOOCs to support the development of entrepreneurial competencies. A purposeful roadmap has been set up to identify the set of actors and activities involved in the design, implementation and monitoring of an entrepreneurial project. Each activity of the roadmap is defined in terms of inputs, outputs, tasks and enabling competences to be acquired. Based on the roadmap, a customized open platform for MOOC delivery has been thus developed along with a set of experimental courses and some guidelines to better engage learners and instructors. Design/methodology/approach - The article is grounded on behaviourism, constructivism and connectivism learning theories, and their relationship with ICT, in the aim to frame MOOC as an emergent pedagogical approach capable to experiment networked learning. A preliminary analysis of literature on MOOC methodology and approach, as well as on the study of international cases of MOOC adoption in entrepreneurship education has been made. Then, based on a design science approach, a MOOC platform dedicated to stimulate entrepreneurial culture and competencies has been realized, and preliminary feedbacks have been collected from instructors and learners. The six phases of design science approach have been set up, problem identification, definition of research goal, artefact development, demonstration, evaluation and research communication. Originality/value - The value of the article can be identified in three main elements: i) the personalized approach to access MOOCs based on a structured roadmap of the entrepreneurial process; ii) the role that companies can play in the MOOC platform (e.g. course design, content production, course delivery, feedback analysis); iii) the possibility to experiment a blended approach in the use of MOOCs as a tool for competence development in the entrepreneurship domain. Practical implications - The article provides useful insights for the design of effective MOOC-based learning experiences in the technology entrepreneurship domain. In particular, a set of guidelines concerning the role of each actor of the learning process (including companies) and the implementation of effective blended (physical and on-line) experience are provided. Finally, the study presents a practical discussion about how to capitalize the value generated by MOOCs.","[Cirulli, Federica; Elia, Gianluca; Margherita, Alessandro] Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, Lecce, Italy; [Lorenzo, Gianluca; Solazzo, Gianluca] Univ Salento, Ctr Interdipartimentale Cultura Innovat Impresa, Lecce, Italy",University of Salento; University of Salento,"Cirulli, F (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, Univ Address Ctr Ecotekne Pal O SP 6, Lecce, Italy.",,"ELIA, Gianluca/N-5942-2015; Margherita, Alessandro/AAI-8018-2020; Solazzo, Gianluca/GZL-4946-2022; Cirulli, Federica/AAP-2713-2020","Margherita, Alessandro/0000-0002-7091-1024;",,,,,44,0,0,0,14,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,58,70,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200004,0

At the same time, the existence of a conspiracy makes detection by management or other agencies more probable because of the chance that one of the conspirators or someone who has been approached to join the conspiracy will report the fraud. However, the discovery of major conspiracies to commit fraud and financial crime in companies, such as Enron and the Madoff Investment Securities case, where the auditor was himself convicted as one of the conspirators, suggests the need to re-evaluate the reasonability of asking auditors to assess the risk of a criminal conspiracy existing and the probability of financial crimes committed by the conspirators remaining undetected. This paper proposes a model for the auditor to use in making such an assessment, thereby enhancing the auditor's assessment of the reliability of the overall audit.

To this end, switching models conditional on the usually chosen transport mode, unconditional switching models and holding models were investigated and compared. The aim was threefold: (i) to analyse the feasibility of a inter-urban carsharing program; (ii) to investigate the main determinants of the choice behaviour; (iii) to compare different approaches (switching vs. holding; conditional vs. unconditional); (iv) to investigate different modelling solutions within the random utility framework (homoscedastic, heteroscedastic and cross-correlated closed-form solutions). The set of models was calibrated on a stated preferences survey carried out on users commuting within the metropolitan area of Salerno, in particular with regard to the home-to-work trips from/to Salerno (the capital city of the Salerno province) to/from the three main municipalities belonging to the metropolitan area of Salerno. All of the involved municipalities significantly interact each other, the average trip length is about 30 km a day and all are served by public transport. The proposed carsharing program was a one-way service, working alongside public transport, with the possibility of sharing the same car among different users, with free parking slots and free access to the existent restricted traffic areas. Results indicated that the interurban carsharing service may be a substitute of the car transport mode, but also it could be a complementary alternative to the transit system in those time periods in which the service is not guaranteed or efficient. Estimation results highlighted that the conditional switching approach is the most effective one, whereas travel monetary cost, access time to carsharing parking slots, gender, age, trip frequency, car availability and the type of trip (home-based) were the most significant attributes. Elasticity results showed that access time to the parking slots predominantly influences choice probability for bus and carpool users; change in carsharing travel costs mainly affects carpool users; change in travel costs of the usually chosen transport mode mainly affects car and carpool users.

For integrated assessment of Russian position at the world market of meat and for inter country comparisons, we proposed to use cluster analysis to develop multivariate classification of the countries being the major meat producers. The classification results made it possible both to reveal three clusters of the countries with similarities and common problems in the development of the meat market, and to determine the position of Russia in the obtained categorizing. With the purpose of evaluation of the revealed cluster structure stability, comparison of the results, which were obtained within the period of 2000-2013, was carried out. Detailed explanation of the revealed countries' displacement between the clusters was presented. During the whole investigated period, Russia was placed in the cluster, where average values of indices being analyzed were lower as compared to appropriate values of the cluster of the countries-world market leaders. With the purpose of detailed description of the Russian meat market development trends, the dynamics for the major indices of market demand-supply situation were described.

Rationality itself is usually differently determined what is closely connected to various concepts of human. Despite numerous reservations in economic and other sciences, the standard economic human model rationality neoclassic concept, so called homo oeconomicus - still prevails. Characteristics and limitations of the homo economicus model can be critically confronted with the decision making of real human beings, including the importance and an impact of irrationality, altruism, etc. In addition, there are other approaches to modeling of a human behavior (and not only economic rationality) and has often cross interdisciplinary boundaries of mainstream. The inspiration can be found for example in the emerging behavioral, or the experimental economics. Also the deeper analysis of specifics of life indigenous nations promises a significant contribution in this area. The current global society faces many problems that may, due to their nature, have fatal consequences for mankind.

The level of infestation varied with location ranging from 3 to 36%. At some locations, B. invadens shared the same fruit with the indigenous fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata but occurred at higher numbers than C. capitata. Among the five Citrus species sampled, sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) recorded the highest level of infestation compared with other species. There was a significant inverse relationship between numbers of B. invadens/kg of fruits and elevation at which fruits were collected. Field trails were conducted on sweet orange during the fruiting and off seasons to compare catches of B. invadens in Multilure trap baited with 6 food-based attractants (Mazoferm, Torula yeast, Hymlure, Molasses, Mango juice and Nulure). During the fruiting season, Mazoferm and Torula yeast were the most effective attractants and captured between 2.4-2.8 times more females and 3.2-4.1 times more males, respectively than the standard Nulure. In the off season, Mazoferm and Torula yeast captured between 2.5-2.7 times more females and 3.7-4.3 times more males, respectively, than Nulure. In field suppression trials using Mazoferm-spinosad bait spray, % reduction in B. invadens population relative to control was 82% at 4-weeks after bait spray, and 94% at 8-weeks after treatment application. At harvest, % fruit infestation was significantly lower in the treated orchards (5%) compared with the control orchards (39%) and demonstrates the efficacy of bait spray for the management of B. invadens on citrus.","Int Ctr Insect Physiol & Ecol, Nairobi, Kenya",International Centre of Insect Physiology & Ecology (ICIPE),"Ekesi, S (通讯作者)，Int Ctr Insect Physiol & Ecol, POB 30772, Nairobi, Kenya.",sekesi@icipe.org,"Ekesi, Sunday/P-8944-2019",,,,,,25,11,11,0,3,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1019,1026,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600127,0

It found that in Balochistan over 40,000 had failed. When the project looked to the value chain literature to see what organisational format it could use to facilitate the marketing of its producers' products, it found little to guide it. Consequently, the project developed the farmer marketing collective (FMC). This paper describes the five key issues that distinguish an FMC from a cooperative. It outlines the training that has been provided to the members of the FMCs. In a major shift in orientation, the project provides in equal measures, production and business training to FMCs. An equally distinctive feature of the FMCs in Balochistan is the role of business support service providers and reliance on own capital, a paradigm shift away from the traditional loan and free advice dependency syndrome typically found in South Asia.","[Essa, A.

Research has established creativity as being related mostly to the individual (e.g. Kurtzberg and Amabile, 2001). On the other hand, innovation has largely been treated as an organizational level construct, while neglecting the moments when collective creative insights occur (Hargadon and Bechky, 2006). Creativity and innovation on the collective level relies on group processes and collaboration. Studies on ensembles in arts increase our understanding of group interaction that produces creative outputs (Hatch, 1999; Murnighan & Conlon, 1999; Sawyer, 1999). However, little research has been done to understand the nuances of interaction processes that produce collective creativity. Thus, this paper studies interaction patterns across different arts ensembles. Methodology - Data for this research came from semi-structured in-depth interviews with 12 expert practitioners. The participants came from the disciplines of music, theatre, dance and fine arts. The data were approached against a framework, consisting of three overarching themes: Vision and Purpose; Ensemble structure, member skills, artistic materials, context; and Leadership and intensity of interactions. Originality/value - The results show that the overarching theme of Leadership and intensity of interactions is key in understanding moments of collective creativity. Those emphasizing the collective interaction before individual skill expressed much greater likelihood of collective creativity emerging. In addition, this study shows the distinctiveness of different art forms and how individual and collective creativity is understood through ensemble practices. Practical implications - The framework on collaborative working can be applied in any organisation aiming at collective creativity processes.","[Furu, Patrick] Univ Arts Helsinki, Dept Arts Management, Sibelius Acad, FI-00097 Uniarts, Finland; [Gaunt, Helena F.] Guildhall Sch Mus & Drama Barbican, London EC2Y 8DT, England; [Treacy, Danielle] Univ Arts Helsinki, Dept Mus Educ, Sibelius Acad, FI-00097 Uniarts, Finland",University of the Arts Helsinki; University of the Arts Helsinki,"Furu, P (通讯作者)，Univ Arts Helsinki, Dept Arts Management, Sibelius Acad, POB 1, FI-00097 Uniarts, Finland.",,"Treacy, Danielle/AAI-9215-2021","Treacy, Danielle/0000-0001-7347-6737",,,,,27,0,0,0,9,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,677,685,,,,,,9,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200052,0

Producers from Europe and the Southern Hemisphere such as South Africa compete directly in European markets. In this context, the factors driving apple production in South Africa, Italy and Germany and their impacts on competitiveness are analysed. The study uses national statistics and typical farms in major production regions to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current situation and expected trends in apple production systems. While Germany produces mainly for domestic markets, both Italy and South Africa export 43% of their production. The most important export destination for Italian apples is Germany: however this market has declined over the past decade. Other export destinations for Italian apples are Spain and the Russian Federation. South Africa's main buyers for apples are the UK and Malaysia, but exports to other African countries and the Middle East have increased. Farm sizes are much smaller in Europe than in South Africa, however structural change towards larger farms is a global trend. The farm level analysis shows cost advantages for larger farm sizes in Italy and Germany.

The prescribed and adopted restrictive measures caused an economic depression of the Greece that was associated with very high social costs (e.g. historically high unemployment or an unprecedented fall in incomes). Actual economic misery of Greece calls in question whether the strict deflationary policies might themselves rebuild the economic balance or they finally do the opposite. This paper has ambition to analyse the appropriateness and the success of the applied policy mix in Greece in respect to identified key shortcomings of the Greek economy and triggers of the subsequent financial crisis. The cross-country comparison with the managed deflationary policy in Latvia or other EU countries might help us to confirm or exclude the hypothesis that the misery of Greek economy has been caused by inappropriate policy-mix adopted in Greece or failure to promote advised policy measures.,"[Horska, Helena] SKODA AUTO VYSOKA SKOLA Ops, Karmeli 1457, Mlada Boleslav 29301, Czech Republic; [Horska, Helena; Milucka, Daniela; Marek, Jan] Raiffeisenbank As, Prague 14078 4, Czech Republic; [Marek, Jan] Univ Karlova Praze, IES, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic",Skoda Auto University; Charles University Prague,"Horská, H (通讯作者)，SKODA AUTO VYSOKA SKOLA Ops, Karmeli 1457, Mlada Boleslav 29301, Czech Republic.",helena.horska@rb.cz; daniela.milucka@rb.cz; honzamarek92@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,541,555,,,,,,15,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000052,0

It highlights their role as sources of some of the most influential ideas about nationhood, governance and state now shaping public discourse on the UK's membership of the EU. These include radical-democratic, restorationist and Anglo-British forms of patriotic discourse, which have prompted and responded to the growing prevalence of England as an imagined community' - a trend which has rendered other circles of attachment to the UK and Europe more tenuous and distant. A central conclusion of the article is that these emerging perspectives have spawned webs of belief that connect new and old ideas of nationhood to the political judgements that different actors are making about the EU.

Greater openness to external cooperation, together with uncertainty that accompanies every innovation directs the attention to the social context of this process (Baregheh et al., 2009) and the role of managers in creating conditions conducive to innovativeness (Terziovski, Morgan, 2006; Drucker, 2008; Hueske, Guenther, 2015). The article corresponds with two research streams concerning innovativeness. The former regards the evaluation of enterprises' openness to innovativeness; the latter refers to the role of managers in creating conditions conducive to innovativeness. The paper aims to evaluate the openness of the surveyed enterprises to innovations and their innovativeness, and also to identify the factors conducive to the openness of enterprises in the area of management. The paper serves to fill the gap that ensues from lack of research on the determinants of innovativeness of Polish enterprises with reference to openness to innovations. Design/methodology/approach - The presented research constitutes a part of a larger research project, the aim of which was to identify the decision-making determinants in the process of implementing RFID system in Polish enterprises (Radio Frequency IDentification with autonomous semi-passive RFID tag (API)). The study uses the results of the analysis of the research conducted in 202 Polish companies. The data used in the analysis were gathered by means of a questionnaire completed in a direct or an electronic form by companies' owners, medium and high-level managers making decisions concerning investments or responsible for them. There were applied the statistical methods of analysing the data, the sampling of which ensued from the specific objectives of the research (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test, factor analysis). Originality/value - The research indicates that the innovativeness of an enterprise is ambiguous as far as its openness to innovations is concerned, which constituted the basis for distinguishing four types of companies. The article presents the characteristics of innovative enterprises which are open to innovations (I/O) and non-innovative ones which are closed to innovations (N/C). It was proved that the three features of the managers of the surveyed companies, i.e., management style, work management skills and orientation towards organisation's development influence their assignment to a certain type of enterprise. Practical implications - One can indicate two areas of practical implications of the conducted research. The former refers to the characteristics of non-innovative and closed to innovations companies, which indicates organisations that most frequently lack innovativeness. The latter comprises personal practices, i.e., sampling, training, evaluation, motivation, which can also include the tools for proper formation of managers' skills, which enable them to build social conditions facilitating the innovativeness of enterprises.","[Kmiotek, Krystyna; Chudy-Laskowska, Katarzyna; Jankowska-Mihulowicz, Marzena] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Fac Management, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland",Rzeszow University of Technology,"Kmiotek, K (通讯作者)，Rzeszow Univ Technol, Fac Management, Al Powstancow Warszawy 12, PL-35959 Rzeszow, Poland.",,"Jankowska-Mihułowicz, Marzena/HQN-2442-2023; Chudy-Laskowska, Katarzyna/AAG-9921-2019","Jankowska-Mihułowicz, Marzena/0000-0002-7382-0515; Chudy-Laskowska, Katarzyna/0000-0002-7797-2858",,,,,31,1,1,0,9,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1941,1952,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200150,0

The air was supplied to the boiler through a fan under the grate at a speed of 1 m.s(-1) and 2.5 m.s(-1). There were significantly different emissions of CO, NO and SO2 under varying conditions of airflow supply to the boiler. Emissions of NO and SO2 depended mainly on nitrogen and sulfur contents in the biomass, while CO emissions were mainly dependent on the amount of supplied air. Such heating devices allow for ecological combustion of pellets made of a plant biomass, but air distribution needs to be improved. It is advisable to develop nomograms to facilitate the selection of airflow speed in relation to the biofuel used for a specific boiler type, ensuring its use in accordance with the concept of sustainable development.

We have analyzed physiological parameters and the transcriptome profiles of photosynthetically active leaves from citrus trees acclimatized to moderate salinity (NaCl 30 mM) after 2 years treatment. Through functional genomics, global gene expression in response to NaCl treatment in mature (8 months-old) and young (2 months-old) leaves has been analyzed and compared. Although young leaves (YL) accumulated low levels of chloride (0.51%+/- 0.06), they exhibited a much stronger response to salinity in term of the number of differentially expressed genes (1,211 genes) compared with mature leaves (ML), which accumulated higher chloride levels (1.05%+/- 0.01), and exhibited a much lower number of differentially-responsive genes (100 genes). In this work, a number of responses have been observed that differ from those described in previous studies of citrus plants non-acclimatized to salt stress (Brumos et al., 2009), whose principal manifestation was the lack of repression of primary metabolism in leaves at the molecular and physiological levels. Results describing enriched functional categories of differentially expressed genes are presented and discussed highlighting how the long-term acclimation to NaCl stress involves drastically different molecular strategies depending on the developmental stage of plant leaves.","[Perez-Perez, Juan G.; Gomez-Gomez, Antonio G.; Botia, Pablo] Inst Murciano Invest & Desarrollo Agr & Alimentar, Dept Citriculture, Murcia, Spain; [Brumos, Javier; Talon, Manuel] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Genom, Valencia, Spain; [Colmenero-Flores, Jose M.] CSIC, Inst Recursos Nat & Agrobiol, E-41080 Seville, Spain",Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Recursos Naturales y Agrobiologia de Sevilla (IRNAS),"Colmenero-Flores, JM (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Recursos Nat & Agrobiol, E-41080 Seville, Spain.",chemacf@irnase.csic.es,"Pérez-Pérez, Juan/Q-6244-2016; ORDAZ, PABLO BOTIA/AAT-4462-2021; Talon, Manuel/C-8540-2014; Pérez-Pérez, Juan Gabriel/AAK-7597-2020; Brumos Fuentes, Javier/A-8055-2017; Colmenero-Flores, Jose Manuel/K-7160-2014","Pérez-Pérez, Juan/0000-0002-8012-119X; ORDAZ, PABLO BOTIA/0000-0002-3646-3264; Talon, Manuel/0000-0003-4291-9333; Pérez-Pérez, Juan Gabriel/0000-0002-8012-119X; Brumos Fuentes, Javier/0000-0002-6503-9593; Colmenero-Flores, Jose Manuel/0000-0001-9475-1187",,,,,37,1,1,0,10,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1359,1369,,,,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600172,0

It is based on the continuous data measurements by a microcontroller based circuitry of a solar module used for supplying a multi-functional wireless sensor for agriculture. The solar module consists of two monocrystalline solar cells (c-Si) flat design, highly transparent and having UV stable front encapsulation. The data is not only a simple day and night information, but a measurement of the solar radiation. The device is able to measure the environment temperature as well, therefore the data is useful for evaluation of the photoperiodism, but the correlation between solar radiation and temperature is also possible. The data is transmitted to a host controller able to store and process higher volume information. As a conclusion, the research seeks to provide a low-cost solution for small and medium size farms based on the very solar cells used to supply low-power consumption electronic modules of the wireless network sensors for an optimal recovery of production depending on the type of culture.

RNA interference (RNAi), an approach based on using dsRNA to trigger RNA silencing, has been widely used for generating transgenic plants resistant against viruses. Considering the important role of p23, p20 and p25 in CTV pathogenesis, we obtained transgenic Mexican lime plants with an intron-hairpin vector carrying full untranslatable versions of genes p25, p20, p23 and the 3'-UTR from the CTV strain T36, to attempt silencing their expression in CTV-infected cells. Complete resistance to viral infection was observed in three transgenic lines, with all their propagations remaining symptomless and virus-free after graft-inoculation with CTV-T36, either in the non-transgenic rootstock or directly in the transgenic scion. Accumulation of transgene-derived siRNAs was necessary but not sufficient for CTV resistance. When immune transformants were challenged with a dissimilar CTV strain the resistance was partially broken, stressing the importance of sequence identity in the underlying RNAi mechanism. This is the first evidence that it is possible to achieve full resistance to CTV in a highly sensitive citrus host by targeting simultaneously its three viral silencing suppressors through RNAi.","[Soler, Nuria; Plomer, Montserrat; Fagoaga, Carmen; Moreno, Pedro; Navarro, Luis; Pena, Leandro] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain; [Flores, Ricardo] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Biol Mol & Celular Plantas UPV CSIC, E-46071 Valencia, Spain",Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; CSIC-UPV - Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular de Plantas (IBMCP),"Peña, L (通讯作者)，Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain.",lpenya@ibmcp.csic.es,"Peña, Leandro/F-9089-2014; Fagoaga, Carmen/AAP-2550-2021; Navarro, Luis/D-1001-2012; Flores, Ricardo/K-2788-2014","Fagoaga, Carmen/0000-0001-6492-7604; Navarro, Luis/0000-0001-5163-5960; Flores, Ricardo/0000-0002-3033-5077",,,,,24,0,0,0,5,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,703,709,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600088,0

In the study, DI strategies were adopted on a young orange orchard in Sicily (Southern Italy) and crop physiological features were monitored and analysed for possible negative effects. The orchard includes 300, 4-years old, trees, irrigated with drip and sub-drip irrigation systems. Four irrigation strategies (replicated 3 times), based on DI concepts, were adopted, each supplying different percentages (50, 75, 100%) of the irrigation requirement (IR). IR values were calculated via the Penman-Monteith model, by assuming a crop coefficient (K-c) of 0.45 typical for immature orchard, and correction coefficients accounting for the localized irrigation. Several physiological indices were measured during the trial, including Leaf Area Index, stem water potential, canopy temperature, and trunk diameter, among others. Preliminary observations, obtained during the two irrigation periods (2011-2012), evidenced slight variations of xylematic potential and stomata conductance among the monitored treatments. LAI, canopy volume and trunk circumference increases were quite similar among treatments. Accordingly, trees growth seems to sustain the imposed water restrictions, without significant stress symptoms on the analyzed physiological features.","[Stagno, Fiorella; Roccuzzo, Giancarlo; Allegra, Maria; Intrigliolo, Francesco] Ctr Ric Agrumicoltura & Colture Mediterranee CRA, Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, Acireale, CT, Italy; [Stagno, Fiorella; Parisi, Rosaria; Cirelli, Giuseppe; Consoli, Simona; Barbagallo, Salvatore] Univ Catania, Dipartimento Gest Sistemi Agroalimentari & Ambien, I-95124 Catania, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); University of Catania,"Roccuzzo, G (通讯作者)，Ctr Ric Agrumicoltura & Colture Mediterranee CRA, Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, Acireale, CT, Italy.",giancarlo.roccuzzo@entecra.it,"Roccuzzo, Giancarlo/M-2851-2019; Stagno, Fiorella/ABH-6261-2020; Cirelli, Giuseppe Luigi/AAQ-2027-2020","Roccuzzo, Giancarlo/0000-0002-0851-1329; Cirelli, Giuseppe Luigi/0000-0002-8227-4878; Stagno, Fiorella/0000-0002-8144-1224",,,,,21,3,3,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1713,1718,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600219,0

The dynamic panel data analysis is applied in accordance with the explained theoretical framework on defining and measuring regional competitiveness. The results of the study have shown that employment and labour productivity have significant, positive and the highest impact on regional competitiveness, human capital has significant and positive influence while real unit labour costs have significant and negative influence on regional competitiveness of the observed regions in the EU. Human capital is not a significant determinant if the modelling is applied only on convergence regions and regions of the new member countries while unit labour costs are not a significant determinant in the sample of the new member countries of the EU. The results imply that competitiveness is not homogeneous between the regions of the EU and can have implications for regional policy makers, regarding utilisation of examined determinants. The importance of less developed regions should not be disregarded in competitiveness analysis especially if we take into account that this may result in a re-allocation of resources from the less developed to (better places) the more developed regions which will contribute to widening inequalities and possibly lower the competitiveness of less developed areas or even problems in more developed regions regarding its capacity and problems of congestion.

Initially, a ruling elite may be able to use trade policy to maintain political stability. But a world price shock can push the country into a situation where the elite face a commitment problem that only democratization can resolve. Because the world price shock may also reduce average incomes, the model provides a way to understand why the level of national income per capita and democracy may not be positively correlated. The model is also useful for understanding dictatorial regimes' rebuttal of World Bank calls to keep their export markets open in the face of the 2007-08 world food crisis.","Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Exeter EX4 4ST, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Zissimos, B (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Exeter EX4 4ST, Devon, England.",b.zissimos@exeter.ac.uk,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

The properties of these distributions are well known and several estimation methods for these distributions from grouped data have been discussed widely. Moreover, previous studies argue that the Dagum distribution gives a better fit than the Singh-Maddala distribution in the empirical analyses. This study explores the reason why Dagum distribution is preferred to the Singh-Maddala distribution in terms of the akaike information criterion through Monte Carlo experiments. In addition, the properties of the Gini coefficients and the top income shares from these distributions are examined by means of root mean square errors. From the experiments, we confirm that the fit of the distributions depends on the relationships and magnitudes of the parameters. Furthermore, we confirm that the root mean square errors of the Gini coefficients and top income shares depend on the relationships of the parameters when the data-generating processes are a generalized beta distribution of the second kind.","[Kakamu, Kazuhiko] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan",Kobe University,"Kakamu, K (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",kakamu@person.kobe-u.ac.jp,,"Kakamu, Kazuhiko/0000-0003-1370-5520","KAKENHI [26380266, 24530222, 25245035]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25245035, 24530222] Funding Source: KAKEN","KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I would like to thank an anonymous referee and the editor of this journal for their valuable comments and suggestions, which improve the paper substantially.

The results indicate that the multilayered nature of aggregation in FDI matters for empirical analysis. Affiliate-level host-country and third-country sales activity provides evidence of a negative spatial lag or substitution of FDI in space, broadly supporting the export-platform theory. For exports back to Sweden, we find a positive spatial lag suggesting agglomeration of production activities and vertical specialisation. The sequential aggregation from affiliate level to firm and country level provides evidence of a severe scale problem particularly in export-platform FDI. This aggregation bias is likely present in many of the country-level analyses in previous literature.","[Naughton, Helen] Univ Montana, Dept Econ, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Norback, Pehr-Johan] Res Inst Int Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden; [Tekin-Koru, Ayca] TED Univ, Dept Business Adm, Ankara, Turkey",University of Montana System; University of Montana; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Ted University,"Naughton, H (通讯作者)，Univ Montana, Dept Econ, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",,"Tekin-Koru, Ayça/U-7590-2019; Tekin-Koru, Ayça/I-5210-2018","Tekin-Koru, Ayça/0000-0002-0817-9055;",,,,,57,2,2,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2016,39.0,12,,,,,2046,2073,,10.1111/twec.12388,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,EG0BY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390697000008,0

These components can be defined in terms of their spectral structures-i.e., their frequency content-and it is argued that the process of econometric signal extraction should be guided by a careful appraisal of the periodogram of the detrended data sequence. Whereas it is true that many annual and quarterly economic data sequences are amenable to relatively unsophisticated filtering techniques, it is often the case that monthly data that exhibit strong seasonal fluctuations require a far more delicate approach. In such cases, it may be appropriate to use filters that work directly in the frequency domain by selecting or modifying the spectral ordinates of a Fourier decomposition of data that have been subject to a preliminary detrending.","[Pollock, D.

Analyzing panel data on publicly traded US restaurant firms, this study showed that franchising could be an important determinant of the maturity structure of corporate debt.

This paper examines the effects of rail transit-supported urban expansion using travel survey data collected from residents in four Shanghai suburban neighborhoods, including three located near metro stations. Estimated binary logit model of car ownership and nested logit model of commuting mode choice reveal that: (1) proximity to metro stations has a significant positive association with the choice of rail transit as primary commuting mode, but its association with car ownership is insignificant; (2) income, job status, and transportation subsidy are all positively associated with the probabilities of owning car and driving it to work; (3) higher population density in work location relates positively to the likelihood of commuting by the metro, but does not show a significant relationship with car ownership; (4) longer commuting distance is strongly associated with higher probabilities of riding the metro, rather than driving, to work; (5) considerations of money, time, comfort, and safety appear to exert measurable influences on car ownership and mode choice in the expected directions, and the intention to ride the metro for commuting is reflected in its actual use as primary mode for journey to work. These results strongly suggest that rail transit-supported urban expansion can produce important positive outcomes, and that this strategic approach can be effectively facilitated by transportation policies and land use plans, as well as complemented by timely provision of high quality rail transit service to suburban residents.

An aggregated zonal travel cost model is outlined and estimated in a panel setting using a negative binomial estimator with time-specific constants to capture unobserved time-varying quality attributes. The data are based on catch records for the Morrum river salmon fishery, one of the most popular sport fishing destinations in Northern Europe. These are aggregated to the municipal level for the zonal estimation and give number of visits per municipality per week for the period 1999-2011. The results confirm the expected negative influence of travel cost on visits. Further, the inclusion of time-specific constants does not render all time-varying quality attributes insignificant.","[Wallentin, Erik] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, POB 1026, SE-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden",Jonkoping University,"Wallentin, E (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, POB 1026, SE-55111 Jonkoping, Sweden.",erik@enveco.se,,,,,,,34,7,7,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Although Enterprise Zone (EZ) programs and the studies examining these place-based policies are abundant, the NEZH program is unique because it offers tax abatements directly to the homeowner. Specifically, NEZH beneficiaries receive an 11.5 mill reduction (out of 66.61 total mills) for 12 years (excluding the value of land), and a phase-in to full taxation through year 15. We use residential sales data for properties sold in Detroit between 1997 and 2010 and a difference-indifferences model to estimate how much households are paying for the tax savings. Our primary results (intent to-treat estimates) show all sales within NEZHS were 6-10% higher compared to those outside a zone. Furthermore, treatment-on-the-treated estimates highlight program beneficiaries paid 39% more for their property. With a full capitalization rate of 8.05%, these results indicate NEZH benefits are being overcapitalized by Detroit residents.","[Hodge, Timothy R.] Oakland Univ, Dept Econ, 413 Elliott Hall, Rochester, MI 48309 USA; [Komarek, Timothy M.] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Econ, 2023 Constant Hall, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Oakland University; Old Dominion University,"Komarek, TM (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Dept Econ, 2023 Constant Hall, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",trhodge@oakland.edu; tkomarek@odu.edu,,,,,,,27,9,12,0,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Consequently, SNAs (sub-national authorities) seek to represent their interests through various lobbying practices, including taking part in the European Commission's open consultations. In this article, we argue that varying levels with which SNAs take part in open consultations cannot be adequately explained by regional-level conditions such as resources or autonomy. Instead, we hypothesize that the specific policy context strongly affects regional involvement in open consultations. We test our hypotheses with evidence of the participation pattern of 296 SNAs in eight online consultations situated in five policy areas: CAP (Common Agricultural Policy), EAP (Environment Action Programme), Horizon 2020, COH (Cohesion Policy) and TEN-T (Trans-European Network for Transport). Our analysis demonstrates that the probability that SNAs take part in open consultations increases significantly when private interests of the same region and/or other SNAs of the same country participate in the same consultation.","[Van Hecke, Matti; Bursens, Peter; Beyers, Jan] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Beyers, J (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Dept Polit Sci, ACIM Antwerp Ctr Inst & Multilevel Polit, Sint Jacobstr 2, BE-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",jan.beyers@uantwerpen.be,"Bursens, Peter/N-1529-2016","Bursens, Peter/0000-0003-2096-6454",Flemish government; Reserach Foundation-Flanders (Odysseus Program) [G.0908.09]; European Research Council [ERC-2013-CoG 616702-iBias],Flemish government; Reserach Foundation-Flanders (Odysseus Program); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"The research presented in this article was made possible by a research grant of the Flemish government to the Policy Research Centre on 'Foreign Affairs, International Entrepreneurship and Development Cooperation' for the Flemish government (see https://ghum.kuleuven.be/ggs/projects/policy-research-centre/).

Attempts have been made to fully liberalize the intra-African air transport market. Except for general assertions about the merits/demerits of liberalization, our empirical understanding of the welfare effects of such polices in Africa remains rudimentary. This study empirically measures the economic effects of air transport liberalization, mainly on two supply side variables: fare and service quality, measured as departure frequency. The empirical models evaluate how air fares and departure frequency respond to measures of opennessin air services agreements, while controlling for other determinants. The results show up to 40% increase in departure frequency in routes that experienced some type of liberalization compared to those governed by restrictive bilateral air service agreements. Furthermore, there is a relatively larger increase in departure frequency in routes which experienced partial liberalization compared to fully liberalized ones. This can be explained by the diminishing marginal effect of progressive liberalization on departure frequency. While the effect of liberalization is substantial in improving service quality, there is no evidence of its fare reducing effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In light of this rapid growth, this study examined four dimensions of operational efficiency: occupancy rate and passengers carried per stateroom, passengers per ship, and passengers per 1000 gross registered tons. Over 7000 voyages on Carnival Cruise Line, Celebrity Cruise Line, Disney Cruise Line, Holland America Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line, Princess Cruise Line, and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line were analyzed.

According to original data, most of the money spent by the United States on that task supports American NGOs working abroad rather than local NGOs in transitioning and non-democratic countries. Yet there are also significant variations across countries in donor officials' reliance on American NGOs. Why do American donor officials fund American NGOs as a strategy of aiding democracy abroad more in some cases than in others? This paper argues that donor officials find it easier to observe American NGOs than other NGOs and that American NGOs are more likely to share donor officials' preferences. Donor officials are therefore more likely to pursue a strategy of made-in-America democracy support in countries that are salient for U.S. foreign policy. Evidence from a new data set of democracy assistance programs supports the argument. The findings have implications for the study of American foreign policy, foreign aid effectiveness, and NGOs in world politics.","[Bush, Sarah Sunn] Temple Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Bush, SS (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",sarah.bush@temple.edu,,,,,,,90,11,13,2,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

It addresses the challenge of conceptualization imbued in the notion of the rule of law, and critically examines the definition of the concept provided by the EC (European Commission). It then demonstrates that over the course of modern European integration, the rule of law emerged as a central dimension in four distinct core areas of EC/EU identity and activity. Should the contemporary crisis of foundational values persist or deepen, each of the four is expected to be adversely affected. Finally, the article explores the emerging 'rule of law turn' in the EU.","[Magen, Amichai] IDC Herzliya, Lauder Sch Govt Diplomacy & Strategy, POB 167, IL-4610101 Herzliyya, Israel",Reichman University,"Magen, A (通讯作者)，IDC Herzliya, Lauder Sch Govt Diplomacy & Strategy, POB 167, IL-4610101 Herzliyya, Israel.",amichai.magen@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,15,15,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In this article we show that while in some limited respects this is indeed the case, the Commission's overall position in the EU system is not one of having become a weaker institutional actor. The extent of the losses of its powers and influence tends to be exaggerated, while in some aspects its powers and influence have actually been strengthened. We show this by focusing on three of the Commission's core functions-agenda-setter, legislative actor and executive-all of which are widely portrayed as being in decline.

Our data analytics show how the arrival rates of vehicles vary by time of day and day of week, and that the service rate per booth varies considerably by the time of day and the number of active booths. We propose a time-varying queueing model to capture these dynamics and use empirical data to estimate the model parameters using a multiple linear regression. We then formulate the staffing task as an integer programming problem and derive a near-optimal workforce schedule. Simulations reveal that our proposed workforce policy improves on the existing schedule by about 18% in terms of average delay without increasing the total work hours of the border staff.

Its rhetoric and policies suggest that the organization has radically changed the ways in which it offers financial assistance to countries in economic trouble. We revisit two long-standing controversies: Has the policy content of IMF programmes evolved to allow for more policy space? Do these programmes now allow for the protection of labour and social policies? We collected relevant archival material on the IMF's lending operations and identified all policy conditionality in IMF loan agreements between 1985 and 2014, extracting 55,465 individual conditions across 131 countries in total. We find little evidence of a fundamental transformation of IMF conditionality. The organization's post-2008 programmes reincorporated many of the mandated reforms that the organization claims to no longer advocate and the number of conditions has been increasing. We also find that policies introduced to ameliorate the social consequences of IMF macroeconomic advice have been inadequately incorporated into programme design. Drawing on this evidence, we argue that multiple layers of rhetoric and ceremonial reforms have been designed to obscure the actual practice of adjustment programmes, revealing an escalating commitment to hypocrisy.","[Kentikelenis, Alexander E.] Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England; [Kentikelenis, Alexander E.] Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stubbs, Thomas H.] Univ Waikato, Sch Social Sci, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Stubbs, Thomas H.; King, Lawrence P.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, England",University of Oxford; Harvard University; University of Waikato; University of Cambridge,"Kentikelenis, AE (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Oxford, England.;Kentikelenis, AE (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",alexander.kentikelenis@trinity.ox.ac.uk,,"Stubbs, Thomas/0000-0002-2624-9272; King, Lawrence/0000-0002-5714-406X; Kentikelenis, Alexandros/0000-0002-1543-4595",Institute for New Economic Thinking [INET Grant INO13-00020]; Cambridge Political Economy Society Trust; Centre for Business Research at the University of Cambridge,Institute for New Economic Thinking; Cambridge Political Economy Society Trust; Centre for Business Research at the University of Cambridge,"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding by the Institute for New Economic Thinking [grant number INET Grant INO13-00020] ('The Political Economy of Structural Adjustment'), the Cambridge Political Economy Society Trust, and the Centre for Business Research at the University of Cambridge.",,206,196,216,5,92,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Conversely, the percentage of lower incentivized former supervisory board members is assumed to increase the top earners' average income tax rate. Both effects are assumed to be enforced if the ruling parties have strong support in the German Bundestag. The empirical results significantly confirm the unconditional effect for former executive board members and the conditional effect for former supervisory board members. Corresponding to sociological findings (see Hartmann 2002, Der Mythos von den Leistungseliten. Frankfurt a. M., Campus) and building on Barro's (1973, The Control of Politicians: An Economic Model. Public Choice 14(1): 19-42) approach to the selfish maximization of political income and arguments regarding career concerns from principal agent theory (see, e.g. Fama 1980, Agency Problems and the Theory of the Firm. Journal of Political Economy 88, 288-307), this study assumes a strong incentive for former executive board members in the German Federal Government (1957-2012) to maximize their political income by lowering the top earners' average income tax rate (1958-2013) due to their social elitist homogeneity and career concerns in terms of future job opportunities in business corporations. Conversely, former supervisory board members are assumed to increase the top earners' average income tax rate due to their differing social backgrounds. Despite possible career concerns, they are assumed to increase the top earners' average income tax rate in order not to lose their previously gained ideological credibility. Both effects are assumed to be enforced if the ruling parties have more than or equal to 55% of seats in the German Bundestag. By running OLS and Tobit regressions, the empirical results confirm an unconditional decreasing effect of a higher percentage of previous executive board members and a conditional increasing effect of a higher percentage of previous supervisory board members on the top earners' average income tax rate.","[Scharfenkamp, Katrin] Univ Tubingen, Dept Human Resource Management & Org, Nauklerstr 47, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Scharfenkamp, K (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Dept Human Resource Management & Org, Nauklerstr 47, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",katrin.scharfenkamp@uni-tuebingen.de,,,,,,,81,2,2,1,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Within this context, planners and policy makers would benefit from an improved understanding of available interventions and their relative effectiveness for cycling promotion. We examined predictors of bicycle commuting that are relevant to planning and policy intervention, particularly those amenable to short- and medium-term action. Methods: We estimated a travel mode choice model using data from a survey of 765 commuters who live and work within the municipality of Barcelona. We considered how the decision to commute by bicycle was associated with cycling infrastructure, bike share availability, travel demand incentives, and other environmental attributes (e.g., public transport availability). Self-reported and objective (GIS-based) measures were compared. Point elasticities and marginal effects were calculated to assess the relative explanatory power of the independent variables considered. Results: While both self-reported and objective measures of access to cycling infrastructure were associated with bicycle commuting, self-reported measures had stronger associations. Bicycle commuting had positive associations with access to bike share stations but inverse associations with access to public transport stops. Point elasticities suggested that bicycle commuting has a mild negative correlation with public transport availability (-0.136), bike share availability is more important at the work location (0.077) than at home (0.034), and bicycle lane presence has a relatively small association with bicycle commuting (0.039). Marginal effects suggested that provision of an employer-based incentive not to commute by private vehicle would be associated with an 11.3% decrease in the probability of commuting by bicycle, likely reflecting the typical emphasis of such incentives on public transport. Conclusions: The results provide evidence of modal competition between cycling and public transport, through the presence of public transport stops and the provision of public transport-oriented travel demand incentives. Education and awareness campaigns that influence perceptions of cycling infrastructure availability, travel demand incentives that encourage cycling, and policies that integrate public transport and cycling may be promising and cost-effective strategies to promote cycling in the short to medium term.

This article contributes to this under-researched area by examining the extent to which EU soft law influences policy adoption at the national level. Our empirical application is corporate governance, an area of growing EU policy interest, with significant soft law elements. We analyse the extent to which the European Commission's 2003 plan to enhance corporate governance achieved its aim of 'co-ordinating corporate governance efforts of Member States'. Our quantitative analysis of 95 national codes issued over 1992-2010 suggests that the Action Plan did influence national policy-making, but that the degree of national policy alignment depends on when the corporate governance code was issued, where, and by whom.","[Ferrero, Idoya Ferrero] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Ackrill, Robert] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham, England",Universitat Jaume I; Nottingham Trent University,"Ackrill, R (通讯作者)，Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Div Econ, Burton St, Nottingham NG1 4BU, England.",robert.ackrill@ntu.ac.uk,"Ferrero, Idoya/ABH-2597-2020; Ackrill, Robert/J-3874-2019","Ferrero, Idoya/0000-0002-0964-9223; Ackrill, Robert/0000-0002-0739-1812",Universitat Jaume I [E-2010-48],Universitat Jaume I,Ferrero Ferrero gratefully acknowledges the financial support provided by grant E-2010-48 funded by Universitat Jaume I.

This paper proposes an extension to the popular scheduling approach to model traveler's departure time choice behavior under uncertainty, with the main focus on a richer representation of uncertainty. This more general approach incorporates a separate term to reflect the risk aversion associated with uncertainty. Recognizing the correlation between expected schedule delay and travel time variability, the schedule delay components in the generalized approach are defined in terms of expected travel time, which differs from the scheduling approach. This approach is developed based on the analytical investigation of the relationship between the expected schedule delay and the mean and standard deviation of travel time. An analytical equivalence was found between the scheduling approach and the general approach given a departure time t. To investigate the empirical performance of the generalized approach, two state preference (SP) data sets are used; one from China with a symmetric travel time distribution and the other from Australia with an asymmetric distribution. Both studies show empirical evidence of an equivalence in respect of statistical fit between the generalized and the scheduling approaches, as found from analytical investigations. The Chinese study gives support in the generalized model to including both the mean-variance and the scheduling effects; whereas the Australian study finds only the mean-variance specification has statistical merit. Despite the different travel contexts, it is noteworthy in both empirical settings, that the parameter estimate for arriving earlier than the preferred arrival time (PAT) in the generalized model is positive. This suggests that commuters tend to prefer to arrive earlier in order to guarantee he/she will not be late. This paper contributes to a better understanding of performances of different reliability measures and their relationships. The practical value of the various unreliability measures is provided showing that these indicators are easy to obtain for inclusion in project appraisal. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Standards are less precise than rules. They must be sufficiently demanding that undercompliance is distinguishable from non-compliance. Discretion permits undercompliance as an alternative to renegotiation of commitments, safeguards and the filing of disputes. Undercompliance, particularly when restrained, is a lower cost and less confrontational resolution to addressing adverse shocks. Signatories are restrained in undercomplying so that the effects of their actions are imperfectly distinguishable from the effects of shocks. Compliance and evidentiary standards for formal disputes define the accomplishments of the agreement.

The dominant analyses portray these FTAs as driven primarily by foreign policy motivations and promoted by political leaders with businesses marginally involved or interested. It is contended here that, compared to other forms of liberalization, bilateral FTA negotiations promote new institutional arrangements within government agencies and business associations and unique configurations of government-business relations. Formulation of FTAs imposes greater information demands on government officials, which should compel them to consult business associations. In turn, clearer identification of FTAs' impacts and greater chances to affect their formulation should increase business incentives to lobby for or against FTA liberalization domestically and across borders. Demands on officials and business associations upon successive FTAs should foster institutional change/creation to reduce information and coordination costs. These hypotheses were tested on the bilateral FTAs of Thailand and Malaysia. FTAs in these countries stimulated government-business consultations and lobbying by businesses that, for some key FTAs, took the initiative. Successive negotiations strengthened the technical capacities of officials and business associations and stimulated the emergence of new institutions, which may endure to provide similar functions for multilateral rounds.","[Postigo, Antonio] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Postigo, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,,,,,,34,6,6,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We then present a social welfare framework that estimates the benefits and costs of using the IP3 approach on an urban transportation network. A P3 project's impact on overall social welfare provides a more comprehensive evaluation criterion than the often-used Value for Money (VfM) analysis. Apart from several theoretical studies, a detailed social welfare analysis that includes all major P3 project stakeholders is absent from the literature. We use Fresno, California as our case study in order to conduct a welfare analysis on IP3s. Our results show that system-optimal tolling favors average users, but that government and consequently taxpayers should pay for costly tolling systems (negative profits). In contrast, unlimited profit-maximizing tolls raise substantial profits for government, for the infrastructure's citizen-owners, and for the private sector, but the average user is worse off. From a social-welfare perspective, one should search for a Pareto improvement under which all major stakeholders are better off. Our estimates indicate that a mixed public and private tolling scheme offers such an improvement.

Correlations among decisions and self-selection biases are explicitly investigated by using a sample selection model with a bivariate probit selection rule. A dataset collected in the first wave of a recent activity-travel scheduling panel survey carried out in Valencia (Spain) was used for empirical investigation. Significant differences are revealed in the empirical models for leisure and social activities in planning decisions, including different effects of temporal, companionship and demographic factors. The findings of the empirical model have important implications to travel behavior and activity-travel scheduling model developments. These results confirm the existence of different mechanisms underlying the activity-travel decision processes when leisure and social activities are of concerns. Results provide significant insights into enhancing the performances of an activity scheduling model by capturing accurate activity-travel scheduling tradeoffs in flexible activity types e.g. leisure and social activities.

We exploit a reform of the fiscal equalization system in the Netherlands to show that the resulting change in grants to municipalities was fully capitalized into local house prices. Nevertheless, only a small fraction was passed on to residents through property taxes, indicating local public service provision as the main adjustment channel. As the marginal homebuyer was apparently willing to pay for these services, capitalization makes rent seeking by local politicians or bureaucrats improbable - thus effectively ruling out one class of explanations for the flypaper effect. The absence of a significant effect on municipal staff provides further evidence against a bureaucratic flypaper effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In terms of utilization rates, we find that the genders behave similarly. Nevertheless, we do detect some intriguing gender differences in these challenges. First, male players' challenges are more likely to be provoked by those of their opponents. More importantly, at tiebreaks, females are more likely to reverse an umpire's unfavorable call, while males make relatively more unsuccessful challenges. Furthermore, we find that men are a lot more likely to make embarrassing line-call challenges at tiebreaks and offenses (i.e., when the shot lands at the opponent's side of the tennis court) than women. These significant gender differences suggest that women particularly diverge from men at crucial junctures of the match such as tiebreaks. Differences in factors such as risk aversion, overconfidence, pride, shame, and strategic signalling behavior might help us to explain these gender-difference findings in line call challenges.","[Anbarci, Nejat; Ulker, Aydogan] Deakin Univ, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Lee, Jungmin] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Econ, Seoul 121742, South Korea",Deakin University; Sogang University,"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 121742, South Korea.",junglee@sogang.ac.kr,"lee, jungmin/IXW-6580-2023","Anbarci, Nejat/0000-0001-5952-8086","Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (MCST); Korea Culture & Tourism Institute (KCTI) Research & Development Program; Sogang University [201310065.01]","Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (MCST); Korea Culture & Tourism Institute (KCTI) Research & Development Program; Sogang University","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is supported by Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (MCST) and Korea Culture & Tourism Institute (KCTI) Research & Development Program 2012.

Evidence suggests that exporting activity exhibits spillovers and benefits that are country and product specific. In addition, export spillovers exhibit considerable heterogeneity. Foreign-owned firms benefit from peers generally and domestic firms only from the agglomeration of domestic exporters.

We focus on the secondary market, and build repeat sales indexes. Then the AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model is applied to estimate the weight of housing consumption incentives relative to investment incentives. It turns out that the overall market features strong consumption incentives, especially in the suburb area. Moreover, the market tends to overreact to policy changes. Compared with the suburb area, downtown features more investment incentives, lower returns and volatility, and less overreaction to policy changes. We infer that long-term investors overreact less than consumers. Finally, the purchase restriction policy and the issue of non-local buyers are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

When emission prices are perceived as short-lived, socially cost-effective upfront investment in climate technologies may be hampered. This paper compares the social abatement cost of a uniform GHG pricing system with two policy options for overcoming such regulatory uncertainty: One combines the emissions pricing with a state guarantee scheme whereby the regulatory risk is borne by the government and one combines the system with subsidies for upfront climate technology investments. A technology-rich computable general equilibrium model is applied that accounts for abatement both within and beyond existing technologies. Our findings suggest a tripling of abatement costs if domestic climate policies fail to stimulate investment in new technological solutions. Since the cost of funding investment subsidies is found to be small, the subsidy scheme performs almost as well as the guarantee scheme.","[Faehn, Taran; Isaksen, Elisabeth T.] Stat Norway, Res Dept, PO 8131 DEP, N-0033 Oslo, Norway; [Faehn, Taran] Frisch Ctr, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Isaksen, Elisabeth T.] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, POB 1095 Blindern, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Isaksen, Elisabeth T.] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, CEES, POB 1066 Blindern, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway; University of Oslo; University of Oslo,"Fæhn, T (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, PO 8131 DEP, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.;Fæhn, T (通讯作者)，Frisch Ctr, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway.",tfn@ssb.no,,"Isaksen, Elisabeth Thuestad/0000-0002-6557-8001",Research Council of Norway's programme RENERGI,Research Council of Norway's programme RENERGI,"Financial support from the Research Council of Norway's programme RENERGI is greatly acknowledged.

Using data from the 24 top men's and 23 top women's singles tournaments in 2010, we find a gender difference in the competitiveness (tightness) with regard to the final score of tennis sets. However, when using two physical variables (height and body mass index) that have not been investigated in this context before and controlling for the physical characteristics of the players, this gender difference completely disappears. Moreover, this result remains robust in propensity score analysis. To narrow this disparity between the number of games in men's and women's sets, it might be worthwhile for tennis authorities to consider making some changes in court conditions on a gender basis.","[Krumer, Alex] Ariel Univ, Dept Econ & Business Management, IL-40700 Ariel, Israel; [Rosenboim, Mosi] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Guilford Glazer Fac Business & Management, Dept Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Shapir, Offer Moshe] Sapir Acad Coll, Dept Ind Management, DN Hof Ashkelon, IL-79165 Gevim, Israel",Ariel University; Ben Gurion University,"Krumer, A (通讯作者)，Ariel Univ, Dept Econ & Business Management, IL-40700 Ariel, Israel.",krumer.alex@gmail.com,"Krumer, Alex/AAP-9910-2020; Rosenboim, Mosi/F-1474-2012","Rosenboim, Mosi/0000-0001-9494-7606; Krumer, Alex/0000-0002-3274-8078; Shapir, Offer Moshe/0000-0002-6590-0945",,,,,26,18,18,7,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Econometric approaches accounting for non-linearities induced by the low liquidity-framework and by technical constraints of the considered gas hubs are specified. The empirical results reveal that price discovery generally takes place on the futures market. Thus, the futures market seems to be more informationally efficient than the spot market. The theory of storage seems to hold at all hubs in the long run. There is empirical evidence of significant market frictions hampering intertemporal arbitrage. UK's NBP and Austria's CEGH seem to be the hubs at which arbitrage opportunities are exhausted most efficiently, although there is convergence in the degree of intertemporal arbitrage efficiency over time at the hubs investigated.","[Nick, Sebastian] Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ, Vogelsanger Str 321, D-50827 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Nick, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ, Vogelsanger Str 321, D-50827 Cologne, Germany.",nick.sebastian.sn@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,6,6,0,22,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,APR,2016,37.0,2,,,,,1,30,,10.5547/01956574.37.2.snic,0.0,,,30,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DH3EO,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372670500001,0

This SAM is more ambitious than previous matrices. It is a 62 square matrix built on the information provided by the latest input-output table available, the regional accounts and other statistical information of the BI government and the Continuous Consumers' Expenditure Survey. It includes 35 production activities and 5 representative households. The results of the models confirm the key role of tourism in the BI economy.

We explore the effect of this intervention on the price movements of the six major players, and find that the nature of competition in the industry has changed, with less effective rivalry between the regional incumbents and large regional competitors following the intervention; companies seem to have 'retreated' to their home regions, leaving a market where pricing behaviour resembles more closely a duopoly between British Gas and the regional incumbent.","[Price, Catherine Waddams] Univ E Anglia, Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Zhu, Minyan] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Jubilee Campus,Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England",University of East Anglia; University of Nottingham,"Price, CW (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",C.waddams@uea.ac.uk; Minyan.Zhu@nottingham.ac.uk,,,ESRC; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H004831/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We gratefully acknowledge funding from the ESRC, and many helpful discussions with and suggestions from Stephen Davies, Maxine Frerk, Morten Hviid, Stephen Littlechild, and Ben Smithers, while we retain sole responsibility for the analysis and its interpretation.

It was expected that the detrimental impact of non-employment on subjective well-being would be larger in countries with a stronger social norm. Using a direct measure of the social norm to work and employing data from 45 European countries, this study assessed subjective well-being levels of five employment status groups for men and women separately. Results showed that subjective well-being of unemployed men and women is unaffected by the social norm to work. However, non-working disabled men are worse off in countries with a stronger norm. Living in such a country also decreases the well-being gap between employed and retired men, whereas retired women are worse off in these countries. This effect for retirees disappears when a country's GDP is taken into account, suggesting that norms matter less than affluence.","[Stam, Kirsten; Sieben, Inge] Tilburg Univ, Dept Sociol, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Verbakel, Ellen] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Sociol ICS, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; [de Graaf, Paul M.] Tilburg Univ, Sociol, Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Radboud University Nijmegen; Tilburg University,"Stam, K (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Sociol, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",K.Stam@uvt.nl,"de Graaf, Paul M/D-7035-2013; Verbakel, Ellen/H-5118-2012","Verbakel, Ellen/0000-0003-1022-9020",,,,,56,59,67,1,50,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The WTO GATS negotiations over the liberalisation of trade in services, which commenced in the year 2000, led to a strongly contested debate over whether the international level would provide an additional channel for the privatisation of public services. In particular, the position of the European Union was criticised for promoting this agenda. More recently, this question has regained its significance with the start of negotiations for the Trade in Services Agreement and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Thus, this article seeks to analyse the politics of scale in the field of trade in services and its specific impact upon the liberalisation of public services. By applying a Neo-Poulantzian IPE approach, we propose a typology of (i) scalar forms in trade policy and (ii) of particular liberalisation strategies. Our results suggest that the multilateral level is but one element in a strategic politics of scale, with the former primarily fulfilling the role of locking-in liberalisation gains achieved at other levels, while other scalar forms, in particular bi- and plurilateralism, are primarily used to progressively advance the liberalisation agenda.","[Raza, Werner] OFSE Austrian Fdn Dev Res, Vienna, Austria",,"Raza, W (通讯作者)，OFSE Austrian Fdn Dev Res, Vienna, Austria.",w.raza@oefse.at,"Raza, Werner/JQV-9891-2023","Raza, Werner/0000-0001-9988-3808",,,,,63,6,6,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The conceptualization of the EU - a vast, composite and ever-expanding entity with fuzzy' borders - as an empire of sorts bridges the theoretical divide and offers a powerful explanation of the EU's behaviour vis-a-vis its vicinity. Through the transfer of rules and practices beyond its borders, the EU is indeed engaged in normative' policies, which however primarily serve the security and economic interests of the EU and its Member States. Thus, the EU's (allegedly) norm-based behaviour is in itself a utility-maximizing strategy, which also serves the construction of a normative identity. The EU's response to the Arab uprisings serves to illustrate the argument, with the concept of empire' resolving the puzzle of seemingly inconsistent EU policies.","[Del Sarto, Raffaella A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, SAIS Europe, European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Del Sarto, Raffaella A.] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Via Roccettini 9, I-50014 Fiesole, FI, Italy",Johns Hopkins University; European University Institute,"Del Sarto, RA (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Paul H Nitze Sch Adv Int Studies SAIS SAIS Europe, Via Belmeloro 11, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",rdelsarto@jhu.edu,"Del Sarto, Raffaella A./I-4048-2019","Del Sarto, Raffaella A./0000-0001-9037-4281",European Research Council (ERC) [263277],European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"Previous versions of this article were presented at the eighth pan-European Conference on International Relations (ECPR-SGIR and EISA), Warsaw, September 2013, at the conference on Imperial Soft Power and Governance beyond Borders: The EU's Relations with North Africa and the Middle East, Copenhagen Business School, 23-24 January 2014, and at the ENP PhD Summer School, College of Europe, Natolin Campus, July 2014.

When there are unobserved factors that affect both friendship decisions and economic outcomes, the spatial weight matrix (sociomatrix; adjacency matrix) in the SAR model, which represents the structure of a friendship network, might correlate with the disturbance term of the model, and consequently result in an endogenous selection problem in the outcomes. We consider this problem of selection bias with a modeling approach. In this approach, a statistical network model is adopted to explain the endogenous network formation process. By specifying unobserved components in both the network model and the SAR model, we capture the correlation between the processes of network and outcome formation, and propose a proper estimation procedure for the system.

This study covers the monthly data from January 1995 to December 2011. The Granger causality between the variables of interest is determined using the TYDL bootstrap causality approach. Then, we apply the Granger causality with rolling regression technique to evaluate the stability of the tourism-led growth hypothesis in Lebanon. We find that the tourism-led growth hypothesis is supported empirically in the case of the Lebanese economy. Meanwhile, we also find some evidences of uni-directional Granger causality running from the real exchange rate to tourism and economic growth in Lebanon. Therefore, tourism can be used a policy instrument to stimulate long-term economic growth in Lebanon.","[Tang, Chor Foon] Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Policy Res & Int Studies, Usm 11800, Penang, Malaysia; [Abosedra, Salah] Amer Univ Emirates, Coll Business Adm, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Tang, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Policy Res & Int Studies, Usm 11800, Penang, Malaysia.",tcfoon@usm.my,"Tang, Chor Foon/F-9289-2011; Abosedra, Salah/ABE-6147-2020; Abosedra, Salah/AAY-4421-2021","Tang, Chor Foon/0000-0003-2242-9222; Abosedra, Salah/0000-0003-0947-4141",,,,,67,47,47,0,22,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The Kremlin's position appeared somehow hesitant, fostering the resentment of Russian nationalist circles that were hoping for a second annexation. In this article, I explore the term Novorossiya as a live mythmaking process orchestrated by different Russian nationalist circles to justify the Donbas insurgency. The powerful pull of Novorossiya rests on its dual meaning in announcing the birth of a New Russia geographically and metaphorically. It is both a promised land to be added to Russia and an anticipation of Russia's own transformation. As such, Novorossiya provides for an exceptional convergence of three underlying ideological paradigms - red (Soviet), white (Orthodox), and brown (Fascist). The Novorossiya storyline validates a new kind of geopolitical adventurism and blurs the boundaries, both territorial and imaginary, of the Russian state.","[Laruelle, Marlene] George Washington Univ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Laruelle, M (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",laruelle@gwu.edu,"Laruelle, Marlene/AAN-1443-2020","Laruelle, Marlene/0000-0001-8289-2695",Baltic Sea Foundation (Stockholm),Baltic Sea Foundation (Stockholm),"This paper was written as a part of a research project The Vision of Eurasia, organized by the Center for Baltic and East European Studies at Sodertorn University and supported financially by the Baltic Sea Foundation (Stockholm).

At the same time, its government has been criticised for authoritarian tactics and the use of violence. Missing from the often polarised debate are the connections between these two perspectives. Synthesising existing literature on Rwanda in light of a combined year of fieldwork, we argue that the Government of Rwanda is using the developmental infrastructure to deepen state power and expand political control. We first identify the historical pressures that have motivated the ruling Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) to reimagine the political landscape. Sectarian unrest, political rivalry, wider regional insecurity and aid withdrawal have all pressured the RPF to identify growth as strategic. However, the political transformation extends beyond a prioritisation of growth and encompasses the articulation of ideologies and new mindsets, the provision of social services and infrastructure and the reordering of the social and physical layout of the territory. Growth and social control go hand in hand. As such, this paper's main contribution is to bring together the two sides of the Rwandan debate and place the country in a broader sociological literature about the parallel development of capitalist relations and transformations in state power.","[Mann, Laura] Leiden Univ, African Studies Ctr, Leiden, Netherlands; [Berry, Marie] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sociol, Los Angeles, CA USA",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Mann, L (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, African Studies Ctr, Leiden, Netherlands.",l.e.mann@ascleiden.nl; marieberry@ucla.edu,,"Berry, Marie/0000-0002-0504-2723",,,,,89,61,63,0,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We estimate discrete choice behavioral mixture models considering latent variables; these allows us to deal with this potential demand as well as to analyze the effect of different attributes of the alternatives over the potential market penetration. We find out that some usual assumptions regarding electromobility also hold for the Austrian market (e.g. proclivity of green-minded people and reluctance of older individuals), while others are only partially valid (e.g. the power of the engine is not relevant for purely electric vehicles). Along the same line, it is established that some policy incentives would have a positive effect for the demand for electrical cars, while others - such as an annual Park and Ride subscription or a one-year-ticket for public transportation - would not increase the willingness-to-pay for electromobility. Our work suggests the existence of reliability thresholds concerning the availability of charging stations. Finally this paper enunciates and successfully tests an alternative approach to address unreported information regarding income in presence of endogeneity and multiple information sources. We find that, for our sample, the presence of endogeneity and correlation makes both classical imputation techniques unsuitable. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors analyze the theoretical and methodological approaches to the phenomenon of the reproduction of human capital, highlighting the modern information culture as one of it's most important characteristics. A special role in human capital is given to it's innovative potential, which serves the engine of the modern economy. Transition of the modern society into a new stage of development, which the researchers called information brings to the front the ability and knowledge of the individuals associated with information technology. The reproduction of human capital, including information culture as it's component, is largely determined by factors such age and place of residence. The findings confirmed by the results of empirical research conducted in 2015 in the Sverdlovsk region (Russia), according to which the level of information culture essentially defines human capital in the region. Based on the analysis, the authors can conclude the existing inequality of human capital development between types of settlements and regions of the Russian Federation, which is due to various reasons, many of which are economic in nature and depend on the policy and the efforts of the regional authorities.","[Bannykh, Galina; Kostina, Svetlana] Ural Fed Univ, Mira Str 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Bannykh, G (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Mira Str 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",gbannykh@gmail.com; kostinasn@mail.ru,"Bannykh, Galina/T-8511-2017","Bannykh, Galina/0000-0002-8175-591X",,,,,9,3,3,1,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,93,102,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100010,0

Will such worries resurface under current economic conditions? While fears about monotowns were exaggerated during the last economic crisis, Russia's leadership has reason to remain concerned. Despite the dramatic transformations of the last two decades, Russia's post-Soviet industrial landscape has largely survived intact, leaving a significant number of monotowns with unprofitable enterprises in a precarious position.

Our goal is to design market mechanisms in which participants' trades or wagers influence the market's behavior in a way that leads to accurate predictions, yet no single participant has too much influence over what others are able to observe. We study the possibilities and limitations of such mechanisms using tools from differential privacy. We begin by designing a private one-shot wagering mechanism in which bettors specify a belief about the likelihood of a future event and a corresponding monetary wager. Wagers are redistributed among bettors in a way that more highly rewards those with accurate predictions. We provide a class of wagering mechanisms that are guaranteed to satisfy truthfulness, budget balance on expectation, and other desirable properties while additionally guaranteeing &joint differential privacy in the bettors' reported beliefs, and analyze the trade-off between the achievable level of privacy and the sensitivity of a bettor's payment to her own report. We then ask whether it is possible to obtain privacy in dynamic prediction markets, focusing our attention on the popular cost-function framework in which securities with payments linked to future events are bought and sold by an automated market maker. We show that under general conditions, it is impossible for such a market maker to simultaneously achieve bounded worst-case loss and e-differential privacy without allowing the privacy guarantee to degrade extremely quickly as the number of trades grows, making such markets impractical in settings in which privacy is valued. We conclude by suggesting several avenues for potentially circumventing this lower bound.","[Cummings, Rachel] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Pennock, David M.; Vaughan, Jennifer Wortman] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA USA",California Institute of Technology; Microsoft,"Cummings, R (通讯作者)，CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",,,"Pennock, David/0000-0003-0522-4815",,,,,28,8,10,0,4,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,143,160,,10.1145/2940716.2940721,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300016,0

This paper is aimed at investigating the role or performance of Islamic banks in distributing Al qard hasan, usually given to the micro businesses, poor and less bankable people. This research is a descriptive research employing financial data from banks' annual reports. The sample taken is Indonesia's four major sharia compliant banks (BUSN) which are also categorized as foreign exchange banks. The results show that over the period of observation, the Al qard hasan of all banks had a declining tendency. Among the four banks, BSM and BNIS are the banks which had the highest portion of Al qard hasan (over the total financing). This result evidenced that the government owned banks (BSM and BNIS) had more concern with the poor and micro businesses, compared to the private-owned banks (BMI and BMS). To the author's knowledge, this is the first study to address the issue of Al qard hasan in the Indonesian context using the major Islamic banks.","[Firmansyah, E.

This behavior can be modeled using present-bias discounting, whereby individuals over-weigh immediate costs. However, this model tends to make stark predictions, with agents either procrastinating indefinitely or not at all. We propose a modification in which the present-bias parameter varies over time, drawn independently each step from a fixed distribution. Following [Kleinberg and Oren 2014], we use a weighted task graph to model task planning, and study the procrastination ratio: the total expected cost of a present-biased agent relative to the cost of the optimal path. We use a novel connection to optimal pricing theory to describe the structure of the worst-case task graph for any present-bias distribution. We leverage this structure to develop worst-case bounds on the procrastination ratio as a function of the present-bias distribution. In particular, we show that the worst-case ratio will be exponential unless the present-bias distribution satisfies a strong light-tail condition. We next examine conditions on the task graph and present-bias distributions that lead to improved procrastination ratios. We prove that for graphs in which the distance to the target node is maximized at the initial node, the procrastination ratio is at most linear and this is tight. For graphs that satisfy the stronger property that the distance to the target monotonically decreases on any path, we show that the procrastination ratio is constant under a mild assumption on the bias distribution, which is satisfied when there is sufficient mass near rational behavior (i.e., bias parameter near 1).","[Gravin, Nick] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Immorlica, Nicole; Lucier, Brendan] Microsoft Res, Cambridge, MA USA; [Pountourakis, Emmanouil] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Gravin, Nick] CSAIL MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Immorlica, Nicole; Lucier, Brendan] Microsoft Res New England, Cambridge, MA USA; [Pountourakis, Emmanouil] EECS Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Microsoft; Northwestern University; Microsoft; Northwestern University,"Gravin, N (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Gravin, N (通讯作者)，CSAIL MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",ngravin@mit.edu; nicimm@gmail.com; brlucier@microsoft.com; manolis@u.northwestern.edu,"Immorlica, Nicole/B-7655-2009","Nikolova, Evdokia/0000-0002-8801-0320",,,,,1,13,14,1,8,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,361,361,,10.1145/2940716.2940774,0.0,,,1,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300030,0

There are different methods to test unit roots in the literature. Recent studies show the advantages of using Bridge estimator for choosing the lag length of unit root tests and computing test statistics. This method penalizes the parameters of the model with a positive shrinkage parameter. For a suitable choice of the shrinkage parameter, the limiting distributions of the Bridge estimator can have positive probability mass at 0 when the true value of the parameter is zero for stationary series. Therefore, the Bridge estimator provides a method that can be used for the model selection and estimation simultaneously. It is known in the literature that Bridge estimator does the model selection while simultaneously distinguishing between stationary and unit root models for series with a unit root as well. In this study, we propose Bridge estimator to determine the integration order of series with more than one unit root. In order to do this, we apply the Bridge estimator to Dickey-Pantula model.

The analysis draws on a nationally representative survey of Russians, fielded by the Levada Center in 2010. The results show that most court veterans believe that the decision in their case was just, and that the judge treated them well. But these positive feelings do not extend beyond their case. Russians who have no court experience tend to have more favorable views about the legal system than do court veterans. These findings serve to remind us of the difficulty of building confidence in the legal system in post-Soviet Russia.","[Hendley, Kathryn] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Law, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hendley, Kathryn] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Polit Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Hendley, K (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Sch Law, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;Hendley, K (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Polit Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",khendley@wisc.edu,"Hendley, Kathryn/Z-4181-2019","Hendley, Kathryn/0000-0003-0027-9235",,,,,73,6,6,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

An empirical study investigating the common effects of inflation and output growth uncertainty using the Turkish data set will be important and informative because the data cover both high-and low-inflation periods.

The model parameters are stated according to the official statistics and qualitative research that is used mainly in order to define and specify structure of the system. For the purpose of the paper we had to define the small farming business precisely to be able to quantify the model parameters on the basis of various data sources using different methodology and therefore with significantly different values of indicators. Missing values for the model variables are estimated on the basis of Powell optimisation. System dynamics simulation model shows possible development scenarios. Whether the scenarios are pessimistic or optimistic, the parameters are based on real historical conditions. It is typical for a small farmer that prices of both input and output of the transformation process are out of his reach and non-negotiable. The simulation results depict a dependence of the small farming business on the environment constrains and the weak market position. In this paper, we focus mainly on the scenarios of animal production of the defined small farming business.","[Krejci, Igor] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Syst, Dept Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Kolackova, Gabriela; Ticha, Ivana] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Krejcí, I (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Syst, Dept Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",krejcii@pef.czu.cz; kolackovag@pef.czu.cz; ticha@pef.czu.cz,"Koláčková, Gabriela/H-8417-2018; Krejci, Igor/R-9263-2016; Ticha, Ivana/C-5460-2017","Koláčková, Gabriela/0000-0002-5963-3828; Krejci, Igor/0000-0003-2723-7289; Ticha, Ivana/0000-0003-4000-1000",,,,,32,0,0,0,5,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,453,458,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500078,0

When clustering objects are characterized by mixed-type variables, there are two basic choices: latent class analysis or cluster analysis based on similarity measures. The paper focuses on similarity measures for mixed data which can be applied in hierarchical cluster analysis. We propose several modifications of the Gower similarity coefficient. Instead of the simple matching approach in its part determined for nominal variables, the modifications considering variability or frequency distribution of a certain variable are used. The clustering results based on proposed modifications are compared with results obtained with the original Gower coefficient and further, with alternative methods to mixed-data clustering; namely, two-step cluster analysis and latent class analysis. The comparison is performed on several economic datasets. Moreover, the classification performance of the introduced measures is examined in a subsequent analysis.","[Sulc, Zdenek; Prochazka, Jiri; Matejka, Martin] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Sulc, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic.",zdenek.sulc@vse.cz; jiri.prochazka@vse.cz; martin.matejka@vse.cz,"Sulc, Zdenek/A-2681-2019","Sulc, Zdenek/0000-0002-7624-8104","University of Economics, Prague [IGA F4/41/2016]","University of Economics, Prague","This work was supported by the University of Economics, Prague under Grant IGA F4/41/2016.",,14,0,0,0,2,"UNIV BANSKA BYSTRICA, FAC ECONOMICS MATEJ BEL",BANSKA BYSTRICA,"TAJOVSKEHO, 10, BANSKA BYSTRICA, 975 90, SLOVAKIA",2453-9902,,978-80-89438-04-4,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2016,,,,,,,369,377,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BH2KW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000399024100037,0

Semen of the three Boer bucks was collected using artificial vagina. In the first experiment, the semen samples were preserved in liquid state and subsequently were diluted with Tris-fructose-citric acid (TFC), Tris-fructose-citric acid + 1.5% soybean lecithin (TFCSL) and Tris-fructose-citric acid + 2.5% egg yolk (TFCEY). In the second experiment, the semen samples were cryopreserved in various freezing media as the same treatment with experiment 1. The results from the first experiment indicated that sperm motility and viability in TFCEY were significantly greater than those of TFCSL (P < 0.05). In the second experiment, there was no difference in post-thawing quality of semen in TFCEY and TFCSL.

We employ finite mixture models to uncover heterogeneity in risk preferences and find that (i) behavior is heterogeneous, with one half of the subjects behaving as expected utility maximizers, (ii) for the others, reference-dependent models perform better than those where subjects derive utility from final outcomes, (iii) models with sign-dependent decision weights perform better than those without, and (iv) there is no evidence for loss aversion.

However, there is growing recognition that broader economic factors play a significant role in producing conditions that exacerbate crash risk, especially in the area of fatigue. The aim of this study was to determine whether agent-based modelling (ABM) may be usefully applied to explore the effect of driver payment methods on driver fatigue, crash-risk, and the response of enforcement agencies to major heavy-vehicle crashes. Simulation results showed that manipulation of payment methods within agent-based models can produce similar patterns of behaviour among simulated drivers as that observed in real world studies. Simulated drivers operating under 'per-km' and 'per-trip' piece rate incentive systems were significantly more likely to drive while fatigued and subsequently incur all associated issues (loss of license, increased crash risk, increased fines) than those paid under 'flat-rate' wage conditions. Further, the pattern of enforcement response required under 'per-km' and 'per-trip' systems was significantly higher in response to greater numbers of major crashes than in flat-rate regimes. With further refinement and collaborative design, ABMs may prove useful in studying the potential effects of economic policy settings within freight or other traniport systems ahead of time.

Body height and spermarcheal/menarcheal ages were obtained from two periodic large-scale national representative surveys in China between 1975 and 2010. Chinese socioeconomic development indicators were obtained from the United Nations world population prospects. The effects of plausible determinants were assessed by partial least-squares regression. The average height of children and adolescents improved in tandem with socioeconomic development, without any tendency to plateau. The increment of height trend presented larger around puberty than earlier or later ages. The partial least-squares regressions with gross national income, life expectancy and spermarcheal/menarcheal age accounted for increment of height trend from 88.3% to 98.3% for males and from 82.9% to 97.3% for females in adolescence. Further, through the analysis of the variable importance for projection, the contributions of gross national income and life expectancy on height increment were confirmed to be significant in childhood and adolescence, and the contribution of spermarcheal/menarcheal age was superior to both of them in adolescence. We concluded that positive secular trend in height in China was significantly associated with socioeconomic status (GNI as indicator) and medical and health conditions (life expectancy as indicator). Earlier onset of spermarche and menarche proved to be an important role in larger increment of the trend over time of height at puberty for a population. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Substantial heterogeneity of individual forecasters' uncertainty is found, together with significant persistence in their relative uncertainty, which is a new finding in professional forecast surveys. It is an individual characteristic akin to the individual optimism and pessimism already established in the literature on point forecasts; the latter is also found in the current dataset, now in a bivariate sense with respect to joint inflation and output growth point forecasts. Whether disagreement among point forecasts is a useful indicator of uncertainty is shown to depend on the underlying macroeconomic environment.

Recent research finds that the ratio of skilled to unskilled worker earnings (the skilled wage ratio, SWR) also varies significantly. The income elasticity hypothesis (IEH) holds that if, as empirical evidence suggests, the income elasticity of demand for housing is significantly below unity, then the SWR should vary inversely with house prices. This implication of the IEH has been confirmed in empirical tests and leads to a further consequence of the IEH. If the SWR varies inversely with house prices, the SIR should vary directly as employers substitute more skilled workers when the SWR falls. This provides the opportunity for a new test of the IEH which is conducted here. The results strongly confirm, consistent with the IEH, that housing cost is an important determinant of variation in the SIR across cities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This article investigates whether the European integration process altered the relative importance of host country location factors. In particular, we investigate to what extent knowledge-seeking is a relevant investment motive, which has been documented as a key determinant for OFDI from other emerging economies. We apply a discrete choice approach to model foreign location choice of firms from CEE countries (CEECs) within the EU 27 (1996-2010). We find that the EU integration process is related with increasing importance of market access and less emphasis on labour cost advantages. We find heterogeneity in the valuation of foreign knowledge-related assets. The location probability within the EU15 is positively associated with knowledge-seeking. It also plays a role for technology-intensive industries and larger firms.","[Jindra, Bjoern; Guenther, Jutta] Univ Bremen, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Jindra, Bjoern] Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Hassan, Sohaib S.; Cantner, Uwe] Univ Jena, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Cantner, Uwe] Univ Southern Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Bremen; Copenhagen Business School; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of Southern Denmark,"Jindra, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Fac Business Studies & Econ, Hsch Ring 4, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",bjoern.jindra@uni-bremen.de,"Guenther, Jutta/AAP-7297-2020; Cantner, Uwe/A-9187-2015","Guenther, Jutta/0000-0001-5354-3541; Hassan, Sohaib S./0000-0001-5195-4400; Cantner, Uwe/0000-0002-2067-493X",European Union [290657]; DFG Research Training Group 1411 (The Economics of Innovative Change),European Union(European Union (EU)); DFG Research Training Group 1411 (The Economics of Innovative Change),"This research has been co-financed by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration (within the Collaborative Project: Growth - Innovation - Competitiveness: Fostering Cohesion in Central and Eastern Europe; grant agreement number 290657) as well as funding from the DFG Research Training Group 1411 (The Economics of Innovative Change).

To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to collect an individual's activity diary over an extended period as it captures the multi-tasking activities and multidisciplinary factors that underlie individual activity-travel patterns in a developing country. Preliminary analyses of the collected data indicate that different beliefs, anticipated emotions, support and attachment to motorised modes significantly correlate with different groups of occupation, gender, age, activity participation, multi-tasking activities, and physical health, but not with different social and mental health. This finding highlights the reason why implementing car reduction policies in Indonesia, without breaking or changing the individual's habits and influencing his/her attitudes have not been fruitful. The results also show that endorsing more physical activities may result in a significant reduction in the individual's motorised mode use, whilst individuals who demonstrate a tendency to use their spare time on social activities tend to have better social health conditions. Furthermore, undertaking multi-tasking out-of-home discretionary activities positively correlates with better physical health. All these highlight the importance of properly understanding and analysing the complex mechanisms that underlie these fundamental factors that shape individual daily activity-travel patterns in developing countries. This type of multidisciplinary approach is needed to design better transport policies that will not only promote better transport conditions, but also a healthier society with a better quality of life.

This paper identifies a new category of transit policies, called demi-flexible operating policies, to fill the gap between flexible transit services and conventional fixed-route systems. The passenger cost function is defined as the performance measure of transit systems and the analytic work is performed based on a real-world flag-stop transit service, in which we compare its system performance with another two comparable systems, the fixed-route and flex-route services, at expected and unexpected demand levels in order to be closer to reality. In addition, the dynamic-station policy is introduced to assist the flex-route service to better deal with unexpectedly high demand. Experiments demonstrate the unique advantages of demi-flexible operating policies in providing affordable, efficient, and reliable transport service in low-demand operating environments and this work is helpful to optimize the unifying framework for designing public transit in suburban and rural areas.

They allow the use of public transport at no additional cost. I analyze such a scenario in a theoretical model as an example of a flat-rate ticket for public transport which is implemented by majority decision. The mandatory character of the ticket reduces transaction costs like marketing and ticket inspection, reducing the ticket price and thus the students' commuting expenses. However, there is a countervailing effect. Students face and rationally expect zero marginal monetary commuting costs, so that new students choose a place of residence which is relatively far from the university. This in turn raises the equilibrium ticket price. It may even be the case that students would be better off if such a ticket had never existed. Nonetheless, they always vote for it in referenda, because accepting the high price is optimal given their place of residence. After laying out the model, I analyze an optimal policy, which consists, for example, of subsidizing student dorms at an efficient distance to the city center. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using 20th century S&P500 data we use our model to compare the empirical fit of belief assumptions associated with rational expectations, asymmetic information, learning, behavioral effects and evolution. Among these, asymmetric information with evolution is particularly useful both in terms of statistical criteria and in terms of ability to explain the equity premium, excess volatility and predictability of returns. Our work suggests that popular relaxations of rationality can easily lead to econometric representations that may be impossible to work with in empirical research. Furthermore, replication of stylized facts may be too weak a requirement when evaluating such models. Fortunately, there exist simple relaxations of rationality that are sufficient to drastically improve the empirical fit of models with full rationality.","[Skouras, Spyros] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Athens, Greece; [Axioglou, Christos] Minist Finance, Athens, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Skouras, S (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Athens, Greece.",skouras@aueb.gr,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Overall, hyperbolic discounting does not seem to explain the high rates of home ownership or portfolio concentration in housing in the data. I then study the choice between mortgages that require a substantial down payment and mortgages that require no down payment. Allowing households access to no-down-payment mortgages exacerbates rather than mitigates the undersaving of hyperbolic discounters.

Our intention is to detail how acting within ordoliberal tenets has led to some rather messy and unpredictable results for Germany and other EU Member States alike - a state particularly emphasized by the crisis. In so doing, we (re)invoke Robert Merton's treatment of unintended consequences.

We assume different units could have unknown common break dates. Although panel data with large cross-sectional size can help identify the break locations, it could render posterior simulation very inefficient. Hence, care must be taken to avoid such problems. We apply our method to study the world production over the period of 1960-2007 and find that the data support structural breaks in technology rather than in efficiency. For most countries under study, the most important source of growth is capital accumulation. The technology adopted by different countries shows signs of convergence. Changes of technology usually happen after economic crises to compensate for negative capital growth. Alternative modelling approach and priors are used for robustness check.","Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Li, GJ (通讯作者)，Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.",ligj@cf.ac.uk,,"LI, Guangjie/0000-0002-8977-4146",,,,,21,1,1,0,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This paper empirically examines this relationship using data from the American Time Use Survey. It finds that, controlling for relevant demographic, geographic, and temporal covariates, travel time per day is significantly and positively associated with life satisfaction. This relationship is attenuated, but still significant, when the amount of time spent participating in out-of-home activities is controlled for. Time spent bicycling is strongly associated with higher life satisfaction, though it attains significance only in some models; time spent walking is also quite positive, though it is not significant. However, both walking and bicycling are positively and significantly associated with life satisfaction when time spent on purely recreational walking and bicycling is included. Life satisfaction is positively and significantly associated with time spent traveling for the purposes of eating and drinking, religious activities, volunteering, and playing and watching sports. Travel time exhibits a strong positive relationship with life satisfaction in smaller towns and cities, but in large cities the association weakens, and for very large cities travel time may actually not be associated with life satisfaction at all. This may be due to the costs of traffic congestion, which disproportionately exists in large cities. In all, while the associations between travel and life satisfaction are clear, the causal story is complex, with the positive relationships potentially being explained by (1) travel allowing us to access destinations that make us happy, (2) the act of travel itself being fulfilling, and/or (3) intrinsically happier people being more likely to travel. In all likelihood, all three factors are at play. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines tax changes in The Netherlands, which are among the most stringent and most salient in Europe, and assesses the ex-post purchasing impacts and CO2 effectiveness of six years of CO2-based tax incentives for low-carbon cars in The Netherlands. Dutch tax incentives resulted in 13 g/km, or 11% lower average CO2 emissions in 2013. The Netherlands has moved from the 12th position before the tax changes in 2007 to become Europe's number one in terms of the lowest average new car CO2 emissions and highest share of electric vehicles in 2013. Tax incentives for new cars sold between 2008 and 2013 have resulted in 4.6 million tons of potential lifetime CO2 abatement at the cost of a drop in tax revenues of 30-50%. However, when corrected for the Dutch policy-induced increasing real-world fuel-economy shortfall and leakage of carbon reduction potential through vehicle export of low-carbon cars, only 3.5 million tons or 75% of the CO2 reduction remains. CO2-based tax incentives for company cars seem to have contributed the most to the observed turnaround in purchasing behavior towards lower CO2-emitting passenger cars. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Commons, coined the term 'futurity' to describe an epochal change in the late nineteenth-century advanced economies. Futurity refers to the reorientation of economies towards the future, and specifically to the fledgling practice of treating businesses as 'going concerns' and measuring its value in terms of their anticipated future profits. Curiously, the implication of such epochal changes on the performance of the financial system had rarely been discussed, let alone addressed. This article presents a theoretical argument that suggests that futurity encourages pro-cyclical dynamics that are pulling the financial systems in ever more violent and disastrous swings.","City Univ London, Dept Int Polit, London EC1V 0HB, England",City University London,"Palan, R (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Int Polit, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",ronen.palan.1@city.ac.uk,,,,,,,47,19,19,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Price discrimination and market captivity: Evidence from the Italian city-pair markets,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Airline fares; Price discrimination; Inter-modal competition; Market captivity,ADVANCE-PURCHASE DISCOUNTS; STATES AIRLINE INDUSTRY; HIGH-SPEED RAIL; AIR TRANSPORT; COMPETITION; POWER; ALLOCATION; EFFICIENCY; DEMAND; TRAINS,"This paper tests whether, and to what extent, airlines exploit market captivity by using price discrimination strategies. The Italian passenger market is particularly fit for this purpose, given the high differentials in the degree of the inter-modal competition amongst domestic connections. Results show that, ceteris paribus, airlines adopt a different pricing behaviour depending on the degree of inter-modal market captivity. First, in highly concentrated markets with respect to air competitors, airlines price higher when the intermodal competition is limited. This proves that inter-modal market captivity strengthens the effect of market power. Second, the inter-temporal price discrimination leads to a J-shaped distribution of fares over time, which is more pronounced when the inter-modal competition is effective. This suggests that airlines need to adopt a pricing technique that allows for a greater market segmentation in order to compete successfully with high-speed rail transport and to extract a larger part of passengers' surplus. These results are relevant in terms of transport-investment implications and competition policy. The indirect benefits that investments in rail infrastructure would yield through downward pressures on competing airline fares should be embedded in any cost-benefit analysis of high-speed networks investments and in any policy evaluation of measures that aim to reduce the territorial gaps in infrastructure endowment and accessibility.

The system is similar to the system introduced in Stockholm in 2006; both are designed as time-of-day dependent cordon pricing systems. We find that many effects and adaptation strategies are similar to those found in Stockholm, indicating a high transferability between smaller and larger cities with substantial differences in public transport use. However, there are also important differences regarding some of the effects, the accuracy of the model forecasts and public support arising from different topologies, public transport use, congestion levels and main objectives communicated to the public. Finally, the Gothenburg case suggests that whether congestion charges are introduced or not depends on the support among the political parties, and that this is determined primarily by the prevailing institutional setting and power over revenues, and to a lower extent by the public support, and benefits from congestion reduction.

This study empirically examines and compares the impact of both international and domestic tourism on China's regional development using the Gini coefficient method and the Granger causality test. The results indicate that the spatial distribution of the total tourism industry is more unbalanced than that of the regional economy. However, the imbalance in the spatial distribution is decreasing more rapidly than the imbalance in the regional economy. The Gini coefficient decomposition analysis shows that declining tourism spatial distribution imbalances are mainly and increasingly caused by domestic tourism. Granger causality tests show that tourism development will promote BRD through domestic tourism rather than international tourism.

It studies this link in the context of poor households in Cambodia. Evidence is based on an original dataset that contains both experimental measures of risk taking and impatience along with anthropometric measurements of children and adults. The aim of the paper is to (i) explore the importance of risk and time preferences in explaining undernutrition and (ii) compare the evidence stemming from poor households to strikingly similar findings from industrialized countries. It uses an inter-generational approach to explain observed correlations in adults and children that is inspired by the height premium on labor markets. Parents can invest in the health capital of their child to increase future earnings and their consumption when old: better nutrition during infancy translates into better human capital and better wages, and ultimately better financial means to take care of elderly parents. However this investment is subject to considerable uncertainty, since parents neither perfectly foresee economic conditions when the child starts earning nor fully observe the ability to transform nutritional investments into long-term health capital. As a result, risk taking households have taller and heavier children. Conversely, impatience does not affect child health. In the case of adults, only weight and the body mass index (BMI), but not height, are positively and moderately correlated with risk taking and impatience. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The reform, aimed at encouraging energy efficiency and private investment, sparked considerable policy debate about its potential impact on household welfare. This paper estimates a short-run residential electricity demand function to evaluate the distributional impact of the tariff increase. The analysis allows heterogeneity in households' price sensitivity and the model is estimated using a nationally representative sample of 8,572 Turkish households. The results suggest that rich households in Turkey are three times as responsive in adjusting consumption to price changes as poor households are. In addition, the welfare loss of the poorest income quintile-measured by the change in consumer surplus as a percentage of income-is 2.9 times that of the wealthiest.","World Bank, Washington, DC 20006 USA",The World Bank,"Zhang, F (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",fzhang1@worldbank.org,,,,,,,33,13,14,0,16,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,APR,2015,36.0,2,,,,,71,95,,10.5547/01956574.36.2.4,0.0,,,25,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CH5JS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354072500005,0

The goal of this policy is to monitor and contain overall risk in the financial sector. Implementing MPP, however, carries the potential for distributional conflict with the largest financial firms and the politicization of central bank policy. In light of this risk, this essay analyses the institutional implications of MPP for a leading central bank, the US Federal Reserve. Specifically, how will MPP affect the autonomy of the Fed to set the policy it thinks right? The analysis is based on interviews with financial regulators, including Fed staffers and policymakers, and with journalists who report on financial regulation. It is also informed by a case study of the Volcker Revolution' in monetary policy. Based on these sources, I identify the factors that contributed to Fed autonomy in the conduct of monetary policy during the Volcker Revolution and assess the extent to which those same factors hold for MPP. I close with an assessment of what MPP means for the new political economy of the Fed in particular and developed world central banks more broadly.","Harvard Univ, Weatherhead Ctr Int Affairs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Goodhart, LM (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Weatherhead Ctr Int Affairs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Goodhart, Lucy/0000-0002-7704-4998",ESRC [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,64,31,33,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The moments of the assumed Normal-Inverse-Wishart (no conjugate) prior distribution of the VAR parameter vector are derived using the results developed by Fernandez-Villaverde et al. (Am Econ Rev 97(1):21-26, 2007) , Christiano et al.

In line with the results from previous studies, BVAR models with theoretical priors seem to achieve forecasting performance that is comparable-if not better-to the one obtained using theory free 'Minnesota' priors (Doan, Econ Rev 3(1):1-100, 1984). Additionally, the marginal-likelihood of the time-series model with theory found priors-derived from the output of the Gibbs sampler-can be used to rank competing DSGE theories that aim to explain the same observed data (Geweke, Contemporary Bayesian econometrics and statistics, 2005). Finally, motivated by the work of Christiano et al. (Handbook of monetary economics, 2010a; Involuntary unemployment and the business cycle, 2010b) and Del Negro and Schorfheide (Int Econ Rev 45:643-673, 2004), we use the theoretical results developed by Chernozhukov and Hong (J Econom 115(2):293-346, 2003) and Theodoridis (An efficient minimum distance estimator for DSGE models, 2011) to derive the quasi-Bayesian posterior distribution of the DSGE parameter vector.","[Filippeli, Thomai] Queen Mary Univ London, London E1 4NS, England; [Theodoridis, Konstantinos] Bank England, London EC2R 8AH, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; Bank of England,"Filippeli, T (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",t.filippeli@qmul.ac.ukm; konstantinos.theodoridis@bankofengland.co.uk,,,,,,,47,1,1,1,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

To suppress foreign influences in the forming of housing bubbles, governments have resorted to short-term measures of stamp duty or raising the duty rate for non-local buyers, increasing down payments and restricting or even forbidding non-local purchases. These new measures may help contain the demand for housing, but short of being the first-best optimal housing policy for an open economy with significant non-local and foreign buyers. We argue that the first-best policy is to tax non-local and foreign buyers and then use the tax revenue generated to subsidize domestic low- and middle-income buyers.

Our approach has two prominent features: one is the adoption of nonparametric functional form to capture the anomaly effects of some asset-specific characteristics and the other is the flexible treatment of both observed/constructed and unobserved common factors. By estimating the unknown factors, betas, and nonparametric function simultaneously, our setup is robust to misspecification of functional form and common factors and avoids the well-known error-in-variable problem associated with the commonly used two-pass procedure. We apply our method to a publicly available data set and divide the full sample into three subsamples. Our empirical results show that size and book-to-market ratio affect the excess returns of portfolios significantly for the full sample and two of the three subsamples in all five factor pricing models under investigation. In particular, nonparametric component is significantly different from zero, meaning that the constructed common factors (e.g., small minus big and high minus low) cannot capture all the size and book-to-market ratio effects. We also find strong evidence of nonlinearity of the anomaly effects in the Fama-French 3-factor model and the augmented 4-factor and 5-factor models in the full sample and two of the three subsamples.","[Jin, Sainan; Su, Liangjun] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore; [Zhang, Yonghui] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Singapore Management University; Renmin University of China,"Su, LJ (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",ljsu@smu.edu.sg,"Zhang, Yonghui/AFL-9055-2022; SU, Liangjun/D-1445-2009; JIN, Sainan/D-1431-2009","Su, Liangjun/0000-0002-0565-6928; Zhang, Yonghui/0000-0001-6962-4768",,,,,62,2,2,0,23,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Social sanctions often have been used to mark non-compliant states and their policies as deviant. Yet, we know little about how deviant states strategically manage such policy stigmas in international finance and how this management shapes the international normative order. Recent scholarship in international relations suggests that stigma management strategies tend to either reinforce or fracture the international normative order. This article, by contrast, contends that such strategies also have the potential to transform the international normative order so that it resembles more closely the preferences of the deviant. This argument is illustrated using evidence drawn from Brazil and South Korea's management of the policy stigma associated with controls on capital inflows.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Chwieroth, JM (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",,,,,,,,70,31,35,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

It highlights inherent conflicts and contradictions of this discourse such as the myth of decoupling growth from the environment, pollution generations and resource consumption. Using key theoretical constructs of both Gramsci and Polanyi, the paper argues that the green economy/growth discourse can be seen as a Gramscian 'passive revolution' whereby the dominant sustainable development discourse, subsumed by capitalist hegemony, is protected in the context of global environmental, economic and development crises. The 'neoliberalising of nature', or in other words, the privatisation, marketisation and commodification of nature, akin to Polanyi's fictitious commodities, continues and intensifies with green economy/growth strategies. Greening the economy and associated strategies of green growth divert attention from the social and political dimensions of sustainability and issues of social and international justice. In this way, the inexorable march or 'sustainable development' of neoliberal capitalism is maintained. This paper goes on to argue that contesting the claims of green economy/growth discourse through political struggles by civil society against the neoliberalisation of nature is a sign of a slowly emerging counter-hegemonic 'double movement' which challenges capitalist hegemony and the commodification of society-nature relations.","Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Wanner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Social Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",thomas.wanner@adelaide.edu.au,,"Wanner, Thomas/0000-0003-1066-1454",,,,,57,140,158,5,209,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Following illegalities associated with the collapse of the fourth biggest bank in Bulgaria, this study examines the propensity to willful blindness. A survey was carried out by distributing questionnaires to all bank employees in addition to semi-structural interviews and ongoing media monitoring for the period of seven months. The findings reveal that bank criminal activities are mostly due to inadequate organizational culture, missing internal control, weak supervision performed by the central bank and lacking coherence among governmental authorities, including public prosecution. Although financial supervision as well as chartered accounting services needs more responsibility and control over bank activities, detecting willful blindness is the most important signal for corporate illegalities. The research outcome proves that anonymous questionnaires that contain no identifying information are more likely to produce evidences for discovering willful blindness among employees.

The analyzed wage distributions were compared with those for all employees in the Czech Republic. Basic data used in this study were drawn from the official website of the Czech Statistical Office. Certain problems arose due to the changes in the classification of economic activities during the research period, the wages between 2003 and 2008 being classified within the ISIC standards, those in the period 2009-2013 according to the NACE nomenclature. For this reason, consistent time series are not available for the whole period. This may distort the comparison since the worldwide economic downturn began just at the end of 2008.

The presence of fruit flies belonging to the genera Anastrepha, Bactrocera or Ceratitis (Diptera: Tephritidae) on the American continent constitute a potential risk of introduction, threatening the production of citrus and other hosts of countries in the region. In Cuba, the presence of some Anastrepha spp., as well as Bactrocera carambolae or Ceratitis capitata is not registered, thus surveillance for these quarantine pests and for other species of national interest continues. Results have been obtained from research on preferred host fruits located in the surroundings of citrus plots, revealing the presence and potential risk to citrus of A. suspensa, identified as of quarantine importance in countries such as the United States and others. During the period 2010-2012 three activities were conducted to characterize, diagnose and train staff to strengthen phytosanitary surveillance of Anastrepha fruit flies in citrus production areas in: Ceiba Citrus Enterprises (Artemisa), Victoria de Giron (Matanzas), Arimao (Cienfuegos) and Ciego de Avila citrus enterprises. To fulfill this objective, the composition of host fruit presence in production areas with respect to A. suspensa was evaluated. Host preferences of the main Anastrepha species detected and the effectiveness of traps and attractants were determined, and the monitoring system was relocated. The information obtained allowed designing the monitoring strategy in production areas. Training, one of the most important tools, was developed through seminars and workshops. These results provide inputs to the monitoring programs and the procedures that are essential in the development and implementation of measures for the phytosanitary surveillance and integrated management of fruit flies in Cuban citrus production.","[Borges Soto, Mirtha; Beltran Castillo, Alina; Avalos Rodriguez, Yunet; Hernandez Espinosa, Doris; Rodriguez Rubial, Maylin] Inst Invest Fruticultura Trop, Playa C Habana, Cuba; [Sabater-Munoz, Beatriz] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia 46113, Spain",Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA),"Soto, MB (通讯作者)，Inst Invest Fruticultura Trop, Ave 7ma 3005 & 30 & 32 Miramar, Playa C Habana, Cuba.",ecologia1@iift.cu; b.sabater.munyoz@gmail.com,"Sabater-Munoz, Beatriz/M-6021-2019; Sabater-Munoz, Beatriz/K-5989-2014","Sabater-Munoz, Beatriz/0000-0002-0301-215X",,,,,5,1,1,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1027,1032,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600128,0

In order to pinpoint common and different elements in the three literature contexts, we performed a bibliometric analysis on a database built through scholars contributions.

We chose a bibliometric approach (Callon, 1986) to analyse this wide set of literature and we investigated the keywords provided by authors through a double-step co- word (He, 1999). The first part gave us the chance to examine the whole set, and then we had the opportunity to compare the sub-sets related to the three different perspectives, in order to acquire a better understanding of the elements linking contributions on innovation. Originality/value - Literature on innovation is huge (Chesbrough, 2006) - even through contributions arising by combining different fields of science -, but an analysis about the evolution of this topic is missing, especially by taking into account the contexts of innovation. Nowadays, innovation is becoming more and more open than in the past, hence a better understanding of the theoretical evolution of innovation contexts can be helpful to investigate the emerging contributions and framing them in line with what scholars did in last decades. implications - The investigation performed led us to make theoretical contributions, namely to highlight the relevance of management, as an activity needed to get out the best from open context, especially as it concerns knowledge. Moreover, the role of strategy had a decreasing relevance when moving from system to network to ecosystem literature, while it is the opposite for technological features as they emerge in the three contexts of innovation and in direct relation with knowledge.","[D'Auria, Anna; Tregua, Marco; Spena, Tiziana Russo; Bifulco, Francesco] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ, Management Inst, I-80126 Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"D'Auria, A (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ, Management Inst, Campus Monte St Angelo,Via Cintia 26, I-80126 Naples, Italy.",,"TREGUA, Marco/J-6726-2018; Bifulco, Francesco/N-9585-2019; russo spena, tiziana/D-3220-2012","TREGUA, Marco/0000-0003-1579-7676; Bifulco, Francesco/0000-0002-4324-5679; russo spena, tiziana/0000-0002-1732-6029",,,,,35,0,0,0,3,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2082,2093,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200163,0

Genetic transformation was performed with Citrus sinensis 'Hamlin', via Agrobacterium tumefaciens, using epicotyl segments as explants. Transgenic plants were identified by PCR analysis. The transgene integration and transcription were confirmed by Southern blot, Northern blot and RT-qPCR analyses. The results reported here confirmed the integration of the transgene, with 1 to 3 integration loci per event. The level of transgene transcription was higher in plants containing the gene construct pCAtSuc2/attA-SP.

However, one exception occurred early in the 20th century when the United States kept records of emigrants. Using within-country changes in quota allocations in 1921, 1924, and 1929 in combination with 1908-1932 data on specific countries of intended destination of the emigrants, we estimate the effect of quotas on (1) out-migration rates, (2) emigration across skill groups, and (3) the duration of temporary migrants' stays in the U.S. Higher quota restrictions reduced emigration rates, mostly for unskilled laborers and farmers. Higher quota restrictions also increased duration of stay, as the share of migrants staying less than 5 years fell and the share staying 5 to 10 years rose. Return migration behavior was also associated with changes in previous immigrant cohort's networks and savings. Return migration rates were also low during World War I, and more significant population losses from the War in home countries discouraged return migration. Finally, out-migration of German migrants increased substantially during the 1920s. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The leaf parents included Hirado Buntan and Shatian pummelos, and Bingtang, Early gold, Taoye and Hongjiang sweet oranges. Encouragingly, the cybrid pummelo between Satsuma Guoqing No. 1 (G1) and Hirado Buntan pummelo (HBP) showed male sterility. Chromosome karyotype analysis was conducted to further confirm results of our previous molecular maker analysis, which indicated that the cybrid (G1+HBP) contained the nuclear genome of HBP. RNA-seq was performed to assess gene expression profiles of G1+HBP and HBP; a large number genes were differentially expressed between the two types, such as nuclear genes involved in nucleic acid binding and response to hormone synthesis, and genes required for floral organ identification. In addition, agreeable with the flower morphology of the cybrid, expression levels of PISTILLATA (PI) and APETALA3 (AP3) were reduced in stamen-like structures, though they were restricted to correct floral whorls. These finding indicated that citrus class-B MADS-box genes likely constituted 'perfect targets' for CMS retrograde signaling. Correlation analysis of transcriptome and proteome data showed that posttranscriptional regulation played an important role in floral bud development and might contribute to male sterility of G1+HBP.","[Guo, Wen-Wu; Zheng, Bei Bei; Xiao, Shi-Xin] Huazhong Agr Univ, Minist Educ MOE, Key Lab Hort Plant Biol, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Huazhong Agricultural University,"Guo, WW (通讯作者)，Huazhong Agr Univ, Minist Educ MOE, Key Lab Hort Plant Biol, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",guoww@mail.hzau.edu.cn,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,671,676,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600084,0

Innovation activities of the company is a prerequisite for competitive advantage and long-term existence of the company. Competitive advantage of the whole economy, of course, depends on the competitiveness of companies. Innovation is an increasingly important tool for companies to maintain long-term competitive advantage, therefore discussions about the appropriateness of possible instruments for measuring innovation potential are intensifying.

The routine application of STG using 0.1-0.2 mm shoot tips is very efficient for elimination of all citrus graft-transmissible pathogens from local or imported varieties. It has allowed the recovery of hundreds of healthy cultivars and the planting of hundreds of millions of healthy certified trees worldwide. Only in Spain about 140 million certified nursery plants propagated from micrografted plants have been planted. STG is also a very useful technique for regeneration of elite genotypes in several research areas. In vitro grafting for these purposes may be done using larger shoots (up to 1 cm). STG is being routinely used for the following purposes: (i) Regeneration of somatic hybrids from embryos difficult to germinate; (ii) Regeneration of plants from irradiated shoots to produce seedless varieties; (iii) Regeneration of plants from haploid embryos that are very difficult to germinate. STG was used to regenerate the 'Clemenules' haploid plant that has been used by the International Citrus Genome Consortium to sequence the whole citrus genome; (iv) Production of stable tetraploid plants of non-apomictic genotypes, which are very useful for triploid breeding; (v) Regeneration of transgenic plants from shoots that are very difficult to root in vitro.

This study focuses on which processes of RL are supported by ICT, in what extent are the processes supported, and what role KM plays in RL. Besides, barriers of ICT implementation and benefit evaluation approaches of ICT are revealed. Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on explorative statistical analysis of results of quantitative survey gathered from 55 Czech and Slovak companies. The companies vary in size, type of industry and reverse logistics processes. Due to insufficient knowledge of studied phenomenon, cross-sectional sampling was utilized in order to gather the most various answers. Originality/value - Although the research of RL is quite developed in aspects such as: reverse supply chain design, RL process characteristics, decision problems; other aspects such as ICT support, knowledge management, and performance evaluation are less developed. This study tries to enhance the scattered knowledge about these aspects and simultaneously provide suggestions for further (qualitative) research by exploring the reasons, why companies in the RL field do not know or not employ evaluation methods, why they do not focus on knowledge management and how they are measuring the performance of RL. Practical implications - Several interesting outcomes were revealed by this study. First, the data confirmed that the larger the company is the more developed ICT support it has. Second, evaluation of ICT support of RL processes was reported in less than half of the cases. Third, most companies do not perceive significant barriers regarding implementation of ICT support of RL processes. Fourth, companies that have implemented ERP systems report the support of ERPs as effective. Fifth, some approaches to ICT evaluation positively correlate with the level of KM development. These outcomes draw an important implication. Although the companies do not perceive the barriers of ICT support implementation, the effectiveness of such support is perceived positively. This can be caused by low penetration of ICT evaluation. Therefore, the practical implication of these findings for the companies involved in reverse supply chain is to implement knowledge management and ICT evaluation methods in order to gather the knowledge about RL and to be able to make decisions about investment in RL ICT support with proper information.","Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Krcál, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",,"Krčál, Michal/H-4357-2013","Krčál, Michal/0000-0001-8788-8601",,,,,32,3,3,0,15,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1953,1963,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200151,0

However, agroindustriers believes that such criticisms teachs this country with extremely meaningful lessons for better policy reorientation for national economic development of this Republic. Based on the agroindustriers' perspective, unstable and centralized economic growth of this country is clearly direct consequences of political-economic policy choice in national development in favor of import-based industries, IBI, by overall protective measures covering monetary, fiscal, and trade policies in particular, ABI. It is the challenge for agroindustriers to take the opportunity promoted by President Jokowi through his cabinet, Working Cabinet, maintreaming on food sovereignty and agroindustrial development i.e. agro-based industries or ABI, instead of IBI. Stabilizing and decentralizing the Indonesia's growth would only be possible, if and only if, this country immediately switchs from IBI to ABI.

Nowadays there are many fuzzy clustering algorithms. One of their fundamental problems is to determine the optimal number of clusters, which has a deterministic effect on the clustering results. We can determine the optimal number of clusters with help of cluster validity indices. Cluster validity indices are used for estimating the quality of partitions produced by clustering algorithms and for determining the number of clusters in data. In this paper, factors determining the number of clusters in the existing fuzzy clustering are researched and their advantages and disadvantages are examined. The important task is to estimate the proper number of clusters in actual dataset. This paper describes a new validity index for fuzzy clustering (modified index E) and modifications improving its performance as cluster number selection criterion for fuzzy k-means. The proposed indexes are tested and validated using several data sets.

The question arises of whether governments can use financial development policy as the means to mitigate or insure against this negative fiscal impact. This paper uses a panel vector autoregressive model, estimated on annual data for high- and middle-income countries over 1975-2008, to study the role of debt market development and insurance penetration in enabling fiscal response after catastrophes. The authors find that countries with higher debt market development suffer smaller real consequences from disasters but that their deficits expand further following the mitigating fiscal response. Disasters in countries with high insurance penetration also experience smaller real consequences of disasters but without the need for further deficit expansions. From an ex-post perspective, the availability of insurance could offer the best mitigation approach against the real and fiscal consequences of disasters.","[Melecky, Martin; Raddatz, Claudio] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Melecky, Martin] Univ Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic",The World Bank; University of Ostrava,"Melecky, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",mmelecky@worldbank.org; craddatzk@gmail.com,"Raddatz, Claudio/AAM-2056-2020","Raddatz, Claudio/0000-0003-3192-9034; Melecky, Martin/0000-0003-3101-0482",Europe and Central Asia Catastrophe Insurance project of the World Bank; Czech Science Foundation [13-20613S],Europe and Central Asia Catastrophe Insurance project of the World Bank; Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"This work was supported by the Europe and Central Asia Catastrophe Insurance project of the World Bank and the Czech Science Foundation grant 13-20613S.

The water relations responses of trees during the summer-autumn period and the nutritional status after three years of application of the treatments were studied. Trees were well irrigated in all treatments, even during the most water demanding periods, and no clear differences in leaf gas exchange were found within the different irrigation treatments. Conventionally irrigated trees had similar water potential values to daily pulse irrigated trees and the values of both were always above from the threshold for well-irrigated trees. When nutrients were applied in a conventional way, irrigation practices did not modify foliar NPK levels, while with proportional injected nutrition combined with pulse irrigation increased K and P foliar levels. As conventionally irrigated trees received lower amounts of water and had a similar yield to daily pulse irrigated trees, the former had the highest water use efficiency.","[Navarro, Josefa M.] Inst Murciano Invest & Desarrollo Agr & Alimentar, Dept Citricultura, Murcia, Spain; [Falivene, Steven G.] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Dareton, NSW, Australia",NSW Department of Primary Industries,"Navarro, JM (通讯作者)，Inst Murciano Invest & Desarrollo Agr & Alimentar, Dept Citricultura, Murcia, Spain.",josefam.navarro2@carm.es,"Navarro, Josefa M/Q-6256-2016; Navarro, Josefa M./S-1831-2019","Navarro, Josefa M/0000-0002-8811-4576; Navarro, Josefa M./0000-0002-8811-4576",,,,,21,2,2,0,5,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1739,1747,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.223,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600223,0

They further show that the elasticity and its variation across cities within the U.S. are significantly influenced not only by regulatory supply constraints, but also by the city level population, population density, and geographic constraints. This paper studies empirically if these findings apply to a country that is notably different from the U.S. with respect to its population density, typical city size, geographic and cultural coherence, and regulatory constraints, i.e., Finland. Based on data for the period 1987-2011, our findings are largely in line with those reported for the U.S. The results support the theoretical models indicating that the supply elasticity is largely a local phenomenon, i.e., dependent mainly on city specific factors rather than the abundance of undeveloped land at the country level. The supply elasticity substantially varies across Finnish cities. The city size, zoning policies, and geographic constraints are found to be the most important factors causing regional elasticity differences, accounting for some 80% of the elasticity variation. While more flexible regulation can increase the supply elasticity, the results imply that the possibilities of local regulation to affect the elasticity are limited even in a sparsely populated country with small cities and abundant reserve of vacant developable land.

In our study we used 20 rats of 10 months old divided into two groups of 10 rats each: control and treated. The treated group has received for 4 weeks 2 subcutaneous injections/week with DOCA (20 mg/b.w. in solution of 0.9% NaCl+0.2% KCl) according to the protocol, and 10-14 days since the last dose of treatment, the animals have been sacrificed. Coronary flow (CF), heart rate (HR) and left ventricle developed pressure (LVDP) have been measured on isolated and perfused Langendorff heart system at a constant pressure and total lipids, cholesterol, HDL and LDL, lipid peroxides as well as GGT, LDH, CK have been assessed using standard biochemical methods and Randox and Sigma kits. As results, there was an increase in C.F, H.R. and LVPD in DOCA-salt treated hearts, accounting for an intense mechanic cardiac activity generated by the hypertension following DOCA-salt treatment, accompanied by an increase in lipid peroxide, in CK and LDH as markers of myocardial lesion and a reduction of GGT activity in myocardial tissue probably due to hypoxia generated by the cardiac insufficiency following the increase in arterial blood pressure and a decrease in antioxidant potential. DOCA-salt hypertension is associated with rapid development of high blood pressure, vascular growth, vascular stiffening, and cardiac hypertrophy with increasing in mechanical activity of the heart, and a decrease in GGT activity and in antioxidant potential.

In contrast, over the years established incubator structures in industry clusters have supported entrepreneurs mainly in one specific field. Thus, there is a gap of support structures offering custom-tailored services for start-ups in new emerging sectors. Based on this problem, the paper introduces a novel approach for Open Cross Cluster Incubators (OCCI). Design/methodology/approach - The OCCI concept implies the linkage of actors of different clusters to support early stage projects with incubation services. In detail, these incubation services are not bound to one institution, but distributed across research institutions, regional business development and transfer agencies, and industry associations. The main goals of an OCCI are mapping and networking existing services (e.g. market research, fund scouting, international marketing, business modelling, partner search, consortia building, and IP issues) as well as building up new functional components based on identified, emerging demands of entrepreneurs. Consequently, this virtual incubator model comes up with new challenges in coordination and synchronization as well as allocation of responsibilities. These issues must be solved to explore and capitalize on the synergetic potential of technology regions and its ecosystems. The OCCI approach is discussed with examples of a two-year cross cluster project funded by the European Union demonstrating first measurements of this concept and demand analysis. Originality/value - The approach focuses on a gap of incubation services for start-ups that do not fit into a specific scope of current cluster structures and support activities. For these potentially emerging industries a new way of customized incubation is designed. Practical implications - The paper names the benefits of OCCI services, outlines a roadmap for a sustainable implementation, and shows the results of a study that provides information on how to collect data of uprising entrepreneurial demands.","[Schmiedgen, Peter; Noennig, Joerg Rainer] Tech Univ Dresden, Lab Knowledge Architecture, Dept Architecture, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Wylegalla, Joerg] Saxon State Minist Econ Affairs Labour & Transpor, Dept Ind 36, D-01097 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Schmiedgen, P (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Lab Knowledge Architecture, Dept Architecture, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",,"Schmiedgen, Peter/JDW-1038-2023",,,,,,16,1,1,0,27,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2349,2362,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200185,0

The paper explores the links between perceived effectiveness of reverse logistics and selected variables - factors - that are related to managerial approaches (to reverse logistics and to corporate management in general). The investigated factors are the level of formal planning, the intensity of coordination with 1-tier supply chain members, knowledge management, and quality management (defined as one aspect of organizational culture). In the second step, we investigate the link between RL-effectiveness and one aspect of organizational culture - the managerial approach to programs. Design/methodology/approach - The causal and correlation models are proposed and tested on data that were collected through interviews with representatives of 149 Czech companies. The majority of presented findings are based on subjective statements of informants due to the fact that many questions asked for the data that companies don't measure, collect and reprocess. The items utilized in the paper were reprocessed by means of bi- and multivariate statistics. Originality/value - The originality stems from the fact that the paper tests empirically a structural model of factors for effective reverse logistics. Second, it test link between the reverse logistics effectiveness and organizational culture. Practical implications The knowledge management, the extent of planning and external integration/coordination with both suppliers and customers can be considered to be factors of effective reverse logistics. The factor of external coordination speaks in favour of supply chain management in reverse flows: higher value from reverse flows can be recovered if the reverse logistics activities are coordinated on supply chain level, not on the company level solely.

The need to hire specialized managers with distinctive skills has emerged. It is necessary to evaluate managers' performance, in order to define if the firm objectives are in compliance with managers' ones. However, traditional models are based on profits maximization and sporting performance maximization under a defined budget. They are not able to properly explain the reality because these tools do not consider every aspects of the football industry. Therefore, a new managers' objective function and new managerial tools have to be identified. The research aims to determine an innovative model based on intellectual capital, able to evaluate managers' performance. Design/methodology/approach - The research proposes a quali-quantitative method with an empirical application. The study identifies intellectual capital development as determinant of clubs success. The intellectual capital of professional football clubs has been identified in three components: the first team players, the brand and the right of qualification for the competition on sporting merit. In order to check if intellectual capital could represent a management control system, the traditional objective-function of professional football clubs have been analysed and an application of the intellectual capital model has been carried out on seven Italian Serie A football clubs. For each club, the components of intellectual capital have been identified considering 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 seasons. Originality/value - This methodology provides a control system of managers' performance for company ownership. The competition between football clubs is very intensified and it is necessary to invest in managers' skills efficiency to improve intellectual capital value of football clubs. In this perspective, the originality of the research is to offer a practical application of intellectual capital as a management control system. The research aims to demonstrate that the intellectual capital objective function could strike a balance between sporting performance maximization and economic result maximization. Practical implications - The outcomes of the application of the new model based on intellectual capital allow to define a new use of it as an evaluation tool for football clubs' managers, overcoming the traditional models, which do not consider the job of manager. Furthermore, the new objective function defined by the research allows managers to make strategic decisions finalised to achieve clubs success in compliance with ownership aims.","[Trequattrini, Raffaele; Lardo, Alessandra; Cuozzo, Benedetta] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, I-03043 Cassino, FR, Italy",University of Cassino,"Lardo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, Via S Angelo, I-03043 Cassino, FR, Italy.",,"Trequattrini, Raffaele/AAI-3270-2021",,,,,,41,0,0,1,11,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,794,807,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200060,0

They can become infected by accidental ingestion of the infective elements or cutaneous contact with contaminated soil. The aim of this study was to determine the possibility of contamination with canine intestinal worms of the soil from different parks in Bucharest and a dog's shelter outside of town. A total of 45 soil samples were collected from 4 dog playpens (from which 3 fenced and 1 unfenced), 4 playgrounds and one shelter dogs. Helminthes eggs were found in 22.22 % of the soil samples. Positive samples for at least one parasite have found in 1 (the unfenced once), 4 playpens, 3/4 playground and 1/1 shelter dogs. The most frequently parasites species found in the examinated soil samples were Toxocara spp. (17.17%), followed by Trichuris spp. (8.88%), Strongyloides spp. and Toxascaris spp., each one with 4.44 %. 8.88% had only one kind of eggs, and two parasites mixt were found in 13.33 %.

Sustainable development is not only a point of view. Corporate leaders increasingly accept the fact that new strategic and operational approaches are required to manage their company's role and responsibilities in society. Corporate sustainability should not be driven by formal requirements or pressure. Businesses should undertake voluntary initiatives to promote greater environmental and social responsibility. There are a number of factors or instruments that attempt to link environmental management and corporate social responsibility. The paper aims at examining the increasing prevalence of corporate sustainability and relevant practices related to it. The main research questions are: how can enterprises contribute to sustainable development and what are the possible indicators for its monitoring? The paper addresses key implications for corporate managers and other affected decision-makers. It concludes that corporate sustainability is becoming increasingly important as it contributes to environmental management and social responsibility by various standards or tools. Therefore, corporate sustainability can also offer significant competitive advantages.","[Urbaniec, Maria] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Entrepreneurship & Innovat, 27 Rakowicka St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Urbaniec, M (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Entrepreneurship & Innovat, 27 Rakowicka St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",maria.urbaniec@uek.krakow.pl,"Urbaniec, Maria/M-6754-2014","Urbaniec, Maria/0000-0001-8307-8396",,,,,15,0,0,1,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1611,1620,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000154,0

Recent data have confirmed the tendency of a spatial extension of the parasite distribution area towards the Danubian shores of Oltenia and Calarasi, as well as a progressive increase of affected fish host species into natural environments. During the study, the infested fish underwent parasitological and anatomopathological examinations, with the aim to identify the nematode (genus level) and the pathological effects of the parasite over its host. In Romania, this is the first report on eustrongylidosis in eel, detected within fish populations inhabiting some Danubian Delta lakes.

Regarding the fact that bribery and other forms of corruption are illegal in most countries, their perpetrators try very hard to conceal them, and it is often nearly impossible to expose corruption. Despite this, there are many specific procedures in existence to deal with this problem in this day and age. Even during the Premyslid dynasty, the Czech Republic designated attempted bribery of public entities as a crime that deserved the most severe sentence. However, despite this fact, it is significant that corruption in the Czech Republic has always been deftly managed. To some extent, this paradox is the result of the fact that, in the Czech Republic, corrupt activities continue to be highly effective over the long term, thus the profit from corruption highly outweighs its risks. The main goal of this paper is formulated around this connection. The paper deals with the problems and trends of corruption in the Czech Republic; the past twenty five years were analyzed, because building an effective anti-corruption policy is an integral component of the wider processes of the democratization of Czech society. First, we conducted comparative research of the development of corruption in the Czech Republic on the basis of available corruption indicators. Next, using the Corruption Perception Index's series of values over time, we analyzed the evolution and nature of corruption and the probability of possible trends for corruption in the country. The conclusion of the article discusses the extent of corruption in the Czech Republic and the effectiveness of this country's anti-corruption policy in connection with their membership in the European Union.","[Volejnikova, Jolana] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Volejníková, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,8,1,1,1,5,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,163,170,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400021,0

This policy has produced an effect to the shallot price that rose significantly in spite inflation occurred. In order to control the inflation rate, on 2 September 2013 the government changed the import restriction policy, from quota based into price reference based as stated in a decree of the Director General of Domestic Trade No. 118/PDN/KEP/10/2013. The price reference of shallot was counted at IDR 25,700/kg, and discounted at IDR 11,935/kg at the farmer level. The aim of this research is to determine the price reference of shallot import restriction that suit for protection of farmer profit of shallot farming. The method of analysis used in this research is Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM). The results shows that the implementation of price reference policy with the price at IDR 11,935/kg at farmer level has decreased the farmer protection and profitability for 46 % and 233 %, respectively. This decreasing was caused by the price reference of shallot at the retailer level. It is discussed that the price reference of shallot should be increased at least to IDR 15,260/kg at the farmers level to achieve a higher rate of protection and profit that would be most beneficial to farmers.

The need for the renewable energy emerged due to the perception of scarcity of fossil fuels, their high costs, as well as their geopolitical concentration and oligopoly of certain companies and countries. One of the renewable energy sources, which is very popular in Croatia, is the wind power. A significant hurdle in assessing the viability of investing in wind farms is the stochastic nature of wind, variable and often hidden costs of construction and maintenance, which depend on the position of wind farms, as well as their relatively low efficiency. All of these factors make the wind farms completely dependent on the heavily subsidized renewable electricity prices. When calculating the cost-effectiveness of a complex project such as the wind farm, it is not possible to use traditional methods of valuation, such as the method of net present value and internal rate of return. Under the national strategy of promoting renewable energy, wind farms have been given top priority as an alternative energy source, but due its unpredictability, investors are not fully confident in the viability of such projects. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the reality of assumptions behind the classical valuation of wind farm projects by using Monte Carlo simulation. Unlike the traditional methods, Monte Carlo simulation provides a broader and a more realistic view of the project valuation and provides an insight into the key variables that determine the investment's profitability. It also provides us with input/output flexibility, and possibility to adapt to market changes. Our results show that investing in wind farms in Croatia, under the current circumstances, is only marginally profitable. Although traditional valuation methods suggest the opposite, detailed analysis shows a lot of critical points and project viability seems highly questionable.","[Zikovic, Sasa; Grzeta, Ivan; Zikovic, Ivana Tomas] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, 1 Filipovic 4, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Zikovic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, 1 Filipovic 4, Rijeka, Croatia.",szikovic@efri.hr; igrzeta@efri.hr; itomas@efri.hr,"Žiković, Ivana Tomas/R-5169-2018; Gržeta, Ivan/P-9460-2018; Žiković, Saša/P-9458-2018; Tomas Žiković, Ivana/AAJ-8542-2020","Gržeta, Ivan/0000-0003-4900-0688; Tomas Žiković, Ivana/0000-0002-9156-3479",,,,,12,3,3,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,537,546,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100053,0

In this paper, we examine whether another form of human capital, health, is also largely transmitted from generation to generation. Using data from the NLSY, we first present new evidence on intergenerational transmission of health outcomes in the U.S., including weight, height, the body mass index (BMI), asthma and depression for both natives and immigrants. We show that between 50% and 70% of the mothers' health status persists in both native and immigrant children, and that, on average, immigrants experience higher persistence than natives in BMI. We also find that the longer immigrants remain in the U.S., the less intergenerational persistence there is and the more immigrants look like native children. Unfortunately, the more generations immigrant families remain in the U.S., the more children of immigrants resemble natives' higher BMI. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Due to a large number of intersections in what is usually a grid road system in the CBDs, we investigate crashes occurring in and around an intersection. The question of interest in this study is: does the nature of crashes at intersections differ from those of the roads at midblock? Stated more precisely, considering the intersection as a reference point, does the distance to the reference point (i.e. midblock locations on the roads) correlate with different types of crashes compared to that of the intersection? A right answer can lead traffic engineers and safety auditors to propose different safety measures at intersections and the midblock locations. As a pilot study, we collected the last 9 years crash data of the CBD of Melbourne, Australia. For the first time, we employ Survival Analysis models-including Exponential, Weibull, and Log-logistic- to investigate a space-dependent phenomenon (i.e. accidents at proximity to the intersection). Of the outcome, highlights are: (i) police presence at busy intersections during busy night outs and weekends highly improves the pedestrian safety (ii) raised crossings at midblock locations lower likelihood of crashes of pedestrians as well as cars, (iii) lighting conditions at intersections must be watched and kept at a high level. (iv) Severity, likelihood, and location have no known association with the level of congestion. In other words, safety is first, always and everywhere. The results can be of interest to traffic authorities and policy makers in reinforcing traffic calming measures in the cities. The codes developed in this study are made available to the research community to be used in further studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that BMI and obesity are strongly correlated among biological parent-child pairs, but there are no significant intergenerational associations in these health traits among adoptive parent child pairs. The intergenerational elasticity of BMI for children to their parents is 0.2 in the matched biological sample, but indistinguishable from zero for adopted children with a standard error more than three times as large as the coefficient. Under reasonable assumptions, these findings indicate that the intergenerational transmission of BMI and obesity occurs primarily through genetic mechanisms. Additional analyses of transmission rates by parental gender and among step-parents and step-children support this conclusion. The role of determinants of BMI and obesity in the household environment in relation to our findings is discussed. Given the negative consequences of obesity on earnings and other economic measures, our results suggest that the genetic transmission of weight problems contributes substantially to intergenerational persistence in economic outcomes.

The impacts of the real exchange rate and real income on the trade balance of the EU have been investigated in the presence of structural breaks. The empirical analysis includes ten major trade partners of the EU for 1980-2012, on a quarterly basis. The paper applies the Kejriwal and Perron (J Econom 146(1):59-73, 2008, J Bus Econ Stat 28(4):503-522, 2010a) structural break test to determine the presence of structural breaks in series and to estimate the parameters of the model. In order to test the cointegration relationships of series, three different cointegration techniques were applied to the data. First, the Gregory and Hansen (Oxf Bull Econ Stat 58(3):555-560, 1996) cointegration test allows for one structural shift; then, for cases where two breaks were detected, the Hatemi-J (Empir Econ 35(3):497-505, 2008) cointegration test was employed. Finally, for countries where more than two breaks are detected, the Maki (Econ Model 29(5):2011-2015, 2012) cointegration test was applied, which allows for an unknown number of breaks. This paper presents evidence to show that income is a determining factor in the bilateral trade of Europe rather than a real exchange rate. However, allowance of structural breaks in cointegration tests reveals the absence of cointegrating relations in export demand equations of China and Norway and in import demand equations of Japan and Norway. The main finding of this paper is that important details of estimations can be missed when structural breaks are uncounted.","[Ketenci, Natalya] Yeditepe Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34755 Istanbul, Turkey",Yeditepe University,"Ketenci, N (通讯作者)，Yeditepe Univ, Dept Econ, TR-34755 Istanbul, Turkey.",nketenci@yeditepe.edu.tr,"Ketenci, Natalya/S-7612-2017","Ketenci, Natalya/0000-0002-7299-2833",,,,,46,3,3,0,15,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Given that users may return bikes to sites differing from their starting locations, rental stations frequently lack bikes or bike racks. This study sought to identify lacking-bike and/or lacking-bike rack hot spots utilizing spatial-temporal analysis. In addition, it applied retail location theory to determine site selection of further rental stations. Historical data indicated that shortage of bikes was much more severe than shortage of bike racks in the YouBike public bike system and lacking-bike and lacking-bike rack hot spots were clustered significantly. The study demonstrated that spatial-temporal analysis can be used to effectively identify rental stations' spatial patterns, determine the most suitable locations for further installation of rental stations, help to provide public bike users with a more effective rental system, and greatly assist public bikes' operational management and decision-making in Taiwan.

(Econ Lett 71(3):397-404, 2001) in order to identify subjects' behavioral types. We then link the likelihood to act as a leader in a repeated public goods game to the elicited behavioral types. The leader in a group is defined as the subject who voluntarily decides in the first place about his contribution. The leader's contribution is then reported publicly to the remaining group members who take their contribution decisions simultaneously. Our main findings are that leaders emerge in almost all rounds and that subjects who are identified as conditional cooperators are more likely to act as leaders than other types, e.g., free-riders or triangle-contributors. We also find that voluntary leaders, irrespective of their behavioral type, contribute always more than followers. However, the presence of leadership does not prevent the decay that is commonly observed in linear public goods experiments.","[Preget, Raphaele] INRA, LAMETA, Montpellier, France; [Phu Nguyen-Van] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, BETA, Strasbourg, France; [Willinger, Marc] Univ Montpellier, LAMETA, Ave R Dugrand,Site Richter,CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France",Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; INRAE; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Lorraine; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier,"Willinger, M (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier, LAMETA, Ave R Dugrand,Site Richter,CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France.",willinger@lameta.univ-montp1.fr,"Nguyen-Van, Phu/U-7574-2019","Nguyen-Van, Phu/0000-0003-1330-9851; PREGET, Raphaele/0000-0003-2650-148X",,,,,28,12,13,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,NOV,2016,81.0,4,,,,,581,599,,10.1007/s11238-016-9550-3,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EB5FD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387398300007,0

Thus, the Swedish government and the Diet made strategic choices when deciding which debts to pay. The reputational mechanisms and the creditors' attempts to force the Swedish state to honor its commitments did not work when the government had access to foreign subsidies.","[Winton, Patrik] Uppsala Univ, Dept Hist, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Winton, P (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Hist, Uppsala, Sweden.",patrik.winton@hist.uu.se,,,,,,,60,2,2,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

For example, priming causes Protestants to increase contributions to public goods, whereas Catholics decrease contributions to public goods, expect others to contribute less to public goods, and become less risk averse. A simple model implies that priming effects reveal the sign of the marginal impact of religious norms on preferences.

To simplify the determination of values of (sets of) items from ordinal rankings of the items, we use the Borda rule, a concept used extensively and well-known in voting theory.

The relationship is less strong for firms in service industries, possibly reflecting the difficulty of reallocating taxable service income.","[Gumpert, Anna; Schnitzer, Monika] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich, Germany; [Schnitzer, Monika] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Hines, James R., Jr.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hines, James R., Jr.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Schnitzer, Monika] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",University of Munich; Ifo Institut; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Gumpert, A (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich, Germany.",,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Science Foundation) [SFB-Transregio 15, GRK 801]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Science Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This paper was partly written during visits of the first and third authors to the research center of the Deutsche Bundesbank.

Because these links come in different forms, the question arises: what accounts for such variation? An examination of the wide variety of non-trade issues (NTIs) in preferential trade agreements (PTAs) reveals that prominent explanations fall short of explaining this variation. I argue that domestic characteristics of trade partner countries trigger lobbying by interest groups and cause design changes. I hypothesize that strong import and wage pressure increases lobbying by social and environmental protection advocates. A large difference between member states regarding civil and political rights protection levels should trigger NGO activity, but only if at least one member complies at a very high level already. In order to test the argument, I rely on a novel dataset including newly coded data on NTIs design for 474 PTAs signed between 1990 and January 2016. The findings using multivariate regression analysis show that linking trade and social or environmental clauses is motivated by strategic and the inclusion of political rights by substantial interests. This study contributes to the literature on rational design of international institutions, legalization, and issue-linkage.","[Lechner, Lisa] Salzburg Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Sociol, Salzburg, Austria",Salzburg University,"Lechner, L (通讯作者)，Salzburg Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Sociol, Salzburg, Austria.",lisa.lechner@sbg.ac.at,"Lechner, Lisa/X-3303-2019","Lechner, Lisa/0000-0001-6690-1029",,,,,88,105,115,2,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We compare ZIP-Code-level market-based estimates of housing prices to those derived from homeowners' self-reported values. We show that there are systematic differences which vary with market conditions and the amount of equity owners hold in their homes. When prices have fallen, homeowners systematically state that their homes are worth more than market estimates suggest, and homeowners with little or no equity in their homes state values above the market estimates to a greater degree. Over time, homeowners appear to adjust their assessments to be more in line with past market trends, but only slowly. Our results suggest that underwater borrowers are likely to understate their losses and either may not be aware that their mortgages are underwater or underestimate the degree to which they are.","[Chan, Sewin; Ellen, Ingrid Gould] NYU, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Dastrup, Samuel] Abt Associates Inc, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA",New York University; ABT Associates,"Chan, S (通讯作者)，NYU, 550 1St Ave, New York, NY 10012 USA.",sewin.chan@nyu.edu; samuel_dastrup@abtassociates.com; ingrid.ellen@nyu.edu,,,Russell Sage Foundation,Russell Sage Foundation,"We thank the Russell Sage Foundation for generous financial support.

It is well known that these large effects on the set of equilibrium payoffs rely on long-run players being arbitrarily patient. We study reputation games where a long-run player plays a fixed stage-game against an infinite sequence of short-run players under imperfect public monitoring. We show that in such games, introducing arbitrarily small incomplete information does not open the possibility of new equilibrium payoffs far from the complete information equilibrium payoff set. This holds true no matter how patient the long-run player is, as long as her discount factor is fixed. This result highlights the fact that the aforementioned large effects arise due to an order of limits argument, as anticipated.","[Dalkiran, Nuh Aygun] Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Dalkiran, NA (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",dalkiran@bilkent.edu.tr,"Dalkiran, Nuh Aygun/AAC-3984-2022","Dalkiran, Nuh Aygun/0000-0002-0586-0355",Sabanci University School of Management,Sabanci University School of Management,"I am indebted to my advisors Mehmet Ekmekci and Ehud Kalai, as well as my committee members Nabil Al-Najjar and Asher Wolinsky for their guidance throughout this project.

Because these laws effectively limit the number of small dwellings that can be built within a community, proponents argue that restrictions of this type help to guarantee that new homes will pay for themselves by discouraging free-riding behavior within a system of property tax funded local governments. Critics, however, have maintained that such policies constitute a veiled attempt by suburban communities at restricting entry for low-income families. Focusing on the clear distinction between housing units located in multifamily structures (i.e., apartments) and single-family homes, this paper finds strong evidence that residential per capita values, measured as value per person and value per child, are actually higher for apartments, not single-family residences. Consequently, communities' effective property tax rates decline as apartments' share of the housing stock rises, holding all else equal. These findings are contrary to the set of assumptions that are often used to justify many of today's land-use restrictions and raise serious questions regarding the efficacy of modern fiscal zoning as a tool for promoting efficient fiscal federalism.

After introducing the need for performance measurement, the problem of benchmarking is outlined in more detail. A context-dependent undesirable output data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, designed to be sensitive to business context, is then tested on a simulated set of fleet profiles. DEA can produce more consistent measures of good-practice, compared to ratio-based key performance indicators (KPI), providing emission reduction targets for companies and an aggregate reporting tool.

By 2013 average hospital demand elasticity with respect to readmission rates and waiting times were -0.2 and -0.04.

This paper presents results from an internet survey examining perceived comfort while driving and bicycling on various roadways among 265 non-bicycling drivers, bicycling drivers, and non-driving bicyclists in the San Francisco Bay Area. Analysis of variance tests revealed that both drivers and bicyclists are more comfortable on roadways with separated bicycling facilities than those with shared space. In particular, roadways with barrier separated bicycle lanes were the most popular among all groups, regardless of bicycling frequency. Striped bicycle lanes, a common treatment in the United States, received mixed reviews: a majority of the sample believed that they benefit cyclists and drivers through predictability and legitimacy on the roadway, but the lanes were rated significantly less comfortable than barrier-separated treatments particularly among potential bicyclists. These findings corroborate research on bicyclists' preferences for roadway design and contribute a new understanding of motorists' preferences. They also support the U.S. Federal Highway Administration's efforts to encourage greater accommodation of bicyclists on urban streets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This approach performs three functions in contemporary Russian foreign policy: securing Russian national interests at domestic, regional, and international levels; balancing against the United States; and acting as a marker of non-Western' power identity in an emergent multipolar order. The conflict between these two models increasingly appears to threaten the last of these objectives, however, and as a means of advancing foreign policy objectives the approach thus appears caught in a self-defeating logic.","[Deyermond, Ruth] Kings Coll London, Dept War Studies, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Deyermond, R (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept War Studies, London WC2R 2LS, England.",ruth.deyermond@kcl.ac.uk,,"Deyermond, Ruth Margaret/0000-0002-8443-8661",,,,,50,43,43,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,AUG,2016,68.0,6,,,,,957,984,,10.1080/09668136.2016.1204985,0.0,,,28,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,DV2SR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382772200001,0

In this paper we analyze the effects of the proposed constitutional reforms, in a setting where decision making is subject to 'hard time constraints', and lawmakers face the opposing interests of a lobby and the electorate. We show that bicameralism might lead to a decline in the lawmakers' bargaining power vis-a-vis the lobby, thus compromising their accountability to voters. Hence, bicameralism is not a panacea against the abuse of power by elected legislators and the proposed unicameral reforms could be effective in reducing corruption among elected representatives.","[Facchini, Giovanni] Univ Nottingham, Univ Milano, CES Ifo, CEPR,CReAM,GEP,IZA, Nottingham, England; [Facchini, Giovanni] LdA, Nottingham, England; [Testa, Cecilia] Univ Nottingham LdA, Nottingham, England; [Testa, Cecilia] NICEP, Nottingham, England",University of Nottingham; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Testa, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham LdA, Nottingham, England.;Testa, C (通讯作者)，NICEP, Nottingham, England.",cecilia.testa@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,45,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,AUG,2016,47.0,2,,,,,387,411,,10.1007/s00355-016-0969-9,0.0,,,25,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DX5WC,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000384452400009,0

By 1963, a path for integrating the economies of Turkey and the eventual European Union had been mapped. As with many trade agreements, agriculture posed difficult political hurdles, which were never fully cleared, even as trade barriers to other sectors were eventually removed and a Customs Union formed. In this paper, we trace the influences the Turkey-EU economic institutions have had on agricultural policies and the agricultural sector. Using an applied general equilibrium framework we provide estimates of what including agriculture under the Customs Union would mean for the sector and the economy. We also discuss the implications of fully aligning Turkey's agricultural policies with the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, as would be required under full membership.","[Larson, Donald; Martin, Will] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Sahin, Sebnem] World Bank, Environm & Nat Resources Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Tsigas, Marinos] US Int Trade Commiss, Washington, DC USA",The World Bank; The World Bank,"Larson, D (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,"Larson, Donald/L-3918-2016","Larson, Donald/0000-0002-1318-3243",European Commission; World Bank,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); World Bank(The World Bank India),"The authors would like to thank Dimitris Diakosavvas, Kamer Krakurum Ozdemir, Ian John Douglas Gillson, Refik Erzan, Alper Demirdogen, and participants in seminars at the Center for Economics and Econometrics, Bogazici University and the Villa Mondragone International Economic Seminar, University of Rome Tor Vergata for helpful comments on earlier drafts.

It shows how a key industrial policy known as 'double relocation' generated tensions between the Guangdong government, then led by Party Secretary Wang Yang, and the senior echelon of the Communist Party of China in Beijing. The contestations and negotiations that ensued illustrate the dynamic entwinement between state rescaling and institutional path-dependency: the Wang administration launched this industrial policy in spite of potentially destabilising effects on the prevailing national structure of capital accumulation. This foregrounds, in turn, the constitutive and constraining effects of established, national-level policies on local, territorially specific restructuring strategies.","[Lim, Kean Fan] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Lim, KF (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",keanfan.lim@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Lim, Kean Fan/0000-0002-7979-2068",,,,,102,17,18,1,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Our findings reconcile the counter-cyclicality of longevity in the short run with the pro-cyclicality of longevity in the long run with respect to the business cycle. Additionally, four causal relationships between health progress and economic growth: the income view, health view, feedback view, and neutrality hypotheses are identified. Our results show that the income view, health view, and feedback hypotheses could only be validated for some specific time periods and conditions. None of these four hypotheses regarding causality of health progress and economic growth prevail over the entire period of 1934-2010 in the USA.","[Chen, Wen-Yi] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Senior Citizen Serv Management, 193,Sec 1,Sanmin Rd, Taichung 40343, Taiwan",National Taichung University of Science & Technology,"Chen, WY (通讯作者)，Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Senior Citizen Serv Management, 193,Sec 1,Sanmin Rd, Taichung 40343, Taiwan.",chenwen@nutc.edu.tw,,,,,,,66,29,29,0,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Using new data on railroads and cities spanning over one century, we find that railroads had large effects on the distribution of economic activity during the colonial period and these effects have persisted to date, although railroads collapsed and road networks expanded considerably after independence. Initial transportation investments may thus have large effects in poor countries.

This paper argues that this approach raises a number of undesired issues because decomposition terms have the interpretation of approximate percentage differences in geometric means. Instead, we suggest that the analysis should be based on the arithmetic means of the original dependent variable. We present a flexible parametric decomposition framework that can be used for all types of nonnegative dependent variables. In particular, we derive a propensity score weighted estimator for the aggregate decomposition that is doubly robust, that is, consistent under two separate sets of assumptions. A comparative Monte Carlo study illustrates that the proposed estimator performs well in many situations. An application to the union wage gap in the USA finds that the importance of the unexplained union wage premium is much smaller than suggested by the standard log-wage decomposition.","[Kaiser, Boris] Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Schanzeneckstr 1, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Kaiser, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Schanzeneckstr 1, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland.",bo.kaiser@gmx.ch,,"Kaiser, Boris/0000-0003-4936-8618",,,,,51,3,3,0,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This paper presents an analysis of how different competitors simultaneously adjust their prices in the short run. The empirical model accounts for dynamic price variations, exploring both intramodal and intermodal price competition. The results, based on 12,506 price observations, show that intermodal competition presents some kind of asymmetric behaviour, with airlines reacting more than trains to competitors' price changes.

To shed new light on this puzzle, the recent theoretical literature shifts its focus to the differential effects of distance on the extensive and intensive margins of trade. However, so far there is a lack of corresponding contributions from empirical studies of the gravity equation. This paper provides the first piece of evidence using data for about 150-200 countries between the years 1980 and 2009. The extensive and intensive margins are measured based on bilateral trade data of more than 3,100 product items. It is found that the distance effect on the extensive margin declines, while that on the intensive margin rises over time for most specifications. Therefore, there is little empirical evidence that distinguishing between the extensive and intensive margins of trade solves the distance puzzle.","[Cheong, Juyoung; Kwak, Do Won; Tang, Kam Ki] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Cheong, J (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",j.cheong@uq.edu.au; d.kwak@uq.edu.au; kk.tang@uq.edu.au,"Cheong, Juyoung/AAJ-9607-2020","Kwak, Do Won/0000-0001-5443-1576; Tang, Kam/0000-0001-7282-8112",,,,,30,3,3,0,13,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In particular, the evolution of the Russian middle class is an interesting but highly complex phenomenon. Most works dealing with this issue are based on summary statistics, which do not fully convey all the information on income distribution. In the present paper, we analyze the evolution of the middle class in Russia from 1992 to 2008, by applying a nonparametric tool, the relative distribution, to Russian household incomes. The relative density function is a proper density function which compares two distributions observed in different years, in order to describe patterns of differences on the entire income scale. Despite a stable pattern of high inequality, we found that after a period of income convergence characterized by a rise of the middle class, in 1998 Russian households income started to polarize and in 2008 one can observe a very high degree of polarization and a marked decrease in the middle class. This shrinking of the middle class affected particularly incomes below the median.

This observation is remarkable given the importance of costs in transportation decision-making. Classification of differently sized IWTs and their cost structure will lead to more insight into the container cost per terminal. Therefore, the goal of our research was to determine both the characteristics of the cost structure associated with different inland waterway (IWW) container terminal types and the sensitivity of the system to cost/TEU changes in input and operational conditions. We show that terminals with a higher container throughput encounter fewer costs, and can therefore charge a lower price. Assumed delays of 2 h per day on the waterside cause a 4.7-6.6% cost increase per container, mainly caused by extra labor costs. It is also assumed that the changing climate will influence terminal operations and results in extreme water levels (lasting two weeks occurring four times a year) causing a cost increase of 1.0-3.4%. Subsidies can cause cost reductions of 0.3-10.4% depending on the exact form, with the smaller terminals benefiting more because their investment costs are higher relative to operational costs. A subsidy can lower costs by up to 10.4%, but it is questionable whether small and medium terminals will have a lower cost price than the market price, showing that it is important for small and medium terminals to quickly grow in size.

However, if wages lagged behind productivity growth, why did the National Industrial Recovery Act fail to increase employment and output? This article shows that the chosen policy instruments (e.g., Codes of Fair Competition and the President's Reemployment Agreement), and not the objectives, were among the causes of its demise.

Solving economic problems through regular updates (patches) became as important to those games as traditional gameplay issues. In this paper we provide an agent framework inspired by the economic features of Diablo 3 and analyze the effect of monetary policy in the game. Our model reproduces a number of features known from the Diablo 3 economy such as a heterogeneous price development, driven almost exclusively by goods of high quality, a highly unequal wealth distribution and strongly decreasing economic mobility. The basic framework presented in this paper is meant as a stepping stone to further research, where our evidence is used to deepen our understanding of the real-world counterparts of such problems. The advantage of our model is that it combines simplicity that is inherent to model economies with a similarly simple observable counterpart (namely the game environment where real agents interact). By matching the dynamics of the game economy we can thus easily verify that our behavioral assumptions are good approximations to reality.","[El-Shagi, Makram] Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Kaifeng, Peoples R China; [El-Shagi, Makram; von Schweinitz, Gregor] Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Dept Macroecon, Halle, Germany; [von Schweinitz, Gregor] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Chair Macroecon, D-06108 Halle, Germany",Henan University; Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH); Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"El-Shagi, M (通讯作者)，Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Kaifeng, Peoples R China.",makram.elshagi@gmail.com; gregorvon.schweinitz@iwh-halle.de,"von Schweinitz, Gregor/CAA-5344-2022","von Schweinitz, Gregor/0000-0001-9293-3470",European Regional Development Fund through the programme Investing in your Future,European Regional Development Fund through the programme Investing in your Future,Research of Gregor von Schweinitz was partly funded by the European Regional Development Fund through the programme Investing in your Future.,,15,2,2,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

In the algorithms, an improvement in the balance increases the pheromones, thus rising the probability of ants moving towards the equilibrium of the matrix.

To measure the process of regime personalization, and to distinguish such a process from overall authoritarian reversal, is difficult in comparative context. Using the Russian political regime in 1999-2014 as a case study, we examine the dynamics of regime personalization over time. Relying on original data on patron-client networks and expert surveys assessing the policy influence of the key members of the ruling coalition, we argue that having more clients, or clients who are more powerful, increases the power of patrons - and that where the patron is the ruler, the resulting measure is an indication of the level of personalization of the regime. We trace regime personalization from the changes in political influence of the president's associates in his patron-client network versus that of other elite patron-client networks. We find that as early as 2004, the Russian regime can be regarded as personalist, and is strongly so from 2006 onward.","[Baturo, Alexander] Dublin City Univ, Sch Law & Govt, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Elkink, Johan A.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Dublin 4, Ireland",Dublin City University; University College Dublin,"Baturo, A (通讯作者)，Dublin City Univ, Sch Law & Govt, Dublin 9, Ireland.",alex.baturo@dcu.ie,"Elkink, Johan/AAC-7354-2019; Elkink, Johan/AAQ-1171-2021","Elkink, Johan/0000-0002-8275-533X; Baturo, Alexander/0000-0002-1108-5287",,,,,62,30,33,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

In the first part, I present the early' Hayek of the 1930s. Hayek was the great rival of Keynes. Both explained the Great Depression, applying opposing business cycle theories. For Keynes, the crisis was caused by an excess of saving over investment; for Hayek, on the contrary, by an excess of investment over saving. In the early 1930s, Ropke attempted a synthesis, positing that a recession due to overinvestment can degenerate, as in 1929, into a depression caused by oversaving. Hayek examined and rejected Ropke's theory. In the second part, I present the later' Hayek of the 1970s. After years of silence and solitude, Hayek was unexpectedly awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, precisely for the contribution he made in the 1930s to the theory of the business cycle. Hayek returned to his pursuit of the ghost of Keynes, debated with his friend and rival Friedman, re-examined Ropke's special case and, according to Haberler, changed his mind. In my conclusion, I attempt to resolve the dilemma.","[Magliulo, Antonio] LUSPIO Univ Rome, Fac Econ, Via Cristoforo Colombo 200, I-00147 Rome, Italy",,"Magliulo, A (通讯作者)，LUSPIO Univ Rome, Fac Econ, Via Cristoforo Colombo 200, I-00147 Rome, Italy.",antonio.magliulo@luspio.it,,"MAGLIULO, Antonio/0000-0003-1482-656X",,,,,59,7,8,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

A network perspective is a suitable framework to explore the connectedness of the world-wide banking system and to monitor potential threads to its stability. By calculation of several topological properties we are able to shed some light on interconnections among banking sectors on country-to-country level, although the applied methodology is also well-suited for the individual bank-to-bank exposure analysis. We extend the analysis by examining the cycles within the exposure networks, which correspond to the risk-sharing bank activities through the cross-border lending and borrowing at the same time.","[Baumohl, Eduard; Lyocsa, Stefan; Vyrost, Tomas] Univ Econ Bratislava, Inst Econ & Management, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04130, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Baumöhl, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Inst Econ & Management, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04130, Slovakia.",eduard.baumohl@euba.sk; stefan.lyocsa@euba.sk; tomas.vyrost@euba.sk,"Vyrost, Tomas/AAO-3780-2020; Lyocsa, Stefan/ABE-7961-2021; Baumohl, Eduard/K-3195-2014","Vyrost, Tomas/0000-0002-8384-5724; Lyocsa, Stefan/0000-0002-8380-181X; Baumohl, Eduard/0000-0002-5444-7348",,,,,11,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,134,143,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100014,0

My focus is particularly on ecofeminism, which I argue helps regional integration scholars ask important questions that need to be more central to our work, and on Gaia theory, which I argue provides the ontological analysis to legitimize such a shift in theoretical perspective. As an illustration of how a green approach to integration theory might be undertaken, I use Mary Mellor's ecofeminist work to contribute to the `normative turn' in integration theory.","[Brianson, Alex] Univ Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [Brianson, Alex] United Nations Univ UNU CRIS, Paris, France",University of Kent,"Brianson, A (通讯作者)，12 Privett Rd, Gosport PO12 3SU, Hants, England.",alex.brianson@yahoo.com,,,,,,,67,1,1,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

There are cases in which orders cannot be made at the moment they are received so it is necessary to change the sequence of making them to increase production efficiency. Setting the priority of orders plays an important role as it lets manufacturers organize the course of production. Analytical methods are often confronted with their limits and, therefore, the use of computer simulation increases progressively. The simulation method as a tool is more and more often used to define the appropriate procedure for the selection of orders and organizing a manufacturing process. They are based on mathematical models which are subsequently used as a source for simulation programs. These programs are especially useful for strategic production planning. The main aim of the article is to design an adequate mathematical model based on the heuristic approach.

It associates that defense with interdisciplinarity, or the idea that the social sciences are relatively autonomous, but argues that this defense functions as a mask for a more conventional imperialist strategy of promoting Chicago School neoclassicism. Lazear's argument also created a dilemma for Chicago regarding how it could espouse interdisciplinarity while actually operating in a contrary way. I argue that the solution to this dilemma was for mainstream economics to rebuild economics imperialism around a performative conception of neoclassicism as a theory that always sees the world in its own image. This strategy, however, suffers from a number of problems, which upon examination ultimately lead us to multidisciplinarity, or the idea that the sciences can have transformative effects on one another. This latter conception can be associated with a complexity economics approach as an alternative view of the relation between the sciences. The paper argues that this view provides a basis for pluralism in economics.","[Davis, John B.] Marquette Univ, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA; [Davis, John B.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Marquette University; University of Amsterdam,"Davis, JB (通讯作者)，Marquette Univ, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA.;Davis, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",john.davis@marquette.edu,,,,,,,20,12,13,0,5,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

The social cost of a candidate is the sum of its distances to each voter. Some of our work assumes that these points can be modeled on the real line, but other results of ours are more general. A question closely related to candidate selection is that of minimizing the sum of distances for facility location. The difference is that in our setting there is a fixed set of candidates, whereas the large body of work on facility location considers every point in the metric space to be a possible candidate. This setting gives rise to three types of candidate selection mechanisms which differ in the granularity of their input space (single candidate, ranking and location mechanisms). We study the relationships between these three classes of mechanisms. While it may seem that Black's 1948 median algorithm is optimal for candidate selection on the line, this is not the case. We give matching upper and lower bounds for a variety of settings. In particular, when candidates and voters are on the line, our universally truthful spike mechanism gives a [ tight] approximation of two. When assessing candidate selection mechanisms, we seek several desirable properties: (a) efficiency (minimizing the social cost) (b) truthfulness (dominant strategy incentive compatibility) and (c) simplicity (a smaller input space). We quantify the effect that truthfulness and simplicity impose on the efficiency.","[Feldman, Michal; Fiat, Amos; Golomb, Iddan] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Comp Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University,"Feldman, M (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Comp Sci, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",michal.feldman@cs.tau.ac.il; fiat@tau.ac.il; igolomb@gmail.com,,,,,,,32,61,70,0,4,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,269,286,,10.1145/2940716.2940725,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300024,0

Using the case of a sudden and unanticipated currency devaluation in Botswana as a quasi-experiment, we examine how this monetary shock affects individuals' evaluations of well-being. We do so by using microlevel survey data, which-incidentally-were collected in the days surrounding the devaluation. The chance occurrence of the devaluation during the time of the survey enables us to use pretreatment respondents, surveyed before the devaluation, as approximate counterfactuals for post-treatment respondents, surveyed after the devaluation. Our estimates show that the devaluation had a large and significantly negative effect on individuals' evaluations of subjective well-being. These results suggest that macroeconomic shocks, such as unanticipated currency devaluations, may have significant short-term costs in the form of reductions in people's sense of well-being.","[Hariri, Jacob Gerner] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Bjornskov, Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Justesen, Mogens K.] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen; Aarhus University; Copenhagen Business School,"Justesen, MK (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Copenhagen, Denmark.",JGH@ifs.ku.dk; ChBj@econ.au.dk; mkj.dbp@cbs.dk,,"Hariri, Jacob Gerner/0000-0002-0176-9749",,,,,43,4,5,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

In recent years, the campus safety accidents frequently occur, which continue to stimulate the sensitive nerve of the society from all walks of life, and have aroused the high attention of all circles of life in the society. The campus safety and the administering of the schools according to laws have become the important issues of the common concern in the whole society. The campus security management is a systematical engineering, which will be influenced by many social factors. To ensure the campus security, we cannot simply rely on the schools, but should also need the support of the educational administrative departments, Public Security and the departments of justice, the community organizations, the social media, the parents and other aspects. Only by mass prevention and mass treatment and by strengthening the management can we create a healthy and orderly campus environment full of vitality. In this paper, the author will mainly discuss the construction of the GIS system in the campus security, only for reference. The Digital Earth and the digital city are the hot spots of the scientific researches on the earth spatial information in recent years. The most basic technology in the technological systems of the earth spatial information science is the 3S technology and its integration. The 3S is the general designation of the global positioning system (GPS), the geographic information system (GIS) and the remote sensing (RS). With the development of the construction of the campus informationization all over the world, the concept of the Digital Campus correspondingly came into being. The so-called Digital Campus refers to the use of the broadband and the interactive and professional local area network to realize the digitalization, informationization and intelligence of running the schools in the whole process of carrying out the teaching, the scientific researches and the management, as well as the external communication work. The application of the GIS technology can help solve the problem of the campus security, and the author will put forward the targeted security countermeasures based on the GIS system.","[He, Shuluan; Wu, Mingzhu] Hainan Coll Econ & Business, Haikou 570201, Hainan, Peoples R China",Hainan College of Economics & Business,"He, SL (通讯作者)，Hainan Coll Econ & Business, Haikou 570201, Hainan, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,11,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7914-0,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,58.0,,,,,,421,425,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7QX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391643800080,0

But in reality, due to people's selfishness, the information block and other reasons, the sharing of the high-quality information is limited. In this paper, the author of this paper carries out the analysis of the present situation of the sharing of the domestic and foreign educational resources, and finds a solution to the low degree of the sharing of the high-quality network educational resources, to give advice and suggestions for the development of the network education. At present, the outcome of the construction of the network education in our country is outstanding, which is mainly reflected in the two aspects of the high level and the rich resources. This marks that the construction of the network resources in the network education in China has come into a period of the high-speed development. These results bring us surprise, which also caused our reflections. In the rapid development of the network education, there are many problems in the sharing of the high-quality resources. What caused the paradoxical situation? If we do not understand the importance of the sharing of the high-quality teaching resources in the network education, the rapid development of the network education will only bring more and more problems.","[Hong, Hetiao] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Hangzhou 310000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Hangzhou Normal University,"Hong, HT (通讯作者)，Hangzhou Normal Univ, Hangzhou 310000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,3,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7914-0,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,58.0,,,,,,426,431,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7QX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391643800081,0

It is well known that commonly used Black-Scholes type models can not capture all real market features. Therefore, one way to make these models suitable for real world pricing issues is to relax some of the model assumptions. In this paper we present one of the basket option models that try to remain consistent with the volatility smile. These multi-factor local volatility models incorporate the volatility as a function of maturity and moneyness into the pricing procedure. The presented numerical approach arises from the concept of the discontinuous Galerkin method and enables better resolving of occurred special properties of solutions of such types of options. Finally, the resulting schemes are demonstrated on practical experiments with real data.","[Hozman, Jiri] Tech Univ Liberec, Dept Math & Didact Math, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic; [Tichy, Tomas] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Finance, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec; Technical University of Ostrava,"Hozman, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Dept Math & Didact Math, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic.",jiri.hozman@tul.cz; tomas.tichy@vsb.cz,"Tichy, Tomas/AAA-1564-2021; Tichy, Tomas/ABH-9773-2020","Tichy, Tomas/0000-0002-6503-5330;",,,,,9,0,0,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,307,312,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500053,0

In other words, in an environment of legal uncertainty there are no or few investments. Legal certainty primarily means that it is clear when and under what conditions something is legal or illegal. Unfortunately, in Croatia, according to the information given by the author, there are legal environment and practice that, instead of going in favorem investment, do the opposite. As a typical example, we analyzed paying property taxes in millions to the international trading corporation for the non-existing facility whose construction never started, but was only issued construction permit, later reduced. The construction was performed according to such reduced permit, but the taxes were charged as if it were several times bigger object. The examples of numerous laws abolished by the Croatian Constitutional Court are also given, of which some in full and before the entry into force (Criminal Code), some had their implementation indefinitely postponed and until then were ordered to implement the law abrogated by the legislator (Family Law), with a range of less drastic examples. In such environment it doesn't surprise the fact that the constitution has been amended several times in the short term (the offenses of transition and privatization). In recent Croatian Parliament convene more laws were passed by urgent, than the regular procedure. Each of these phenomena, separately and all together, give us reason to admit with a great regret that both, the legal framework and practice in its essence, reject investments and investors.","[Ivancic - Kacer, Blanka] Univ Split, Fac Law, Domovinskog Rata 8, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Split,"Ivancic - Kacer, B (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Law, Domovinskog Rata 8, Split 21000, Croatia.",blanka.ivancic-kacer@pravst.hr,,,,,,,10,0,0,1,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,347,353,,,,,,7,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400036,0

Eighty-five percent of respondents indicate that they are willing to pay at least 10 percent more than the market price for these products. The econometric analysis indicates that income, education, age and gender, as well as public awareness and concerns about climate change are significant factors influencing WTP. Respondents who are more knowledgeable and more concerned about the adverse effect of climate change show higher WTP. In comparison, income elasticity is small.

The demand-side model of economic growth based on massive windfall revenue from oil and gas exports from the 2000s is now exhausted, and the country needs to shift to a new, supply-side model of growth. Mobilization and liberalization are discussed as two key economic policy alternatives. The analysis includes historical retrospection, which provides some important lessons from economic developments in the twentieth century: the Great Depression and the period of stagflation, the Soviet industrialization debate and perestroika, and the New Economic Policy in the USSR and the contemporary modernization of China. Special attention is paid to the mechanisms of economic growth acceleration in present-day Russia.

Since determinism of chaotic time series indicates on potential possibility of their prediction, it is also expected that has a significant impact on the construction of optimal portfolio.

Sustainable management of tropical peatlands is an important element in controlling carbon emission. However, the available information of tropical peatlands lacks of accuracy and is outdated, especially in terms of medium to high resolution. Thus, development of reliable monitoring techniques is a significant step towards the sustainable management of tropical peatlands. The remote sensing (RS) application is suitable as a tool to monitor tropical peatlands, whereas direct measurements are generally labor-intensive, time-consuming and limited to accessibility. In this study, methodology to identify degraded tropical peatland was developed by using the McFeeters Normalized Difference Water Index (McFeeters-NDWI), which was derived by Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 (AVNIR-2) data. Additionally, a seasonal analysis was carried out to examine the characteristics of degraded tropical peatland during the rainy and dry seasons from the viewpoint of the medium to high resolution of optical RS. Overall, a relationship was discovered such that the wet shrub class was considered as the degraded tropical peatland area, and was identified as being in between -0.43 to -0.11 of the McFeeters-NDWI value. The wet-shrub class yielded a producer's accuracy of 80.6% and a user's accuracy of 91.8%. Afterwards, the seasonal change was discovered to slightly shift the threshold values (TrVs) in the identification of degraded tropical peatland by as much as -0.05. However, the interval of the TrVs for the wet shrub class was stable and remained unchanged. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Samples were determined using incidental sampling method, performed land quality analysis, land conversion, and prediction the loss of potential unhulled-rice production using time series data. Results of the research showed that, the causal factors of rice-field conversion to non rice-field (turned into embankment) include lower productivity of rice-field, low quality of land, and higher economic values of the land that belonged to the competitors. Rice-field conversion at La'bakkang Subdistrict in Pangkep Regency that had occurred for 5 years (2009 - 2014) covered the area of 124.5 hectares or for about 24.9 hectares per year. Meanwhile, the loss of potential rice production, since that period as a result of rice-field conversion was 1,571,129 kg or 314,225.8 kg per year. Such condition has occurred cumulatively, permanently, and progressively, which meant that loss of food production (particularly rice), which was caused by land conversion, was very huge and cannot be recovered anymore.

The simulated alternatives are evaluated with multi-attribute decision tools expert system. The simulation system consists of deterministic production simulation models that enable different types of costs calculations for organic production and on farm food processing in the framework of supplementary activities. Simulation models were further evaluate by a qualitative multi-attribute decision modelling methodology using the software tool DEX-I and quantitative analytical hierarchical process (AHP). The simulation model was also evaluated by the standard financial analysis (i.e., cost benefit analysis). These results show that there was the difference before and after investment into specific processing equipment of three organic products with respect to positive financial values. The financial analysis reveals that after 10 years the farm had constant annual cash flow with an investment return at 9.43%. This showed that investments into organic farm was feasible financially. The integrated simulation model as the discount cash flow and multi-criteria decision analysis are the suitable methodological tool for decision support system on organic farms. The system takes into consideration different independent criteria and enables ranking of farm business alternatives. The model is useful in minimizing risk and inappropriate decision in investment.

Deodorization was conducted at 130, 140, and 150 degrees C under 20 mmHg. 20 L/hour of nitrogen was used to deodorize neutral oil. After 1 and 2 hours, NDPO (Neutralized Deodorized Palm Oil) was then analyzed for some quality parameters, including moisture content, free fatty acid (FFA), total carotenes, peroxide value (PV), color, and odor. All treatments had good performance to reduce moisture content and PV. Considering oil quality parameters, deodorization at 140 degrees C for 1 hour was recommended to produce NDPO with high carotene retention. It could preserve carotene almost 70%. All treatments could not reduce FFA and all volatile components of odor although NRPO was deodorized for 2 hours at 150 degrees C.

In particular, it shows in the case of EU studies that a settled narrative of the pivotal theoretical debate between neo-functionalism and intergovernmentalism has been a vital rhetorical tool in the constitution of the field since the 1990s. Drawing on citation data and contemporaneous accounts of the theoretical architecture of the field from the 1970s and 1980s, the article shows that the idea of an intergovernmentalist school of theory is a retrospective construction developed in the 1980s and 1990s that has been read back into the past of the field of integration studies. The further effects of this settled intersubjective understanding of EU studies past include contributions to the stereotyping and simplification of neo-functionalism, the writing out of the field's key archive of other mainstream theoretical work and the continued silencing of non-mainstream or ' dissident ' theoretical voices.","[Rosamond, Ben] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Rosamond, B (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",br@ifs.ku.dk,,"Rosamond, Ben/0000-0003-1487-7703",,,,,82,16,17,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Elements of the matrix express evaluations if a decision-maker chooses the particular alternative and the particular state of the world occurs. In practice, the states of the world as well as the decision-maker's evaluations are often described only vaguely. In the literature, there are considered fuzzy decision matrices, where alternatives are compared on the basis of the fuzzy expected values and fuzzy variances of their evaluations. However, the fuzzy variances of alternatives are calculated without considering dependencies between fuzzy evaluations under particular fuzzy states of the world and the fuzzy expected evaluation. So the final ranking of alternatives can be wrong. In the paper, we propose a proper way of how should the fuzzy variances of evaluations of alternatives be obtained.

Peer prediction mechanisms seek to exploit correlations between signals to align incentives with truthful reports. A long-standing concern has been the possibility of uninformative equilibria. For binary signals, a multi-task mechanism [Dasgupta and Ghosh 2013] achieves strong truthfulness, so that the truthful equilibrium strictly maximizes payoff. We characterize conditions on the signal distribution for which this mechanism remains strongly-truthful with non-binary signals, also providing a greatly simplified proof. We introduce the Correlated Agreement (CA) mechanism, which handles multiple signals and provides informed truthfulness: no strategy profile provides more payoff in equilibrium than truthful reporting, and the truthful equilibrium is strictly better than any uninformed strategy (where an agent avoids the effort of obtaining a signal). The CA mechanism is maximally strongly truthful, in that no mechanism in a broad class of mechanisms is strongly truthful on a larger family of signal distributions. We also give a detail-free version of the mechanism that removes any knowledge requirements on the part of the designer, using reports on many tasks to learn statistics while retaining epsilon-informed truthfulness.","[Shnayder, Victor] EdX, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Shnayder, Victor; Parkes, David C.] Harvard Univ, Paulson Sch Engn, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Agarwal, Arpit] Indian Inst Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Frongillo, Rafael] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Harvard University; Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Shnayder, V (通讯作者)，EdX, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.;Shnayder, V (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Paulson Sch Engn, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",shnayder@eecs.harvard.edu; arpit.agarwal@csa.iisc.ernet.in; raf@colorado.edu; parkes@eecs.harvard.edu,,"Frongillo, Rafael/0000-0002-0170-7572",,,,,29,56,67,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,179,196,,10.1145/2940716.2940790,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300018,0

However, not so much attention is paid to the risks connected with establishing these new, innovative forms of businesses. This led us to conducting our study on risk definition and risk management in a selected case of LPS. We examine how the representatives of the LPS perceive risks in their municipality association. We used qualitative methods for an extensive document analysis of relevant policy documents, databases and websites to identify a list of local production systems in Slovakia. From this list we chose Bioenergia Bystricko, where we conducted an interview with the representatives using a semi-structured interview. The paper is based on original survey data from our own research, conducted mainly within two research projects, LIPSE and FOLPSEC. Based on our primary research we found out that Bioenergia Bystricko grasped the meaning of LPS and they use its potential for local social and economic development, whereas the risk definition and management lags, both in theory and practice. The study analyzes the case of a successful innovation that supports local business activities and as such can serve as an inspiration for other regions in Slovakia.

Abstractly, this setting can be thought of as an instance with single-dimensional type space but multi-dimensional allocation space. Such setting has been extensively studied in the literature, but all under the assumption that the items are positively correlated. Under the positive correlation assumption, the optimal allocation rules are simple, avoiding difficulties brought by ensuring Bayesian incentive compatibility (BIC) under multi-dimensional feasibility constraints and by ensuring interim individual rationality (IIR) given the possibility that the lowest utility point may no longer be at the boundary of the type domain. However, the nice properties no longer hold when there is negative correlation among items. In this paper, we obtain the closed-form optimal auction for this setting, by directly addressing the two difficulties above. In particular, the first difficulty is that when pointwise maximizing virtual surplus under multi-dimensional feasibility (i.e., the Border feasibility), (1) neither the optimal interim allocation is trivially monotone in the virtual value, (2) nor the virtual value is monotone in the bidder's type. As a result, the optimal interim allocations resulting from virtual surplus maximization no longer guarantee BIC. To address (1), we prove a generalization of Border's theorem and show that optimal interim allocation is indeed monotone in the virtual value. To address (2), we adapt Myerson's ironing procedure to this setting by redefining the (ironed) virtual value as a function of the lowest utility point. The second difficulty, perhaps a more challenging one, is that the lowest utility type in general is no longer at the endpoints of the type interval. To address this difficulty, we show by construction that there exist an allocation rule and an induced lowest utility type such that they form a solution of the virtual surplus maximization and in the meanwhile guarantees IIR. In the single bidder case, the optimal auction consists of a randomized bundle menu and a deterministic bundle menu; while in the multiple bidder case, the optimal auction is a randomization between two extreme mechanisms. The optimal solutions of our setting can be implemented by a Bayesian IC and IR auction, however, perhaps surprisingly, the revenue of this auction cannot be achieved by any (dominant-strategy) DIC and IR auction. In other words, we have witnessed the first instance where a Bayesian IC auction yields strictly more revenue than any IC auction, resolving an important conjecture concerning whether there exists a quasi-linear setting where the optimal revenues differ under the two different solution concepts.","[Tang, Pingzhong; Wang, Zihe] Tsinghua Univ, IIIS, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Tang, PZ (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, IIIS, Beijing, Peoples R China.",kenshinping@gmail.com; wzh5858588@163.com,,,,,,,29,9,9,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,103,120,,10.1145/2940716.2940766,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300012,0

Thus it is inevitable from the socio-economic aspect to investigate the opinion of paddy/rice farmers towards using the new herbicide-resistant paddy/rice known as Clearfield Technique (CLRS) as their farming systems. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and the Binary Logit regression were being employed as the methodology to analyze the data.

Nevertheless, in their actual search for some job they rely on their parents and relatives' help, and they don't rely on the help from employment services or recruitment agencies.

During stagnation, reorientation policies are used in an attempt to mitigate some of those effects in order to reduce the prevalence of seasonality. Various planning instruments have been designed and implemented by successive local governments, a key priority being the attempt to find a strategic answer to reducing this phenomenon. Based on the analysis of successive marketing plans of the Autonomous Region of the Balearic Islands, and using the Gini index to measure seasonality, this study explores the link between the two and demonstrates that regional political policies adopted over the last 20 years have not reduced seasonal variation in tourism.

The European Mobility Partnerships (EU MPs) can be considered the most recent manifestation of this rhetoric. Studies on EU MPs reflect a narrow understanding of power. This paper aims to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the power dimension inherent in the EU's external relations. It develops a neogramscian theoretical framework to challenge the rhetoric of the EU as a soft power and normative hegemon. Drawing on semi-structured expert interviews and textual analysis of documents, it seeks to reveal whether and in what ways socio-economic power dynamics shape the EU MPs. This article argues that while, at the beginning, the design of the EU MPs as a policy tool has been very much influenced by neoliberal ideas such as the market-oriented liberalisation of mobility and the flexibilisation of labour, implementation is marked by the neo-mercantilist approach of restricting immigration and maximising the efficiency of readmission. Applying a critical political economy concept of power is helpful in understanding how market forces influence EU external migration policy, transcending a narrow understanding of power.","Univ Lucerne, Dept Polit Sci, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland",University of Lucerne,"Maisenbacher, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lucerne, Dept Polit Sci, Frohburgstr 3,POB 4466, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland.",julia.maisenbacher@unilu.ch,,,,,,,60,3,4,0,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

These matched series allow us to conduct time series analysis to examine the long-term present value relationship in the housing market. Three key findings are obtained. First, we fail to establish a cointegrating relationship between the home purchase price and rental price based on nationally estimated indexes. Second, area-specific indexes demonstrate strong cross-correlations, invalidating the use of first generation panel unit root tests that ignore these cross-correlations. Third, Pesaran's CIPS test indicates that the unit root hypothesis is rejected for the first difference of both indexes.

In particular, we show that apartment rental-related online searches are endogenously and contemporaneously associated with reduced vacancy rate. However, the association between the searches and rental rates is not significant. The searches are also contemporaneously associated with positive returns on the appraised values of multifamily assets. There is some evidence that the searches are fundamentally associated with REIT returns in the short run and that REIT investors watch the online search trends to inform their stock pricing decisions.","[Das, Prashant] Ecole Hoteliere Lausanne, CH-1000 Lausanne 25, Switzerland; [Ziobrowski, Alan] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Coulson, N.

However, the QML estimators (QMLEs) of the spatial parameters can be quite biased and hence the standard inferences for the regression coefficients (based on t-ratios) can be seriously affected. This issue, however, has not been addressed. The QMLEs of the spatial parameters can be bias-corrected based on the general method of Yang (2015b, J. of Econometrics 186, 178-200). In this paper, we demonstrate that by simply replacing the QMLEs of the spatial parameters by their bias-corrected versions, the usual t-ratios for the regression coefficients can be greatly improved. We propose further corrections on the standard errors of the QMLEs of the regression coefficients, and the resulted t-ratios perform superbly, leading to much more reliable inferences.

Part II: Exploring remedies via simulation,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Managed lanes; Carpool lanes; Toll lanes; Traffic simulation,,"Spatiotemporal analyses of freeway sites in Part I have shown that special-lane access points are prone to become bottlenecks. These can degrade traffic flows, sometimes in all lanes. Part II explores select impacts of re-designing the means of entering and exiting a special lane, and of altering the policy governing its use. Parametric tests were conducted using a computer simulation model that was calibrated to one of the sites studied in Part I; one with a buffer-separated carpool lane. Though less reliable than what might have been observed via experiments in real settings, the simulated findings seem to offer useful insights nonetheless. The findings indicate that traffic conditions would improve at the site by elongating the carpool lane's buffer opening beyond its present length of 400 m. Yet, only modest improvements were predicted, even when the opening was elongated to 1000 m or more. Greater benefits were predicted from disentangling the movements made into and out of the carpool lane. This was achieved by placing first a buffer opening to serve only ingress, followed by another immediately downstream to serve egress. The benefits of this treatment were again limited, even when each tandem opening was elongated to a length of 700 m. Fully removing the buffer that physically separates the carpool lane from the regular ones was predicted to bring the greatest improvements to traffic. Also examined was pending legislation that would leave the carpool-lane buffer in place, while limiting the times of day when the lane is reserved for special use. Simulations predict that this legislation would degrade travel conditions below those that presently occur at the site. The extent of this predicted degradation varied, depending upon the time of day when the lane-use restriction went into effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the viewpoints of individuals with cognitive disabilities are rarely considered. In Australia, the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is approximately 1% and increasing. Many individuals with ASD do not possess a driver's licence, indicating that access to public transport is crucial for their independence. However, at present, there is no research on the opinions of adults with ASD on public transport. Aim: To identify the viewpoints of adults with ASD regarding the barriers and facilitators of public transport usage and their transportation preferences, and to contrast these against the viewpoints of neurotypical adults. Methods: Q. method was used to identify the viewpoints of both participant groups on public transport. Participants consisted of 55 adults with a diagnosis of ASD and a contrast group of 57 neurotypical adults. Both groups completed a Q sort task which took place in either Perth or Melbourne, Australia. Results: The most prominent viewpoint indicated that both groups preferred to use public transport over driving and believed that it supported their independence. This viewpoint also indicated that both groups preferred to use electronic ticketing when using public transport. Interestingly, the second most prominent viewpoint indicated that both groups preferred to drive themselves by private car rather than use public transport. Discussion: It appears that the viewpoints of adults with and without ASD regarding public transportation were largely similar.

Therefore, the elasticities of demand with respect to such factors should be considered in modeling bus transit services and must be considered when maximizing net benefits (i.e. system welfare = consumer surplus + producer surplus) rather just minimizing costs. In this paper welfare is maximized with elastic demand relations for both conventional (fixed route) and flexible-route services in systems with multiple dissimilar regions and periods. As maximum welfare formulations are usually too complex for exact solutions, they have only been used in a few studies focused on conventional transit services. This limitation is overcome here for both conventional and flexible transit services by using a Real Coded Genetic Algorithm to solve such mixed integer nonlinear welfare maximization problems with constraints on capacities and subsidies. The optimized variables include service type, zone sizes, headways and fares. We also determine the maximum welfare threshold between optimized conventional and flexible services) and explore the effects of subsidies. The proposed planning models should be useful in selecting the service type and optimizing other service characteristics based on local geographic characteristics and financial constraints.

Now, we should take carbon dioxide emissions as a constraint in satisfying the electricity demand. Through an optimization model, the optimal power generation capacity structure under the constraint of carbon dioxide emission reduction is achieved. Also, the macroeconomic influences are accessed through a computable general equilibrium model, which results from the increment of power generation costs owing to adjustment of power generation capacity structure. The results show that, the implementation of renewable energy planning has significant positive effects on emission reduction. Nevertheless, the constraint of carbon dioxide emissions will change the power generation capacity structure as well as the power generation costs, and consequently has negative impacts on the macro-economy. It is worth noting that at current stage, many important industries in China are highly reliant on coal and thermal power. As a result, the potential for emission reduction by adjusting power generation capacity structure seems to decrease.","[Wang, Yuhong] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yao, Xin] Xiamen Univ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Pengfei] Natl Bur Stat China, Res Inst Stat Sci, Beijing 100826, Peoples R China",Jiangnan University; Xiamen University,"Yao, X (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Sch Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",wyh2003@gmail.com; lyhneyao@sina.com; yuanpf@gj.stats.cn,"Wang, Yuhong/B-3759-2008",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71203186, 71301061]; Ministry of Education Research of Social Sciences Youth Funded Projects of China [13YJC790065]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2010221051]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education Research of Social Sciences Youth Funded Projects of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"The research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71203186, 71301061), the Ministry of Education Research of Social Sciences Youth Funded Projects of China (Grant No. 13YJC790065) and The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2010221051).",,13,10,10,7,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Drawing on trade data and interviews, as well as press reports and position papers, I analyze the facts of the case and the debate around it and explore the impacts on the geography of production. The case draws attention to two issues which deserve greater attention in research in the GPN tradition. First, the position of companies within a GPN may dictate their political interests more clearly than their nationality. Second, GPNs are seen to be malleable. They can adjust their structures in reaction to new trade restrictions. This fact draws attention to the need to incorporate institutional factors, like trade policy, more effectively into GPN analysis. I propose some criteria to help researchers to do so. Finally, in terms of broader political economy, the case illustrates how, in the post financial crisis context, their domestic market is becoming an important lever for the Chinese government in international negotiations. Thus, at least in the trade sphere, the rise of China as a consumer market is changing global power relations.","[Curran, Louise] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Business Sch, Toulouse, France",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education,"Curran, L (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Business Sch, Toulouse, France.",l.curran@tbs-education.fr,"Curran, Louise/AHE-2801-2022","curran, louise/0000-0001-9326-052X",EU Marie Curie programme IRSES [GA 318909],EU Marie Curie programme IRSES,This research was part funded by the EU Marie Curie programme IRSES [grant number GA 318909].,,84,39,42,2,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

However, the disciplines disagree over whether the fragmentation of production is substantively novel, requiring amendments to trade theory, or is simply a secular deepening of the international division of labor. Some economists view it as just trade,' driven by well-known actor-less determinants, such as factor endowments, technology, and returns to scale, while more recent firm heterogeneity trade theories consider firm behavior. By contrast, other heterodox social science approaches differ by focusing on the strategic actions of firms and sector-specific governance as independent drivers which govern' trade and determine the division of value between countries. This paper develops novel measurements by utilizing unique transactional trade data - the raw firm-level trade transactions that comprise standard inter-country trade statistics - on 439 of China's largest exporters in 18 subsectors of the electronics and light industries, to examine whether trade is heterogeneously governed in ways theorized by the global value chain (GVC) literature. It finds substantial empirical support for GVC-governed trade, and advances both GVC and firm-centric trade theory along several fronts.","[Dallas, Mark P.] Union Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA; [Dallas, Mark P.] Harvard Univ, Fairbank Ctr Chinese Studies, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Union College; Harvard University,"Dallas, MP (通讯作者)，Union Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA.",,,"Dallas, Mark/0000-0002-9133-6540",Union College,Union College,"Participants and commentators at Harvard Business School and the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard have helped shape these ideas.

Our strategy is designed to handle identification failures as well as the misspecification of the relevant propagation mechanisms. We invert a likelihood ratio test for the cross-equation restrictions (CER) that the New Keynesian system places on its reduced-form solution under determinacy. If the CER are not rejected, sunspot-driven expectations can be ruled out from the model equilibrium and we accept the structural model. Otherwise, we move to a second-step and invert an Anderson and Rubin-type test for the orthogonality restrictions (OR) implied by the system of structural Euler equations. The hypothesis of indeterminacy and the structural model are accepted if the OR are not rejected. We investigate the finite-sample performance of the suggested identification-robust two-step testing strategy by some Monte Carlo experiments and then apply it to a New Keynesian AD/AS model estimated with actual US data. In spite of some evidence of weak identification as for the Great Moderation' period, our results offer formal support to the hypothesis of a switch from indeterminacy to a scenario consistent with uniqueness occurring in the late 1970s. Our identification-robust full-information confidence set for the structural parameters computed on the Great Moderation' regime turns out to be more precise than the intervals previously reported in the literature through limited-information' methods.

Previous studies in the food sector have shown that corporate social responsibility has positive effects on firm performance, but what is still unclear is whether and how much, consumers are willing to pay for such an intangible attribute. In tackling this issue, we attempt to offer insights into consumer willingness to pay for corporate social responsibility attributes, identifying the psychological constructs that are likely to influence consumer preferences.

The banking literature has largely accounted for risk using ex-post realizations of banks' uncertain outputs and the variables intended to capture risk. This is equivalent to estimating an ex-post realization of bank's production technology which, however, may not reflect optimality conditions that banks seek to satisfy under uncertainty. The ex-post estimates of technology are likely to be biased and inconsistent, and one thus may call into question the reliability of the results regarding banks' technological characteristics broadly reported in the literature. However, the extent to which these concerns are relevant for policy analysis is an empirical question. In this paper, we offer an alternative methodology to estimate banks' production technology based on the ex-ante cost function. We model credit uncertainty explicitly by recognizing that bank managers minimize costs subject to given expected outputs and credit risk. We estimate unobservable expected outputs and associated credit risk levels from banks' supply functions via nonparametric kernel methods. We apply this framework to estimate production technology of U.S. commercial banks during the period from 2001 to 2010 and contrast the new estimates with those based on the ex-post models widely employed in the literature.","[Malikov, Emir; Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Malikov, Emir] St Lawrence Univ, Dept Econ, Canton, NY 13617 USA; [Restrepo-Tobon, Diego] EAFIT Univ, Dept Finance, Medellin, Colombia",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Saint Lawrence University; Universidad EAFIT,"Malikov, E (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, POB 6000, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",emalikov@binghamton.edu,,"RESTREPO-TOBON, DIEGO/0000-0002-9054-3847","Colombian Fulbright Commission; Colombian Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (Colciencias); EAFIT University","Colombian Fulbright Commission; Colombian Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (Colciencias)(Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias); EAFIT University","Restrepo acknowledges financial support from the Colombian Fulbright Commission, the Colombian Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (Colciencias) and EAFIT University.",,37,9,11,0,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Yet the trade literature has paid little attention to the scope of innovation policy as a stimulus to both trade and innovation. To investigate this question, we rely on a general workhorse model of trade and firm heterogeneity with firm investments in R&D activities. The interplay of innovation and trade policies uncover novel results. In particular, we show that the effects of either policy depend on the degree of protectionism in a country. Therefore, countries can respond differently to the same policy, and similarly to different policies. In such a context, different governments may face different trade-offs in achieving a given target.","[Navas, Antonio] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Sala, Davide] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark",University of Sheffield; University of Southern Denmark,"Navas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",,,,,,,,43,6,6,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2015,38.0,8,,,,,1205,1224,,10.1111/twec.12278,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CP4RK,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359870000002,0

Specifically, we test two mainstream behavioral finance/economic theories: sunk cost fallacy and cognitive dissonance. Using fMRI technology, we identify a number of substrates within the brain that provide a neurobiological explanation for why some homeowners exercise their mortgage put option while others do not. We find that borrowers rationally do not suffer from the sunk cost fallacy as it relates to strategic default in that they significantly prioritize their negative equity position over the amount of their initial down payment. We do, however, find neurological support that cognitive dissonance is relevant in homeowners' thought processes as they toil with the hesitancy brought on by the believe that strategic default is immoral against the strong financial incentive to walk away from a substantially underwater mortgage.","[Seiler, Michael J.] Coll William & Mary, Mary Mason Sch Business, Dept Finance, Real Estate & Finance, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Walden, Eric] Texas Tech Univ, Informat Syst & Quantitat Sci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",William & Mary; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Seiler, MJ (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Mary Mason Sch Business, Dept Finance, Real Estate & Finance, POB 8795, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",Michael.Seiler@mason.wm.edu; Eric.Walden@ttu.edu,,"Seiler, Michael/0000-0001-7071-2474",,,,,33,4,5,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Using network analysis methods and an original dataset based on decisions in EU cartel cases, this paper maps the developments in detected collusion in the European market from 1958 to 2008 and tentatively explains these developments. It appears that collusive activities increased during the 1960s and after the mid-1980s and that a long decline in the scale of collusion began in the mid-1990s. Moreover, the geographical spread of collusive activities in Europe increased considerably from 1969 to 1993. To facilitate an explanation of these and other findings, the paper presents a three-dimensional analytical framework that emphasises the importance of anti-cartel regulation, major changes in the business environment and the size of national economies.","[Buch-Hansen, Hubert] Copenhagen Business Sch, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Levallois, Clement] EMLYON Business Sch, Ecully, France",Copenhagen Business School; emlyon business school,"Buch-Hansen, H (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Porcelaenshaven 24, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",hb.dbp@cbs.dk,,"Levallois, Clement/0000-0002-2482-1319; Buch-Hansen, Hubert/0000-0002-8279-4179",,,,,36,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This paper analyses how two hard Travel Demand Management (TDM) policies implemented in Singapore to target vehicle ownership and road usage may contribute to a negative externality namely excessive mileage accumulation. This has implications on resource depletion such as petrol wastage, higher CO2 emission and losses in time and productivity. Vehicle ownership in Singapore is managed firstly via the requirement to bid for a Certificate of Entitlement (CUE) which entitles the usage of local roads and secondly via the payment of an Additional Registration Fee (ARF) which is refundable between 75% and 50% to incentivise the de-registration of a vehicle before it is 10 years old. Such deregistered vehicles may also be eligible for a CUE refund between 0% and 80% depending on age. The CUE and ARF costs are significant as they typically account for more than half the purchase price of a vehicle. Furthermore, road usage is subject to Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) fees on busy segments. A sample of over 8700 used cars is analysed to infer the effects of the non-refundable (or sunk) and the variable portions of the combined cost of CUE and ARF as well as the number of ERP gantries on mileage over and above traditional factors such as petrol price and engine size. The findings suggest tweaks to the TDM policies to reduce mileage and its negative implications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Proximity to historical mining deposits is associated with reduced entrepreneurship for cities in the 1970s and onward in industries unrelated to mining.

Perhaps more surprisingly, this model also predicts that (iii) the weekly hours present does not depend on commute time, while (iv) academic achievement falls with-commute time. We show that these predictions are true for Dutch university students. To be specific, it appears that an additional hour of one-way commute time induces students to reduce their presence by 0.65 days per week. When present, students with an additional hour of commute time stay 52 min longer. The total time present per week therefore hardly depends on commute time. Our results consistently show that students with long commute times have less good average grades. Our results indicate a strong and statistically significant decrease in average grades with commute time, however, a decrease in study grades which is much smaller (or even dose to negligible) cannot be ruled out either.

We examine several of the most prominently made assertions about manufacturing decline and its consequences for deindustrializing metropolitan areas and find not all of them supported by the data. In particular, we find that, given their industrial structure some of these areas performed better than expected, that long-term economic distress was not inevitable, that manufacturing remains an important component in many metropolitan area economies, and that much of the growth in the service sector is based upon or complementary to the existence of manufacturing.

Previous research focused exclusively on persistence at the conditional mean of the inflation rate. As economic theory provides reasons for inflation persistence to differ across conditional quantiles, this is a potentially severe constraint. Conventional studies of inflation persistence cannot identify changes in persistence at selected quantiles that leave persistence at the mean of the distribution unchanged. Based on post-war US data we indeed find robust evidence for a structural break in persistence at all quantiles of the inflation process in the early 1980s. While prior to the 1980s inflation was not mean reverting, quantile autoregression based unit root tests suggest that since the end of the Volcker disinflation the unit root can be rejected at every quantile of the conditional inflation distribution.","[Wolters, Maik H.] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Wolters, Maik H.] Kiel Inst World Econ, Dept Macroecon, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Tillmann, Peter] Univ Giessen, Dept Econ, D-35394 Giessen, Germany",University of Kiel; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Wolters, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Wilhelm Seelig Pl 1, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",maik.wolters@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,30,17,18,0,22,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The effects of this bribe tax on productivity are compared to the consequences of red tape, which may be understood as imposing a time tax on firms. When testing effects in the full sample, only the bribe tax appears to have a negative impact on firm-level productivity, while the effect of the time tax is insignificant. We also find that the surrounding environment influences the way in which firm behaviour affects firm performance.

The mechanism effectively auctions off the 'right' to be the last one to contribute, but intuition suggests that neither player wishes to be the last one to contribute.

We investigate this problem by first recalling some negative results from preference and judgment aggregation theory which show that the aggregate of several probability measures should not be conceived as the probability measure induced by the aggregate of the corresponding expected utility preferences. We describe how McConway's (Journal of the American Statistical Association, 76(374):410-414, 1981) theory of probabilistic opinion pooling can be generalised to cover the case of the aggregation of infinite profiles of finitely additive probability measures, too; we prove the existence of aggregation functionals satisfying responsiveness axioms A la McConway plus additional desiderata even for infinite electorates. On the basis of the theory of propositional-attitude aggregation, we argue that this is the most natural aggregation theory for probability measures. Our aggregation functionals for the case of infinite electorates are neither oligarchic nor integral-based and satisfy (at least) a weak anonymity condition. The delicate set-theoretic status of integral-based aggregation functionals for infinite electorates is discussed.","[Herzberg, Frederik] Univ Munich, Munich Ctr Math Philosophy, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Herzberg, Frederik] Univ Bielefeld, Ctr Math Econ, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",University of Munich; University of Bielefeld,"Herzberg, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, Ctr Math Econ, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany.",fherzberg@uni-bielefeld.de,"Herzberg, Frederik/T-9507-2017","Herzberg, Frederik/0000-0001-6185-223X",,,,,54,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2015,78.0,2,,,,,319,337,,10.1007/s11238-014-9424-5,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AZ3JU,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348124200010,0

We use a hedonic pricing model for the empirical analysis and estimate the model by using the Box-Cox quantile regression method. The empirical results show that this method provides a more comprehensive description of housing price determinants. Housing prices and characteristics have a nonlinear relationship, and this relationship varies across all quantiles. In addition, the response of housing prices to various housing characteristics varies across quantiles. For example, an increase in the size of the gross floor area is more valued at higher quantiles. Other variables have differential effects on housing prices across the distribution of housing prices.

The increase in the wage gap stemmed from asymmetric labor market responses to the external shocks, explained by the dissimilar institutional configurations of the two labor markets.","[Lundh, Christer; Prado, Svante] Univ Gothenburg, Unit Econ Hist, Dept Econ & Soc, Sch Business Econ & Law, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Lundh, C (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Unit Econ Hist, Dept Econ & Soc, Sch Business Econ & Law, Gothenburg, Sweden.",christer.lundh@econhist.gu.se,"Prado, Svante/AAS-9306-2020","Prado, Svante/0000-0002-5046-3340",Riksbankens Jubileumsfond [P09-0500:1-E]; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences [P09-0500:1-E] Funding Source: Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences,Riksbankens Jubileumsfond(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences); Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences),"The authors have received financial support from the Riksbankens Jubileumsfond for the research project Swedish wages in comparative perspective, 1860-2008 (P09-0500:1-E).

My results indicate that these imbalances could have been detected with the aid of real-time econometric modeling. With reference to Stiglitz's general conception of a bubble, I use the econometric results to construct two bubble indicators, which clearly demonstrate the transition to an unstable regime in the early 2000s. The indicators are shown to Granger cause a set of coincident indicators and financial (in)stability measures. Finally, it is shown that the increased subprime exposure during the 2000s can explain the econometric breakdown, i.e.the housing bubble may be attributed to the increased borrowing to a more risky segment of the market.

The paper presents various methodological and methodical approaches of Russian researchers to the problem of labor conflicts management. The view of labor economists to this problem is related to the evolution of social and labor relations, change of place and role of labor conflicts in the Russian model of labor relations and their ratio with an institute of social partnership in the modern world. The destruction of the authoritarian-paternalistic model of labor relations exacerbated the antagonistic contradictions between workers and employers that led to the inevitable interpersonal conflicts, implicit conflicts caused by the resistance of employees, and conflicts of interests. The specificity of Russian labor conflicts is that these conflicts as a crisis form of relationships carry out the mission of forced rebalancing of subjects' - employees and employers - interests.","[Artamonova, Marina] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Artamonova, Marina] MSU, Fac Econ, Moscow 119991, Russia",Lomonosov Moscow State University; Lomonosov Moscow State University,"Artamonova, M (通讯作者)，Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Econ, Moscow, Russia.",mvartamonova@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,71,78,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000007,0

Horticulture has no live animal risks, but shares many others such as complex machinery, agrichemicals and manual handling. A recent fatal coal mine explosion has caused Government to revise the whole of its approach to workplace health and safety. A new stand-alone agency will be created with a substantially increased budget and staff. Enhanced and more extensive guidance material is to be produced. It is anticipated to act as a stronger regulator than its predecessors and will operate under a new law modelled on Australian experience. In this paper, the implications for horticultural enterprises and their workers are explored. More explicit indications of the responsibilities of owners, managers and workers and of the need for enhanced relationships between them to minimise risks, is a core principle of the proposed law. Improved holistic health and safety systems should reduce the risks to the businesses from injury or illness. This should enhance the quality assurance systems for the food being produced as there should be fewer times of crisis management from staff absences. The proposed law is a tightening of the old one but alone it is not enough. Better health and safety systems within Good Agricultural Practice frameworks should enhance audit-based assurances about fair, non-exploitive and healthy worker conditions and thus the products should have high food integrity and a higher market price. Until there is a change in relationships throughout the industry, whereby safety is made the number one priority and Safe becomes the Culture, the unacceptable high rate of injury and death will continue.","[Atkinson, W.

This paper looks into the challenges, experiences and lessons of smallholder vegetable farmers who have collaborated to supply high value markets. Data from farmer surveys, case studies, project documents and narratives are used. Results indicate that supplying high value markets leads to greater market access, more open communication and feedback, premium prices and higher income. However, accessing these markets requires farmers to improve product quantity and quality, to have competent marketing and business officers, improved logistics and better farm-to-market roads. Linking the marketing clusters to high value markets requires production protocols to be upgraded and long-term relationships established with buyers and various stakeholders.","[Bacus, R.

The companies have been selected as they are considered (by the local industrial associations) as sustainability champions in the targeted geographic area. In particular, four research questions are addressed: - Which meaning do the analyzed companies attribute to sustainability? - How do they put sustainability into practice? In which way do their specific actions reflect the meaning they give to act sustainably? - Which are the main barriers companies found in embracing sustainability?. Which benefits do arise from practicing sustainability and which disadvantages do they deal with? Design/methodology/approach - We use descriptive multiple case studies to investigate the dynamics related to corporate sustainability. We conducted open-ended in-depth interviews with managers and executives for each of the selected cases. Every interview was conducted through direct visits to companies and lasted at least two hours, so allowing the issues under investigation to be comprehensively analysed and the management's views and opinions to be more correctly perceived and interpreted. Originality/value - Based on the in-depth analysis of the selected cases, some initial theoretical findings can be pointed out: when a company embraces sustainability, so simultaneously focusing on the economic, environmental, and social dimensions (e.g. Dyllick and Hockerts, 2002), it also focuses on quality - in its broad meaning, which ranges from product quality to quality of human relationships - and adopts a long-term orientation in decision making. Both quality and long-term orientation are aptitudes that reflect on mental models of any organization; therefore, the company's commitment to embrace sustainability principles shapes its strategy and affects its programs and initiatives. Practical implications - This paper highlights some benefits that the interviewed managers or entrepreneurs put into relation with the adoption of sustainability. They concern profitability, image improvement, attraction of talented workers, better organizational climate, better relationships with partners, development of specific know-how and abilities, access to new markets, and long-term (i.e. sustainable) growth. Nonetheless, adopting a sustainability strategy requires to overcome some barriers - such as the need of strong financial efforts and a high dependency upon public subsidies for conducting investments - and presents some disadvantages (most benefits need time to be fully appreciated and there are higher risks of significant revenue losses).","[Bellantuono, Nicola; Pontrandolfo, Pierpaolo] Politecn Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Dangelico, Rosa Maria] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn, I-00185 Rome, Italy",Politecnico di Bari; Sapienza University Rome,"Bellantuono, N (通讯作者)，Politecn Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management, Viale Japigia 182, I-70126 Bari, Italy.",,"Pontrandolfo, Pierpaolo/AAH-5273-2020; Bellantuono, Nicola/AAC-3144-2020",,,,,,17,0,0,1,12,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2420,2432,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200190,0

We first review relevant literature from different disciplines. This suggests both that information targeted to an individual's specific needs is more effective than broader messages and that videos featuring role models similar to viewers reinforce persuasiveness as the latter relate to the character. We then discuss some of the challenges in designing non-laboratory randomized controlled trials to evaluate video-based interventions. We draw on our design of a recently completed study in remote rural Ethiopia, which showed that simple documentaries of relatively successful individuals from the same region affected both viewers' investment in their children's education and other future-oriented behaviors (Bernard, T., S.

We discuss the importance and challenges of placebo treatments to evaluate the effects of exposure to video and gatherings, explore the potential for controlling variation in the exposure of an individual's network of friends to the same treatment, and discuss external validity.

Studies in horse establishments worldwide have shown a tremendous occurrence of these parasites under largely different geographic and climatic conditions. Accordingly, decades of strongyle control have been based on regular and frequent preventive treatments with anthelmintics and, subsequently, this has led to increasing levels of anthelmintic resistance. Therefore, it is essential that investigations into the efficacy of current anthelmintics in different locations are performed to help future reliable control programmes. This paper reports preliminary data of a survey conducted in Romania to evaluate the efficacy of two commonly used anthelmintics (fenbendazole FBZ and ivermectin - IVM) against horse strongyles, using a faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT). Horses with a strongyle faecal egg count (FEC) of >= 50 eggs per gram (EPG) were enrolled into the study. The anthelmintic efficacy was determined by calculating the percentage of reduction in FEC between the group mean at Day 0 and Days 14 post-treatment. Individual strongyle faecal egg count reduction tests (n=137) were performed on three stud farms (R, S, C) in which 108 and 29 horses were administered ivermectin and fenbendazole, respectively. The results of the study have shown that the efficacy was within the expected range with no signs of anthelmintic resistance for IVM (98.2-100%). However, FBZ resistance was suspected in one stud (the group mean FECR of 75.4%). Thus, further studies are planned to investigate extension of the anthelmintic resistance in horse parasites including an increased number and different horse establishments in Romania, in order to design realistic control programmes carrying a limited risk of selection for anthelmintic resistance and improve overall health of the horses.

This paper attempts to remedy this void by developing a simple, two-region general equilibrium model with amenities playing a key role in affecting migration flows. Specifically, we argue that in the presence of an environmental externality, interregional labour migration depends not only on wages but also on amenities. People may leave a region offering higher wages, if the resulting utility loss from worsened amenities exceeds the gain in wages. Policies should be adopted by regions or nations to regulate the environment to provide for the quality of living. To attain this goal, regional or international policy cooperation on tradable pollution permits can be superior to pollution permits supplied independently by each region or nation while non-tradable between them.","[Chao, Chi-Chur; Sgro, Pasquale M.] Deakin Univ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Laffargue, Jean-Pierre] Univ Paris 01, Dept Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Liu, Xiangbo] Renmin Univ, Dept Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xiao, YuChao] Deakin Univ, Dept Finance, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Deakin University; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Renmin University of China; Deakin University,"Chao, CC (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",,"Sgro, Pasquale M/C-7629-2013","Sgro, Pasquale/0000-0002-1450-730X",,,,,22,3,3,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2015,38.0,1,,,SI,,48,62,,10.1111/twec.12247,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AZ9BS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348506900003,0

The present article supports the idea that the competitiveness action framework of European tourist destinations has to respect the principles and implement the instruments for sustainable development of tourism which exist at the European Union level. To that end, we used the two following qualitative research methods: the literature review and the case study. We started our analysis with several conceptual clarifications and theoretical definitions regarding the notions of tourism competitiveness and sustainable development within the context of the most recent Tourism Policy adopted by the European Commission. We used a step-by-step approach and formulated a simple definition of the sustainable tourist destination, from a European perspective. For European tourist destinations, gaining competitive advantage essentially means developing in a sustainable way. The next methodological step was to analyze the competitiveness of Romania macro-tourist destination within the context of the European Union. To accomplish this purpose, we used the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index developed by the World Economic Forum. We concluded that Romania needs to focus on the sustainable development of tourism in order to become a more competitive macro-tourist destination within the European Union.","[Cismaru, Laura] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania; [Iunius, Ray] Ecole Hoteliere Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland",Transylvania University of Brasov,"Cismaru, L (通讯作者)，Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania.",,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,747,754,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400095,0

Specifically, the paper compares the optimal mix of per-flight and per-passenger based airport charges from both a monopoly carriers' and the social viewpoints conditional on airport cost recovery. It focuses on the trade-off between price and frequency (i.e., schedule delays) when time valuations are uniform, or differ, between business and leisure passengers. We identify an easy test for the evaluation of the mix of per-passenger and per-flight based airport charges by policy makers, which is simply to check whether the carrier's preferred per-flight charge is zero. Our analysis suggests that there is no need for immediate regulatory corrections of the current trend towards the strong use of per-passenger based airport charges. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In 2013, the share that contributing BPC in relation to the overall level of the Republic of Croatia for the following indicators are: the number of enterprises 1.52%, the share in total employment is 1.8%, the share of total assets is 0.8%, the share of income makes 1.18%, net profit 0.96% etc. Strategy presents a series of competitive moves and business approaches that company uses to increase the level of business, ensure the desired market position, attract customers, compete successfully, and accomplished the desired objectives. Strategy of each company, same as the economy is the key to development and success. All weak indicators can be explained by poor and almost non-existent strategy for the development of county economy and stimulate entrepreneurial activity. Manufacturing industry historically has great significance for the BPC and has been a holder of the economy. However, badly managed privatization is almost destroyed many sectors. Because of this, it should develop a strategy to enable to existing enterprises enviable business results. The aim of this paper is to show status and basic financial indicators for the sectors which comprise more than 15 companies in the manufacturing in BPC, which are according to the CNAE 2007 (CNAE-National Classification of Economic Activities) Sector: C10 Manufacture of food products, C16-Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork, except furniture, C22-Manufacture of rubber and plastic, C25-production of fabricated metal products, except machinery and equipment.

It traces the origins of 'multi-vector' foreign policy to a series of asymmetric bargaining 'games' between smaller states and two competing regional powers over the terms of cooperation. During these bargaining games, they either accommodate the demands of more powerful actors to relieve external pressure, or manoeuvre between two external actors to extract concessions from and negotiate more favourable agreements with one or both.

Our empirical analysis relies on export data for more than 100,000 Chinese exporters over the 2000-6 period. We confirm a trade-deterring effect of RER volatility. We find that firms' decision to begin exporting and the exported value decrease for destinations with a higher exchange rate volatility and that this effect is magnified for financially vulnerable firms. As expected, financial development seems to dampen this negative impact, especially on the intensive margin of export. These results provide micro-founded evidence suggesting that the existence of well-developed financial markets allows firms to hedge exchange rate risk. The results also support a key role of financial constraints in determining the macro impact of RER volatility on real outcomes.","[Hericourt, Jerome] Univ Lille 1, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Hericourt, Jerome] Univ Lille, EQUIPPE, Lille, France; [Hericourt, Jerome] Univ Paris 01, CES, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Hericourt, Jerome; Poncet, Sandra] CEPII, Paris, France; [Poncet, Sandra] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France",Universite de Lille; Universite de Lille; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics,"Poncet, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",jerome.hericourt@univ-lille1.fr; sandra.poncet@cepii.fr,,"Hericourt, Jerome/0000-0002-1870-7931",French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-11-JSH1 002 01],French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We thank two anonymous referees and the editor for very insightful comments.

To develop and cultivate freeze tolerant cultivars is the most effective way to avoid damages caused by freeze. Cold tolerance is considered a quantitative trait in plants. In this research, QTL mapping was used to find loci and molecular markers putatively related with freeze tolerance in citrus. A new linkage map was established by combining the segregating data of markers in a published map and SSR markers newly developed from citrus EST and Clementine BAC-end sequences. New map integrated 452 SSR markers with 9 linkage groups and covered 936.1 cM of citrus genome with an average genetic distance at 2.07 cM between adjacent markers. Freeze tolerance of the mapping population of parents and 68 progenies was tested by the method of electrolyte leakage in the end of December after more than two weeks of low temperature hardening and Semi-lethal low temperature (LT50) was estimated with logistic equation. The distribution of LT50 in the mapping population was not deviated from a normal distribution. Four QTLs were indentified at LOD >= 3.0, which could explain 29.3, 23.1, 44.7 and 21.0% of the phenotypic variation. These QTLs were mapped on the linkage group 2, 4, 3 and 1, respectively.

Therefore, triploidy breeding appears very promising for the selection of new citrus cultivars. CIRAD has developed a method to produce triploid hybrids by somatic hybridization between diploid and haploid lines and demonstrate the potential for haploid citrus production by induced gynogenesis in clementine. In this work we analyzed the efficiency of induced gynogenesis by irradiated pollen in 'Wilking' mandarin (Citrus reticulata). Four doses of gamma irradiation of 'Meyer' lemon pollen were tested (150, 200, 250, 300 Grays). Embryos were extracted from small seeds, obtained in immature fruits, and cultivated in vitro. The ploidy level of plantlets was determined by flow cytometry analysis. Irradiated pollen appeared to be efficient for gynogenesis induction in 'Wilking'. A relatively high number of haploids (7 plantlets) was obtained, essentially after hybridisation with pollen irradiated at 250 Grays. The ploidy level of all haploid plantlets was confirmed by chromosome count. These haploid lines should be useful for triploid breeding by somatic hybridisation and also constitute interesting resources for genomic studies.","[Jedidi, Emna] Tunisian Natl Agron Res Inst INRAT, Hort Lab, Tunis, Tunisia; [Kamiri, Mourad] Grp Kabbage, DAK, Agadir, Morocco; [Poullet, Thibaut; Froelicher, Yann] Int Ctr Agr Res Dev CIRAD, AGAP, UMR, San Giuliano, Corsica, France; [Ollitrault, Patrick] CIRAD, UMR AGAP, Montpellier, France",CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD,"Jedidi, E (通讯作者)，Tunisian Natl Agron Res Inst INRAT, Hort Lab, Tunis, Tunisia.",jedidi.emy@gmail.com,"Ollitrault, Patrick/HLQ-0557-2023","Ollitrault, Patrick/0000-0002-9456-5517",,,,,19,0,0,0,8,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,495,500,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600060,0

After performance of the audit, reports are drawn up, which are available to the public. The aim of this study is to determine the realisation of tax revenues in total revenues and receipts of local units, based on data obtained by the audit procedures. The main role of local and regional self-government units is satisfying public needs, as well as improving living and working conditions in a particular area. Through the process of decentralisation, i.e. by transferring of tasks to be provided by individual levels of government, the local interests and demands for public goods and services can be satisfied in the best possible way. It is therefore necessary to collect budgetary revenues and ensure sources of funding for performance of tasks that fall under the competence of local units. The realisation of tax revenues needs to be analysed by individual types and by counties, for a specified period. The study covers the period from 2007 to 2011, and the fiscal capacity of the counties is presented by analysing the revenues and receipts in relation to the number of inhabitants for each unit of local (regional) self-government. The presented results were analysed in order to determine the changes in shares of tax revenues in total revenues by counties, to compare the share of tax revenues in the total revenues and to show the fiscal capacity of the counties. Attention is paid to tax revenues as sources for budget financing, given that their purpose is not determined by law and they are used to cover budgetary expenditures in accordance with budgetary demands. Other revenues, the ones dedicated to specific purposes, are not included in this study. Conclusions are drawn about the realisation of tax revenues within the realisation of total budgetary revenues, with regard to meeting of demands falling within the scope of local units. The conducted external audit and data from financial statements represent the basis for research and drawing conclusions on tax revenues.","[Mahacek, Dubravka] State Audit Off, Kamenita Vrata 8, Pozega 34000, Croatia; [Krmpotic, David] City Osijek, Dept Finance & Procurement, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Liovic, Dina] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Mahacek, D (通讯作者)，State Audit Off, Kamenita Vrata 8, Pozega 34000, Croatia.",dmahacek@vup.hr; david.krmpotic@osijek.hr; dinali@efos.hr,"Bičvić, Dina/AAT-6475-2021; Bičvić, Dina/AAL-1438-2021","Bičvić, Dina/0000-0002-5296-7788; Bičvić, Dina/0000-0002-5296-7788",,,,,5,3,3,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,370,384,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100036,0

The aim of this article is to determine the potential of innovative activity realization on the base of Russian information recourses. The stages of innovative process and types of information recourses used and produced at its every stage have been determined. This use is based on their demand while their production is connected with the results obtained. Hence, innovative processes depend on quality and quantity of information recourses. Relying on determined information recourses produced at innovative process stages and considering available statistics the indicators of information recourses characteristics were singled out: Royalty payoff on Russian import of technologies, thousand $; Royalty return on Russian export of technologies, thousand $; Patents delivery and intellectual activity certification in Russia, units; Articles with SCOPUS index (in different countries including Russia), units; Hirsh index. On the one hand these indicators reflect information recourses and on the other hand innovative processes. In Rosstat there were found the original statistics. Using these basic data calculations and graphs were made and analysis of information recourses of Russia was carried out. It was concluded that: 1) Russia is net-importer of technologies. There is stable and increasing negative balance of Russia in technologies trade on the world market - Russian import of technologies is substantially greater than technologies' export. 2) Delivery of patents and certification of intellectual activity results is increased in Russia. Topology of integrated circuits has undergone the largest growth. 3) Number of articles with SCOPUS index has grown. The largest amount of such articles is in the USA. Meanwhile the amount of such articles in China has become larger several times since 2004; now this country is on the second place. Russia being on equal positions with China in 1996 had become the outsider by 2013. 4) Hirsh index remains constant from 1996.

The aim of this paper is to present the methodology which the management of transport companies can use to monitoring and taking into consideration of risks arising from the implementation of measures transportation policy, determining their probability of occurrence and economic impact on business activity. In the article, qualitative and quantitative methods for risk analysis were used. Data was obtained from research taken from selected transport companies in the Czech Republic. The research was focused on the selected measures consequences of the transportation policy affecting economic results of enterprises. The research showed that the transport companies must take into account the risks from transportation policy measures, because it can significantly affect the financial stability of the company. The mentioned procedure of risk analysis enables to improve the quality of management decisions in terms of risk identification, risk significance and approach to risk. Moreover, it can also prepare management of transport companies for changes, especially for changes arising from the strategic plans of the Government in the enterprise environment. This procedure gives information about the types of risk which are non-suggestible (therefore, it is necessary to include them in strategic planning), and the risks which are suggestible (so, it is advisable to prepare the appropriate measures to eliminate their impact).","[Oborilova, Iveta; Melichar, Vlastimil] Univ Pardubice, Jan Perner Transport Fac, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Oborilová, I (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Jan Perner Transport Fac, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",,"Melichar, Vlastimil/W-9412-2018","Melichar, Vlastimil/0000-0001-8232-1614",,,,,6,1,1,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,211,218,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400027,0

Greenhouse tomato production systems have increased considerably in recent years. Besides the environmental problems that agriculture generates, there is also the problem of emissions and solid waste. The objective of this paper is to assess the environmental impact on profitability of protected agriculture systems in the state of Zacatecas. The methodology used was total cost assessment. This study assesses the total cost of four production units in their present situation, as well as in two scenarios: one denominated sustainable and the other unsustainable. Profitability indicators in the sustainable and unsustainable scenarios show that adopting conservation production practices, besides improving the image of the organization and permitting better access to markets, will maintain profitability and contribute to the conservation of natural resources.","[Padilla-Bernal, L.

The cross gramian contains information both for the reachability of the system as well as for its observability. The main property of the cross gramian for a square symmetric stable linear system is that its square is equal to the product of the reachability and observability gramians and therefore, the absolute values of its eigenvalues are equal to the Hankel singular values. This is the reason to use the cross gramian for computing balancing transformations for model reduction. Laguerre polynomial series representations are used to approximate the cross gramian of the system at infinity. The orthogonal polynomials of Laguerre possess good convergence properties and allow to reduce the computational complexity of the model reduction problem. Numerical experiments are performed confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method.","[Perev, Kamen] Tech Univ Sofia, Syst & Control Dept, Sofia 1756, Bulgaria",Technical University Sofia,"Perev, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Sofia, Syst & Control Dept, 8 Cl Ohridski Blvd, Sofia 1756, Bulgaria.",kperev@tu-sofia.bg,,,,,,,17,2,2,0,0,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-1337-5,AIP CONF PROC,,,2015,1690.0,,,,,,,,20013.0,10.1063/1.4936691,0.0,,,9,"Economics; Mathematics, Applied; Physics, Applied",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Physics,BE0PS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366565600013,0

The soil type and climate conditions favor the culture of maize (50%), wheat and successive crops (16%), alpha-alpha (18%), sugar beet (6%), sunflower (7%), vegetables and other crops (3%). Taking into account the soil type, climate conditions and geomorphological characteristics of the studied area, the paper focuses on evaluation of Sentinel-1 sensor capabilities to monitor soil degradation and surface soil moisture. A multi-temporal series of Sentinel-1 data gathered from October 2014 until January 2015 is used. Crop growing stages are investigated with multi-temporal Landsat OLI and MODIS data. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), specific leaf area index, land thermal index, soil moisture index and soil salinity information are retrieved from Landsat data. The potential evapotranspiration is computed from MODIS data to evaluate the effects of soil salinity on growing crops.

Martyn's writings, by introducing what later was called the eighteenth-century rule, prepared the path of transition from absolute advantage to comparative advantage as the basis of trade. Smith provided a description of comparative advantage outcome by observing that a poor country can rival a rich country in agricultural goods despite having an absolute disadvantage in both manufacturing and agricultural goods. The present paper focuses particularly on Smith because he has not received the attention he deserves in the literature on comparative advantage. In this intellectual odyssey, Ricardo plays the seminal role with his famous example of England exchanging cloth for Portuguese wine.","Univ Hartford, Dept Econ, Hartford, CT 06117 USA",University of Hartford,"Rassekh, F (通讯作者)，Univ Hartford, Dept Econ, Hartford, CT 06117 USA.",rassekh@hartford.edu,,,Barney School of Business,Barney School of Business,"The author thanks two anonymous referees as well as Roy Ruffin, Andrea Maneschi, Bruce Elmslie, Jorge Morales Meoqui, and Henry Thompson for their valuable and constructive comments on an earlier draft of the paper.

The share of energy from renewable sources in transport is to achieve 10 percent at the same time. It is the mandatory minimum target for all Member States. Due to the high diversification of potentials of particular Member States, related to the renewable energy sources (water conditions, wind conditions, sun illumination, resources of biomass and biogases) and initial conditions of the states, the 20 percent share of the entire Community has been recalculated to specify the individual (national) targets. Therefore, following the list of the Member States, Poland is to achieve the 15 percent and Croatia the 20 percent share of energy from the renewable sources in the final gross energy consumption. In order to achieve these targets, Poland (in 2010) and Croatia (in 2013) approved the National Action Plans in the Field of the Renewable Energy Sources. These plans determine the concepts, time schedules and instruments of implementation of the actions assumed by the EU. The objective of the paper is to discuss the descriptive and comparative analysis of the structure of the renewable energy sources in the energy production, in relation to the targets specified by the EU for particular Member States. The detailed analysis will cover the structure of energy mixes of Poland and Croatia, including, first of all, water power, wind energy, sun energy, biomass and biogases.","[Sajnog, Natalia] Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Geodesy & Cartog, Dept Cadastre & Land Management, Pl Politech 1, PL-00661 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Technology,"Sajnog, N (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Geodesy & Cartog, Dept Cadastre & Land Management, Pl Politech 1, PL-00661 Warsaw, Poland.",n.sajnog@gik.pw.edu.pl,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,758,767,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100075,0

Joi Ito, the director of the MIT Media Lab, created the slogan 'Deploy or die' precisely to encourage the researchers of the lab to take these conditions into consideration and to push their projects up to the production stage (and thus beyond the creation of a demo). This paper examines how design is used at the Media Lab to support this 'deploy or die' approach and, consequently, to foster entrepreneurial processes fuelled by the research activities of the lab. The paper contends that design activities - such as user research and user testing, rapid and frequent prototyping, visualization techniques, co-design, attention to the brand experience contribute in igniting and sustaining the 'deploy or die' approach. Design/methodology/approach - The study is the result of an investigation - also based on ethnographic methods - conducted by the author in the city of Cambridge, MA across 2011 and 2014. The application of an ethnographic approach with the direct involvement of researchers in the field has proven to be a common element of a good number of recent studies on organizations (Czarniawska 2012). Originality/value - The study contributes to the ongoing discussions on how design can support entrepreneurship, with particular reference to the area of academic entrepreneurship. Practical implications - The paper contends that design activities contribute in igniting and sustaining the 'deploy or die' approach and, consequently, could be adopted by research organizations to support operations in the area of academic entrepreneurship.","[Simeone, Luca] Malmo Univ, S-20506 Malmo, Sweden; [Simeone, Luca] Univ Arts London, Innovat Insights Hub, London, England",Malmo University; University of Arts London,"Simeone, L (通讯作者)，Malmo Univ, O Varvsg 11 A, S-20506 Malmo, Sweden.",,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,2,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1552,1566,,,,,,15,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200120,0

Introduction of agrotourism on farms extends primary agricultural activity to meals and accommodation services and also to a variety of other contents such as participation in agricultural activities, direct contact with farm animals, involvement in the life of the host, etc, so thus farmers can ensure a better placement of their own products and consequently increase their income.

Since was first developed in '78, the method is used in various sectors of economy and at different levels (companies, counties, regions, etc.). Our purpose is to apply DEA at regional level by using various inputs and outputs to analyse the performance of agriculture practiced in plain, hill and mountain areas. Thirty-six counties were classified into three categories based on their geographical main characteristics, respectively: group I - with 50-100% plain areas (20 counties); group II - with 50-80% hill areas (8 counties); group III - with 50-80% mountain areas (8 counties). For these groups were computed, under input-oriented option, CRS and VRS technical scores from which we calculated scale efficiencies. This empirical research shows that exists clear differences of performance between areas with similar geographical characteristics in terms of production factors (work, land and mechanization) allocation and outputs. Our results show that there are only 14 counties (5 in plain areas, 5 in hill areas and 4 in mountain areas) completely achieving DEA efficiency and operate at their optimal scale. In conclusion, in majority of areas the overall efficiency of agriculture is not reached, these regions needing to decrease the input levels (especially work hours that are too high compared with productivity) or to increase the output levels (production value) through a better use of fix capital and higher yields.

The Index of Economic Freedom is an indicator which defines and tries to measure the economic freedom of a country or a region. Economic freedom is a necessary condition for democratic development, prosperity and other positive outcomes. There are several indices of economic freedom which are published yearly from different organizations. The most famous are the Index of Economic Freedom created by the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal and Economic Freedom of the World published by the Canadian Fraser Institute. The indices consist of a number of components which are grouped in four or five broad categories. The aim of this thesis is to analyse the Economic Freedom of the World index. For this purpose two multivariate statistical methods will be used, namely factor analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis with the help of correlation analysis. The produced results will be compared with the existing indices.","[Vrabec, Michal; Marek, Lubos] Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Vrabec, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",vrabec@vse.cz; marek@vse.cz,"Marek, Lubos/HRC-4615-2023","Marek, Lubos/0000-0003-4761-1936",,,,,6,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1736,1743,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000166,0

The empirical challenge in these tests is to disentangle the state dependence from unobserved heterogeneity. We propose a simple approach based on the explicit reliance on the cost of future accidents function which is used to filter out the pure incentives effect, whereas the bonus-malus scale is used to control for pure heterogeneity. Our results confirm the existence of negative dependence in claims indicating the presence of significant moral hazard effect. Increasing a 3-year cost of having an accident by approximately US$20 decreases the probability of having an accident by 6.5%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This dilemma was itself coloured by the existence of policy traditions that oriented Britain away from Europe and towards political communities tied to a historical interpretation of British nationality. Euroscepticism is symptomatic of these traditions and dilemmas while at the same time sustaining them. But Eurosceptics face a dilemma of their own. What serious alternative do they propose? The notion of the Anglosphere' was adopted on the Eurosceptic right of British politics as an alternative to European integration. As a politics of disengagement by the Cameron government played out in Europe, a policy of re-engagement began with Britain's former Dominions. Here was a response to a political dilemma that not only used historical consciousness and political tradition as its point of departure, but as its place of destination too.

The analysis was based on three financial variables namely the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Return Index, Government Bond Return Index and the Rand/Dollar Exchange Rate in South Africa. The forecasts were based on the out-of-sample period from January 2006 to December 2011. Compared to benchmark autoregressive (AR) models, both the DFM and ANN offer more accurate forecasts with reduced root-mean-square error (RMSE) of around 2-12 % for all variables and over all forecasting horizons. The ANN as a nonlinear combining method outperforms all linear combining methods for all variables and over all forecasting horizons. The results suggest that the ANN combining method can be used as an alternative to linear combining methods to achieve greater forecasting accuracy. The ANN combining method produces out-of-sample forecasts that are substantially more accurate with a sizeable reduction in RMSE of both the AR benchmark model and the best individual forecasting model. We attribute the superiority of the ANN combining method to its ability to capture any existing nonlinear relationship between the individual forecasts and the actual forecasting values.","[Babikir, Ali; Mwambi, Henry] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Math Stat & Comp Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Babikir, A (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Math Stat & Comp Sci, Private Bag X01, ZA-3209 Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.",ali.basher@gmail.com,,,,,,,42,5,6,0,19,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The decision is based on potential cost and transit time savings that change on a monthly basis according to sailing conditions and the area along the NSR. This study is applied to a 1A Ice-Class Panamax tanker vessel sailing through the NSR compared to a Panamax tanker vessel sailing through the SCR. It concludes that the NSR provides a competitive advantage in the months from August to November when conservative assumptions on ice conditions (higher bound) are considered for the level of ice thickness encountered along the route and from July to November when a lower bound is assumed.

Combined Revealed Preference (RP) and Stated Preference (SP) data were used to understand traveler choice behavior regarding the usage of managed lanes (MLs). The data were obtained from the South Florida Expressway Stated Preference Survey, which focused on automobile drivers who had traveled on the I-75,I-95, or SR 826 corridors in South Florida. Mixed logit modeling was applied and indicated an average value of $13.55 per hour for VOT and $16.13 per hour for VOR. Potential sources of heterogeneity in user sensitivities to time, reliability, and cost were identified and quantified by adding interaction effects of the variables in the mixed logit model. The findings indicated that various socioeconomic demographic characteristics and trip attributes contributed to the variations in VOT and VOR at different magnitudes. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding on what attributes lead to higher or lower VOT and VOR and to what extent. These findings can be incorporated into the demand forecasting process and lead to better estimates and enhanced analytical capabilities in various applications, such as toll feasibility studies, pricing strategy and policy evaluations, and impact analysis.

J,"Loayza, NV",,,,"Loayza, Norman V.",,,Informality in the Process of Development and Growth,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; SECTOR; MIGRATION; UNEMPLOYMENT; POLICIES; MODEL,"Informality' is a term used to describe the collection of firms, workers and activities that operate outside the legal and regulatory systems. It is widespread in the majority of developing countries - in a typical developing economy, the informal sector produces about 35 per cent of GDP and employs 70 per cent of the labour force. This paper studies informality in the context of economic development by presenting a model and projections that link informality, regulations, migration and economic growth. This analytical framework highlights the trade-offs between formality and informality, the relationship between the different types of informality, and the connection between them and the forces of labour, capital and productivity growth. The paper models the behaviour of the informal sector based on the following fundamental asymmetry: formal firms confront higher labour costs, while informal firms face higher capital costs and lower productivity. Using mandated minimum wages as the policy-induced distortion, the model first studies the static allocation of formal and informal capital and labour in a modern economy. Second, it opens the possibility of labour migration from a rudimentary economy with ample supply of labour (e.g. rural areas or less advanced neighbouring countries). Third, the model analyses the dynamic behaviour of the formal and informal sectors, considering how they affect and are affected by economic growth and labour migration. Then, the paper presents projections for the size of labour informality, in the modern and rudimentary economies, in the next two decades for a large group of countries representing all regions of the world. The projections are based on the calibration and simulation of the model and serve to discuss its usefulness and limitations.","[Loayza, Norman V.] World Bank, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",,"Loayza, NV (通讯作者)，World Bank, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",nloayza@worldbank.org,,,"World Bank's Research Support Budget (RSB), under the project 'Informality, Migration, and Growth'","World Bank's Research Support Budget (RSB), under the project 'Informality, Migration, and Growth'","This paper was first delivered as The World Economy Annual Asia Lecture, University of Nottingham, Kuala Lumpur, 18th of February 2016.

At the same time, Millennials the largest generation in U.S. history have faced problems of high rents relative to incomes, and volatility in housing markets. These shifts are reigniting debates about how changes in age structure will affect housing and labor markets. To address some of these concerns, we revisit Green and Hendershott (1996) and analyze the links between the willingness to pay for a constant-quality house and demographics using microdata from the 1990 and 2000 Censuses and from the 2006, 2010, and 2014 American Community Surveys. The results generally reconfirm what Green and Hendershott (1996) found; The massive demographic shift will not result in another housing crisis on its own. This is because the education and income levels of current and future seniors are still relatively high, leading them to consume more than previous generations. Also, the size of the Millennial generation will drive the growth of aggregate housing demand, although the growth of per household housing demand may be relatively modest.","[Green, Richard K.; Lee, Hyojung] Univ Southern Calif, Lusk Ctr Real Estate, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, 331B Ralph & Goldy Lewis Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Green, RK (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Lusk Ctr Real Estate, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, 331B Ralph & Goldy Lewis Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",richarkg@usc.edu,,,,,,,39,24,31,4,65,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Dating such episodes of exuberance in housing markets provides a timeline as well as empirical content to the narrative connecting housing exuberance to the global 2008 -09 recession. For our empirical analysis, we employ two recursive univariate unit root tests recently developed by Phillips and Yu (International Economic Review 52(1):201-226, 2011) and Phillips et al. (2015). We also propose a novel extension of the test developed by Phillips et al. (2015) to a panel setting in order to exploit the large cross-sectional dimension of our international dataset. Statistically significant periods of exuberance are found in most countries. Moreover, we find strong evidence of the emergence of an unprecedented period of exuberance in the early 2000s that eventually collapsed around 2006 -07, preceding the 2008 -09 global recession. We examine whether macro and financial variables help to predict (in-sample) episodes of exuberance in housing markets. Long-term interest rates, credit growth and global economic conditions are found to be among the best predictors. We conclude that global factors (partly) explain the synchronization of exuberance episodes that we detect in the data in the 2000s.","[Pavlidis, Efthymios; Yusupova, Alisa; Paya, Ivan; Peel, David] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England; [Martinez-Garcia, Enrique; Grossman, Valerie] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, 2200 N Pearl St, Dallas, TX 75201 USA; [Mack, Adrienne] Mutual Omaha, Omaha, NE USA",Lancaster University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas,"Martínez-García, E (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, 2200 N Pearl St, Dallas, TX 75201 USA.",e.pavlidis@lancaster.ac.uk; a.yusupova@lancaster.ac.uk; i.paya@lancaster.ac.uk; d.peel@lancaster.ac.uk; enrique.martinez-garcia@dal.frb.org; adrienne.mack@ymail.com; valerie.grossman@dal.frb.org,"Martinez-Garcia, Enrique/AAH-7320-2019; Paya, Ivan/K-4059-2012","Martinez-Garcia, Enrique/0000-0001-5736-361X; Paya, Ivan/0000-0002-2857-057X; Peel, David/0000-0001-5281-2041; Yusupova, Alisa Yevgenyevna/0000-0002-2694-6342; Pavlidis, Efthymios/0000-0002-4892-1955",Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas,Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas,We would like to thank Maria Teresa Martinez Garcia and Itamar Caspi for providing helpful assistance and suggestions.

The empirical exercise shows that the specific territorial patterns in the data cannot be merely explained using a standard set of contextual factors. This intangible component can be interpreted as the role of the local business climate: in most localities, the presence of an embedded community stimulates a process of local learning that generates the diffusion of tacit knowledge through continuous interaction among the local actors.

Flood risk disclosure through maps is a policy instrument aimed at addressing this situation. We assess its effectiveness by identifying whether such maps induce a price differential for single family coastal dwellings in three Finnish cities, and by estimating the discount per square meter for various flooding probabilities (return times). The estimations indicate a significant price drop after the information disclosure for properties located in flood-prone areas as indicated by the maps. In the case of sea flooding information in Helsinki, the price effect is sensitive to the communicated probability of flooding. Overall, the discussed policy instrument appears to have functioned as intended, correcting information gaps and asymmetries related to flood risk. The identified effect is spatially selective; it caused a short-term localized shock in market prices in conjunction with some reorientation of demand from risky coastal properties towards ones that represent a similar level of coastal amenity, but are less risky in terms of flooding. This hints at the potential for incorporating the shocks associated with flood events or risk information into broader-scoped urban modelling and simulation. Similarly, the reasonable accuracy with which the housing market processes the additional information shows a potential for wider use of the disclosure of non-obvious risks in real estate markets. In the case of adapting to climate change risks, additional uncertainties may make the disclosure instrument less effective, if used as a single tool.","[Votsis, Athanasios; Perrels, Adriaan] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Socioecon Impact Res, Erik Palmenin Aukio 1,POB 503, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Votsis, Athanasios] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, Helsinki, Finland",Finnish Meteorological Institute; University of Helsinki,"Votsis, A (通讯作者)，Finnish Meteorol Inst, Socioecon Impact Res, Erik Palmenin Aukio 1,POB 503, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland.;Votsis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, Helsinki, Finland.",athanasios.votsis@fmi.fi,"Votsis, Athanasios/AAB-1817-2021","Perrels, Adriaan/0000-0003-4655-1310; Votsis, Athanasios/0000-0001-5878-7684",Academy of Finland as part of the RECAST project [140797]; Helsinki University Centre for Environment (HENVI) as part of the ENSURE project; Academy of Finland (AKA) [140797] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland as part of the RECAST project(Research Council of Finland); Helsinki University Centre for Environment (HENVI) as part of the ENSURE project; Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),This study was funded by the Academy of Finland as part of the RECAST project (decision number 140797) and by Helsinki University Centre for Environment (HENVI) as part of the ENSURE project.,,50,32,35,3,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We argue that dwellings, in particularly rental properties, are not only consumer goods, but also constitute financial market assets. Properties are spatially fixed and traded in regional contexts, where real estate market characteristics like vacancy, income levels, and expectations determine rent and prices, which in turn provide incentives to invest in housing quality. The level of housing quality (e.g. windows, building materials, or heating technology) in turn influences the level of energy consumption. While this view is established in the real estate and urban economics literature, it has only recently found its way into the energy debate. As a result, the relationship between regional housing market fundamentals and energy consumption has received little attention. This study provides a first attempt to address this paucity. Utilizing aggregate data on regional space-heating energy consumption from over 300,000 apartment buildings in 97 German planning regions, the study applies structural equation modeling to estimate the influence of housing market fundamentals on the level housing quality, and subsequently on regional energy consumption. Findings provide first evidence that regional differences in housing market conditions have a significant impact on housing quality and energy consumption. Specifically, the results suggest that carbon abatement programs in buildings should focus on regions with weak housing market fundamentals, as market incentives are unlikely to incentivize investors to invest in housing quality attributes. The authors conclude by highlighting important implications for energy research and avenues for further investigations.","[Claudy, Marius] Univ Coll Dublin, Coll Business, Carysfort Ave, Blackrock, Co Dublin, Ireland; [Michelsen, Claus] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",University College Dublin; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Michelsen, C (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",cmichelsen@diw.de,"Claudy, Marius/ADC-7535-2022","Claudy, Marius/0000-0001-7214-1687",,,,,72,4,5,0,39,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,OCT,2016,37.0,4,,,,,25,43,,10.5547/01956574.37.4.mcla,0.0,,,19,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DZ5OZ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385912700002,0

Using China`s tourism data for 48 major tourist cities from 2000 to 2012, the article reexamines the direct and indirect effects of tourism booms on urban economic growth within the framework of the resource curse. At the city level, there is some evidence for the presence of Dutch Disease symptoms as a consequence of high dependency on tourism industry. However, physical investment tends to be an important transmission channel via which tourism exerts a positive indirect effect on economic growth. The evidence becomes stronger for cities, which are more dependent on the tourism industry.","[Deng, Taotao] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Ma, Mulan] Shanghai Univ Int Business & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of International Business & Economics,"Deng, TT (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",deng.taotao@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,"Deng, Taotao/0000-0002-7380-6000",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41401145],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The financial support for this work was provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 41401145).",,8,8,8,5,60,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Among various risk-coping strategies, we specifically analyze input smoothing (labor, raw materials, or capital). If it is costly to adjust inputs, firms will prefer to smooth the path of adjusting their inputs in response to fluctuating demand, especially when demand shocks are expected to be temporary. However, their capacity for such smoothing may be more limited for credit-constrained firms, creating a potential welfare loss due to incomplete smoothing. Using panel data of Cambodian firms at the time of the 2008 global economic crisis, we show that (1) firms try to smooth inputs especially when they believe the shock to be temporary, (2) non-credit-constrained firms are better able to smooth inputs than credit-constrained firms, and (3) the welfare loss from incomplete smoothing due to credit constraints is an order of magnitude larger than the adjustment costs of the firms that were not credit constrained. The article concludes with a discussion of the policy implications of the findings.","[Guimbert, Stephane] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Oostendorp, Remco] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam Inst Int Dev, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Oostendorp, Remco] Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",The World Bank; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; University of Oxford,"Oostendorp, R (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam Inst Int Dev, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Oostendorp, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",r.oostendorp@vu.nl,,"Oostendorp, Remco/0000-0002-2034-4842",,,,,30,0,0,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0013-0079,1539-2988,,ECON DEV CULT CHANGE,Econ.

We conclude that while the semi-parametric estimators can have excellent properties in terms of estimating the long memory parameter, they do not have good properties when applied to the two step estimator of short memory I(0) parameters.

This paper focuses on the impact of the ownership structure on the efficiency and sensitivities of the producers towards the quality and the environment of the olive oil sector. The efficiency of the olive oil sector was estimated by Data Envelopment Analysis. The Meta Frontier methodology was carried out in order to consider the ownership structures: cooperatives and private firms. The quality and the environmental compliance of firms were found to be of medium level. The firms analyzed showed a medium tohigh technical efficiency level. Results of bootstrapped truncated regression indicates that ownership structure (private firms), experienced production manager and extensive specialized training within the industry have together a positive effect. However the number of partners, the number of permanent unskilled labour and environmental indice cause negative effects. In this paper, it is concluded that olive oil firms should solve their environmental and quality problems and reduce their fixed capital.","[Ozden, Altug] Adnan Menderes Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Aydin, Turkey; [Dios-Palomares, Rafaela] Univ Cordoba, Dept Stat Cordoba, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain",Adnan Menderes University; Universidad de Cordoba,"Ozden, A (通讯作者)，Adnan Menderes Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Aydin, Turkey.",aozden@adu.edu.tr,"Dios-Palomares, Rafaela/AAF-3357-2020",,TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) [BIDEB-2219],TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"This research has benefited from the support of the TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey), BIDEB-2219 (Foreign Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program).",,38,4,5,1,22,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2016,15.0,3,,,,,2,9,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EF2VS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390184300001,0

Farmers were asked to choose whether to participate or not in a collective investment regulated by contract schemes. Monetary trade-offs were then computed among contract attributes. A specific questionnaire was submitted to a sample of farmers selected on the basis of their potential capability of investments. A stated preference modelling approach was implemented so that farmers could make a choice between alternative contracts reporting varying attribute levels. If energy-producing companies are paying attention to biofuel production aiming at a diversification of their activities, results show that farmers' participation needs to be managed through contracts that take care of investment length, warranty on investment return, and risk management.","[Caracciolo, Francesco; Cembalo, Luigi; Cicia, Gianni] Univ Naples Federico II, Agr Econ & Policy Grp, Dept Agr Sci, Naples, Italy; [Schifani, Giorgio; Migliore, Giuseppina; Romeo, Pietro] Univ Palermo, Agr Econ & Policy Grp, Dept Agr & Forest Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Palermo,"Migliore, G (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Agr Econ & Policy Grp, Dept Agr & Forest Sci, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",giuseppina.migliore@unipa.it,"Schifani, Giorgio/AIF-4239-2022; Cicia, Gianni/B-1822-2012; Caracciolo, Francesco/D-6147-2013; Migliore, Giuseppina/H-6334-2019","Schifani, Giorgio/0000-0003-1055-929X; Caracciolo, Francesco/0000-0001-9430-7529; Migliore, Giuseppina/0000-0002-1889-0625; Cembalo, Luigi/0000-0002-3808-5797; Cicia, Gianni/0000-0003-4188-241X","MIPAAF (Italian Ministry of Agrifood and Forestry Policies), Department of European and International Policies of Rural Development","MIPAAF (Italian Ministry of Agrifood and Forestry Policies), Department of European and International Policies of Rural Development","This research received grant from the MIPAAF (Italian Ministry of Agrifood and Forestry Policies), Department of European and International Policies of Rural Development: Biocarburanti da fonti completamente rinnovabili non in competizione con colture alimentari in ambiente mediterraneo: Valutazione dell'impatto agricolo, ambientale, energetic: ed economico (BIOFORME).",,23,3,3,0,3,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2016,15.0,3,,,,,56,63,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EF2VS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390184300008,0

Although there are methods to evaluate each objective respectively, there are few reports or research papers showing how to incorporate these objectives and put it in practice. Thus, this study aims to develop a procedure to incorporate traffic efficiency into the traffic safety countermeasure (CM) selection process. To illustrate the procedure, the economic benefits of four pedestrian safety improvements at crosswalks of major-streets at two-way stop controlled intersections (TWSC) were calculated, considering not only the safety benefits but also the efficiency impacts. First, for each countermeasure the efficiency impacts were calculated as the average delay reduction for both pedestrians and motorists. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine how the crucial parameters, including vehicular volume, pedestrian volume, and motorist yield rate, offset the average vehicle and pedestrian delay. Next, the safety impacts were calculated as the crash reduction benefits for different CMs using safety performance functions (SPFs) and crash modification factors (CMFs). Finally, the equivalent uniform annual return (EUAR) method was used to combine the countervailing effects of efficiency and safety by evaluating the economic effectiveness of different CMs. The Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method was used to conduct uncertainty analysis by using random sampling from probability descriptions of uncertain input variables to generate a probabilistic description of results. The findings showed that, first, CMs can have tradeoff impacts for pedestrians and motorists. Second, the efficiency impacts accounted for a large proportion of the total impacts, which can significantly affect the selection of CMs. Third, the rankings of the CMs differ depending on whether the safety impacts alone are considered, or whether both safety and efficiency impacts are integrated. The study illustrates the detailed process of evaluating projects considering multiple objectives for multiple road users. This process offers policy and decision makers a solid and practical reference using existing guidebooks. The findings also explain how safety and efficiency objectives can countervail with each other in improving pedestrian safety at TWSC. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We aim to fill this gap by providing individual time series of short-run elasticity estimates based on maximum entropy resampling in a fixed-width rolling window framework. This approach does not only enable taking the variability of the elasticities into account, but also helps obtain more efficient and robust results in small samples in comparison with conventional inferences based on asymptotic distribution theory. To illustrate the methodology, we employ monthly time-series data between 2004 and 2012 and analyze the dynamics of residential natural gas demand in Istanbul, the largest metropolitan area in Turkey. Our findings reveal that the elasticities of the demand model do not remain constant and they are sensitive to the economic situation as well as weather fluctuations.","[Altinay, Galip] Bandirma Onyedi Eylul Univ, Dept Econometr, Bandirma Balikesir, Turkey; [Yalta, A.

The relationship between recruit quality and team performance may be overstated, however, if the effect is driven by heterogeneity between teams. In this article, we analyze the effect of recruit quality on team performance controlling for school fixed effects. We collected data from recruiting services to obtain the number of individual recruits by ex ante star rating for every Football Bowl Division (FBS) school for the years 2002-2012. We also record team performance in the regular season and postseason during the same time period. We find that controlling for between-school heterogeneity lowers the estimated effect of recruit quality on wins by more than 25%, but the remaining effect is still statistically and economically significant. Furthermore, we find that within-school variation in recruit quality is an important determinant of the probability of an appearance in the most lucrative bowl games. Our within-school estimates imply that a 5-star recruit is worth more than US$150,000 in expected Bowl Championship Series bowl proceeds to an individual school.","[Bergman, Stephen A.; Logan, Trevon D.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, 410 Arps Hall,1945 N High St, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Logan, Trevon D.] Natl Bur Econ Res, 1050 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Bergman, SA (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, 410 Arps Hall,1945 N High St, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",,,,,,,,13,14,24,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

The proposed duration model employs a flexible link function and incorporates the grouped-duration analogue of the well-known Cox proportional hazards model and the proportional odds model as special cases. The theoretical setup of the model is motivated, and simulation results are reported, suggesting that the model proposed performs well. The simulation results and an empirical analysis of US import durations also show that the choice of link function in discrete hazard models has important implications for the estimation results, and that severe biases in the results can be avoided when using a flexible link function.","[Hess, Wolfgang] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Hess, Wolfgang] Lund Univ, Ctr Econ Demog, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Tutz, Gerhard] Univ Munich, Dept Stat, Akad Str 1, D-80799 Munich, Germany; [Gertheiss, Jan] Univ Gottingen, Dept Anim Sci, Gottingen, Germany; [Gertheiss, Jan] Univ Gottingen, Ctr Stat, Carl Sprengel Weg 1, D-37075 Gottingen, Germany",Lund University; Lund University; University of Munich; University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,"Hess, W (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.;Hess, W (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Ctr Econ Demog, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",at.wolfgang.hess@gmail.com; gerhard.tutz@stat.uni-muenchen.de; jgerthe@uni-goettingen.de,"Tutz, Gerhard/AAI-5954-2020; Tutz, Gerhard/L-6315-2019","Tutz, Gerhard/0000-0002-6628-3539",Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation [W2010-0305:1],Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,"This paper draws in parts on Working Paper 2009:18, Department of Economics, Lund University.

Agents are assumed to use either a fully fundamental-value reversion or a trend following strategy to form their expectation of future asset returns. Furthermore, the probability of changing strategies and the parameters for the strategy are chosen based on a fitness measure. In this way, the agents' strategy choices are better related to the evolution of the market. We also add a layer of intraday activity. This model can obtain the results of the original model, such as the impacts of the traders' strategy and the stylized facts. Furthermore, we exhibit many empirically observed features in both the intraday and the daily horizon. The results provide evidence that the agents' expectations and trading volume can generate large daily price changes and that intraday price fluctuations can be caused by large trading size or liquidity fluctuations in different conditions.","[Ji, Mingjie; Li, Honggang] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Li, HG (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",hli@bnu.edu.cn,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2012LZD01]; National Science Foundation of China [70871013],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We wish to thank Xuezhong He and Youwei Li for useful comments and discussions, and anonymous referees for helpful comments.

Vehicles individually request permission to follow precise paths through the intersection at specific times from an intersection manager agent. Previous studies have shown that reservations can reduce delays beyond optimized signals in many demand scenarios. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that signals can outperform reservations through theoretical and realistic examples. We present two examples that exploit the reservation protocol to prioritize vehicles on local roads over vehicles on arterials, increasing the total vehicle delay. A third theoretical example demonstrates that reservations can encourage selfish route choice leading to arbitrarily large queues. Next, we present two realistic networks taken from metropolitan planning organization data in which reservations perform worse than signals. We conclude with significantly positive results from comparing reservations and signals on the downtown Austin grid network using dynamic traffic assignment. Overall, these results indicate that network-based analyses are needed to detect adverse route choices before traffic signals can be replaced with reservation controls. In asymmetric intersections (e.g. local road-arterial intersections), reservation controls can cause several potential issues. However, in networks with more symmetric intersections such as a downtown grid, reservations have great potential to improve traffic. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We conduct an empirical study of data from the Colombian market, which in 2009 transitioned from a self-commitment paradigm to a centralized unit commitment approach where generators offer a linear supply function for energy along with start-up costs while the commitment and dispatch are determined by the system operator using MIP-based optimization. The results indicate that the transition to centralized dispatch has resulted in productive efficiency gains through a decrease in production costs. However, these gains have not translated into wholesale price decreases; in fact, wholesale prices increased after the change in the dispatch approach.

The performance of immigrants in the host labour markets strongly differ by country of origin in terms of unemployment risk and access to highly qualified jobs. This article focuses on these differences and highlights whether and to what extent they are linked to diversities in country of origin religion and race. The analysis concerns Italy, a country where the population was highly homogeneous in terms of religion and racial' characteristics until 25 years ago. The estimates show that religion plays a role in explaining differences in terms of unemployment rate only for women, while the white/non-white divide matters for both sexes. Neither race nor religion have a significant impact in terms of occupational attainment of migrants in the Italian labour market.","[Fullin, Giovanna] Univ Milano Bicocca, Econ Sociol, Dept Sociol & Social Res, Milan, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Fullin, G (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Sociol & Social Res, Via Bicocca degli Arcimboldi 8, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",giovanna.fullin@unimib.it,,"FULLIN, GIOVANNA/0000-0003-1102-1504",,,,,55,8,9,1,35,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Since shadow economic activity is not directly observable, we use several indicator variables that are positively related to shadow economic activity. We find that, indeed, some of these variables have had a significant influence on M1 money and currency demand in OECD countries over the last decades. Our results indicate that the omission of unofficial activities leads to a considerable overestimation of the income elasticity and the interest semi-elasticity of M1 and currency demand. Measuring accurately the size of shadow economic activity is therefore an important task for central banks to determine the optimal stock of money.","[Herwartz, Helmut] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Sarda, Jordi; Theilen, Bernd] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, E-43007 Tarragona, Spain; [Sarda, Jordi; Theilen, Bernd] Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, E-43007 Tarragona, Spain",University of Gottingen; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Theilen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, E-43007 Tarragona, Spain.;Theilen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, E-43007 Tarragona, Spain.",hherwartz@uni-goettingen.de; jordi.sarda@urv.cat; bernd.theilen@urv.cat,"Theilen, Bernd/Z-1589-2019","Theilen, Bernd/0000-0001-7141-2780",Spanish 'Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion' [ECO2013-42884-P],Spanish 'Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion'(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government),We are grateful to the constructive comments obtained from three anonymous referees.

Here we ask the inverse question and aim to design voting rules for a committee such that a given desired power distribution is met as closely as possible. We generalize the approach of Alon and Edelman who studied power distributions for the Banzhaf index, where most of the power is concentrated on few coordinates. It turned out that each Banzhaf vector of an n-member committee that is near to such a desired power distribution, also has to be near to the Banzhaf vector of a k-member committee. We show that such Alon-Edelman type results exist for other power indices like e.g. the Public Good index or the Coleman index to prevent actions, while such results are principally impossible to derive for e.g. the Johnston index.","[Kurz, Sascha] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Math Phys & Comp Sci, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth,"Kurz, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Dept Math Phys & Comp Sci, POB 101251, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",sascha.kurz@uni-bayreuth.de,,,,,,,58,5,5,1,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2016,47.0,1,,,,,65,88,,10.1007/s00355-015-0946-8,0.0,,,24,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DO4AC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000377722900004,0

We apply a gravity framework that takes into account the potential endogeneity of preferences in the estimation, as factors like the historical relationships can be behind both trade preferences and trade flows. Overall, our results show that preferences determine positively the trade flows from Morocco to the EU, being the preferential entry price more effective than the ad valorem reduction in tariffs. Interestingly, our results find sectoral differences, as the reduced entry price is still export-restrictive for vegetables. Finally, we find that the fostering effect of trade preferences differs by EU destination country. Hence, our results have policy implications both in future revisions of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreements and in the deepening of the trade liberalization policy undertaken by Morocco.","[Marquez-Ramos, Laura] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Marquez-Ramos, Laura] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Int Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Martinez-Gomez, Victor] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Econ & Social Sci, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Martinez-Gomez, Victor] Univ Politecn Valencia, Grp Int Econ & Dev, E-46022 Valencia, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Martinez-Gomez, V (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Econ & Social Sci, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",vicmargo@esp.upv.es,"Martinez-Gomez, Victor/L-7626-2014; Márquez-Ramos, Laura/ABB-6904-2021","Martinez-Gomez, Victor/0000-0001-7144-9663; Márquez-Ramos, Laura/0000-0002-2193-9645","Generalitat Valenciana [GV/2015/073, P1-1B2013-06, PROMETEOII/ 2014/053]; Universitat Jaume I",Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)); Universitat Jaume I,"The authors wish to thank the participants in the Seminar Building sustainable agriculture for food security in the Euro-Mediterranean area: Challenges and Policy Options, in the XIV Congress of the European Association of Agricultural Economists, and in the X Congress of the Asociacion Espanola de Economia Agraria for their valuable comments on previous versions of this paper.

Using a novel elicitation method, we assess individuals' beliefs about the shape of the income distribution in the United States. We find that respondents' beliefs approximate the actual distribution on average. However they tend to overestimate the median income and underestimate the level of inequality. Surprisingly we find that beliefs about overall inequality, measured in terms of income dispersion, play only a marginal role in political positions as well as prospects of future wealth. Political preferences, however, are predicted by first, beliefs about the level of income of the poorest members of society, and second, a belief in an open society with equal opportunities for all. Support for redistribution is lower for people who give higher estimates of the income level of the poorest members of society and for people who perceive that opportunities for upward mobility are available.","[Page, Lionel] Queensland Univ Technol, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Goldstein, Daniel G.] Microsoft Res, 641 Ave Amer, New York, NY 10011 USA",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Microsoft,"Page, L (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.",lionel.page@qut.edu.au; dgg@microsoft.com,"Goldstein, Daniel G/A-7479-2008","Goldstein, Daniel G/0000-0002-0970-5598; Page, Lionel/0000-0002-6020-9733",,,,,54,26,29,0,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JUN,2016,47.0,1,,,,,25,61,,10.1007/s00355-015-0945-9,0.0,,,37,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DO4AC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000377722900002,0

For simplicity, these models assume talent supply is either perfectly inelastic or perfectly elastic. It has been argued that perfectly inelastic supply is ill suited for duopsony analysis.

The paper takes into account the co-movement between crude oil and natural gas prices and proposes two price models: one incorporates a long-run link between the two while the other has no such link. Incorporating a long-run relationship between oil and natural gas prices has a significant effect on the value of the project and its optimal operation and reduces the sensitivity of the project to the natural gas price process.,"[Almansour, Abdullah] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dept Finance & Econ, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia; [Insley, Margaret] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals; University of Waterloo,"Almansour, A (通讯作者)，King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Dept Finance & Econ, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia.",amansour@kfupm.edu.sa; min-sley@uwaterloo.ca,"Insley, Margaret C/E-6248-2011",,,,,,39,6,7,0,26,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,APR,2016,37.0,2,,,,,61,88,,10.5547/01956574.37.2.aalm,0.0,,,28,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DH3EO,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372670500003,0

Using European panel data (EU-SILC) from 2003 to 2009 and multi-level models, this study analyses the effect of family policies on fathers' working hours. The results indicate that fathers work less than childless men if they live in countries that offer well paid, non-transferable parental leave for fathers, short parental leave for mothers and generous family allowances. The effects, however, are strongly contingent on fathers' educational levels. Whereas short maternal leaves are associated with shorter working hours among highly educated fathers, generous family allowances and father friendly parental leave schemes reduce the working hours of less educated fathers.","[Buenning, Mareike; Pollmann-Schult, Matthias] WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Reichpietschufer 50, D-10785 Berlin, Germany",,"Bünning, M (通讯作者)，WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Reichpietschufer 50, D-10785 Berlin, Germany.",mareike.buenning@wzb.eu,,"Bunning, Mareike/0000-0001-9419-5723",German Research Foundation (DFG) [PO 1569/2-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) grant number PO 1569/2-1.,,51,45,50,1,46,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

However, it is often observed that experimental subjects fail to report consistent preferences. So far, these inconsistencies are almost always examined singly. We thus wonder whether the more inconsistent individuals in one task are also more inconsistent in other tasks. We propose an experiment in which subjects are asked to report their preferences over risky bets so as to obtain, for each subject, three measures of inconsistencies: classical preference reversals, framing effects and preference instability. In line with previous experimental findings, subjects are largely inconsistent according to each of these three measures and there are considerable individual differences. The main result is that we find no correlation among these three measures of inconsistency.","[Hollard, Guillaume] Ecole Polytech, CNRS, Dept Econ, F-91128 Palaiseau, France; [Maafi, Hela] Univ Paris 08, LED, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93200 St Denis, France; [Vergnaud, Jean-Christophe] CNRS, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Universite Paris-VIII; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Maafi, H (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 08, LED, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93200 St Denis, France.",guillaume.hollard@polytechnique.edu; hmaafi@univ-paris8.fr; vergnaud@univ-paris1.fr,,"Vergnaud, Jean-Christophe/0000-0001-6604-4186",,,,,19,6,7,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,APR,2016,80.0,4,,,,,623,648,,10.1007/s11238-015-9518-8,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DI1CE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373232800006,0

HEF operators have helped expand access, incentivise health staff, and lobby on behalf of poor patients. However, despite their successes, they have been unable convincingly to address some of the deeper-seated problems of the Cambodian health system, such as under-resourced facilities, underpaid, poorly qualified staff and a burgeoning private sector. This paper explains this state of affairs as a product of Cambodia's political settlement', in which relatively successful multi-stakeholder initiatives exist as islands of effectiveness' in a sea of rent-seeking and patronage. While such islands may currently be the best solution available for the poor, the deeper problems are unlikely to be solved without a shift in the political settlement itself.","[Kelsall, Tim] Overseas Dev Inst, Polit & Governance, London SE1 8NJ, England",,"Kelsall, T (通讯作者)，Overseas Dev Inst, Polit & Governance, 203 Blackfriars Rd, London SE1 8NJ, England.",tim.kelsall@gmail.com,,,UK Aid from the UK Department for International Development (DFID),UK Aid from the UK Department for International Development (DFID),"This article is an output from a project funded by the UK Aid from the UK Department for International Development (DFID) for the benefit of developing countries.

Our analysis demonstrates that the J-curve argument (good institutions in autocracies as compared to hybrid and transitional regimes) may not be generic and is not well supported by empirical evidence from the sample of post-Soviet countries. An explanatory model of the King of the Mountain is instead provided. Its focus is on the monopoly of political rent as a precondition for extraction of economic rent. It demonstrates an inverse correlation between the quality of institutions and the extraction of political and economic rent, and explains why an autocrat may not have an incentive to improve institutions that may make his/her monopoly vulnerable, and rather would prefer to preserve a low quality of institutions and bad enough governance. An analysis of a variety of external and domestic factors that may endanger this monopoly is provided. Finally, the autocrat's alternative strategic choices are analyzed. It is argued that better payoffs for the autocrat - paradoxically - may result from partial reforms and improvement of the quality of institutions. However, for various reasons, this is not occurring in post-Soviet autocracies.","[Melville, Andrei; Mironyuk, Mikhail] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Dept Polit Sci, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Melville, A (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Dept Polit Sci, Moscow, Russia.",amelville@hse.ru,"Melville, Andrei/B-1152-2014; Mironyuk, Mikhail/K-9102-2015","Melville, Andrei/0000-0002-1414-5783; Mironyuk, Mikhail/0000-0002-8183-3084",,,,,75,25,30,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Extant methods based on minimum-phase function are computationally intensive and those utilizing discrete wavelet transform also fail to unfold causal effects over time and frequency. The proposed method circumvents the need for minimum-phase transfer functions and is able to localize causality in time and frequency suitably. We study the ability of the proposed method using simulated data and find that it performs excellently in identifying the causal islands. We then use the method to analyze the time-frequency causal effects in the relationship between the US financial stress and economic activity and find that financial stress has been causing economic activity particularly during the unwinding financial and economic distress and not the other way around.,"[Olayeni, Olaolu Richard] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Social Sci, Room 003 FSS Bldg Basement, Ife 220005, Nigeria",Obafemi Awolowo University,"Olayeni, OR (通讯作者)，Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Social Sci, Room 003 FSS Bldg Basement, Ife 220005, Nigeria.",rolayeni@gmail.com,,,,,,,44,56,56,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

It analyzes the number of cars owned by a household, using various attributes including expenditure for renting a parking space on a monthly basis. The estimation results derived from the IV-ordered probit model show that the absolute value of parking rent price elasticity of car ownership is, at most, 0.48, which is fairly small (i.e., inelastic). The elasticity value varies depending on city size; for megacities, elasticity is always negative for car ownership, whereas for middle-sized or small cities, towns, and villages, elasticity is positive for one-car ownership and negative for the ownership of more than one car. Hence, when the price of parking increases, some people may switch from more than one car to one car and some people in megacities may switch from one to zero cars. Indeed, the net effect of a price increase may be that non-car ownership increases in megacities and one-car ownership increases in other cities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

CHWs are relatively inexpensive to train but can treat only a limited range of medical conditions. This paper explicitly models a two-tiered structure of healthcare provision and characterizes the optimal allocation of resources between training doctors and CHWs, and implications for population health outcomes. We analyze how medical migration alters resource allocation and population health outcomes, shifting resources towards training CHWs. In the model, migration stimulates health care provision at the lower end of the illness severity spectrum, improving health outcomes for those patients; sufferers of relatively severe medical conditions who can only be treated by doctors are madeworse off. It is further shown that donor countries must be reimbursed by at least the training cost of emigrating physicians in order to restore aggregate population health to the pre-migration level.","[Roemer, John E.] Yale Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 115 Prospect St,POB 208301, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Dias, Pedro Rosa] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England",Yale University; Imperial College London,"Dias, PR (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England.",john.roemer@yale.edu; p.rosadias@imperial.ac.uk,,,,,,,32,3,4,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2016,46.0,2,,,,,335,358,,10.1007/s00355-015-0916-1,0.0,,,24,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DH8CI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373020700005,0

The great inflation of World War I and its aftermath left an indelible impression on him, and this mitigated his position on the importance of high levels of employment. In 1920 he recommended that inflation in the UK be controlled even if some unemployment would result, and there is at least some hint in his work that the relative importance to him of inflation and unemployment did not vary much over the remainder of his life.","[O'Connell, Joan] Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Econ, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"O'Connell, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Econ, Galway, Ireland.",joan.oconnell@nuigalway.ie,,,,,,,36,5,7,3,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

The US economy bridged this shortfall domestically and globally by blowing successive equity market and housing bubbles, but these produced ever more severe financial crises. Rebalancing after the 2008 crisis required trade surplus countries to expand their non-traded sectors, but rebalancing is never immaculate. Instead, the Federal Reserve Bank's three rounds of Large-Scale Asset Purchases, or quantitative easing, shifted investment flows towards some developed and developing economies. As a matter of accounting, capital inflows led to shrinking trade surpluses in those countries. However, their relatively undeveloped securities markets mean that rebalancing largely occurred through rising housing prices, mirroring the same unsustainable phenomenon the USA experienced in the 2000s. In effect, the USA shifted part of its unsustainably large non-traded sector back to trade surplus countries by causing the real-estate part of the non-traded sector in surplus countries to expand. However, this is not a sustainable solution to global trade and financial imbalances in the long run, and risks producing the same kind of crises the USA experienced in 2008.","[Schwartz, Herman Mark] Univ Virginia, Dept Polit, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",University of Virginia,"Schwartz, HM (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Dept Polit, POB 400787, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",schwartz@virginia.edu,,"Schwartz, Herman Mark/0000-0002-5571-3644",University of Virginia Sesquicentennial,University of Virginia Sesquicentennial,The University of Virginia Sesquicentennial fund enabled the writing of this article.,,28,12,12,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

International standards of project management describe and set organizational, process and knowledge areas of project management for common practice, which can be designated as the so-called soft project structure. Although the prioritization of project roles in communication or project documentation in project management is a key to the success of a project, a unique approach to quantify the soft structure of a project has not yet been introduced. The semantic networks can be used in project management to illustrate and quantify links between internal and external objects of an environment of a project. Using the ANP method, it is possible to quantify elements even in a soft project structure, i.e. e.g. project roles, project documentation, and project constraints. The author of the paper loosely follows previous research in the application of semantic networks in the case of soft structures. This article aims to propose a procedure for displaying and quantifying the soft structure of a project.","[Bartoska, Jan] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Syst Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Bartoska, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Syst Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague, Czech Republic.",bartoska@pef.czu.cz,"Bartoška, Jan/C-8992-2017","Bartoška, Jan/0000-0003-0935-5978",,,,,18,1,1,0,2,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,19,24,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500004,0

The latter approach was originally suggested as an improvement of the former one and consists of several steps. We use Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the probability of type I error for the latter approach with all the necessary steps included as part of the simulation, which mimics a real- life scenario.

One of them is the historical aspect, the former reforms, the previous system, the history of the state and the public administration. In my paper I would like to show that the importance of tradition in public administration reforms is significant. Without paying enough attention to this aspect a public administration reform is not complete, thus it cannot be successful. According to Adam Rixer's grouping the traditional elements of a public administration system - and especially the Hungarian public administration system - are the following: the language, the traditional institutions and the practical traditions. I would like to add three more elements to this list: the self-picture of the public servants in the public administration system, the effects of the former public administration reforms and the constitutional surroundings. It is easily visible that some of these elements are easily changeable, and others are hard or even impossible to change, some are only changeable through organic development, and others can be changed by the will of the government or by legislature simply. The paper shows the importance and weight of the above mentioned six traditional elements of a public administration reform through some examples in the Hungarian public administration history, especially the recent Magyary-programme. The paper describes an analysis of the reforms being silent on the above traditional elements or discussing them. Taking the historical aspects into consideration and paying enough attention to the traditions of public administration must be an important task during the preparation of the reform. The paper also gives examples and consequences of the proper and improper handling of the traditional elements.","[Batho, Gabor] Pazmany Peter Catholic Univ, Budapest, Hungary",Pazmany Peter Catholic University,"Batho, G (通讯作者)，Pazmany Peter Catholic Univ, Budapest, Hungary.",gabor.batho1@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,558,566,,,,,,9,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400057,0

Theory and evidence from advanced economies suggests that greater household access to finance smooths consumption. Evidence from emerging markets, where consumption is usually more volatile than income, indicates that financial reform further increases the volatility of consumption relative to output. This puzzle is addressed in the framework of an emerging economy model in which households face shocks to trend growth rate, and a fraction of them are financially constrained, with no access to financial services. Unconstrained households can respond to shocks to trend growth by raising current consumption more than the rise in current income. Financial reform increases the share of such households, leading to greater relative consumption volatility. Calibration of the model for pre- and post-financial reform in India provides support for the model's key predictions.","[Bhattacharya, Rudrani] Natl Inst Publ Finance & Policy, Special Inst Area, 18-2 Satsang Vihar Marg, New Delhi 110067, India; [Patnaik, Ila] Minist Finance, Dept Econ Affairs, North Block, New Delhi, India",National Institute of Public Finance & Policy (NIPFP),"Bhattacharya, R (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Publ Finance & Policy, Special Inst Area, 18-2 Satsang Vihar Marg, New Delhi 110067, India.",rudrani.bhattacharya@nipfp.org.in; ilapatnaik@gmail.com,,,British Foreign and Commonwealth Office,British Foreign and Commonwealth Office,"This paper was written under the aegis of the project named Policy Analysis in the Process of Deepening Capital Account Openness funded by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

In this case, the estimator reduces to a single GLFP and is thus computable in polynomial time. We perform a simulation study with independent uniformly distributed errors. We find out that the asymptotic convergence of the estimator to the true value and the reduction of its variance (which hold asymptotically by theory) can be empirically observed even for small datasets, but the speed of convergence heavily depends on p.","[Cerny, Michal] Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Cerny, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",cernym@vse.cz,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,132,137,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500023,0

Much of the extant literature comes to seemingly contradictory conclusions about the existence and causes of asymmetry, though the differences may be due to different aggregation (both over time and geographic markets) and the use of different price series including crude oil, wholesale, and retail gasoline prices. I utilize a large and detailed dataset to determine where evidence of a passthrough asymmetry exists, and how it depends on the aggregation and price series chosen by the researcher. Using the error correction model, I find evidence of pass-through asymmetry based on spot, rack and retail prices, though the largest effect is found in the rack to retail relationship. I find more asymmetry in branded prices compared with unbranded prices, consistent with a consumer search explanation for asymmetry. However, I also find evidence consistent with explanations based on market power as the magnitude of asymmetry is positively associated with retail concentration. On average, retail prices rise three to four times as fast as they fall.","[Chesnes, Matthew] Fed Trade Commiss, Bur Econ, Washington, DC 20580 USA",,"Chesnes, M (通讯作者)，Fed Trade Commiss, Bur Econ, 600 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20580 USA.",mchesnes@ftc.gov,"Chesnes, Matthew/ABA-1595-2021",,,,,,43,18,19,0,8,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JAN,2016,37.0,1,,,,,153,180,,10.5547/01956574.37.1.mche,0.0,,,28,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DA2OD,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367634800007,0

Globalisation changes socio-cultural contexts of the community, using the top-down approach rather than the bottom-up approach of primary health care development by ignoring traditional medical systems. Traditional medicine is not only a part of local health practices and traditional indigenous knowledge but has also become a formal strategy to improve primary health care (WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023). The development of traditional medicine is an innovative way to reduce poverty and increase public health through its integration into new forms of integrated microfinance management, implemented through local institutions. Indonesia consists of about 400 ethno-cultural groups, where each group has inherited their specific indigenous knowledge systems from generation to generation, including traditional knowledge of therapies and medicines. The potential benefits of traditional medicine should not be underestimated. Apart from its contribution to reduce high-prevalence diseases in Indonesia, the problem of persistent poverty could also be resolved since traditional medicine is not only a relatively cheap way of treatment, but is also marketable and can as such be an important source of income and employment for local people. This paper aims to review evidence on the role of indigenous medical knowledge on the improvement of the current health system and the related reduction of poverty. It is important that all communities take the opportunity to integrate indigenous medical knowledge and practice into local community services, such as in integrated microfinance management in order to improve Indonesia's health agenda while conserving the local cultures.","[Febriyanti, R.

On the other hand, since 2008, the share of reinvested earnings on equity foreign direct investment kept growing and in the years 2010 to 2014, reinvested earnings accounted for the most prevalent form of equity. The paper will focus on examining the factors that play a major role in deciding of transnational corporations on the specific form of foreign direct investments, ie. their decisions between investments in equity capital, reinvested earnings and intra-company loans. We will also address the question whether the trends in the component structure of global foreign direct investment are observable even within groups of countries, particularly in the group of investors from developed and developing economies.","[Horejsi, Bronislava] Skoda Auto Vysoka Skola Ops, Karmeli 1457, Mlada Boleslav 29301, Czech Republic",Skoda Auto University,"Horejsi, B (通讯作者)，Skoda Auto Vysoka Skola Ops, Karmeli 1457, Mlada Boleslav 29301, Czech Republic.",bronislava.horejsi@savs.cz,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,583,593,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100058,0

Nevertheless, they need to be accompanied by diagnostic tools for verifying their assumptions. In this paper, we propose the asymptotic Goldfeld-Quandt test for the regression median. It allows to formulate a natural procedure for models with heteroscedastic disturbances, which is again based on the regression median. Further, we pay attention to nonlinear regression model. We focus on the nonlinear least weighted squares estimator, which is one of recently proposed robust estimators of parameters in a nonlinear regression. We study residuals of the estimator and use a numerical simulation to reveal that they can be severely heteroscedastic also for data generated from a model with homoscedastic disturbances. Thus, we give a warning that standard residuals of the robust nonlinear estimator may produce misleading results if used for the standard diagnostic tools.","[Kalina, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Comp Sci, Vodarenskou Vezi 2, Prague 18207 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computer Science of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Kalina, J (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Comp Sci, Vodarenskou Vezi 2, Prague 18207 8, Czech Republic.",kalina@cs.cas.cz,"Kalina, Jan/E-4287-2012","Kalina, Jan/0000-0002-8491-0364",,,,,15,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,781,790,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100077,0

It has also been the subject of extensive study in the behavioral economics literature. While the simplest models assume that decision-making agents are naive, reasoning about the future without taking their bias into account, there is considerable evidence that people often behave in ways that are sophisticated with respect to present bias, making plans based on the belief that they will be present-biased in the future. For example, committing to a course of action to reduce future opportunities for procrastination or overconsumption are instances of sophisticated behavior in everyday life. Models of sophisticated behavior have lacked an underlying formalism that allows one to reason over the full space of multi-step tasks that a sophisticated agent might face, and this has made it correspondingly difficult to make comparative or worst-case statements about the performance of sophisticated agents in arbitrary scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate the framework of sophistication into a graph-theoretic model that we used in recent work for modeling naive agents. This new synthesis of two formalisms - sophistication and graph-theoretic planning - uncovers a rich structure that wasn't apparent in the earlier behavioral economics work on this problem, including a range of findings that shed new light on sophisticated behavior. In particular, our graph-theoretic model makes two kinds of new results possible. First, we give tight worst-case bounds on the performance of sophisticated agents in arbitrary multi-step tasks relative to the optimal plan, along with worst-case bounds for related questions. Second, the flexibility of our formalism makes it possible to identify new phenomena about sophisticated agents that had not been seen in prior literature: these include a surprising non-monotonic property in the use of rewards to motivate sophisticated agents; a sharp distinction in the performance of agents who overestimate versus underestimate their level of present bias; and a framework for reasoning about commitment devices that shows how certain classes of commitments can produce large gains for arbitrary tasks.","[Kleinberg, Jon] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Oren, Sigal] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Raghavan, Manish] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA",Cornell University; Ben Gurion University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Kleinberg, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,"Oren, Sigal/AHE-1701-2022","Oren, Sigal/0000-0002-4271-7291",,,,,11,15,17,0,5,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,343,360,,10.1145/2940716.2940764,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300029,0

First, young teachers may participate in vocational skills competition to improve practical ability.

The highest total GGGI equality between men and women is in Poland, the Czech Republic ranked the worst level among the V4 countries in 2014 but improved its place in 2015. Since 2006 there is a decrease of the difference between men and women in the individual sub-indixes, which affects the overall outcome GGGI. Although there are improvements on the value score indicator, placing in rankings may indicate a decline compared to previous years: in 2006 the Czech Republic placed in its prior 53rd place, the decline in 2014 caused that the Czech Republic's position dropped to the 96th place. This decrease is in most cases due to the growing number of reporting countries throughout the world that have achieved the same or better value GGGI.","[Macakova, Libuse] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Macáková, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",macakova@vse.cz,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1109,1118,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100110,0

The resulting composite index of strategic performance is constructed from four sub-indices evaluating performance in the four perspectives of the BSC: the financial perspective, the customer perspective, internal processes, and learning and growth.

However there is no standard or methodology for selection of optimal input periods and many other combinations are utilized. The aim of presented contribution is the sensitivity analysis of MACD values on selection of short, long and signal period lengths. In the first part MACD indicator is formally defined using weighted exponential averages, from this definition the dependence of input parameters and resulting MACD value is more understandable. Case study involves three types of shares with growing, falling and changing trend respectively. From results we can conclude that prolonging of signal frame increases sensitivity of MACD indicator. Moreover combination 12/26/9 is not optimal for selected shares and lengths of short and long period are in mutual relation.","[Navratil, Martin; Heckenbergerova, Jana] Univ Pardubice, Fac Elect Engn & Informat, Dept Math & Phys, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic; [Stranska, Pavla Kotatkova] Masaryk Inst Adv Studies MIAS CTU, Dept Management & Quantitat Methods, Kolejni 2637-2a, Prague 16000 6, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice; Czech Technical University Prague,"Navrátil, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Elect Engn & Informat, Dept Math & Phys, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",martin.navratil1@student.upce.cz; stranska.pavla@seznam.cz; jana.heckenbergerova@upce.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,7,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,594,599,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500102,0

In this regard, it is well documented that empirical distributions of financial returns are often skewed and exhibit fat tails. For this reason, we focus on the stable Paretian distribution, that has been shown to be especially suitable for modeling financial data. We analyze these two different approaches, namely parametric and non-parametric, and compare them by performing an empirical study.

In this auction format, bidders submit demand curves to a seller who uses these stated demands to compute market-clearing quantities, then allocates each bidder her associated quantity while charging the entire area under her stated demand curve. Except in parameterized settings, little has been known about equilibrium strategies in pay-as-bid auctions. We model pay-as-bid auctions using random supply and a perfectly-divisible good. In a setting where bidders are perfectly symmetric, we prove the uniqueness of pure-strategy Bayesian-Nash equilibria and give a tight sufficient condition for the existence of this unique equilibrium. Equilibrium uniqueness does not depend on any restrictive assumptions on the form of bids: equilibrium bid functions are unique in the space of all bounded, decreasing functions on the domain of available quantities. We show that this equilibrium has a surprisingly convenient and tractable analytical form: the bid for any quantity is a weighted average of the marginal values for all larger quantities. Leveraging this representation of bids, we show that deterministic supply revenue-dominates all distributions of random supply; hence if the seller can affect the distribution of supply, it should sell the classical monopolist's quantity. We show that, with optimal supply, if the seller is also permitted to set a reserve price, the pay-as-bid auction and the uniform-price auction-the other common format for allocating multiple homogeneous units-are revenue-equivalent; without the ability to set a reserve price, the pay-as-bid auction weakly revenue-dominates all equilibria of the uniform-price auction. The equivalence of optimally-parameterized auctions may provide insight into the empirical ambiguity surrounding which mechanism generates better outcomes.","[Pycia, Marek] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Woodward, Kyle] UNC CH, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Pycia, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",pycia@ucla.edu; kyle.woodward@unc.edu,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,123,123,,10.1145/2940716.2940768,0.0,,,1,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300014,0

One promising method of sybil detection is to use data from social network ties to implicitly infer trust. Previous work along this dimension typically a) assumes that it is difficult/costly for an adversary to create edges to honest nodes in the network; and b) limits the amount of damage done per such edge, using conductance-based methods. However, these methods fail to detect a simple class of sybil attacks which have been identified in online systems. Indeed, conductance-based methods seem inherently unable to do so, as they are based on the assumption that creating many edges to honest nodes is difficult, which seems to fail in real-world settings. We create a sybil defense system that accounts for the adversary's ability to launch such attacks yet provably withstands them by: (1) Not assuming any restriction on the number of edges an adversary can form, but instead making a much weaker assumption that creating edges from sybils to most honest nodes is difficult, yet allowing that the remaining nodes can be freely connected to. (2) Relaxing the goal from classifying all nodes as honest or sybil to the goal of classifying the core nodes of the network as honest; and classifying no sybil nodes as honest. (3) Exploiting a new, for sybil detection, social network property, namely, that nodes can be embedded in low-dimensional spaces.","[Schonebeck, Grant; Snook, Aaron; Yu, Fang-Yi] Univ Michigan, Comp Sci & Engn Dept, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Schonebeck, G (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Comp Sci & Engn Dept, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",schoeneb@umich.edu; asnook@umich.edu; fayu@umich.edu,,"Yu, Fang-Yi/0000-0002-3697-8807; Schoenebeck, Grant/0000-0001-6878-0670",,,,,42,2,3,0,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,739,756,,10.1145/2940716.2940747,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300064,0

In consideration of that, the study was carried out in 2013. Site sampling, SEM (scanning electron microscope), XRD (X-Ray Diffraction) and some other mechanical equipment were used to test physical and mechanical parameters of surrounding rocks. The RQD (rock quality designation) is lower than 30%, so the integrality of rocks is quite poor, the compressive strength is of high discrete. Then theory of simply supported beam and theory of clamped beam were used to acquire the reasonable span of roof rock. Finally, numerical models were founded to analyse deformation, plastic zone and stress evolution by FLAC3D. Three different size of coal pillar were compared. We come to a conclusion that the suitable width of little pillar is 1.5 m in this mining area, it can guarantee stability of stope, meanwhile recovery rate is the highest.","[Tian, Liang; Li, Minzu; Jiao, Shaopeng] China Univ Min & Technol Beijing, Sch Mech & Civil Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Yang, Dongsheng; Kang, Xianghui] 4 Construct Co Ltd, China Railway Engn Grp 5, Shaoguan 512031, Peoples R China",China University of Mining & Technology,"Tian, L (通讯作者)，China Univ Min & Technol Beijing, Sch Mech & Civil Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",cumtbtianl@126.com,,,"Ganhe Colliery, Houzhou Coal Electricity Group Co.,Ltd; State Key Laboratory for Geomechanics and Deep Underground Engineering of China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing)","Ganhe Colliery, Houzhou Coal Electricity Group Co.,Ltd; State Key Laboratory for Geomechanics and Deep Underground Engineering of China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing)","This work was financially supported by Ganhe Colliery, Houzhou Coal Electricity Group Co.,Ltd and State Key Laboratory for Geomechanics and Deep Underground Engineering of China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing).",,6,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-263-3,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,85.0,,,,,,505,510,,,,,,6,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BI0YD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000405302500112,0

Interestingly, there are a handful of appealing Condorcet extensions-such as the top cycle, the minimal covering set, and the bipartisan set-that satisfy set-monotonicity even in the unrestricted linear domain, thereby answering questions raised independently by BarberA (J Econ Theory 15(2):266-278(1977a)) and Kelly (Econometrica 45(2):439-446 (1977)).","[Brandt, Felix] Tech Univ Munich, D-80290 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Brandt, F (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, D-80290 Munich, Germany.",brandtf@in.tum.de,"Brandt, Felix/JQJ-3604-2023",,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [BR 2312/3-3, BR 2312/7-1, BR 2312/7-2]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I am grateful to Florian Brandl, Markus Brill, and Paul Harrenstein for helpful discussions and comments.

In the USA there is increasing interest in a form of community unionism that may gain traction in the UK: union-worker centre collaborations. Unions and worker centres have struggled to collaborate, however, because of their structural, cultural and ideological differences. This article examines a rare case of successful union-worker centre collaboration, asking why this collaboration emerged, what challenges it has faced, and why it has succeeded. Data show this collaboration emerged due to organizational crises, linked to broader economic changes, and individual learning following semi-successful organizing campaigns. The collaboration overcame challenges stemming from the differences between unions and worker centres through intra- and inter-organizational learning. Two conditions facilitated this outcome: bridge builders and state support for unionization. This case is used to explore broader questions about union revitalization.","[Hetland, Gabriel] SUNY Albany, Latin Amer Caribbean & Latino Studies, Albany, NY 12222 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Hetland, G (通讯作者)，SUNY Albany, Dept Latin Amer Caribbean & US Latino Studies, 1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",ghetland@albany.edu,,,"National Science Foundation; Institute for Research on Labor and Employment; Department of Sociology, University of California, Berkeley","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Institute for Research on Labor and Employment; Department of Sociology, University of California, Berkeley","This research was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation, the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment and the Department of Sociology, University of California, Berkeley.",,37,8,10,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

A comparative study based on skeletal remains,ECONOMICS & HUMAN BIOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Skeletal stature; Conscript heights; Industrial period,LONG BONES; PHYSICAL STATURE; SECULAR TRENDS; UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; NUTRITION; MORTALITY; DISEASE; LENGTH; AGE,"Individual stature depends on multifactorial causes and is often used as a proxy for investigating the biological standard of living. While the majority of European studies on 19th and 20th century populations are based on conscript heights, stature derived from skeletal remains are scarce. For the first time in Denmark this study makes a comparison between skeletal stature and contemporary Danish conscript heights and investigates stature of males and females temporally and between socially distinct individuals and populations in 19th and early 20th century Copenhagen. A total of 357 individuals (181 males, 176 females) excavated at the Assistens cemetery in Copenhagen is analyzed. Two stature regression formulae (Trotter, 1970; Boldsen, 1990) are applied using femur measurements and evaluated compared to conscript heights. The results indicate that mean male stature using Boldsen follows a similar trend as the Danish conscript heights and that Trotter overestimate stature by ca. 6 cm over Boldsen. At an inter population level statistically significant differences in male stature are observed between first and second half of the 19th century towards a slight stature decrease and larger variation while there are no significant changes observed in female stature. There are insignificant differences in stature between middle and high class individuals, but male stature differs statistically between cemeteries (p = 0.000) representing middle/high class, paupers and navy employees, respectively. Female stature had no significant wealth gradient (p = 0.516). This study provides new evidence of stature among males and females during the 19th century and suggests that males may have been more sensitive to changes in environmental living and nutrition than females.

The AREA increased SNAP monthly benefits by 13.6% of the maximum allotment for a given household size, equivalent to an increase of $24 to $144 for one-to-eight person households respectively. In the full sample, we find that these increases in SNAP benefits are not associated with changes in nutrient intake and diet quality. However, among those with no more than a high school education, higher SNAP benefits are associated with a 46% increase in the mean caloric share from sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and a decrease in overall diet quality especially for those at the lower end of the diet quality distribution, amounting to a 9% decline at the 25th percentile.

The first is the literature on the fiscal sustainability of welfare states, which is invariably predicated upon future growth primarily to manage demographic changes. The second is the post-growth literature, which has enjoyed a renaissance in recent years due to an environmental critique of economic growth. Both literatures contain implications for the analysis of welfare state sustainability. The primary contribution of this paper will be to explore the intractability of the tensions between these discourses and the difficulty of mapping out a progressive policy direction in the twenty-first century which meets both our environmental and social sensibilities. It is claimed that in the post-industrial world the fiscal sustainability of welfare capitalism is dependent upon public expenditure financed indirectly an environmentally unsustainable growth dynamic, but that ironically any conflagration of public welfare programmes is likely to be counter-productive as the welfare state is able to promote de-carbonisation strategies and notions of the public good as well as promoting monetarily and ecologically efficient public welfare services.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Bailey, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Elmfield Bldg,Northumberland Rd, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England.",daniel.bailey@sheffield.ac.uk,,,UK Economic and Social Research Council,UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),I am grateful for the financial support of the UK Economic and Social Research Council which has allowed me to conduct my research.,,43,49,50,1,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

I draw on Bourdieu's field theory to explain why and how this transformation has occurred. I argue that, in order to understand these changes among parts of civil society, we need to see multilateral trade governance as a social field, which civil society actors enter into as they seek to impact outcomes at the WTO. The case of the WTO challenges existing theories that conceive of global civil society as an exogenous force that acts upon the institutions of global governance, showing instead that global civil society is not in fact independent or autonomous but shaped and influenced by the institution it targets.","[Hopewell, Kristen] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Hopewell, K (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",,,,"US National Science Foundation [0927598]; Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada [75220060755]; Fulbright Fellowship; University of Michigan Nonprofit and Public Management Center Doctoral Research Support Grant; University of Texas at Austin RGK Center for Philanthropy and Community Service Summer Fellowship; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0927598] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Fulbright Fellowship; University of Michigan Nonprofit and Public Management Center Doctoral Research Support Grant; University of Texas at Austin RGK Center for Philanthropy and Community Service Summer Fellowship; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This research was supported by the US National Science Foundation [grant number 0927598], the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada [grant number 75220060755], a Fulbright Fellowship, a University of Michigan Nonprofit and Public Management Center Doctoral Research Support Grant, and a University of Texas at Austin RGK Center for Philanthropy and Community Service Summer Fellowship.",,69,28,32,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

So far, most research in political science has focused on explaining the reasons for independence, while less attention has been paid to analysing the consequences of independence. Aiming to start filling this gap, this article seeks to test if (and to what extent) independence makes a difference in competition policy enforcement. Original data on formal independence of national competition agencies in EU Member States from 1993 to 2009 are employed to test if different degrees of independence (and changes in independence over time) affect foreign direct investment and consumer prices. The results indicate that the formal independence of a competition agency does not have any significant impact on either indicator, thus questioning the assumption that independence yields better regulatory performance.","[Guidi, Mattia] LUISS Guido Carli, Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University,"Guidi, M (通讯作者)，LUISS Guido Carli, Dept Polit Sci, Rome, Italy.",guidim@luiss.it,,"Guidi, Mattia/0000-0003-3293-3203",,,,,67,20,22,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This article provides an overview of recent research on vulnerability and resilience of transport systems. Definitions of vulnerability and resilience are formulated and discussed together with related concepts. In the increasing and extensive literature of transport vulnerability studies, two distinct traditions are identified. One tradition with roots in graph theory studies the vulnerability of transport networks based on their topological properties. The other tradition also represents the demand and supply side of the transport systems to allow for a more complete assessment of the consequences of disruptions or disasters for the users and society. The merits and drawbacks of the approaches are discussed. The concept of resilience offers a broader socio-technical perspective on the transport system's capacity to maintain or quickly recover its function after a disruption or a disaster. The transport resilience literature is less abundant, especially concerning the post-disaster phases of response and recovery. The research on transport system vulnerability and resilience is now a mature field with a developed methodology and a large amount of research findings with large potential practical usefulness. The authors argue that more cross-disciplinary collaborations between authorities, operators and researchers would be desirable to transform this knowledge into practical strategies to strengthen the resilience of the transport system.

Beyond this goal of higher quality of care, however, very little is known about the motivational patterns influencing medical travellers' decision making, including the extent to which existing tourism theory and forecasting models apply to this specialized group. The present study seeks to contribute to the knowledge base by developing and testing a macro-level model of international medical travel to the USA. Using country-level data from the US Department of Commerce, World Health Organization, World Bank and Central Intelligence Agency, a two-part regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with the presence and volume of inbound medical travel by country of origin. The results indicate that travel time and out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure are significant predictors of inbound medical tourism from a given country, and travel time, travel cost, services trade and the number of outbound travellers are significant predictors of the total volume of inbound medical travellers by country. The results are discussed in the light of existing tourism research, and guidance for hospitals, policy makers and the tourism industry is provided on where to target resources for developing relationships with providers and payers abroad.","[Johnson, Tricia J.; Garman, Andrew N.] Rush Univ, Dept Hlth Syst Management, Rush Ctr Advancement Healthcare Value, Chicago, IL 60612 USA",Rush University,"Johnson, TJ (通讯作者)，Rush Univ, Dept Hlth Syst Management, Rush Ctr Advancement Healthcare Value, 1700 W Buren St,TOB Suite 126B, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.",tricia_j_johnson@rush.edu,,,US Department of Commerce Market Development Cooperator Program,US Department of Commerce Market Development Cooperator Program,"This research was supported by an award from the US Department of Commerce Market Development Cooperator Program.

While studies investigating subjective orientations among travellers have proliferated, open questions remain including the role of recent technological advances, the expansion of alternative mobility services, locally specific mobility cultures and residential selection. This paper presents the methods, results and policy implications of a comparative study aiming to understand mobility attitudes and behaviours in the wider metropolitan regions of Berlin and London. We specifically considered information and communication technology (ICT), new types of mobility services such as car sharing, electric cars and residential preferences. In each region, we identified six comparable segments with distinct attitudinal profiles, socio-demographic properties and behavioural patterns. Geocoding of the home address of respondents further revealed varying contextual opportunities and constraints that are likely to influence travel attitudes. We find that there is significant potential for uptake of sustainable travel practices in both metropolitan regions, if policy interventions are designed and targeted in accordance with group-specific needs and preferences and respond to local conditions of mobility culture. We identify such interventions for each segment and region and conclude that comparative assessment of attitudinal, alongside geographical, characteristics of metropolitan travellers can provide better strategic input for realistic scenario-building and ex-ante assessment of sustainable transport policy.

Longitudinal qualitative data are analysed in a life-story context by classifying types of themes found in the narratives. The study is theoretically rooted in the latent deprivation hypothesis, the agency restriction hypothesis and the theory of social exclusion. Occupational background and identity constituted the key foundations in which the journalists and managers anchored their strategies for coping with the labour market in general and with long-term unemployment in particular. Being able to cope was experienced as supportive and even minor success in the labour market enhanced active behaviour. However, repeated failure was related to deterioration in mental well-being. Institutional support was the most beneficial when it provided the unemployed with tools that enabled them to understand the situation they were facing and the need to consider occupational change.","[Raito, Petteri; Lahelma, Eero] Univ Helsinki, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Raito, P (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Publ Hlth, POB 41 Mannerheimintie 172, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",petteri.raito@helsinki.fi,"Lahelma, Eero T/ABC-8716-2020","Lahelma, Eero T/0000-0002-1064-1333",Finnish Education Fund [39197M.02]; Academy of Finland [1257362],Finnish Education Fund; Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland),The research was financially supported by the Finnish Education Fund (grant #39197M.02) and the Academy of Finland (grant #1257362).,,37,12,12,0,30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We also quantify the electoral advantage of a slate being randomly listed first on a ballot.","[Jurajda, Stepan] Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Econ Res & Grad Educ, Prague, Czech Republic; Acad Sci Czech Republ CERGE EI, Inst Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Jurajda, S (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Econ Res & Grad Educ, Prague, Czech Republic.",stepan.jurajda@cerge-ei.cz,"Munich, Daniel/B-8891-2008; Jurajda, Stepan/H-2886-2014","Jurajda, Stepan/0000-0001-6176-2656",Karel Janecek Foundation,Karel Janecek Foundation,This research has been supported by the Karel Janecek Foundation.,,32,8,9,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Given that property data often omits information on quality differences between same-aged homes as well as changes in structural attributes over time, researchers must assume that property renovations are uncorrelated with neighborhood amenities. We formally test if this assumption is valid by incorporating detailed data on renovations in Charlotte, North Carolina. We begin by testing how the inclusion of minor and major home improvements influences hedonic and repeat sales indices. Results find limited bias in hedonic indices and that renovated properties are no more likely to be sold than nonrenovated properties. Using the introduction of Charlotte's light rail-transit system in 2000, we estimate a positive bias of between 1.6% and 19.9% on the capitalized benefits of access to light rail due to omitted information on renovations. Our results show that a number of common data cleaning techniques used to address missing information on structural improvements may worsen this bias.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Billings, SB (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",stephen.billings@uncc.edu,,,,,,,27,14,20,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,FAL,2015,43.0,3,,,,,652,682,,10.1111/1540-6229.12093,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,CO2BU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358961100004,0

Tax competition reduces the distortion from the informational asymmetry and increases labor supply of the less productive individuals.

The estimates illustrate how the intra-household distribution of resources varies across households with and without children and how wages and non-labor income affect the allocation rule in both single-earner and double-earner households. In the presence of a child, both parents, but mothers especially, increase their involvement in home production at the expense of the enjoyment of leisure. This commitment decreases as the child gets older. In general, mothers control less than half of the household resources, while they bear more than half of the cost of maintaining a child.","[Caiumi, Antonella] ISTAT Italian Natl Inst Stat, Econometr Studies & Forecasts Div, Rome, Italy; [Perali, Federico] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, I-37129 Verona, Italy",University of Verona,"Perali, F (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dept Econ, Vicolo Campofiore 2, I-37129 Verona, Italy.",acaiumi@istat.it; federico.perali@univr.it,,,,,,,65,7,7,0,19,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Positional WAR measures the value of players in the NFL, by position, in terms of generating wins. WAR is a commonly used metric to evaluate individual players in professional baseball and basketball in the United States, but to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to construct WAR measures for American football. A key challenge in constructing these measures is that individual statistics for many football players are not as well developed as in baseball and basketball. Related to this point, the productivity of individual football players, perhaps more than players in any other major sport, is highly dependent on context. We circumvent issues related to measuring productivity for individual players by constructing WAR measures at the position rather than individual level. The identifying variation that we leverage in our study is generated by arguably exogenous player injuries and suspensions. Using data from three seasons and all 32 NFL teams, we show that the most valuable positions in the NFL are quarterback, wide receiver, tight end/fullback, and offensive tackle. Perhaps our most surprising finding is that positional WAR for all positions on the defensive side of the football is zero.","[Hughes, Andrew] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO USA; [Koedel, Cory] Univ Missouri, Econ & Publ Policy, Columbia, MO USA; [Price, Joshua A.] Southern Utah Univ, Econ, Cedar City, UT 84720 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Utah System of Higher Education; Southern Utah University,"Price, JA (通讯作者)，Southern Utah Univ, 351 W Univ Blvd, Cedar City, UT 84720 USA.",japrice@suu.edu,,,,,,,19,4,4,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Despite the fact that Russia's contemporary corruption has recently become a subject of analysis, there is, however, no study that has addressed the role of the Communist legacy in the development of various aspects of corruption. This paper contributes to the debates through, first, disentangling the complex phenomenon that is corruption, and focusing on its three aspects: supply, demand, and the attitude of the population. Second, the paper also contributes to the literature on modern corruption by explicitly focusing on the role of the historical legacy in these different aspects of corruption. The study is based on several rich data-sets on corruption and on an original data-set compiled to measure the percentage share of Communists in various regions of Russia in the last decades of the USSR (1970s-1980s). The analysis presented in the paper uncovers different roles of the Communist legacies across the development of various aspects of corruption. By doing so, the paper contributes to the literature on historical legacies in general, on Communist legacies in particular, as well as to the broader literature on the causes of corruption in transitional societies.","[Obydenkova, Anastassia] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Libman, Alexander] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Dept Econ, Frankfurt, Germany; [Libman, Alexander] Higher Sch Econ, Int Ctr Study Inst & Dev, Moscow, Russia",Pompeu Fabra University; Frankfurt School Finance & Management; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Obydenkova, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.",anastassia.obydenkova@upf.edu,"Obydenkova, Anastassia/AAD-5418-2019; Obydenkova, Anastassia/M-6916-2015","Obydenkova, Anastassia/0000-0001-5099-5294; Obydenkova, Anastassia/0000-0001-5099-5294; Libman, Alexander/0000-0001-8504-3007",,,,,109,43,48,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Previous estimates of the effect of cancer on labour market outcomes, using U.S. data, show significant reductions in employment in the first 6 months after diagnosis. However, this impact has been found to dissipate after 12 and 18 months. I use data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and find that, in England, where there is a more generous welfare support system, not only does cancer have a negative impact in the first 6-month period following diagnosis, but also in the second 6-month period. I estimate that, in the second 6-month period after diagnosis, respondents with cancer are 12.2% points less likely to work and work 4.2 fewer hours a week when compared to matched, healthy controls. This suggests that the negative effects from cancer can persist for longer than the six months identified previously. These results have implications for government policy and employers, because it increases the length of time that survivors may be on government supported sick pay, and the expected time that workers will be absent from work due to illness.

Single-product innovators are at greater risk of exiting. Exposure to technical risk does not affect exit probabilities differentially.

We estimate both OIS models using only post-intervention observations and difference in differences (DID) models using also preintervention observations. We estimate effects of the initiative on BMI, waist/height ratio, overweight and obesity for the entire sample and by gender and grade. We find no consistent effect of the programme. When we use the entire sample, no estimates are statistically significant at conventional levels, although the point estimates for the effect on BMI, indicating an average reduction in the range of 0.10-0.15 kg/m(2), are consistent with the results in a recent Cochrane review evaluating 55 studies of diet and exercise interventions targeting children; and DID estimates which are marginally significant (at the 10% level) indicate that the intervention reduces the risk of obesity by 1% point. Running separate estimations by gender and grade we find a few statistically significant estimates: OLS estimates indicate that the intervention reduces BMI in females in grade 5 by 0.39 kg/m(2) and reduces the risk of obesity in females in grade 9 by 2.6% points; DID estimates indicate an increase in waist for females in preschool class by 1.2 cm and an increase in the risk of obesity in grade 9 males by 4% points. However, if we corrected for multiple hypotheses testing these estimates would be insignificant. There is no statistically significant correlation between participation in the programme and the number of other health-promoting projects at the schools. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, we aim to measure the technical, scale and economic efficiencies for a sample of 170 cereal farmers in Chebika region (Central Tunisia) using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. Secondly, computed efficiency scores are regressed on explanatory variables using a Tobit model, in order to identify its determinants. Results of the DEA model show that average technical, allocative and economic efficiencies under constant returns to scale (CRS) are 70.7%, 85.1% and 59.7%, respectively. By operating at full economic efficiency levels, the sampled farms would be able to reduce their costs of wheat production with around 39.3%. Pure technical efficiency, scale and allocative efficiency levels account respectively for 32.3 %, 34.1% and 33.6 % of the total cost reductions. Results of the Tobit regression indicate the positive effect, on economic efficiency, of variety choices, source of irrigation, membership in water users association, irrigation management and farm size. This suggests that there is potential to improve production efficiency through developing and implementing targeted programs for inefficient farmers, intensification of specific and targeted extension services, and encouragement of farmers' membership to association.","[Chebil, Ali] ICARDA, Tunis 1082, Tunisia; [Frija, Aymen] ICARDA, Amman 11195, Jordan; [Thabet, Chokri] Inst Super Agron Chott Meriem, Sousse, Tunisia",CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA); CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA); Universite de Sousse,"Chebil, A (通讯作者)，ICARDA, 3 Rue Mahmoud Ghaznaoui,El Menzah 4, Tunis 1082, Tunisia.",chebila@yahoo.es; frijaaymen@yahoo.fr; thabet_yasmine@yahoo.fr,"Frija, Aymen/D-8296-2016","Frija, Aymen/0000-0001-8379-9054; Chebil, Ali/0000-0002-2931-4762",Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFES); Islamic Development Bank (IDB); Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED); OPEC Fund for International Development,Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFES); Islamic Development Bank (IDB); Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED); OPEC Fund for International Development,"This work was done in the framework of the project Enhancing Food Security in Arab Countries coordinated by I-CARDA.

Monetary sovereignty here means the ability of the central bank to devalue the exchange rate or to buy government debt by printing the domestic currency. We explore this diagnosis by comparing three countries - Hungary, Latvia and Greece - that received considerable amounts of external assistance under different monetary regimes. The evidence does not suggest that monetary sovereignty helped Hungary and Latvia to stabilize their economies. Rather, cooperation and external assistance made foreign banks share in the costs of stabilization. By contrast, the provision of liquidity by the European Central Bank inadvertently facilitated the reduction of foreign banks' exposure to Greece which left the Greek sovereign even more exposed. By viewing the Euro area as a monetary system rather than an incomplete state, we see that what is needed for Euro area stabilization is cooperation over banking union, rather than a fully-fledged federal budget.","[Mabbett, Deborah] Univ London, Polit, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Schelkle, Waltraud] LSE, European Inst, Polit Econ, London, England",University of London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Mabbett, D (通讯作者)，Univ London, Polit, London WC1E 7HU, England.",,,,,,,,53,21,21,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

One of the cities most seriously damaged during the earthquake was Ishinomaki. Understanding human evacuation behavior and observing road network conditions are key for the creation of effective evacuation support plans and operations. In many cases, however, a major natural disaster destroys most infrastructure sensors and detailed dynamic information on people's movements cannot be recorded. Following the Great East Japan Earthquake, vehicle detectors did not work due to the severe tsunami and electric power failure. Therefore, information was only available from individuals' probe vehicles and smartphone GPS data. These probe data, along with disaster measurements such as water immersion levels, revealed the sudden transition of vehicle speed (i.e., it eventually slowed to less than walking speed and a serious gridlock phenomenon in the Ishinomaki central area occurred). These quantitative findings, which could not be identified without probe data, should be utilized during future disaster mitigation planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The literature reveals that city growth tended to be higher in metropolitan areas with favorable weather, higher growth, and greater human capital, whereas distress was strongly correlated with city-level manufacturing legacy. The article affirms that distress has been highly persistent but that some cities have achieved resurgence through a combination of strong leadership, collaboration across sectors and institutions, clear and broad-based strategies, and significant infrastructure investments. Finally, the article explores measurement issues by comparing two methodologies used to identify poorly performing central cities: comparisons across a comprehensive national cross-section of cities and comparisons within smaller samples of similar cities. It finds that these approaches have produced similar assessments of a city's status, except in some cases where the city's progress has been uneven across time or with respect to alternative criteria.","[Kodrzycki, Yolanda K.] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, New England Publ Policy Ctr, Boston, MA 02210 USA; [Munoz, Ana Patricia] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Reg & Community Outreach Dept, Boston, MA 02210 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston,"Kodrzycki, YK (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Boston, New England Publ Policy Ctr, 600 Atlantic Ave, Boston, MA 02210 USA.",Yolanda.Kodrzycki@bos.frb.org,"Muñoz, Ana/JCN-6031-2023",,,,,,39,11,11,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

We suspect that an intrinsic selection bias may exist in the competitive project appraisal process, in addition to the many other factors that contribute to inaccurate traffic forecasts. In this paper, we examine the potential for selection bias in the governmental process of Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) transportation project appraisals. Although the simultaneous consideration of multiple criteria is typically used in practice, traffic flow estimate is usually a key criterion in these appraisals. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the selection bias associated with the highest flow estimate criterion. We develop two approaches to quantify the level and chance of inaccuracy caused by selection bias: the expected value approach and the probability approach. The expected value approach addresses the question to what extent is inaccuracy caused by selection bias?. The probability approach addresses the question what is the chance of inaccuracy due to selection bias?. The results of this analysis confirm the existence of selection bias when a government uses the highest traffic forecast estimate as the priority criterion for BOT project selection. In addition, we offer some insights into the relationship between the extent/chance of inaccuracy and other related factors. We do not argue that selection bias is the only reason for inaccurate traffic forecasts in BOT projects; however, it does appear that it could be an intrinsic factor worthy of further attention and investigation.

This analytical focus has resulted in an understanding of workplace bullying as fundamentally an individualized phenomenon. This article begins with a brief discussion of the theorization that currently predominates in the workplace violence and bullying literature and the outcomes of this theorizing. An emerging framework, conceptualizing violence broadly, is then outlined for understanding violence and bullying. Through this framework, it is argued that the discourse and research on workplace violence - in all its forms - must explore explicit connections between these social phenomena and the interrelatedness of all forms of oppression. Workplace violence must be examined within a framework where power cannot be separated from social dimensions within and outside the workplace.","[Berlingieri, Adriana] Univ Toronto, Ontario Inst Studies Educ, Toronto, ON M5S 1V6, Canada",University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto,"Berlingieri, A (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Ontario Inst Studies Educ, Dept Leadership Higher & Adult Educ, 252 Bloor St West,Off 7-159, Toronto, ON M5S 1V6, Canada.",adriana.berlingieri@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,45,17,33,4,38,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

A common correlated latent time effect induces dependence among risks. Our model is based on underlying latent exit decisions in continuous time while only a time interval containing the exit time is observed, as is common in economic data. We do not make the simplifying assumption of discretizing exit decisionsour competing risk model setup allows for latent exit times of different risk types to be realized within the same time period. In this setting, we derive a tractable likelihood based on scaled GIG Laplace transforms and their higher-order derivatives. We apply our approach to analyzing the determinants of unemployment duration with exits to jobs in the same industry or a different industry among unemployment insurance recipients on nationally representative individual-level survey data from the US Department of Labor. Our approach allows us to conduct a counterfactual policy experiment by changing the replacement rate: we find that the impact of its change on the probability of exit from unemploymet is inelastic.

However, little research has focused on the impact of the Great Recession on work-related discrimination. We examine the extent to which discrimination varies across different national-ethnic groups in Ireland, and whether discrimination increased between 2004, during an economic boom, and 2010, in the midst of a severe recession. Our analysis draws on two large-scale nationally representative surveys on the experience of labour market discrimination. We find that overall non-Irish nationals do experience higher rates of work-based discrimination and that there is substantial variation in discrimination across national-ethnic groups. However we find no evidence to suggest that self-reported discrimination increased during the recession.","[Kingston, Gillian] ESRI, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Kingston, Gillian] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sociol, Dublin, Ireland; [McGinnity, Frances] ESRI, Equal & Integrat Res, Dublin 2, Ireland; [McGinnity, Frances] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [O'Connell, Philip J.] Univ Coll Dublin, Geary Inst Publ Policy, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin; University College Dublin,"Kingston, G (通讯作者)，ESRI, Dublin 2, Ireland.",gillian.kingston@esri.ie,,"McGinnity, Frances/0000-0002-2184-315X",Irish Equality Authority; European Union,Irish Equality Authority; European Union(European Union (EU)),"This article represents a further development of research initially co-funded by the Irish Equality Authority and the European Union's PROGRESS programme (2007-2013): the authors would like to acknowledge this funding.

Our theoretical model demonstrates that the initial green premium can be negative but becomes positive as the building ages if a green building has a higher life-cycle cost and a longer economic life. Our empirical analysis of green condominiums in Tokyo confirms this prediction. We additionally find that the longer-life design is associated with a price premium, but the use of renewable energy and recycled materials and water is associated with price discounts. The price discounts are interpreted as the capitalization of a greater life-cycle user cost.","[Yoshida, Jiro] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Sugiura, Ayako] Tokyo Assoc Real Estate Appraisers, Shinjuku Ku, Tokyo 1620845, Japan",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Yoshida, J (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, 368 Business Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jiro@psu.edu,"Yoshida, Jiro/AAF-5853-2020",,MLIT; Institute for Real Estate Studies at the Pennsylvania State University,MLIT; Institute for Real Estate Studies at the Pennsylvania State University,"We thank John Quigley, Piet Eichholtz, Nils Kok, Austin Jaffe, Brent Ambrose, Ed Coulson, Joshua Graff-Zivin, Jenny Schuetz, Kerry Vandell, Patrick McAllister, Erin Mansur, James Conklin, Moussa Diop, Sun Young Park, and the participants of seminars at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism (MLIT); the AREUEA Denver conference; the Berkeley-Maastricht Conference on Green Buildings; and 2013 NBER Japan Meeting for their comments.

Although the financial sector has always figured strongly in these discussions, its development, or rather repression, is almost always considered in the context of serving the 'real' sector. In contrast, this paper contributes to the emerging literature on government policies to develop financial sectors into independent and internationally competitive sources of economic growth on their own right through an analysis of the development of Islamic finance in Malaysia. The paper argues that the emergence of Islamic finance in Malaysia, and the country's evolution into a key player of the sector in the global market, can be attributed to developmental efforts or industrial policies adopted by the government. The case of Islamic finance in Malaysia suggests the continuing relevance of industrial policy for developmental purposes. More importantly, it demonstrates that developing countries can chart a path towards services-led growth, the next frontier in economic development.","Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Lai, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Level 4,John Medley Bldg, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",jikon.lai@unimelb.edu.au,"Lai, Jikon/A-8682-2015","Lai, Jikon/0000-0003-2886-1403",,,,,58,19,19,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Using a range of first-hand sources - including interviews by leading Russian and Chechen experts and investigative journalists, and the testimonies of eyewitnesses and key actors from within local and Russian politics - the article explains the actual mechanisms of Moscow's policy of Chechenization that have sought to break the backbone of the local resistance using local human resources. To this end, the study focuses on the crucial period of 2000-2004, when Moscow's key proxy in Chechnya, the kadyrovtsy paramilitaries, were established and became operational under the leadership of Akhmad Kadyrov, which helped create a sharp division within Chechen society, reducing the level of populace-based support for the insurgents, thereby increasing support for the pro-Moscow forces.","Charles Univ Prague, Inst Int Studies, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Souleimanov, E (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Int Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.",arslanlik@yahoo.com,"Souleimanov, Emil A./AAQ-3925-2020; Souleimanov, Emil/G-9115-2018",,,,,,35,33,35,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

This condition does not depend on the size of the valuations as in an absolute difference CSF. We prove that several properties of Nash equilibrium with the Tullock CSF still hold in our framework. Finally, we consider the case of players, generalize the previous condition and show that this condition is sufficient for the existence of a unique interior Nash equilibrium in pure strategies.

The behaviour of pedestrian will change with respect to different land use type and this change in behaviour of pedestrian further reflects change in perceived level of service (LOS). So, it is important to evaluate the quality of service of such crossing facilities with respect to different land-use type under mixed traffic conditions. In this framework, pedestrian perceived LOS were collected with respect to different land-use type such as shopping, residential and business areas. The ordered probit (OP) model was developed by using NLOGIT software package, with number of vehicles encountered, road crossing difficulty as well as safety considered as primary factors along with pedestrian individual factors (gender and age), land-use type and roadway geometry. From the model results, it has been concluded that perceived safety, crossing difficulty, land-use condition, number of vehicles encountered, median width and number of lanes have significant effect on pedestrian perceived LOS at unprotected (un-signalized) mid-block crosswalks in mixed traffic scenario. The inferences of these results highlights the importance of land use planning in designing a new set of pedestrian access facilities for unprotected mid-block crosswalks under mixed traffic conditions. Also the study results would be useful for evaluating pedestrian accessibility taking into account different land-use type and planning required degree of segregation with vehicular movement at unprotected mid-block crosswalk locations.

Our framework is fully quantitative and computational, allowing one to measure the quality of strategic alternatives across a series of measures, and as a function of relevant game parameters. Our special focus on performing analysis over a parametric landscape is motivated by public policy considerations, where possible interventions are modeled as affecting particular parameters of the game.

Under the assumption of strictly exogenous regressors and strictly exogenous spatial weighting matrix, the model is estimated by 2SLS method aided by the sieve method and through the instrumental variable. Under some sufficient conditions, the proposed estimator for the finite dimensional parameter is shown to be root-N consistent and asymptotically normally distributed, The proposed estimator for the unknown function is shown to be consistent and asymptotically distributed as well, though at a rate slower than root-N. Consistent estimators for the asymptotic variance-covariance matrices of both estimators are provided.

As social policy is increasingly directed towards stimulating employment in broader sections of society, this article particularly studies employment commitment among groups with traditionally weaker bonds to the labour market. This is also theoretically interesting because the employment commitment in these groups may be more affected by the welfare context than is the employment commitment of the core work force. A welfare scepticism view predicts that disincentive effects and norm erosion will lead to lower employment commitment in more generous and activating welfare states, while a welfare resources perspective holds the opposite view. Using multilevel data for individuals in 18 European countries, the article finds increasing employment commitment as social spending gets more generous and activating. This was also evident for weaker groups in the labour market, although the effect was less pronounced in some groups.","[van der Wel, Kjetil A.; Halvorsen, Knut] Oslo & Akershus Univ Coll Appl Sci, N-0130 Oslo, Norway",Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),"van der Wel, KA (通讯作者)，Oslo & Akershus Univ Coll Appl Sci, POB 4, N-0130 Oslo, Norway.",kjetil.wel@hioa.no,,"van der Wel, Kjetil A./0000-0002-1812-4795",,,,,43,22,24,1,34,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Most of the tetraploid parents used are doubled-diploid (DD). The genetic structure of diploid gametes and particularly the rate of parental heterozygosity restitution (PHR) depend on the meiotic process by which they were originated. Second-division restitution (SDR) is the 2n gamete formation mechanism involved in 'Fortune' and clementines. With SDR, PHR is positively linked with the distance of each locus to the centromere. With DD parents, PHR depends of the rate of preferential pairing and thus the proportion of disomic versus tetrasomic segregations. We have compared the genetic structure of two populations of diploid gametes of clementine (one population of 2n gametes and one of 2x gametes produced by DD) with SNPs and SSRs markers covering the 9 citrus chromosomes. The DD displays mostly tetrasomic segregation; however three linkage groups present intermediate segregation and one display a tendency for disomy. The PHR in 2n gametes is 2/3 of the one obtained in 2x gametes produced by DD. The two methods of triploid production appear complementary in terms of genotypic variability. 4x x 2x hybridizations are more efficient than 2x x 2x for developing new cultivars phenotypically closer to the diploid parent of the DD. Conversely, 2x x 2x hybridisations provides the opportunity to select more innovative products.","[Aleza, Pablo; Cuenca, Jose; Juarez, Jose; Ollitrault, Patrick; Navarro, Luis] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain; [Ollitrault, Patrick] CIRAD, UMR AGAP, Montpellier, France",Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA); Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD,"Aleza, P (通讯作者)，Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain.",aleza@ivia.es,"Aleza, Pablo/ABF-4339-2020; Cuenca, Jose/N-7047-2014; Navarro, Luis/D-1001-2012; Ollitrault, Patrick/HLQ-0557-2023; Aleza, Pablo/M-3710-2014","Aleza, Pablo/0000-0003-3554-5337; Navarro, Luis/0000-0001-5163-5960; Aleza, Pablo/0000-0002-8936-1448",,,,,13,2,2,0,1,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,487,493,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600059,0

The desired responses was percentage decrease of COD, BOD, and TSS; and also increase of pH. According to CCD analysis, the best result was optimally gained on HRT 24 hours and 15% inoculums addition. Those combined factors could decrease COD up to 86. 76%, whereas the decreasing amount of BOD was up to 79.23%, and TSS was up to 67.88%. In addition to those combination, pH of tofu's wastewater increased up to 4.5. That showed that anaerobic system could reduce COD, BOD, and TSS but it couldn't significantly neutralize pH of tofu's wastewater yet.

The importance of studying this subject is that the exploitation of cultural knowledge (Hofstede & Hofstede 2005, Schwartz 1999, Ng et al. 2006, Hall 1976, Lewis 2006) and competence (Koskinen 2001) is still limited in the constantly increasing project-based business (Turner 1999, Artto et al. 2011, PMBOK 2004) in the international field. Two objectives exist in this study: understanding project complexity through the main challenges in project implementation and evaluating the impacts of the cultural factors behind them. We propose the multiple case study approach (Eisenhard & Graebner 2007, Yin 2014). The prominence of cultural knowledge in project implementation is difficult to determine, so the research design has exploratory features. Case project A was implemented in Sub-Saharan Africa and Case project B in the Near East. Interviewed managers worked either from distance and only visited the target country periodically or represented the perspective of an operational level manager working in the host country. The main cultural challenges that occurred in the projects are defined by these interviewees. This methodology gives evidence of the main challenges in the two case projects and clarifies the multiplicity of cultural issues in the project context. The importance of the subject was highlighted and the interviewed managers demonstrated that cultural knowledge can offer benefits. Numerous studies exist concerning the challenges in the project business (Deresky 2014, Turner 1999). The outcomes of the research stressed the uniqueness of projects and the situational need for cultural knowledge. The results highlighted the pervasive nature of culture in the international playing field. Companies are obliged to adjust their operations according to environments with multifaceted requirements. National cultures not only prevail within the borders of geographical areas, but are also reflected in company procedures. Therefore, their overall impact needs to be considered in international projects.","[Aramo-Immonen, Heli; Hietaoja, Helina] Tampere Univ Technol, Pori Unit, Dept Ind Management, Pori 28100, Finland; [Jussila, Jari] Tampere Univ Technol, Dept Informat Management & Logist, Tampere 33720, Finland; [Ammirato, Salvatore] Univ Calabria, Dept Mech Energy & Management Engn, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy",Tampere University; Tampere University; University of Calabria,"Aramo-Immonen, H (通讯作者)，Tampere Univ Technol, Pori Unit, Dept Ind Management, Pohjoisranta 11, Pori 28100, Finland.",,"Jussila, Jari Juhani/P-9416-2019; Ammirato, Salvatore/AAI-9056-2020","Jussila, Jari Juhani/0000-0002-7337-1211; Ammirato, Salvatore/0000-0001-6617-3789",,,,,47,0,0,1,9,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1085,1096,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200083,0

However, adoption of mechanical harvesting requires an important effort in the selection and adaptation of the existing equipment, as well as in planting design. In 2009, several field experiments using two continuous canopy shake systems, OXBO 3210 and OXBO 3220, were conducted in conventional non specifically adapted citrus orchards to evaluate the effect of harvester amplitude (CPMs) and harvester speed on fruit removal efficiency, tree damage and fruit quality. Results suggested that adaptation of current citrus plantations (continuous hedgerows with high canopy and bottom canopy pruned at 1 m above ground) together with an appropriate calibration of the machinery, could provide enough fruit removal efficiency without causing important damage to the tree or affect the physical integrity of the fruits for processing.

We differentiate modalities of arts' expected influence on management and build a typology of anticipated effects of exposing management to arts. By identifying the desired results of art and management merger, we pinpoint the pressing shortcomings of the latter. Methodology/Approach - It is a speculative paper based on the qualitative analysis of literature. The paper analyzes the explicit and implicit meanings of terms and the context of their usage. Paradoxes, equivocations and contradictions are being exposed and discussed. Originality / Value - The emerging field of art and management gathers a lot of valuable insights stemming both from academia and from business practitioners. The growing body of knowledge, however, lacks conceptual clarity; omnipresent equivocations prevent the development of the field and its move to the next level. We claim there are three modalities of influence that art is expected to exert on management. First, exposure of the realm of management to arts is believed to produce direct benefits. Art here is believed to be an active ingredient, which should by itself positively influence managerial process, managers or managed institutions. Second, art is believed to serve as an analogy that brings about insights about what management is (descriptive analogy) or should be (normative analogy). The third way of harnessing arts to managerial improvements is by treating it as a catalyst: art is added to an ongoing process in order to accelerate or facilitate it. Researchers and practitioners urge various expectations about art applied to management. We classify the main effects of exposing management to art and identify the assumptions about art connected with each effect respectively. The main effects are the enhancement of: - creativity (art does not follow the pattern) - agency (art is exercise of human agency) - collaboration (art enhances communication and collaboration) - heroic leadership (art is done by extraordinary people) - holism (art as a realm of non-reductionism) - enriched cognition (art is a realm of epistemological diversity) - moral value (art is meaningful) - craft (art requires mastery) Practical Implications - Deeper and subtler understanding of the art-management link will help business practitioners better respond to the uncertainties they face and chose the forms of Arts-Based Initiatives that better match the particularities of their situation.","Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University,"Bednarz-Luczewska, P (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland.",,,,,,,,64,0,0,1,11,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2021,2029,,,,,,9,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200157,0

The planting system comprised either 4 trees with 3 replicates. The trees were irrigated and their crowns were trained as spindles (in the case of 'Saint Julien' rootstock) and flat open center (in the case of 'Myrobalan C5' rootstock). In this experimental plot, in 2012-2014 period, were evaluated: tree vigour based upon measuring of trunk-diameter and calculated trunk cross sectional area, yields in kg/tree and basic parameters of fruit quality. Behind observations and measurements we found that the trees of all cultivars grafted on 'Saint Julien' rootstock came into bearing in the second year after planting, but production was very low, and those on 'Myrobalan C5' rootstock in the third year. The vigour of all cultivars grafted on 'Saint Julien' rootstock was weaker than those grafted on 'Myrobalan C5'.

The basic hypothesis of this paper is that tourism in Croatia is one of the key sectors of the economy, however, it is questionable whether the river tourism as a form of tourism is sustainable in the future. The demand for international cruises along European rivers has recorded an increase over the last few years. The total number of cruises in 2012 amounted to 90.000, which is almost 12% more cruises than compared to 2011. Increased demand in the number of international cruises on European rivers affected the growth of capacity in the number of ships, and activities in the market of new shipping companies specializing for cruises on the European rivers. There were 235 ships docking in passenger ports of cities Vukovar and Ilok located on the Danube as part of international cruises during 2012. Year after year, Vukovar, Ilok and Osijek marked an increase in the number of tourist cruise ships docking on the Danube River. According to the Vukovar Port Authority visits to Vukovar from the international cruises started in 2002, while the visits to Ilok started in 2007. The reason for this is certainly in the construction of the required infrastructure for the docking of the ships (Aljmas and Batina). The increase in the number of cruises on the Danube is certainly a key factor in the development of continental tourism, especially in Eastern Croatia, which is still feeling the effects of the war of aggression and the world economic crisis. The aim of this paper is to highlight and analyze the existing resources in the river tourism in Eastern Croatia, detect main reasons: (in) visibility dock in Vukovar and Ilok, (un) attractive tourist facilities and offer a solution for increasing the use of tourism services on land and increasing the total number of arrivals of the same.","[Cucic, Drazen; Crnkovic, Boris] Fac Econ, Dept Natl & Int Econ, Osijek, Croatia",,"Cucic, D (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, Dept Natl & Int Econ, Osijek, Croatia.",dcucic@efos.hr; bcrnko@efos.hr; nikolina.mezulic@gmail.com,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,6,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,54,61,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100005,0

Such reticulate evolution coupled with vegetative propagation results in genomes that are mosaics of large chromosome fragments of the basic taxa, in frequent interspecific heterozygosity. Breeding of these species is hampered by their complex heterozygous genomic structures. Haplotyping of multiple gene fragments along the genome should be a powerful approach to resolve the evolutionary history of the gene pools, to reveal the admixture genomic structure of current species and to develop innovative breeding schemes. We have analysed the efficiency of parallel sequencing with 454 methodology to decipher the hybrid structure of modern citrus species and cultivars along chromosome 2. Four hundred fifty four amplicon libraries were established with the fluidigm array system for 48 genotypes and 16 gene fragments of chromosome 2. Haplotypes were established from the reads of each accession and phylogenetic analyses were performed from the haplotypic data of each gene fragment. The length of 454 reads and the level of differentiation between the ancestral taxa of modern citrus allowed efficient haplotype phylogenetic assignations for 12 of the 16 gene fragments. The analysis of the mixed genomic structure of modern species and cultivars (i) revealed C. maxima introgressions in modern mandarins; (ii) was consistent with previous hypothesis regarding the origin of secondary species; and (iii) provided a new picture of the evolution of chromosome 2.

For this purpose, processes and factors of knowledge utilisation in a multi-national enterprise (MNE) are analysed. Design/methodology/approach - An institutional setting in which such transfer, utilisation, and disclosure takes place is analysed in an extensive case study of a MNE. In this case study, the identification of knowledge assets, relationship building, and the knowledge presentation are crucial for an adequate utilization of knowledge. The authors conducted a best-practise case study for knowledge marketing in MNEs, which uncovers and integrates disclosure strategies of the firm. Therefore, this case study primarily focuses on the qualitative research method. The data collection is based on semi-structured interviews with different individuals inside and outside the firm and data of document analyses. Originality/value - The analysed case verifies a model for knowledge marketing characterized by different processes, success factors and disclosure strategies, especially knowledge disclosure, which provides MNEs in knowledge-intensive environments with the possibility of commercialising knowledge-intensive products and services. Main processes identified in the case study were the identification of knowledge assets, relationship building, and knowledge protection processes. Main factors described by MNEs for successful knowledge marketing are: solving customer problems, reputation, and trust. Theoretical implications - This research paper contributes to knowledge marketing as well as knowledge disclosure literature, since the data collected in the case reveal relevant empirical findings about these concepts. Hence, this contribution may support a holistic view on knowledge marketing and its relevance in MNEs. Empirically verified success factors of knowledge marketing in MNEs may also additionally contribute to the existing literature of knowledge utilisation. Practical implications - This best practise case study may improve or clarify firm's understanding of knowledge marketing processes and success factors in order to enhance their outputs as qualitative services providers. Additionally, in the market for knowledge many uncertainties and risks may occur. Firms and clients in knowledge-intensive industries may enhance their benefits by implementing adequate procedures of knowledge marketing, so that relationships of trust may be developed between the participants. This paper describes the practical importance of knowledge disclosure - to enhance the firm's knowledge capital - as well as the relevance of firm's attributes like reputation and problem-solution capacity.","[Diehr, Gregor; Gueldenberg, Stefan] Univ Liechtenstein, Inst Entrepreneurship, Vaduz 9490, Principality Of, Liechtenstein",University of Liechtenstein,"Diehr, G (通讯作者)，Univ Liechtenstein, Inst Entrepreneurship, Fuerst Franz Josef Str, Vaduz 9490, Principality Of, Liechtenstein.",,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,2,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,582,593,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200045,0

SNP markers were used for genetic diversity assessment using different methods; recently, the availability of EST database and whole genome sequences increased the information on sequence variability in citrus leading to wider employment of these markers so that reliable SNP detection methods are needed. In the present study, for the first time we applied high resolution melting curve analysis (HRM) in citrus to detect the presence of SNPs polymorphisms and their involvement in functional and structural genomics. In citrus, the possibility of characterizing genetic diversity was drastically increased using this method since it allowed analyzing more polymorphisms in a single PCR fragment. Furthermore, we identified SNPs associated with gene coding regions which revealed some aspects of their functionality in biochemical variations.

For loans to individuals or small businesses, credit risk is typically assessed through a process of credit scoring. For these purposes, credit scoring models are built. It involves using different statistical techniques and historical data from the accepted applicants. However, the scorecard is designed to be used on all applicants and therefore parameter estimates of credit risk models may be biased due to the selection bias. Reject inference is a technique that tries to mitigate the consequences of this phenomenon. One of the possibilities how selection bias can be reduced is to grant loans to a part of rejected applicants and analyse their behaviour (enlargement method). This approach is time-consuming and costly especially. We introduced a modification of the method with the costs optimization. Our results show that involving rejected cases positively affects forecast accuracy of credit score as well as the discriminative power of models. Finally, we discuss the expected costs and benefits of the modified approach.","[Ditrich, Josef] Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Ditrich, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",xditj04@vse.cz,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,325,334,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000032,0

This crisis can be overcome by focusing on typical citrus productions, which have been PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) recognized by the European Union. Therefore, it is necessary to implement a traceability system to verify the authenticity of these productions. The aim of this research was to classify, by a physicochemical and chemometric approach, two typical Italian citrus productions grown in Sicily (PGI 'Arancia Rossa di Sicilia' and PGI 'Limone di Siracusa') whose geographical origin was authenticated by samplings made in PGI and non-PGI areas. The combined use of physicochemical (quality parameter), spectral (NIR spectral patterns), multielemental (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Li, Sr) and isotopic (C-13/C-12, O-18/O-16) markers joined with multivariate statistical analysis such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) was used as a tool to discriminate between PGI and non-PGI typical Italian citrus fruits. The results have revealed that a representative database of each geographical area can be used for the development of a traceability system of such typical productions.","[Fabroni, Simona; Amenta, Margherita; Allegra, Maria; Sorrentino, Guido; Roccuzzo, Giancarlo; Rapisarda, Paolo] Ctr Ric Agrumicoltura & Colture Mediterranee, Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, Acireale, CT, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Rapisarda, P (通讯作者)，Ctr Ric Agrumicoltura & Colture Mediterranee, Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, Acireale, CT, Italy.",paolo.rapisarda@entecra.it,"Fabroni, Simona/AAL-1154-2020; Roccuzzo, Giancarlo/M-2851-2019","Fabroni, Simona/0000-0002-2567-6838; Roccuzzo, Giancarlo/0000-0002-0851-1329; AMENTA, MARGHERITA/0000-0002-4415-8470; Rapisarda, Paolo/0000-0002-1833-6413",,,,,11,0,0,0,12,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1445,1453,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600183,0

Firstly, it seeks to provide a theoretical explanation for, and justification of, the reasons why successful processes in social and individual experience, as well as activity within an enterprise, need to be supplemented by a quasi-theoretical understanding of what individuals are doing (viewed both from inside and outside) when they act upon their experience in the interests of sustainability. Further, it elucidates the way in which theoretical explanations and their practical application/projection into reality work in general together. The central aim is, however, to provide both empirical insights resting upon experiential success derived from a case study and a sort of theoretical foundation provided by philosophy and theory of science. As a result, we will provide means for decision support in an explanatory (and not just descriptive) way to understand and improve evolutionary processes influencing how to integrate the idea of sustainability into an innovative modelling of enterprises. Design/methodology/approach - A short review of related research traditions is provided, followed by both a conceptual framework LIR (Language-Information-Reality) that rests upon research in the philosophy and theory of science, and empirical evidence both to challenge unreflective or - in the Socratic sense - unexamined organizational life intended to innovate towards sustainable enterprise models. Originality/value - Research related to enterprise sustainability has expanded in recent years, making room in the representational approach to accommodate an enactive or rather performative one. However, it appears that at the point of this integration a theoretical explanation and justification in organizational and management research is still absent. This contribution seeks therefore to explicate the above-mentioned model-theoretic systemic framework of analysis LIR and point out the many ways in which the mutual limitations inherent in the two approaches mentioned above clash with respect to examining organizational life, and are in need of interaction if they are to avoid misapplication and overexploitation of organizational knowledge. Practical implications - The proposed theoretical extension and explanation facilitates understanding and controlled reproducibility of those events that are considered and accepted as examples of sustainable success within an enterprise, economic or otherwise.","[Gatarik, Eva; Kulhavy, Viktor] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Gatarik, E (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",,"Born, Eva/AAA-8263-2020","Born, Eva/0000-0003-2242-0105",,,,,20,0,0,0,4,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2253,2262,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200177,0

However, this cultivar produces fruits of small to medium size that are fairly accepted commercially. In a field study, we evaluated the effects of rates and frequencies of foliar potassium (K) fertilization, applied either as potassium nitrate (KNO3) or potassium sulfate (K2SO4), on fruit production (fruit size, weight and yield) and quality parameters (skin thickness, firmness, color index, maturity index, juice content, acidity and total soluble sugars). Concentrations of foliar fertilizer solutions were 5 and 8% (m/v) for KNO3, and 2.5 and 4% (m/v)for K2SO4, applied either two or three times during fruit growth on orchards with three planting densities (D1: 6x6 m, D2: 5x6 m and D3: 6x3.5 m tree spacing). In all treatments, after potassium sprays, K (% DM) content increased in the leaves of clementine 'Cadoux' between 12 and 40% compared to their initial K levels while in the control this content dropped about 15% compared to its initial content (before K sprays). Fruit weight increased with K application rate and frequency. K fertilization treatments in three foliar applications showed the best percentages of fruits of extra size class, whatever the source of K (KNO3 or K2SO4) or plant density. Foliar applications of K also increased fruit color, firmness and rind thickness. Fruit juice content, acidity and total soluble solids slightly increased with foliar K application. Raising K concentration and the number of foliar applications increased tree fruit production. In terms of efficiency of foliar K fertilizers, 4% K2SO4 in three applications resulted in maximum gain of fruits per kg of foliar fertilizer.","[Hamza, Abdelhak] INRA, Dept Agron, Kenitra, Morocco; [Bamouh, Ahmed] Inst Agron & Vet Hassan II IAV, Plant Prod Protect & Biotechnol Dept, Rabat, Morocco; [El Guilli, Mohammed] INRA, Dept Phytopathol, Kenitra, Morocco; [Bouabid, Rachid] Ecole Natl Agr Meknes, Dept Soil Sci, Meknes, Morocco",Moulay Ismail University of Meknes,"Hamza, A (通讯作者)，INRA, Dept Agron, Kenitra, Morocco.",hamza.abdelhak@gmail.com,,"Bamouh, Ahmed/0000-0003-1761-444X",,,,,12,4,4,0,3,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1785,1793,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600228,0

This means that the energy needed can be reduced whilst maintaining the same transport service. However, the fact that a large cost-effective potential has been identified that is not being harnessed by decision-makers in practice suggests that there is more to this potential to understand. In this paper, the possibilities for increasing energy efficiency by reducing waiting time in port are explored and problematised through a case study of a short sea bulk shipping company transporting dry bulk goods mainly in the North and Baltic seas. Operational data from two ships in the company's fleet for one year showed that the ships spent more than 40% of their time in ports and that half of the time in port was not productive. The two most important reasons for the large share of unproductive time were that ports were closed on nights and weekends and that ships arrived too early before the stevedores were ready to load or unload the cargo. Reducing all of the unproductive time may be difficult, but the results also show that even a conservative estimate of one to four hours of reduced time per port call would lead to a reduction in energy use of 2-8%. From in-depth interviews with employees of the shipping company, ports and ship agencies, a complex picture is painted when attempting to understand how this potential arises. Aspects such as a lack of effective ship-shore-port communication, little time for ship operators, an absence of means for accurately predicting energy use of voyages as a function of speed, perceived risk of arriving too late, and relationships with third-party technical management may all play a role.
