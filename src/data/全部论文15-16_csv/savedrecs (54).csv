This paper demonstrates the importance of implementation lags in the context of Medicare Part D, the prescription drug benefit that took effect two years after it was signed into law. Exploiting the differential responses of chronic and acute drugs to anticipated future prices, I show that individuals reduced drug utilization for chronic but not acute drugs in anticipation of Part D's implementation. Accounting for this anticipatory response substantially reduces the estimated total treatment effect of Part D. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A systematic search of the literature was performed using EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Web of Science. Studies that conducted a cost analysis, considered at least two components of the chronic care model, and compared integrated care with standard care were included. Results: Out of 575 articles, 26 were included. Most studies examined integrated care models for type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 18) and to a lesser extent for schizophrenia (n = 6) and multiple sclerosis (n = 2). Across the three disease groups, the incremental cost per patient per year ranged from - (sic)3860 to + (sic)613.91 = ((x) over bar = -(sic)533.61 +/- (sic)902.96). The incremental cost for type 2 diabetes mellitus ranged from - (sic)1507.49 to + (sic)299.20 ((x) over bar = - (sic)518.22 +/- + (sic)604.75), for schizophrenia from - (sic)3860 to + (sic)613.91((x) over bar = - (sic)677.21 + (sic)1624.35), and for multiple sclerosis from - (sic)822 to + (sic)339.43 ((x) over bar = - (sic)241.29 + (sic)821.26). Most of the studies (22 of 26 [84.6%]) reported a positive economic impact of integrated care models: for type 2 diabetes mellitus (16 of 18 [88.9%]), schizophrenia (4 of 6 [66.7%]), and multiple sclerosis (1 of 2 [50%]). Conclusions: In this systematic literature review, predominantly positive economic impacts of integrated care models for patients with chronic diseases were found.","[Desmedt, Melissa; Vertriest, Sonja; Hellings, Johan; Vandijck, Dominique] Hasselt Univ, Fac Med & Life Sci, Agoralaan Bldg D, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Hasselt, Belgium; [Hellings, Johan] AZ Delta, Roeselare, Belgium; [Bergs, Jochen] Hasselt Univ, Fac Business Econ, Hasselt, Belgium; [Dessers, Ezra] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Sociol Res, Leuven, Belgium; [Vankrunkelsven, Patrik] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Leuven, Belgium; [Vrijhoef, Hubertus] Tilburg Univ, Sci Ctr Care & Welf, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Vrijhoef, Hubertus] Vrije Univ Brussel, Fac Med & Pharm, Brussels, Belgium; [Vrijhoef, Hubertus] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Vrijhoef, Hubertus] Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Singapore, Singapore; [Annemans, Lieven; Verhaeghe, Nick] Univ Ghent, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, I CHER, Ghent, Belgium; [Petrovic, Mirko] Univ Ghent, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Sect Geriatr, Dept Internal Med, Ghent, Belgium; [Vandijck, Dominique] Univ Ghent, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Ghent, Belgium",Hasselt University; Hasselt University; KU Leuven; KU Leuven; Tilburg University; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; Ghent University; Ghent University; Ghent University,"Desmedt, M (通讯作者)，Hasselt Univ, Fac Med & Life Sci, Agoralaan Bldg D, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Hasselt, Belgium.",melissa.desmedt@uhasselt.de,"Dessers, Ezra/ABH-9323-2020; Vrijhoef, Hubertus/AAR-2387-2020","Vrijhoef, Hubertus/0000-0002-5539-4671; Bergs, Jochen/0000-0001-7859-6949",Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology,Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology,The Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology provided the necessary funds for the CORTEXS (Care Organization: a Re-Thinking EXpedition in search for Sustainability) research project of which this article is a result.,,54,64,66,0,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2016,19.0,6.0,,,,,892,902,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.05.001,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DZ5VS,27712719.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385930500028,0

We also consider alternative high frequency volatility measures as well as various continuous time models using their corresponding relevant higher order moments to further analyze the properties of these estimators. Second, we derive the relative MSE efficiency of the slope estimator in the standard IS and MIDAS regressions, we provide conditions for relative efficiency and present the numerical results for different continuous time models. Third, we extend the analysis of the bias of the slope estimator in standard LS regressions with alternative realized measures of risk such as the Realized Covariance, Realized beta and the Realized Skewness when the true DGP is a MIDAS model.

However, even those who believe that assets are overpriced may stay in the market believing that they can rise even further before correcting. Abreu and Brunnermeier (2003, AB) model this idea in an environment with rational and behavioral agents, and more recently, Doblas-Madrid (2012, DM) constructs a fully rational version of the AB model. These models conceptualize a bubble as a boom that is at first justified by fundamentals, but overshoots as asymmetrically informed agents ride the bubble hoping to sell to a greater fool. A critique of these papers is that, although bubbles are finite, they can only arise in equilibrium if prices can grow at extraordinary rates indefinitely. In this paper, I articulate this critique in a simplified DM environment and show how it can be overturned by modifying investors' strategies. If the number of periods an investor plans to ride the bubble is conditional on her signal of fundamental value, one can sustain speculative bubbles in a finite model, where by construction it is impossible for prices to boom indefinitely.

However, they are rarely used in practice due to over-parameterization concerns, difficulties in ensuring identification and computational challenges. With the growing interest in multivariate time series models of high dimension, these problems with VARMAs become even more acute, accounting for the dominance of VARs in this field. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach for inference in VARMAs which surmounts these problems. It jointly ensures identification and parsimony in the context of an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. We use this approach in a macroeconomic application involving up to twelve dependent variables. We find our algorithm to work successfully and provide insights beyond those provided by VARs.

We find strong evidence of time variation in the pool's weights, reflecting the fact that the DSGE model with financial frictions produces superior forecasts in periods of financial distress but does not perform as well in tranquil periods. The dynamic pool's weights react in a timely fashion to changes in the environment, leading to real-time forecast improvements relative to other methods of density forecast combination, such as equal weights combination, Bayesian model averaging, optimal static pools, and dynamic model averaging.

J,"Gonzalez, S; Grabisch, M",,,,"Gonzalez, Stephane; Grabisch, Michel",,,Multicoalitional solutions,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Cooperative game; Core; Aspiration core; Strong Nash implementation,CORE; GAMES,"The paper proposes a new concept of solution for TU games, called multicoalitional solution, which makes sense in the context of production games, that is, where v(S) is the production or income per unit of time. By contrast to classical solutions where elements of the solution are payoff vectors, multicoalitional solutions give in addition an allocation time to each coalition, which permits to realize the payoff vector. We give two instances of such solutions, called the d-multicoalitional core and the c-multicoalitional core, and both arise as the strong Nash equilibrium of two games, where in the first utility per active unit of time is maximized, while in the second it is the utility per total unit of time. We show that the d-core (or aspiration core) of Benett, and the c-core of Guesnerie and Oddou are strongly related to the d-multicoalitional and c-multicoalitional cores, respectively, and that the latter ones can be seen as an implementation of the former ones in a noncooperative framework.

If a quantal response function satisfies C-2 continuity, monotonicity and cumulativity, the graph of QRE correspondence generically includes a unique branch that starts at the centroid of the strategy simplex and converges to a unique Nash equilibrium as noises vanish. This equilibrium is called the limiting QRE of the game. We then investigate the limiting QRE in normal form games, and analyze the effects of payoff transformations and adding/eliminating dominated strategies on equilibrium selection. We find that in two-person symmetric games, any strict Nash equilibrium can be selected as the limiting QRE by appropriately adding a single strictly dominated strategy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We define and measure management practices at approximately half of US cardiac care units using a novel survey approach. A patient's choice of a hospital is modeled as a function of the hospital's performance on publicly reported quality measures and the quality of its management. The estimates, based on a grouped conditional logit specification, reveal that higher management scores and better performance on publicly reported quality measures are positively associated with hospital choice. Management practices appear to have a direct correlation with admissions for AMIpotentially through reputational effectsand indirect association, through better performance on publicly reported measures.

As an underlying motivation, in our setup, agents want to adjust their opinions to match those of the agents of their 'in-group' and, in addition, they want to adjust their opinions to match the 'inverse' of those of the agents of their 'out-group'. Our paradigm can account for persistent disagreement in connected societies as well as bi- and multi-polarization. Outcomes depend upon network structure and the choice of deviation function modeling the mode of opposition between agents. For a particular choice of deviation function, which we call soft opposition, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for long-run polarization. We also consider social influence (who are the opinion leaders in the network?) as well as the question of wisdom in our naive learning paradigm, finding that wisdom is difficult to attain when there exist sufficiently strong negative relations between agents.

We consider three types of popular dynamics, continuous-time gradient dynamics as well as continuous- and discrete-time best-reply dynamics, and include aggregate-taking behavior as a non-strategic behavioral variant. We show that while in general games stability conditions are only sufficient for uniqueness, they are likely to be necessary as well in models with sum-aggregative or symmetric payoff functions. In particular, a unique equilibrium always verifies the stability conditions of all dynamics if strategies are equilibrium complements, and this also holds for both continuous-time dynamics if strategies are equilibrium substitutes with bounded slopes. These findings extend to the case of aggregate-taking equilibria. We further analyze the stability relations between the various dynamics, and demonstrate that the restrictive nature of the discrete dynamics originates from simultaneity of adjustments. Asynchronous decisions or heterogeneous forward thinking may stabilize the adjustment process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the observed correlation may not be causal, as both methamphetamine use and risky sexual behavior could be driven by a third factor, such as a preference for risky behavior. We estimate the effect of methamphetamine use on risky sexual behavior using monthly data on syphilis diagnoses in California and quarterly data on syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia diagnoses across all states. To circumvent possible endogeneity, we use a large exogenous supply shock in the US methamphetamine market that occurred in May 1995 and a later shock stemming from the Methamphetamine Control Act, which went into effect in October 1997. While the supply shocks had large negative effects on methamphetamine use, we find no evidence that they decreased syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia rates. Our results have broad implications for public policies designed to decrease sexually transmitted infection rates.

We examine the use of these methods in low- and middle-income countries, where infectious diseases constitute a major burden. This review is comprised of two parts: (1) a summary of dynamic transmission economic evaluations across all disease areas published between 2011 and mid-2014 and (2) an in-depth review of mosquito-borne disease studies focusing on health economic methods and reporting. Studies were identified through a systematic search of the MEDLINE database and supplemented by reference list screening. Fifty-seven studies were eligible for inclusion in the all-disease review. The most common subject disease was HIV/AIDS, followed by malaria. A diverse range of modelling methods, outcome metrics and sensitivity analyses were used, indicating little standardisation. Seventeen studies were included in the mosquito-borne disease review. With notable exceptions, most studies did not employ economic evaluation methods beyond calculating a cost-effectiveness ratio or net benefit. Many did not adhere to health care economic evaluations reporting guidelines, particularly with respect to full model reporting and uncertainty analysis. We present a summary of the state-of-the-art and offer recommendations for improved implementation and reporting of health economic methods in this crossover discipline. (c) 2016 The Authors.

Dividing the output index by the input index yields a new productivity index that can be decomposed into a measure of technical change, a measure of environmental change, and several measures of efficiency change. A problem with this new index is that it cannot be computed without estimating the production frontier. The paper shows how assumptions concerning technologies, markets and firm behaviour can be used to inform the estimation process. The focus is on the asymptotic properties of least squares estimators when the explanatory variables in the production frontier model are endogenous. In this case, the ordinary least squares estimator is usually inconsistent. However, there is one situation where it is super-consistent. A fully-modified ordinary least squares estimator is also available in this case. To illustrate the main ideas, the paper uses US state-level farm data to estimate a stochastic production frontier. The parameter estimates are then used to obtain estimates of the economically relevant components of productivity change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[O'Donnell, C.

Although government expansion of health insurance to older workers leads to direct labor supply reductions for recipients, there may be spillover effects on the labor supply of uncovered spouses. While the most basic model predicts a decrease in overall household work hours, financial incentives such as credit constraints, target income levels, and the need for own health insurance suggest that spousal labor supply might increase. In contrast, complementarities of spousal leisure would predict a decrease in labor supply for both spouses. Utilizing a mid-1990s expansion of health insurance for U.S. veterans, we provide evidence on the effects of public insurance availability on the labor supply of spouses. Using data from the Current Population Survey and Health and Retirement Study, we employ a difference-in-differences strategy to compare the labor market behavior of the wives of older male veterans and non-veterans before and after the VA health benefits expansion. Although husbands' labor supply decreases, wives' labor supply increases, suggesting that financial incentives dominate complementarities of spousal leisure. This effect is strongest for wives with lower education levels and lower levels of household wealth and those who were not previously employed full-time. These findings have implications for government programs such as Medicare and Social Security and the Affordable Care Act. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The reaction pathways lead to the formation of volatile sulfur compounds, methanethiol and dimethyldisulphide, conferring cabbage-like aromas. The development of this defect is limited at low RF concentrations. In this study, the yeast-mediated release of RF, RF degradation kinetics in model solution and white wine, and RF removal by using insoluble adjuvants were investigated. The results showed the RF release was a strain-dependent property and the fermentation rate did not affect the RF synthesis. The RF degradation followed a 1st order kinetic in both model solution and white wine in which the degradation rate was halved. Among the adjuvants tested, bentonite and active charcoal were the most effective in RF removal and higher concentrations were needed for effectively treating white wine. The selection of low RF-producing yeasts and the treatment with active charcoal could represent useful tools to avoid the white wine spoilage during the shelf-life.","[Fracassetti, Daniela; Gabrielli, Mario; Encinas, Jordi; Pellegrino, Luisa; Tirelli, Antonio] Univ Milan, Dept Food Environm & Nutr Sci, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Manara, Maria] Dal Cin Gildo SpA, Res & Dev, Concorezzo, MB, Italy",University of Milan,"Fracassetti, D (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Food Environm & Nutr Sci, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",,"Gabrielli, Mario/ISS-9083-2023; Manara, Maria/K-1277-2018","Gabrielli, Mario/0000-0002-9313-0140;",,,,,13,1,1,0,14,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,2022.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160702022,0.0,,,3,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700066,0

Exploiting longitudinal claims data and the drastic reduction of coinsurance from 30% to 10% at age 70 in Japan, we find that the elderly's demand responses are heterogeneous in ways that have not been previously reported. Outpatient services by orthopedic and eye specialties, which will continue to increase in an aging society, are particularly price responsive and account for a large share of the spending increase. Lower cost sharing increases demand for brand-name drugs but not for generics. These high price elasticities may call for different cost-sharing rules for these services. Patient health status also matters: receiving medical services appears more discretionary for the healthy than the sick in the outpatient setting. Finally, we found no evidence that additional medical spending improved short-term health outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of the present work was to study the effect of captan on the viability and fermentative behavior of S. cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae (BY4741) on exponential phase was treated with captan (0 to 40 mu M) for different periods, and their cell viability analyzed. Cell membrane integrity, thiols concentration, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was determined. The fermentation experiments were conducted in synthetic must using wine yeast strain Y904. The results showed that under aerobic conditions, 20 mu M of captan reduce 90% of yeast viability in 6 hours. Captan treated cells exhibited alteration of membrane integrity, reduction of thiol compounds and increase in intracellular ROS concentration, suggesting a necrotic and pro-oxidant activity of the fungicide. Fermentative experiments showed that concentrations above 2.5 mu M captan completely inhibited fermentation, while a dose dependent fermentation delay associated with the reduction of yeast viability was detected in sub-inhibitory concentrations. Petit mutants increase was also observed. In conclusion, the captan induces yeast necrotic cell death on both aerobic and anaerobic conditions causing fermentation delay and/or sucking fermentations.","[Scariot, Fernando J.; Jahn, Luciane M.; Delamare, Ana Paula L.; Echeverrigaray, Sergio] Univ Caxias do Sul, Inst Biotecnol, BR-95070650 Caxias Do Sul, Brazil",Universidade de Caxias do Sul,"Scariot, FJ (通讯作者)，Univ Caxias do Sul, Inst Biotecnol, BR-95070650 Caxias Do Sul, Brazil.",,"Echeverrigaray, Sergio/CAI-2867-2022; Longaray Delamare, Ana Paula/AGZ-4312-2022; Delamare, Ana Paula Longaray/AHE-9445-2022; Echeverrigaray, Sergio/CAF-7909-2022","Delamare, Ana Paula Longaray/0000-0001-9638-5483; Scariot, Fernando/0000-0003-0848-2772",,,,,21,5,5,0,4,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,2027.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160702027,0.0,,,4,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700071,0

Four wine tourist types were identified by using cluster analysis: 1) Wine and Rheingau lovers, who have a high interest in wine and visit the region several times a year; 2) wine-oriented tourists, who use the culinary offerings of the Rheingau with pleasure but do not come to the region very often; 3) new visitors, who come to the region mainly because of the nature and history; and 4) foreign tourists, who have less knowledge about the Rheingau and buy less wine in the region. With the help of the purchasing power calculation, we can state that approximately 18 % of the total production is purchased directly in the region by tourists.","[Szolnoki, Gergely] Geisenheim Univ, Inst Betriebswirtschaft & Marktforsch, Von Lade Str 1, D-65366 Geisenheim, Germany",,"Szolnoki, G (通讯作者)，Geisenheim Univ, Inst Betriebswirtschaft & Marktforsch, Von Lade Str 1, D-65366 Geisenheim, Germany.",,"Szolnoki, Gergely/AAA-8381-2022","Szolnoki, Gergely/0000-0002-7791-7218",,,,,23,2,2,0,5,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,3023.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160703023,0.0,,,4,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700101,0

I derive the conditions under which an improvement in health care technology leads to an increase/decrease in health care consumption. In particular, I show how the direction of the effect depends on the relationship between the constant elasticity of substitution parameters of the utility and health production functions. I find that, under the constancy assumption, the ratio of the two elasticity of substitution parameters determines the direction of a technological change on health care demand. On the other hand, the technology share parameter in the health production function contributes to the size but not to the direction of the technological effect. I finally explore how the ratio of the elasticity of substitution parameters work in measurement and practice and discuss how future research may use the theoretical insight provided here.

In contrast to previous studies on the impact of pharmaceutical patents in India, we observe, and estimate the welfare effects accruing from differential pricing and voluntary licensing strategies of patent-holding innovator firms. Three novel molecules belonging to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor class of OADs have been launched in India by the patent holders, at lower prices than those prevailing in the developed countries. Using aggregate market transaction data, we structurally estimate demand and supply and use the parameter estimates in our model to simulate consumer welfare under various counterfactual scenarios. Our results suggest that the introduction of DPP-4 inhibitors generated a consumer surplus gain of around 7.6 cents per day for a typical DPP-4 inhibitor user under the existing differential pricing and voluntary licensing strategies. If the innovators decide to price at developed-country levels, this surplus is eliminated almost entirely. The issuance of compulsory licensing does not always improve consumer welfare because if innovators defer or delay the introduction of new drugs in response, the loss in consumer welfare could be substantial.

HITECH provides up to $27 billion to promote adoption and appropriate use of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) by hospitals. We measure the extent to which HITECH incentive payments spurred EMR adoption by independent hospitals. Adoption rates for all independent hospitals grew from 48 percent in 2008 to 77 percent by 2011. Absent HITECH incentives, we estimate that the adoption rate would have instead been 67 percent in 2011. When we consider that HITECH funds were available for all hospitals and not just marginal adopters, we estimate that the cost of generating an additional adoption was $48 million.

As a consequence, we derive from our computations, the likelihood of two paradoxes of committee elections, the Leaving Member Paradox (Staring, 1986) and the Prior Successor Paradox which occur when an elected candidate steps down from a two-member committee.

A sufficient condition is obtained for the existence and uniqueness of a strictly stationary and ergodic solution to the first-order MTDAR model. We study the Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimator (QMLE) of the MTDAR model. The estimated thresholds are shown to be n-consistent, asymptotically independent, and to converge weakly to the smallest minimizer of a two-sided compound Poisson process. The remaining parameters are root n-consistent and asymptotically multivariate normal. In particular, these results apply to the multiple threshold ARCH model, with or without AR part, and to the multiple threshold AR models with ARCH errors. A score-based test is also presented to determine the number of thresholds in MTDAR models. The limiting distribution is shown to be distribution-free and is easy to implement in practice. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of the QMLE and our score-based test in finite samples. The results are illustrated with an application to the quarterly US real GNP data over the period 1947-2013. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Teachers paid about 17 percent of the cost of individual health insurance and about 46 percent of the cost of their family members' plans through premium contributions, but we find no evidence that teachers' salaries respond to changes in insurance costs. Consistent with a higher willingness to pay for insurance, we find that premium contributions are higher in districts that employ a higher-tenured workforce. We find no evidence that school districts respond to higher health insurance costs by reducing the number of teachers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Three data sets were used: European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure Registry, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Health System Characteristics Survey, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Health Statistics 2013. Patient and country variables were examined by multilevel, multiple logistic regression. The study population consisted of ambulatory patients with chronic HF and reduced ejection fraction. Inappropriateness of prescription of pharmacological treatments was defined as patients not prescribed at least one of the two recommended treatments (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers and beta-blockers) or treated with both medications but at suboptimal dosage and in absence of documented contraindication/intolerance. Results: Of 4605 patients, 1097 (23.8%) received inappropriate drug prescriptions with a large variation within and across countries, with 18.5% of the total variability accounted for by between-country health structure characteristics. Patient-level characteristics such as having mitral regurgitation (odds ratio 1.4; 95% confidence interval 1.1-1.7) was significantly associated with inappropriate prescription of recommended drugs, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (odds ratio 0.7; 95% confidence interval 0.5-0.9) was associated with more appropriate prescriptions. Among the country-level variables, incentives or obligation to comply with guidelines increased the probability of prescription appropriateness. Conclusions: Combining clinical variables with health system characteristics is a promising exercise to explain the appropriateness of recommended drug prescriptions. Such an understanding can help decision makers to design more effective policies to improve adherence to guidelines, improve health care outcomes, and potentially reduce costs.","[Maggioni, Aldo P.; Urso, Renato] ANMCO Res Ctr, Via La Marmora 34, I-50121 Florence, Italy; [Maggioni, Aldo P.] European Soc Cardiol, EORP Dept, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Van Gool, Kees; Biondi, Nelly; Klazinga, Niek] Directorate Employment Labour & Social Affairs, Hlth Div, OECD, Paris, France; [Van Gool, Kees] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Urso, Renato] Univ Siena, Dept Med Surg & Neurosci, Pharmacol Unit G Segre, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Klazinga, Niek] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Dept Social Med, NL-1105 AZ Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Ferrari, Roberto] Azienda Osped Univ Ferrara, Osped Cona, Cona, FE, Italy; [Ferrari, Roberto; Tavazzi, Luigi] Maria Cecilia Hosp, GVM Care & Res ES Hlth Sci Fdn, Cotignola, Italy; [Maniadakis, Nikolaos] Natl Sch Pub Hlth, Hlth Serv Org & Management, Athens, Greece",Associazione Nazionale Medici Cardiologi Ospedalieri (ANMCO); Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); University of Technology Sydney; University of Siena; University of Amsterdam; Academic Medical Center Amsterdam; University of Ferrara; Arcispedale Sant'Anna; Maria Cecilia Hospital,"Maggioni, AP (通讯作者)，ANMCO Res Ctr, Via La Marmora 34, I-50121 Florence, Italy.",centrostudi@anmco.it,"FERRARI, ROBERTO/ABD-5169-2020; Tavazzi, Luigi/ABD-5119-2020; van Gool, Kees/JXW-8446-2024; Maggioni, Aldo Pietro/AAL-5334-2020","Tavazzi, Luigi/0000-0003-0336-8356; van Gool, Kees/0000-0002-1424-9304; Maggioni, Aldo Pietro/0000-0003-2764-6779; Ferrari, Roberto/0000-0003-2046-9175; TAVAZZI, LUIGI/0000-0003-4448-5209",ESC; Abbot Vascular; Bayer Pharma; BMS/Pfizer; Boehringer Ingelheim International; Daiichi Sankyo Europe; Menarini International; Novartis Pharma; Laboratoires Servier; Amgen; Boston Scientific International; MSD/Merck Co; Sanofi-Aventis Group,ESC; Abbot Vascular(Abbott Laboratories); Bayer Pharma; BMS/Pfizer(Pfizer); Boehringer Ingelheim International(Boehringer Ingelheim); Daiichi Sankyo Europe(Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited); Menarini International(Menarini Group); Novartis Pharma; Laboratoires Servier; Amgen(Amgen); Boston Scientific International; MSD/Merck Co; Sanofi-Aventis Group(Sanofi-Aventis),"The Heart Failure Long-Term Registry was funded by the ESC.

England introduced a case payment mechanism from 2003/4, while Scotland continued to pay through global budgets. We investigate the impact this change had on activity for Hip Replacement. We examine the financial reimbursement attached to uncemented Hip Replacement in England, which has been more generous than for its cemented counterpart, although clinical guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommends the later. In Scotland this financial differential does not exist. We use a difference-in-difference estimator, using Scotland as a control, to test whether the change in reimbursement across the two countries had an influence on treatment. Our results indicate that financial incentives are directly linked to the faster uptake of the more expensive, uncemented Hip Replacement in England, which ran against the clinical guidance.

Methods: A literature review was conducted to identify published clinical studies and ongoing/recently completed registered trials in chronic pain. Inclusion criteria were interventional study, chronic pain in adults, and pain measured within the primary end point. Results: Of 1256 PubMed citations and 3006 clinical trial registry entries, 356 reported large clinical studies in pain populations (e.g., malignant, neuropathic, functional, and musculoskeletal). Studies were designed for superiority in 28% of PubMed citations and 8% of registry entries. The primary end points of most studies were single-dimension pain instruments, such as the numerical rating scale (n = 131) and the visual analogue scale (n = 69). In cases in which multidimensional pain end points were used, this was most commonly the Brief Pain Inventory (n = 37). Payer-relevant end points were typically limited to secondary end points, and were limited and/or reported inconsistently in published studies and ongoing/recently completed studies: preference-weighted quality of life (36% and 42%), resource use (2% and 8%), physical function (28% and 39%), and psychological function (25% and 24%). Conclusions: Most pain trials were not designed to show superiority to an active comparator, and they used single-dimension pain scales as their primary end point in combination with a broader selection of secondary end points. The inclusion of payer-relevant end points among clinical trials was inconsistent.","[Rycroft, Catherine E.; Akehurst, Ron] BresMed, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Hirst, Matthew; Dunlop, William C.

In these models, all observed variables depend on a common and unobserved component, but are mutually independent conditional on it. Such a structure applies for instance to measurement error, matching and auction models. Traditional approaches rely on parametric assumptions or strong functional restrictions. We show that these models are actually identified nonparametrically if the supports of the observed variables move with the value of the unobserved component. Moreover, this assumption is testable nonparametrically, using tools from extreme value theory. We develop an appropriate test and derive its asymptotic properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While the optimality problem is formally infinite dimensional, under realistic assumptions it becomes finite dimensional. We provide conditions and examples to show that when the borrower is more optimistic than the bank, there may be only one verification region. A simple example, based on Bernanke and Gertler (1989), shows that as the borrower becomes more optimistic the financial accelerator (Bernanke et al., 1999) becomes more potent.

A key restriction of the existing literature is the assumption that the discontinuity point is known, which does not always hold in practice. This paper extends the applicability of the regression discontinuity design by allowing for an unknown discontinuity point. First, we construct a unified test statistic to check whether there are selection or treatment effects. Our tests are shown to be consistent, and local powers are derived. Also, a bootstrap method is proposed to obtain critical values. Second, we estimate the treatment effect by first estimating the nuisance discontinuity point. It is shown that estimating the discontinuity point does not affect the efficiency of the treatment effect estimator. Simulation studies illustrate the usefulness of our procedures in finite samples.

The classical literature of semiparametric efficient estimation rests on the fact that the maximum likelihood estimator is efficient in any parametric submodel for a large class of loss functions. However, in threshold regression, the maximum likelihood estimator is not efficient, while the Bayes estimators are efficient and different loss functions induce different efficient estimators. For an additively separable loss function that separates the efficiency problem of the threshold point from that of other parameters, we show that the semiparametric and parametric efficiency risk bounds coincide. Then we design a semiparametric empirical Bayes estimator to achieve this bound. In consequence, the threshold point can be adaptively estimated even under conditional moment restrictions. We also provide a valid confidence interval called the nonparametric posterior interval for the threshold point. Simulation studies show that the semiparametric empirical Bayes approach is substantially better than existing methods. To illustrate our procedure in practice, we apply it to an economic growth model for detecting different growth patterns. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Most empirical dynamic discrete choice models identify the theoretical time interval in the behavioral model with that observed in the data set. However, many empirical data sets are time aggregated. In this paper, we show that when the time interval in the behavioral theory model differs from that in the observed data, difficulties with nonparametric identification and specification arise.

The longitudinal nature of the US Health and Retirement Study allows us to gauge the plausibility of two competing explanations for this difference: a contextual effect of self-employment on health (benefit effect), or a health-related selection of individuals into self-employment (barrier effect). Our main finding is that the selection of comparatively healthier individuals into self-employment accounts for the positive cross-sectional difference. The results rule out a positive contextual effect of self-employment on health, and we present tentative evidence that, if anything, engaging in self-employment is bad for one's health. Given the importance of the self-employed in the economy, these findings contribute to our understanding of the vitality of the labor force.

Currently, no consensus exists on the measurement and valuation of productivity losses. Objective: We aimed to develop a standardized instrument for measuring and valuing productivity losses. Methods: A group of researchers with extensive experience in measuring and valuing productivity losses designed an instrument suitable for self-completion, building on preknowledge and evidence on validity. The instrument was designed to cover all domains of productivity losses, thus allowing quantification and valuation of all productivity losses. A feasibility study was performed to check the questionnaire's consistency and intelligibility. Results: The iMTA Productivity Cost Questionnaire (iPCQ) includes three modules measuring productivity losses of paid work due to 1) absenteeism and 2) presenteeism and productivity losses related to 3) unpaid work. Questions for measuring absenteeism and presenteeism were derived from existing validated questionnaires. Because validated measures of losses of unpaid work are scarce, the questions of this module were newly developed. To enhance the instrument's feasibility, simple language was used The feasibility study included 195 respondents (response rate 80%) older than 18 years. Seven percent (n = 13) identified problems while filling in the iPCQ including problems with the questionnaire's instructions and routing (n = 6) and wording (n = 2). Five respondents experienced difficulties in estimating the time that would be needed for other people to make up for lost unpaid work. Conclusions: Most modules of the iPCQ are based on validated questions derived from previously available instruments. The instrument is understandable for most of the general public.","[Bouwmans, Clazien; Krol, Marieke; Severens, Hans; Koopmanschap, Marc; Hakkaart-van Roijen, Leona] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assesment, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Bouwmans, Clazien; Krol, Marieke; Brouwer, Werner; Hakkaart-van Roijen, Leona] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Bouwmans, C (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assesment, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",bouwmans@bmg.eur.nl,"Brouwer, Werner/HSB-9241-2023; Krol, Marieke/HGA-7950-2022","Brouwer, Werner/0000-0002-0476-8397; Krol, Marieke/0000-0002-6153-0828; Hakkaart-van Roijen, Leona/0000-0003-0635-7388",,,,,48,268,272,1,35,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2015,18.0,6.0,,,,,753,758,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.05.009,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CU4EN,26409601.0,hybrid,Y,N,2024-03-09,WOS:000363479800003,0

Our nonparametric identification result is global, and allows for endogenous regressors. In particular, we show that a completeness assumption combined with conditional independence with respect to one of the regressors suffices for the model to be nonparametrically identified. The identification result is also constructive in the sense that it yields explicit expressions of the functions of interest. We show how natural estimators can be developed from these expressions, and analyze their theoretical properties. Importantly, it is demonstrated that different normalizations of the model lead to different asymptotic properties of the estimators with one normalization in particular resulting in an estimator for the unknown transformation function that converges at a parametric rate. A test for whether a candidate regressor satisfies the conditional independence assumption required for identification is developed. A Monte Carlo experiment illustrates the performance of our method in the context of a duration model with endogenous regressors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Since 1990, this reform has introduced conditions self-employed GPs must fulfil to be permitted to bill freely. We exploit 2005 and 2008 public health insurance administrative data on GP activity and fees. We use fuzzy regression discontinuity techniques to estimate local causal impacts for GPs who established practices in 1990 and who were constrained by the new regulation to charge regulated prices (compliers). We find that those GPs practices to income effects. In the regulated fee regime, GPs face prices lower by 42% and provide 50% more care than they would do in the unregulated fee regime. Male care provision increasing reaction is larger than the female one, which results in a higher male labour income in the regulated fee regime than with unregulated fees, whereas it is the opposite for women. With regulated fees, GPs limit side-salaried activities, use more lump-sum payment schemes and occupy more often gatekeeper positions.

A revising rule-i.e. the product rule-is introduced in pure epistemic terms in order to be applied to all structures and message. Since any syntactic structure can be expressed through various semantic ones, an equivalence principle is given by use of the semantic notion of bisimilarity. Thereafter, a robustness result proves that, for a given prior structure, bisimilar messages yield bisimilar posterior structures (Theorem 1). In syntax, the beliefs revised thanks to the product rule are then shown to be unique (Theorem 2).

Inclusion Criteria Studies performed in populations at high risk of LTBI and subsequent reactivation that used the QALY as an effectiveness measure were included. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Quality was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist. Data extracted included tuberculin skin test (TST) and/or interferongamma release assay (IGRA) use, economic, screening, treatment, health state, and epidemiologic parameters. Data were summarized in regard to consistency in model parameters and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), with costs adjusted to 2013 US dollars. Results Of 415 studies identified, ultimately eight studies were included in the review. Most took a societal perspective (n = 4), used lifetime time horizons (n = 6), and used Markov models (n = 8). Screening of adult immigrants was found to be cost effective with a TST in one study, but moderately cost effective with an IGRA in another study; screening immigrants arriving more than 5 years prior with an IGRA was moderately cost effective until 44 years of age (n = 1). Screening HIV-positive patients was highly cost effective with a TST (n = 1) and moderately cost effective with an IGRA (n = 1). Screening in those with renal diseases (n = 2) and diabetes (n = 1) was not cost effective. Limitations Very few studies used the QALY as their effectiveness measure. Parameter and study design inconsistencies limit the comparability of studies. Conclusions With validity issues in terms of parameters and assumptions, any conclusion should be interpreted with caution. Despite this, some cautionary recommendations emerged: screening HIV patients with a TST is highly cost effective, while screening adult immigrants with an IGRA is moderately cost effective.","[Campbell, Jonathon R.; Sasitharan, Thenuga; Marra, Fawziah] Univ British Columbia, 2405 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Marra, F (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, 2405 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.",fawziah@mail.ubc.ca,"Campbell, Jonathon/AAN-4252-2021","Campbell, Jonathon/0000-0003-2341-2166",,,,,54,21,25,1,7,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these techniques in high risk abdominal surgery from the perspective of the French public health insurance fund. Methods: An analytical decision model was constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness of ED, APPWA, and CCA. Effectiveness data were defined from meta analyses of randomized clinical trials. The clinical end points were avoidance of hospital mortality and avoidance of major complications. Hospital costs were estimated by the cost of corresponding diagnosis-related groups. Results: Both goal-directed therapy strategies evaluated were more effective and less costly than CCA. Perioperative mortality and the rate of major complications were reduced by the use of ED and APPWA. Cost reduction was mainly due to the decrease in the rate of major complications. APPWA was dominant compared with ED in 71.6% and 27.6% and dominated in 23.8% and 20.8% of the cases when the end point considered was major complications avoided and death avoided, respectively. Regarding cost per death avoided, APPWA was more likely to be cost-effective than ED in a wide range of willingness to pay. Conclusions: Cardiac output monitoring during high-risk abdominal surgery is cost-effective and is associated with a reduced rate of hospital mortality and major complications, whatever the device used. The two devices evaluated had negligible costs compared with the observed reduction in hospital costs. Our comparative studies suggest a larger effect with APP WA that needs to be confirmed by further studies.

In this framework, a large number of forecasting models are available, varying by the choice of factors and the number of lags. We investigate forecast combination across models using weights that minimize the Mallows and the leave-h-out cross validation criteria. The unobserved factor regressors are estimated by principle components of a large panel with N predictors over T periods. With these generated regressors, we show that the Mallows and leave-h-out cross validation criteria are asymptotically unbiased estimators of the one-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead mean squared forecast errors, respectively, provided that N, T -> infinity. (However, the paper does not establish any optimality properties for the methods.) In contrast to well-known results in the literature, this result suggests that the generated-regressor issue can be ignored for forecast combination, without restrictions on the relation between N and T. Simulations show that the Mallows model averaging and leave-h-out cross-validation averaging methods yield lower mean squared forecast errors than alternative model selection and averaging methods such as AIC, BIC, cross validation, and Bayesian model averaging. We apply the proposed methods to the US macroeconomic data set in Stock and Watson (2012) and find that they compare favorably to many popular shrinkage-type forecasting methods.

I detail the sources of bias of both estimators in a model of earnings dynamics and entry into a Job Training Program (JTP) and I assess their performances using Monte Carlo simulations of the model calibrated with realistic parameter values. I find that Matching generally underestimates the average causal effect of the program and gets closer to the true effect when conditioning on an increasing number of pre-treatment outcomes. When selection bias is symmetric around the treatment date, DID is consistent when implemented symmetrically-i.e. comparing outcomes observed the same number of periods before and after the treatment date. When selection bias is not symmetric, Monte Carlo simulations show that Symmetric DID still performs better than Matching, especially in the middle of the life-cycle. These results are consistent with estimates of the bias of Matching and DID from randomly assigned JTPs. Some of the virtues of Symmetric DID extend to programs other than JTPs allocated according to a cutoff eligibility rule. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Economic and spillover consequences of investments in the treatment of tuberculosis are unclear, particularly when steep gradients in the disease and response are linked by population movements, such as that between Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Australian cross border region. Objective: to undertake an economic evaluation of Australian support for the expansion of basic Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course in the PNG border area of the South Fly from the current level of 14% coverage. Methods: Both cost utility analysis and cost-benefit analysis were applied to models that allow for population movement across regions with different characteristics of tuberculosis burden, transmission, and access to treatment. Cost benefit data were drawn primarily from estimates published by the World Health Organization, and disease transmission data were drawn from a previously published model. Results: Investing $16 million to increase basic Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course coverage in the South Fly generates a net present value of roughly $74 million for Australia (discounted 2005 dollars). The cost per disabilityadjusted life-year averted and quality-adjusted life-year saved for PNG is $7 and $4.6, respectively. Conclusions: Where regions with major disparities in tuberculosis burden and health system resourcing are connected through population movements, investments in tuberculosis control are of mutual benefit, resulting in net health and economic gains on both sides of the border. These findings are likely to inform the case for appropriate investment in tuberculosis control globally.","[Hoa Thi Minh Nguyen; Kompas, Tom] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Hickson, Roslyn I.] Univ Newcastle, Sch Math & Phys Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Hickson, Roslyn I.] IBM Res Australia, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Mercer, Geoffry N.; Lokuge, Kamalini M.] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Ctr Epidemiol & Populat Hlth, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University; University of Newcastle; Australian National University,"Kompas, T (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, JG Crawford Bldg 132 Lennox Crossing, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",torn.kompas@anu.edu.au,"Hickson, R.

For a general class of preferences, we characterize the optimal contract in such a setting using standard Grossman and Hart (1983) techniques. Our analysis shows that the incentive compatibility constraint is not necessarily binding at the optimal solution. As a result, the solution to the relaxed problem (without the incentive compatibility constraint) provides a variable pay, which contrasts with the standard results for the separable utility case. These observations result from the fact that in our setting the principal trade-offs incentives and insurance, but also reduction of self control cost for the agent. Our results shed some light on the justification of randomized contracts (see Holmstrom, 1979), the literature on behavioral contracts, but also show that in the presence of strong self-control problems moral hazard cost can be mitigated.

This study examines three price avoidance strategies among adult male smokers in Thailand: trading down to a lower-priced brand, buying individual sticks of cigarettes instead of packs, and substituting roll-your-own tobacco for factory-manufactured cigarettes. Using two panels of microlevel data from the International Tobacco Control Southeast Asia Study, collected in 2005 and 2006, we estimate the effects of a substantial excise tax increase implemented throughout Thailand in December 2005. We present estimates of the marginal effects and price elasticities for each of five consumer behaviors. We find that, controlling for baseline smoking characteristics, sociodemographics, and policy variables, quitting is highly sensitive to changes in cigarette prices, but so are brand choice, stick-buying, and use of roll-your-own tobacco. Neglecting such strategic responses leads to overestimates of a sin tax's health impact, and neglecting product substitution distorts estimates of the price elasticity of cigarette demand. We discuss the implications for consumer welfare and several policies that mitigate the adverse impact of consumer responses.

Specifically, historical and important from a cultural perspective places are being severely affected by the latest socioeconomic evolutions and consist the first victims of these. Historically, visitor attraction management was neglected but during the last years it has emerged as an essential and vital means of survival for places, sometimes even countries. The attractions sector is vital to the success of the Greek tourism industry. However, attraction managers today face a wide range of challenges, opportunities and threats, that will determine the future success of the sector. For example, for attractions which successfully embrace new technologies-such as Virtual Reality and the Internet-these technologies are an opportunity to achieve competitive advantage. Additionally, there is a need for the sector to become more cohesive and speak with one voice, so it can have greater influence on the government policy-making process and resulting legislation affecting the industry. Moreover, Greek attraction managers can learn a lot from successful foreign practices: from design and marketing, to catering and providing for disabled visitors. Aim and main focus of this article lies on the opportunities that existing socioeconomic conditions have created by utilising a diverse way of thinking that could lead to the light at the end of the tunnel. Our study will explore the different strategies followed by Buckingham Palace and the Museum of Acropolis and how these paths led them to capitalise as well as drive them to success despite of the crisis. From a methodological approach, this study will utilise interviews and questionnaires with professionals who occupy themselves with these strategies as well as utilising all existing theoretical background on the subject. Finally, within Greece, the government needs to take action to create a more level playing field for attraction operators. Subsidies to major national museums and huge National Lottery grants for new projects are probably 'unfair' competition for most small attractions.","[Aspridis, G.; Sdrolias, L.; Grigoriou, I.] Technol Univ Thessaly, Dept Business Adm, Larisa 41110, Greece; [Kimeris, Th.] Acad Studii Econ Bucuresti, Dept Econ, Bucharest, Romania; [Kyriakou, D.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; University of Liverpool,"Kyriakou, D (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England.",aspridis@teilar.gr; lsdrolias@teilar.gr; propobos@propobos.gr; dimk21@gmail.com,"ASPRIDIS, GEORGE/AAK-2062-2021","ASPRIDIS, GEORGE/0000-0001-7606-3831",,,,,59,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-15859-4; 978-3-319-15858-7,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,329,347,,10.1007/978-3-319-15859-4_28,0.0,,,19,"Business; Cultural Studies; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Cultural Studies; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BF1CF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380358000027,0

The average production of biogas from the Jerusalem artichoke silage was 0.437 m(3) . kg(-1), the average concentration of methane was 53.00%. To compare the quantity and quality of biogas from the Jerusalem artichoke, the Nation-wide Reference Laboratory of Biogas Transformations at Mendel University has carried out anaerobic fermentation tests.","[Sotnar, Martin; Vitez, Tomas] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agr Food & Environm Technol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Sotnar, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agr Food & Environm Technol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",martin.sotnar@mendelu.cz,"Šotnar, Martin/K-7783-2018; Vítěz, Tomáš/AAF-3010-2019; Koutny, Tomas/K-9738-2018","Vítěz, Tomáš/0000-0003-4442-4481; Koutny, Tomas/0000-0002-6956-2947",,,,,7,2,1,0,2,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,534,538,,,,,,5,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100101,0

Objectives: To update these values using data from 2011, stratified by age and sex. Methods: This study used data from two sources the 2011 Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS) and the 2011 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Both are nationally representative surveys of the US noninstitutionalized civilian population. The MEPS was used to calculate four HRQOL scores: categorical self-rated health, mental and physical component summaries from the short form-12 items (SF-12) health survey, and the health state short form-6 dimensions (SF-6D). We also estimated Quality of Well-Being Scale scores from the NHIS. We reported means and quartiles for all continuous scores, stratified by decade of age and sex. Results: There were 23,906 eligible subjects in the 2011 MEPS and 32,242 eligible subjects in the 2011 NHIS. All age and sex categories had instrument completion rates above 84%. Females reported lower mean scores than did males across all ages and instruments. In general, those in older age groups reported lower scores than did those in younger age groups, with the exception of the mental component summary scores from the SF-12 health survey. When compared with previous reports, these new values were generally lower than those in previous reports but rarely reached minimally important difference criteria. Conclusions: This report updates US nationally representative age-and sex-stratified estimates for five HRQOL scores using data from 2011. These values are important for use in both generalized comparisons of health status and in cost-effectiveness analyses.","[Hanmer, Janel] Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Div Gen Internal Med, 230 McKee Pl,Suite 600, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Kaplan, Robert M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, UCLA Dept Hlth Serv, Los Angeles, CA USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Hanmer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Med Ctr, Div Gen Internal Med, 230 McKee Pl,Suite 600, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",hanmerjz@upmc.edu,"KAPLAN, Robert/AAK-7342-2021",,National Institutes of Health [KL2 TR000146]; National Institute on Aging [R03 AG048855],National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"This study was supported in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (grant no.

The University of Birmingham and Brunel University, acting as a consortium, were commissioned to act as the EAC, independently appraising the submission. This article is an overview of the original evidence submitted, the EAC's findings and the final NICE guidance. Very little comparative evidence was submitted to demonstrate the effectiveness of Parafricta Bootees or Undergarments. The sponsor submitted a simple cost analysis to estimate the costs of using Parafricta in addition to current practice-in comparison with current practice alone-in hospital and community settings separately. The analysis took a National Health Service (NHS) perspective. The basis of the analysis was a previously published comparative study, which showed no statistical difference in average lengths of stay between patients who wore Parafricta Undergarments and Bootees, and those who did not. The economic model incorporated the costs of Parafricta but assumed shorter lengths of stay with Parafricta. The sponsor concluded that Parafricta was cost saving relative to the comparators. The EAC made amendments to the sponsor's analysis to correct for errors and to reflect alternative assumptions. Parafricta remained cost saving in most analyses, and the savings per prevalent case ranged from 757 pound in the hospital model to 3455 pound in the community model. All analyses were severely limited by the available data on effectiveness-in particular, a lack of good-quality comparative studies.","[Meads, Catherine; Glover, Matthew; Pokhrel, Subhash] Brunel Univ, HERG, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Dimmock, Paul] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence NICE, MTEP, Manchester, Lancs, England",Brunel University; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence,"Meads, C (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, HERG, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",catherine.meads@brunel.ac.uk,"Glover, Matthew/ABG-3969-2021; Pokhrel, Subhash/AAO-8648-2020; Dimmock, Paul/KCK-8972-2024","Glover, Matthew/0000-0001-9454-2668; Meads, Catherine/0000-0002-2368-0665",National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme (MTEP),National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme (MTEP),"The Birmingham and Brunel Consortium is funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme (MTEP) to act as an External Assessment Centre (EAC) for MTEP.

We apply a decomposition method to unravel the contributions of income growth, income inequality and differential income mobility across socio-demographic groups to changes in health disparities by income in Spain using longitudinal data from the Survey of Income and Living Conditions for the period 2004-2012. We find a modest rise in health inequality by income in Spain in the 5 years of economic growth prior to the start of the crisis in 2008, but a sharp fall after 2008. The drop mainly derives from the fact that loss of employment and earnings has disproportionately affected the incomes of the younger and healthier groups rather than the (mainly stable pension) incomes of the groups over 65 years. This suggests that unequal distribution of income protection by age may reduce health inequality in the short run after an economic recession.

NEW EVIDENCE FROM THE HOUSING BOOM,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,health; wealth; housing wealth; house prices,PRICES; INCOME; PANEL; CONSUMPTION; MORTALITY; SLEEP,"We exploit large exogenous changes in housing wealth to examine the impact of wealth gains and losses on individual health. In UK household, panel data house price increases, which endow owners with greater wealth, lower the likelihood of home owners exhibiting a range of non-chronic health conditions and improve their self-assessed health with no effect on their psychological health. These effects are not transitory and persist over a 10-year period. Using a range of fixed effects models, we provide robust evidence that these results are not biased by reverse causality or omitted factors. For owners' wealth gains affect labour supply and leisure choices indicating that house price increases allow individuals to reduce intensity of work with commensurate health benefits.

The econometric problem here is to estimate and perform inference on a finite-dimensional parameter. To handle the high dimensionality, we must systematically choose a set of informative moments; in other words, delete the uninformative ones. In nonlinear models, a consistent estimator is a prerequisite for moment selection. We develop in this paper a novel two-step procedure. The first step achieves consistency in high-dimensional asymptotics by relaxing the moment constraints of empirical likelihood. Given the consistent estimator, in the second step we propose a computationally efficient algorithm to select the informative moments from a vast number of candidate combinations, and then use these moments to correct the bias of the first-step estimator. We show that the resulting second step estimator is root n-asymptotic normal, and achieves the lowest variance under a sparsity condition. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first, asymptotically normally distributed estimator in such an environment. The new estimator is shown to have favorable finite sample properties in simulations, and it is applied to estimate an international trade model with massive Chinese datasets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This model is called a unified GARCH-Ito model. We adopt realized volatility estimators based on high frequency financial data and the quasi-likelihood function for the low-frequency GARCH structure to develop parameter estimation methods for the combined high-frequency and low-frequency data. We establish asymptotic theory for the proposed estimators and conduct a simulation study to check finite sample performances of the estimators. We apply the proposed estimation approach to Bank of America stock price data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Although Food and Drug Administration's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) have established patient-engagement initiatives, CDRH has proposed guidelines for considering quantitative data on patients' benefit-risk perspectives, while CDER has focused on a more qualitative approach. We summarize two significant studies that were developed in collaboration and consultation with CDER and CDRH. CDER encouraged a patient advocacy group to propose draft guidance on engaging patient and caregiver stakeholders in regulatory decision making for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. CDRH sponsored a discrete-choice experiment case study to quantify obese respondents' perspectives on meaningful benefits. CDRH and CDER issued draft guidance in May and June 2015, respectively, on including patient-preference data in regulatory submissions. Both organizations face challenges. CDER is working on integrating qualitative data into existing evidence-based review processes and is exploring options for therapeutic areas not included on a priority list. CDRH has adopted an approach that requires patient-preference data to satisfy standards of valid scientific evidence. Although that strategy could facilitate integrating patient perspectives directly with clinical data on benefits and harms, generating such data requires building capacity.","[Johnson, F.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 408) aged 21 to 70 years who presented for routine visits in the diabetes clinic at a university medical center in Beer-Sheva, Israel. The authors used validated questionnaires to estimate adherence, risk preferences, motivation, self-efficacy, impulsivity, perceptions about the disease and the interpersonal process of care, and demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, in addition to retrieving data from computerized patient medical records of clinical indicators of disease severity. Multivariable linear and ordered-logit models examined predictors of adherence to each self-care behavior. Results: Multivariable analyses revealed that, compared with others, risk-seeking patients reported lower general adherence (beta = -0.32; P <= 0.05), and specifically, lower adherence to healthful eating plan (beta = 0.48; P <= 0.1), consumption of low-fat food (beta = 0.47; P < 0.1), exercise (beta = 0.73; P < 0.05), blood glucose monitoring (beta = 0.69; P < 0.05), and foot care (beta = 0.36; P < 0.1). Risk-seeking patients did not report lower consumption of fruits and vegetables (beta = 0.19; P > 0.1). Because 96% of the study population reported optimal adherence to medication, determinants of this behavior could not be analyzed. Conclusions: Risk preference is associated with adherence to self-care behaviors. Identifying risk seekers may enable practitioners to target these patients with tailored strategies to improve adherence, thus more efficiently allocating scarce health care resources.","[Simon-Tuval, Tzahit] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Guilford Glazer Fac Business & Management, Dept Hlth Syst Management, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Simon-Tuval, Tzahit; Harman-Boehm, Ilana] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Fac Hlth Sci, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Shmueli, Amir] Braun Hebrew Univ, Hadassah Sch Publ Hlth, Jerusalem, Israel; [Harman-Boehm, Ilana] Soroka Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med C, Diabet Clin, Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University; Soroka Medical Center,"Simon-Tuval, T (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Guilford Glazer Fac Business & Management, Dept Hlth Syst Management, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",simont@som.bgu.ac.il,"Simon-Tuval, Tzahit/E-6328-2011","Simon-Tuval, Tzahit/0000-0003-4518-7828",Israel National Institute for Health Policy Research [A/10/140],Israel National Institute for Health Policy Research,These findings are the result of a study supported by the Israel National Institute for Health Policy Research (grant no.

Although the impact of obesity on medical spending is undeniably significant, the estimated magnitude of the cost of obesity has varied considerably, perhaps driven by different study methodologies. Objectives: To document variations in study design and methodology in existing literature and to understand the impact of those variations on the estimated costs of obesity. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the twelve recently published articles that reported costs of obesity and performed a meta-analysis to generate a pooled estimate across those studies. Also, we performed an original analysis to understand the impact of different age groups, statistical models, and confounder adjustment on the magnitude of estimated costs using the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys from 2008-2010. Results: We found significant variations among cost estimates in the existing literature. The meta-analysis found that the annual medical spending attributable to an obese individual was $1901 ($1239-$2582) in 2014 USD, accounting for $149.4 billion at the national level. The two most significant drivers of variability in the cost estimates were age groups and adjustment for obesity related comorbid conditions. Conclusions: It would be important to acknowledge variations in the magnitude of the medical cost of obesity driven by different study design and methodology. Researchers and policy-makers need to be cautious on determining appropriate cost estimates according to their scientific and political questions.","[Kim, David D.; Basu, Anirban] Univ Washington, Dept Hlth Serv, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Basu, Anirban] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kim, DD (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv, 1959 NE Pacific St, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",ddkim62@uw.edu,"Kim, David/JTD-2751-2023","Kim, David D./0000-0002-3383-8972",Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [5 T32 HS 013853-10],Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality),This work was supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality predoctoral training fellowship (grant no. 5 T32 HS 013853-10).,,38,221,313,1,49,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2016,19.0,5.0,,,,,602,613,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.02.008,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DU5MA,27565277.0,hybrid,Y,N,2024-03-09,WOS:000382254600014,0

Other questions relate to the shape of a given impulse response function. Answering these questions requires joint inference about sets of structural impulse responses, allowing for dependencies across time as well as across response functions. Such joint inference is complicated by the fact that the joint distribution of the structural impulse response estimators becomes degenerate when the number of structural impulse responses of interest exceeds the number of model parameters, as is often the case in applied work. This degeneracy may be overcome by transforming the estimator appropriately. We show that the joint Wald test is invariant to this transformation and converges to a nonstandard distribution, which can be approximated by the bootstrap, allowing the construction of asymptotically valid joint confidence sets for any subset of structural impulse responses, regardless of whether the joint distribution of the structural impulse responses is degenerate or not. We propose to represent the joint confidence sets in the form of shotgun plots rather than joint confidence bands for impulse response functions. Several empirical examples demonstrate that this approach not only conveys the same information as confidence bands about the statistical significance of response functions, but may be used to provide economically relevant additional information about the shape of and comovement across response functions that is lost when reducing the joint confidence set to two-dimensional bands.

An increasing number of interventions for AF require cost-effectiveness analysis with decision-analytic modeling to demonstrate value. However, high-quality cost estimates of AF that can be used to inform decision-analytic models are lacking. Objectives The objectives of this study were to determine whether phase-based costing methods are feasible and practical for informing decision-analytic models outside of oncology. Methods Patients diagnosed with AF between 1 January 2003 and 30 June 2011 in Ontario, Canada were identified based on a hospital admission for AF using administrative data housed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. Patient observations were then divided into phases based on clinical events typically used for decision-analytic modeling (i.e., minor stroke/transient ischemic attack [TIA], moderate to severe ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, extracranial hemorrhage [ECH], intracranial hemorrhage [ICH], multiple events, death from an event, or death from other causes). First 30-day and greater than 30-day costs of healthcare resources in each health state were estimated based on a validated methodology. All costs are reported in 2013 Canadian dollars (Can$) and from a healthcare payer perspective. Results Patients (n = 109,002) with AF who did not experience a clinical event incurred costs of Can$ 1566 per 30 days, on average. The average 30-day cost of experiencing a fatal clinical event was Can$ 42,871, but the cost of dying from all other causes was much smaller (Can$ 12,800). The clinical events associated with the highest short-term costs were ICH (Can$ 22,347) and moderate to severe ischemic stroke (Can$ 19,937). The lowest short-term costs were due to minor ischemic stroke/TIA (Can$ 12,515) and ECH (Can$ 12,261). Patients who had experienced a moderate to severe ischemic stroke incurred the highest long-term costs. Conclusions Real-world Canadian data and a phase-based costing approach were used to estimate short- and long-term costs associated with AF-related major clinical events. The results of this study can also inform decision-analytic models for AF.","[Tawfik, Amy; Pechlivanoglou, Petros; Hoch, Jeffrey; Krahn, Murray] Univ Toronto, Leslie Dan Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, 144 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5S 3M2, Canada; [Tawfik, Amy; Pechlivanoglou, Petros; Krahn, Murray] Univ Toronto, Toronto Hlth Econ & Technol Assessment THETA Coll, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wodchis, Walter P.] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wodchis, Walter P.] Toronto Rehabil Inst, Inst Clin Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Hoch, Jeffrey] Canc Care Ontario, Pharmacoecon Res Unit, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Husereau, Don] Inst Hlth Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto; Toronto Rehabilitation Institute; Cancer Care Ontario,"Tawfik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Leslie Dan Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, 144 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5S 3M2, Canada.;Tawfik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto Hlth Econ & Technol Assessment THETA Coll, Toronto, ON, Canada.",amytawfik1226@gmail.com; dhusereau@ihe.ca,"Husereau, Don/AAJ-7722-2021; Hoch, Jeffrey/O-3406-2017","Husereau, Don/0000-0002-4416-6876; Hoch, Jeffrey/0000-0002-4880-4281; wodchis, walter/0000-0003-2494-7031; Krahn, Murray/0000-0001-5836-397X",University of Toronto; Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment Collaborative; Government of Ontario; Pfizer Canada,University of Toronto(University of Toronto); Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment Collaborative; Government of Ontario; Pfizer Canada(Pfizer),"This work is funded by grants from the University of Toronto, the Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment Collaborative, and the Government of Ontario in the form of the Ontario Graduate Scholarship to assist in the completion of doctoral research.

The 2006 Medicare Part D and the 2010 Affordable Care Act are catalysts for further growths in utilization becuase of insurance expansion effects. This research investigating the determinants of prescription drug utilization is timely, methodologically novel, and policy relevant. Differences in population health status, access to care, socioeconomics, demographics, and variations in per capita number of scripts filled at retail pharmacies across the USA justify fitting separate econometric models to county data of the states partitioned into low, medium, and high prescription drug users. Given the skewed distribution of per capita number of filled prescriptions (response variable), we fit the variance stabilizing Box-Cox power transformation regression models to 2011 county level data for investigating the correlates of prescription drug utilization separately for low, medium, and high utilization states. Maximum likelihood regression parameter estimates, including the optimal Box-Cox power transformations, differ across high (=0.214), medium (=0.942), and low (=0.302) prescription drug utilization models. The estimated income elasticities of -0.634, 0.031, and -0.532 in high, medium, and low utilization models suggest that the economic behavior of prescriptions is not invariant across different utilization levels.

The models have two distinctive features. First, we allow for a positive correlation between changes in the VIX and its stochastic volatility to accommodate asymmetric volatility. Second, upward and downward jumps in the VIX are separately modeled to accommodate the possibility that investors react differently to good and bad surprises. Using the VIX futures and options data from July 2006 through January 2013, we find conclusive evidence for both asymmetric volatility and upward jumps in VIX derivative prices. However, we find little evidence supporting downward jumps.

Objective We assess the impact of household size on decisions to enroll in CBHI and demonstrate how to correct for group disparity in scale (i.e. variance differences). Methods A discrete choice experiment was conducted across five CBHI attributes. Preferences were elicited through forced-choice paired comparison choice tasks designed based on D-efficiency. Differences in preferences were examined between small (1-4 family members) and large (5-12 members) households using conditional logistic regression. Swait and Louviere test was used to identify and correct for differences in scale. Results One-hundred and sixty households were surveyed in Northwest Cambodia. Increased insurance premium was associated with disutility [odds ratio (OR) 0.61, p< 0.01], while significant increase in utility was noted for higher hospital fee coverage (OR 10.58, p< 0.01), greater coverage of travel and meal costs (OR 4.08, p< 0.01), and more frequent communication with the insurer (OR 1.33, p< 0.01). While the magnitude of preference for hospital fee coverage appeared larger for the large household group (OR 14.15) compared to the small household group (OR 8.58), differences in scale were observed (p< 0.05). After adjusting for scale (k, ratio of scale between large to small household groups = 1.227, 95 % confidence interval 1.002-1.515), preference differences by household size became negligible. Conclusion Differences in stated preferences may be due to scale, or variance differences between groups, rather than true variations in preference. Coverage of hospital fees, travel and meal costs are given significant weight in CBHI enrollment decisions regardless of household size. Understanding how community members make decisions about health insurance can inform low-and middle-income countries' paths towards universal health coverage.","[Ozawa, Sachiko; Bridges, John F.

Exploiting the rollout of a universal health insurance program in rural China, I find that total household income and consumption are fully insured against health shocks even without access to health insurance. Household labor supply is an important insurance mechanism against health shocks. Access to health insurance helps households to maintain investment in children's human capital during negative health shocks, which suggests that one benefit of health insurance could arise from reducing the use of costly smoothing mechanisms.

Grapevine is well adapted to the agroclimatic conditions of the country which makes it one of the major element of the Lebanese agriculture. Nevertheless germplasm assessment has attributed limited interest to grapevine while genetic resources have not been exploited before despite their potential in adaptation to environmental changes. In this study we assess the diversity of traditional grapevine accessions growing in different production areas in Lebanon. A total of 35 accessions belonging to 22 vernacular names were evaluated using 33 leaf and fruit traits previously developed by OIV. An important variability was revealed among the accessions studied based on grape and grain characteristics. The most discriminant traits were grape and grain weight, dimensions, form, and skin color; leaf size, form, color, lobes number, depth of petiole sinus. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed five main clusters, each regrouping accessions of different named varieties and different agro-climatic areas. An intra-varietal variability is also suspected. Although preliminary, our results indicate a potential of genetic diversity within the Lebanese grape germplasm that should be further investigated in order to understand their performance and to evaluate them in selection programs.","[Chalak, Lamis; Rahme, Stephanie] Lebanese Univ, Fac Agr Sci, Beirut, Lebanon; [Touma, Said; Touma, Joe-Assaad] Chateau St Thomas, Kab Elias, Bekaa, Lebanon; [Azzi, Rani; Guiberteau, Fabrice] Chateau Kefraya, Kefraya, West Bekaa, Lebanon",Lebanese University,"Chalak, L (通讯作者)，Lebanese Univ, Fac Agr Sci, Beirut, Lebanon.",,,,,,,,15,5,6,0,0,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1020.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701020,0.0,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700020,0

According to previous studies, the most resistant roostocks were hybrids of tropical species, such as Vitis caribaea (IAC 572, IAC 571-6, IAC 766) and V. cinerea ( IAC 313). A medium resistance level was observed in V. champinii (Dog Ridge) and Muscadinia rotundifolia hybrids (VR 043-43). However, these rootstocks have not being used in grape growing areas of Southern Brazil. An experiment was carried out to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of the scion cultivar Moscato Embrapa grafted on these rootstocks compared to Paulsen 1103 and R99, considered standards for this region. The tropical rootstocks IAC 313, IAC571-6, and IAC 766 induced earlier bud break compared to Paulsen 1103, the opposite of VR043-43 and Dog Ridge. In general aspects, all rootstocks tested can be used for grape production. Even the tropical rootstocks with no winter dormancy behave as normal rootstocks when grafted. IAC 572 has an advantage of not inducing early bud break. However, excessive vigor is the most limiting factor for IAC 572, requiring especial management practices to control vegetative development.","[Dalbo, Marco] Epagri, Videira Expt Stn, CP 21, BR-89560000 Videira, SC, Brazil; [Feldberg, Nelson] Embrapa Prod & Market, CP 317, BR-89460000 Canoinhas, SC, Brazil",Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA),"Dalbó, M (通讯作者)，Epagri, Videira Expt Stn, CP 21, BR-89560000 Videira, SC, Brazil.",dalbo@epagri.sc.gov.br,"Dalbo, Marco/AAJ-5100-2020","Dalbo, Marco/0000-0002-9203-2362",,,,,13,1,1,0,1,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1017.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701017,0.0,,,3,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700017,0

It was obtained 65.8% of sprouting on the rootstock IAC 313 and 60.4% on 'SO4'. The bud fertility rates were high, around 1.00 bunches per shoot. The average production per plant was 20.63 kg on 'SO4' and 18.34 kg on 'IAC 313', corresponding to an yield at 29.45 ton/ha/season on 'SO4' and 26.19 ton/ha/season on 'IAC 313'. The bunches are medium in size and cylindrical shaped with mass of 400 g on 'SO4' and 370 g on 'IAC 313'. The bunch length and width were also slightly higher on 'SO4' (21.32 cm x 11.89 cm) compared to 'IAC 313' (20.42 cm x 11.50 cm). The berries are large, elliptical shaped, crunchy with a neutral flavor. The grape presented SS content around 16.0.

The second is the inverse power problem: the problem of finding voting systems that approximate equal indirect voting power as well as possible. I argue that the coefficient of variation is appropriate to measure the inequality of a voting system and to specify the inverse problem. I then show how specifying the inverse problem with the coefficient of variation compares to using existing objective functions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

I find that, in general, bubbles cannot exist unless the constraints restrict the demand for credit sufficiently to induce low interest rates. Speculation due to heterogeneous beliefs does not cause bubbles. Ruling out bubbles under asymmetric information requires stronger assumptions: the presence of some uninformed agents and mild portfolio restrictions (debt or borrowing constraints), or alternatively, the existence of some impatient and fully informed agents.

Variable selection in the semi-parametric model must account for the fact that the parametric part of the model is estimated at a faster convergence rate than the nonparametric component. Our variable selection procedures employ a smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty function and consist of two steps. The first is to select covariates with functional coefficients that enter in the semi-parametric model. Then, we perform variable selection for variables with parametric coefficients. The asymptotic properties, such as consistency, sparsity and the oracle property of these two-step estimators are established. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed estimators and variable selection procedures. Finally, an empirical example exploring the predictability of asset returns demonstrates the practical application of the proposed functional index coefficient autoregressive models and variable selection procedures.

Given the very low public investment in the health sector in India, it is critical that resources are used wisely on interventions proven to yield best results. Hence, we undertook this study to assess the extent and quality of evidence for economic evaluation of health-care interventions and programmes in India. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted to search for published full economic evaluations pertaining to India and addressing a health-related intervention or programme. PubMed, Scopus, Embase, ScienceDirect, and York CRD database and websites of important research agencies were identified to search for economic evaluations published from January 1980 to the middle of November 2014. Two researchers independently assessed the quality of the studies based on Drummond and modelling checklist. Results Out of a total of 5013 articles enlisted after literature search, a total of 104 met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. The majority of these papers were cost-effectiveness studies (64 %), led by a clinician or public-health professional (77 %), using decision analysis-based methods (59 %), published in an international journal (80 %) and addressing communicable diseases (58 %). In addition, 42 % were funded by an international funding agency or UN/bilateral aid agency, and 30 % focussed on pharmaceuticals. The average quality score of these full economic evaluations was 65.1 %. The major limitation was the inability to address uncertainties involved in modelling as only about one-third of the studies assessed modelling structural uncertainties (33 %), or ran sub-group analyses to account for heterogeneity (36.5 %) or analysed methodological uncertainty (32 %). Conclusion The existing literature on economic evaluations in India is inadequate to feed into sound policy making. There is an urgent need to generate awareness within the government of how economic evaluation can inform and benefit policy making, and at the same time build capacity of health-care professionals in understanding the economic principles of health-care delivery system.","[Prinja, Shankar; Chauhan, Akashdeep Singh] Post Grad Inst Med Educ & Res, Sch Publ Hlth, Sect 12, Chandigarh 160012, India; [Angell, Blake; Jan, Stephen] George Inst Global Hlth, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia; [Gupta, Indrani] Univ Delhi Enclave, Inst Econ Growth, Hlth Policy Res Unit, Delhi 110007, India; [Jan, Stephen] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh; George Institute for Global Health; University of Sydney; University of Delhi; University of Sydney","Prinja, S (通讯作者)，Post Grad Inst Med Educ & Res, Sch Publ Hlth, Sect 12, Chandigarh 160012, India.",shankarprinja@gmail.com,"Jan, Stephen/AAG-3333-2021","Jan, Stephen/0000-0003-2839-1405; Angell, Blake/0000-0002-7188-7740; Chauhan, Akashdeep Singh/0000-0001-6791-2221",,,,,134,57,59,0,20,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Using the Canadian National Population Health Survey from 1994 to 2003 and implementing a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we find that the mandatory program substantially increased drug coverage among the general population. The program also increased medication use and general practitioner visits but had little effect on specialist visits and hospitalization. Findings from quantile regressions suggest that there was a large improvement in the health status of less healthy individuals. Further analysis by pre-policy drug insurance status and the presence of chronic conditions reveals a marked increase in the probability of taking medication and visiting a general practitioner among the previously uninsured and those with a chronic condition.

Under selection on observables, we construct confidence intervals using a doubly-robust estimator that are robust to model selection errors and prove their uniform validity over a large class of models that allows for multivalued treatments with heterogeneous effects and selection amongst (possibly) more covariates than observations. The semiparametric efficiency bound is attained under appropriate conditions. Precise conditions are given for any model selector to yield these results, and we specifically propose the group lasso, which is apt for treatment effects, and derive new results for high-dimensional, sparse multinomial logistic regression. Both a simulation study and revisiting the National Supported Work demonstration show our estimator performs well in finite samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These models allow generalized interaction structures and generalized behavioral assumptions. The generalized interaction structures allow that the dependence of an agent's utility function on the other agents' actions can itself depend on characteristics of the agents, including an endogenous network of connections among the agents. The generalized behavioral assumptions relax the solution concept from Nash equilibrium play to weaker solution concepts like rationalizability. The results allow a non-parametric specification of the unobservables. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study sought to employ a conventional TTO approach to obtain values for a selection of Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D) health states from a sample of young adults aged 18-29 years and to compare with the values generated from application of the original UK adult standard gamble scoring algorithm and the Australian adolescent scoring algorithm. Methods A convenience sample of Flinders University undergraduate students aged 18-29 years were invited to participate in an interviewer administered conventional TTO task to value a series of five CHU9D health impairment states using the widely used variant developed by the York EQ-5D team. Results A total of 152 students within the target age range were approached to participate in the study of whom n = 38 consented to participate, giving an overall participation rate of 25 %. With the exception of one health state, the mean TTO values were consistently lower than those generated from application of the original scoring algorithm for the CHU9D elicited with adults of all ages. A significant proportion of participants (n = 17, 45 %) considered the most severe CHU9D (PITS) state to be worse than death. Conclusions This study adds to a growing body of evidence indicating that the values attached to identical health states are typically lower for younger people in comparison with adults of all ages and dependent upon the elicitation method utilised. The values obtained are applicable for re-scaling raw CHU9D health state values obtained from younger adolescent samples using profile case best-worst scaling.","[Ratcliffe, Julie; Chen, Gang; Couzner, Leah] Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Hlth Econ Grp, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia; [Stevens, Katherine; Brazier, John] Univ Sheffield, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, ScHARR, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Bradley, Sandra] Flinders Univ S Australia, Dept Palliat & Support Serv, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia; [Sawyer, Michael] Univ Adelaide, Sch Paediat & Reprod Hlth, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Roberts, Rachel] Univ Adelaide, Dept Psychol, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Huynh, Elisabeth] Univ S Australia, Inst Choice, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Flynn, Terry] Uppsala Univ, Ctr Res Eth & Bioeth, Uppsala, Sweden",Flinders University South Australia; University of Sheffield; Flinders University South Australia; University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide; University of South Australia; Uppsala University,"Ratcliffe, J (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Hlth Econ Grp, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia.",julie.ratcliffe@flinders.edu.au,"Chen, Gang/G-4214-2011; Roberts, Rachel Margaret/AAE-5712-2020; brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Stevens, Katherine/E-4679-2010; Huynh, Elisabeth/M-5970-2015; Ratcliffe, Julie/G-3169-2017","Roberts, Rachel Margaret/0000-0002-9547-9995; Chen, Gang/0000-0002-8385-5965; Stevens, Katherine/0000-0002-9018-6413; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Huynh, Elisabeth/0000-0002-1855-3143; Couzner, Leah/0000-0001-5911-5900; Ratcliffe, Julie/0000-0001-7365-1988",Flinders University; Australian NHMRC Project [1021899],Flinders University; Australian NHMRC Project(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),We would like to express our gratitude to the Flinders University students who generously gave up their time to participate in this study.

These tools are appropriate in general when considering panel data with a dominant autoregressive root of the form rho(i)= 1 + ciN(-k)T(-tau), where i = 1,..., N indexes the cross-sectional units, T is the number of time periods and ci is a random local-to-unity parameter. A limit theory for the sample moments of such panel data is developed and is shown to involve infinite-order series expansions in the moments of ch in which existing theories can be seen as mere first-order approximations. The new theory is applied to study the asymptotic local power functions of some known test statistics for a unit root. These functions can be expressed in terms of the expansions in the moments of ci, and include existing local power functions as special cases. Monte Carlo evidence is provided to suggest that the new results go a long way toward bridging the gap between actual and predicted power. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We focused on emerging markets and selected the most populated countries in each of the WHO regions: Africa, the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, Southeast Asia, and Western Pacific. A structured review of published literature was performed through December 2013. Direct information from regulatory agencies and Ministries of Health for each country was extracted. Additionally, key informant interviews were performed for validation. Of the 21 countries selected, approximately half provided an official country-level definition for generic pharmaceuticals. The others did not have any definition or referred to the WHO. Only two-thirds of the countries had specific requirements for generic pharmaceuticals, often associated with clinical interchangeability. Most countries with requirements mention bioequivalence, but few required bioavailability studies explicitly. Over 30 % of the countries had other terms associated with generics in their definitions and processes. In countries with generic drug policies, there is reference to patent and/or data protection during the drug registration process. Several countries do not mention good manufacturing practices as part of the evaluation process. Countries in Africa and Eastern Mediterranean regions appear to have a less developed regulatory framework. In summary, there is significant variability in the definition and classification of generic drugs in emerging markets. Standardization of the definitions is necessary to make international comparisons viable.","[Alfonso-Cristancho, Rafael] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Surg, SORCE, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Alfonso-Cristancho, Rafael; Barbosa, Tatiana] RANDOM Fdn, Bogota, Colombia; [Andia, Tatiana] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Watanabe, Jonathan H.] Univ Calif San Diego, Skaggs Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Brown University; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Alfonso-Cristancho, R (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Surg, SORCE, 1107 NE 45th St,Suite 502, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.",ralfonso@uw.edu,,"Andia, Tatiana/0000-0003-1805-2549","Abbott Products Operations AG, Switzerland","Abbott Products Operations AG, Switzerland","The research underlying this publication has been funded by Abbott Products Operations AG, Switzerland.",,20,35,38,1,16,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

We show three important features of launch timing when all countries refer to the prices in all other countries and in all previous periods of time. First, there is no withdrawal of drugs in any country and in any period. Second, whenever the drug is sold in a country, it is also sold in all countries with larger willingness to pay. Third, there is no strict incentive to delay the launch of a drug in any country. We then show that the first and third results continue to hold when the countries only refer to the prices of a subset of all countries in a transitive way and in any period. We also show that the second result continues to hold when the reference is on the last period prices only.

Policy makers in other states are considering reinstating CON policies in tandem with service expansions mandated under the Affordable Care Act. Although previous studies examined the volume effects of CON, demand responses to actual entry into local hospital markets are not well understood. In this paper, we empirically examine the demand-augmenting, demand-redistribution, and risk-allocation effects of hospital entry by studying the cardiac revascularization markets in Pennsylvania, a state in which dynamic market entry occurred after repeal of CON in 1996. Results from interrupted time-series analyses indicate demand-augmenting effects for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and business-stealing effects for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures: high entrant market share mitigated the declining incidence of CABG, but it had no significant effect on the rising trend in PCI use, among patients with coronary artery disease. We further find evidence that entry by new cardiac surgery centers tended to sort high-severity patients into the more invasive CABG procedure and low-severity patients into the less invasive PCI procedures. These findings underscore the importance of considering market-level strategic responses by hospitals when regulatory barriers are rescinded.

Objective We aim to explore how chronic disease prevalence, obesity, and improved disease detection and treatment rates contributed to the growth in health spending in the USA between 1987 and 2011. Methods We use spending decomposition equations to estimate the portion of spending growth attributable to prevalence increases, rising treatment costs, and population growth, respectively. We use two-part models to estimate the portion of prevalence-related spending that is potentially due to obesity. We examine changing diagnosis and treatment rates to assess how much of the growth in spending might be desirable. Results We find that the share of total healthcare spending associated with the treatment of chronic disease has risen dramatically from 1987-2011. In particular, we estimate that 77.6 % of healthcare spending growth is attributable to patients with four or more chronic conditions. We find that rising obesity levels may explain between 11.4 and 23.5 % of the increase in healthcare expenditure for several specific chronic conditions. Diagnosis and treatment rates for chronic disease are improving. Conclusions Individuals with multiple chronic conditions are disproportionately responsible for rising healthcare expenditure. Much of spending growth associated with rising rates of chronic disease can be linked to rising obesity rates. Though much of the growth in spending is generally considered undesirable, disease detection and treatment rates are also rising, suggesting that at least some of the recent growth in healthcare expenditure may be beneficial.","[Thorpe, Kenneth E.; Allen, Lindsay; Joski, Peter] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Emory University,"Allen, L (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",kthorpe@emory.edu; lindsay.allen@emory.edu; pjoski@emory.edu,,,,,,,14,21,26,2,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

The limit theory of Zou (2006) is extended from univariate lid case to heteroskedastic and non Gaussian data. Then we use the selected instruments in generalized empirical likelihood estimators (GEL). In this sense, these are called hybrid GEL. It is also shown that the lasso estimators are not model selection consistent whereas the adaptive lasso can select the correct model with fixed number of instruments. In simulations we show that hybrid GEL estimators have smaller bias and mean squared error than the other estimators in certain cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Deaths from cardiovascular disease and transport accidents continue to be procyclical; however, countercyclical patterns have emerged for fatalities from cancer mortality and external causes. Among the latter, non-transport accidents, particularly accidental poisonings, play an important role. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using these results, I propose tests that are more powerful than existing approaches for choosing critical values for this test statistic. I quantify the power improvement by showing that the new tests can detect alternatives that converge to points on the identified set at a faster rate than those detected by existing approaches. A Monte Carlo study confirms that the tests and the asymptotic approximations they use perform well in finite samples. In an application to a regression of prescription drug expenditures on income with interval data from the Health and Retirement Study, confidence regions based on the new tests are substantially tighter than those based on existing methods.

Estimates of the program's impact on utilization and out-of-pocket expenditures (OOPs) were obtained using a case-comparison study of 3000 households (14 804 individuals) in urban and semi-urban areas. We used propensity score matching to control for bias on observables and to account for heterogeneity. We check the sensitivity of the results using a weighted regression combined with propensity score matching, which leads to doubly robust treatment effect estimates. The results are robust across the two approaches and show that the insured have significantly higher utilization, lower OOPs and lower incidence of catastrophic expenditures, and are less likely to employ coping mechanisms. However, coverage of the scheme is extremely low, indicating negligible population level impact. Furthermore, the results show that the scheme provides greater protection to the better off than to the poor: the poor are less likely to enrol, and among the poor who are enrolled, there has been no significant impact on utilization of outpatient services, total OOPs or catastrophic expenditures. We discuss the policy implications in the context of the international debate regarding the prospects for the role of community-based health insurance in national financing strategies.

The first section briefly reviews the current methods for addressing generalisability. We argue that these methods make no verifiable assumptions about how representative the recruiting centres are to the population of centres in the jurisdiction. The second section uses data from a multicentre RCT to illustrate that cost-effectiveness estimates can be influenced by the sample of recruiting centres. Finally, we propose two concepts that may advance generalisability research. First, we distinguish between the 'research space' and the 'policy space' and argue that policy makers are interested in the latter, while current methods describe the former.

Methods: Time trade-off (TTO) and paired comparison responses from six health valuation studies four US, one Spanish, and one Dutch were examined (22,225 respondents) to test whether task sequence influences response precision (e.g., rounding), response changes, and median response times. Each study used a computer-based instrument that randomized task sequence among a national sample of adults, age 18 years or older, from the general population. Results: For both no and paired comparisons, median response times decreased with sequence (i.e., learning), but tended to flatten after the first three tasks. Although the paired comparison evidence demonstrated that sequence had no effect on response precision, the frequency of rounded TTO responses (to either 1-year or 5-year units) increased with sequence. Conclusions: Based on these results, randomizing or reducing the number of paired comparison tasks does not appear to influence response precision; however, generalizability, practicality, and precautionaiy considerations remain. Overall, participants learned to respond efficiently within the first three tasks and did not resort to satisficing, but may have rounded their TTO responses.","[Craig, Benjamin M.; Runge, Shannon K.] H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Hlth Outcomes & Behav, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Craig, Benjamin M.; Runge, Shannon K.] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL USA; [Rand-Hendriksen, Kim] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Ramos-Goni, Juan Manuel] Canary Isl Hlth Serv SESCS, Santa Cruz De Tenerife, Spain; [Oppe, Mark] Erasmus Univ, Inst Med Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands",H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; University of Oslo; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Craig, BM (通讯作者)，H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, MRC CANCONT, 12902 Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL 33612 USA.",benjamin.craig@moffitt.org,,"Rand, Kim/0000-0001-7692-4099; Craig, Benjamin Matthew/0000-0003-1121-1316",National Cancer Institute R01 grant [1R01CA160104]; EuroQol Group (EQ) [2013130],National Cancer Institute R01 grant; EuroQol Group (EQ),"Source of financial support: Funding support for this research was provided by a National Cancer Institute R01 grant (1R01CA160104), the EuroQol Group (EQ Project 2013130), and Dr. Craig's support account at Moffitt Cancer Center.",,30,15,15,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2015,18.0,2.0,,,,,217,223,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.11.005,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CD5GF,25773557.0,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351115300012,0

Clinical research has established that these allergies result in large and consistent decrements in cognitive functioning, problem solving ability and speed, focus and energy. However, compared to air pollution, the impact of pollen and seasonal allergies on achievement in schools has received less attention from economists. Here, I use data on daily pollen counts merged with school district data to assess whether variation in the airborne pollen that induces seasonal allergies is associated with performance on state reading and math assessments. I find substantial and robust effects: A one standard deviation in ambient pollen levels reduces the percent of 3rd graders passing ELA assessments by between 0.2 and 0.3 standard deviations, and math assessments by between about 0.3 and 0.4 standard deviations. I discuss the empirical limitations as well as policy implications of this reduced-form estimate of pollen levels in a community setting. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using the theory of competence and self-efficacy, this paper theoretically analyzes the moderating effect of self-efficacy between competence and R&D staffs' innovative performance, and the different effects of competence and self-efficacy on innovative performance in different educational level contexts. The Results show that: firstly, both competence and self-efficacy have positive effects on R&D staffs' innovative performance.

Second, physicians earn more by treating patients themselves, so refer patients to specialty care less often. We assess empirically the overall effect of competition with data from a 2008-2009 Norwegian survey, National Health Insurance Administration, and Statistics Norway. From the data we construct three measures of competition: the number of open primary physician practices with and without population adjustment, and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index.

Metallothioneins are low-molecular weight proteins connected with cancer development and protection of organism against environmental pollution. Their main functions are detoxification of heavy metals, maintaining ion homeostasis and protection against the oxidative stress.

Induction of metabolic genes involved in germination starts around 12 hours after imbibition. Thus, most of the early events are mediated by molecules stored in the seed during maturation and are not accessible to transcriptomic analyses. Proteome analysis has been extensively employed in the past but the coverage of observed seed proteome is relatively low even in present-day high-impact studies. Here, we analysed proteome of two model species, Arabidopsis thaliana and barley (Hordeum vulgare). We employed several complementary approaches to increase the proteome coverage and build a library suitable for targeted protein quantitation.

Methods: We used a Markov modeling approach to compare high-dose HD (in-center or at home) with conventional ICHD using current and hypothetical home HO reimbursement tariffs in England. Sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of the results. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as a cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY). Results: Over a lifetime, high dose HD in-center (5 sessions/wk) is associated with higher per-patient costs and QALYs (increases of (sic)108,713 and 0.862, respectively) versus conventional ICHD. The corresponding ICER ((sic)126,106/QALY) indicates that high-dose HD in-center is not cost-effective versus conventional ICHD at a UK willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000 to 30,000. High-dose HD at home is associated with lower total costs (522 less per patient) and a per-patient QALY increase of 1.273 compared with ICHD under the current Payment-by Results reimbursement tariff ((sic)456/wk). At an increased home HO tariff ((sic)575/wk), the ICEK for high-dose HD at home versus conventional ICHD is (sic)17,404/QALY. High-dose HD at home had a 62% to 84% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of (sic)20,000 to (sic)30,000/QALY. Conclusions: Although high dose HD has the potential to offer improved clinical and quality-of-life outcomes over conventional ICHD, under the current UK Payment-by Results reimbursement scheme, it would be considered cost-effective from a UK payer perspective only if conducted at home.

The relevant prices for insured consumers are copayments. There are many studies of copayment elasticity in the health literature, but they are of limited applicability for studies of competition. Because of a paucity of data, such studies typically control for neither competitor copayment nor advertising. Whereas previous studies examined copayment sensitivity when copayments for branded drugs move in unison, this study examines copayment sensitivity when copayments diverge. This study uses unique panel data of insurance copayments and utilization for 77 insurance groups, as well as data on advertising. The results indicate that demand can be much more sensitive to copayment than previously recognized. Manufacturers selling drugs with higher copayments than branded competitors can lose substantial market share. Manufacturers can offset the loss of demand by increasing advertising to physicians, but it is costly.

During pyrolysis, plant cells carbonize and a chemical change occurs which increases the resistance to microbial decomposition. The application of biochar to soil brings many benefits. Among others, biochar can be used to siphon CO2 from the air into stable forms in the soil, which could also contribute to carbon sequestration. In terms of agricultural management, the addition of biochar into soil increases its fertility, water and nutrient retention and accumulation of rainfall water. The improvement of the physical properties of the soil, in particular, increase in the capillary water capacity, leads to increased productivity of plant growing, higher microbial activity of the soil and greater availability of nutrients, particularly P and K. However, biochar loses its ability to directly stimulate microbial activity after remaining in the soil for a longer period of time, since the attractive substances in the biochar which accompany the pyrolysis process will have been used up by the microbes. In this later stage, biochar mainly improves the physical characteristics of soil and thus indirectly stimulates microorganisms and improves soil fertility. To simulate biochar depleted of nutrients, the experiment used activated carbon. To answer the question of how biochar which has remained in the soil for a long period of time influences the movement of nutrients and water in the soil after application and thus affects the fertility of the soil, we performed and evaluated a pot experiment. In the experiment, activated carbon was applied along with different doses of compost, and a relation was sought between the experimental variants. The study monitored mainly the activity of microorganisms, soil respiration, nitrogen availability index and colonization of roots by mycorrhizal fungi. The goal is to answer the question of the extent of stabilized biochar effectiveness on the soil-plant-microorganism system.","[Svoboda, Zdenek; Zahora, Jaroslav; Mikajlo, Irina; Dvorackova, Helena] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Svoboda, Z (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xsvobod5@node.mendelu.cz,"Dvořáčková, Helena/I-8479-2018; Záhora, Jaroslav/L-6534-2018","Dvořáčková, Helena/0000-0003-4087-4303; Zahora, Jaroslav/0000-0003-1935-0193",,,,,8,1,1,0,8,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,278,283,,,,,,6,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100052,0

Methods: We investigated the cost-effectiveness of a CCC across eight breast cancer subtypes, defined by progesterone receptor (PR) status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, and local/regional spread. These subtypes range from excellent to poorer prognoses. The CCC helped in improving tamoxifen persistence by providing information, checking-in by phone, and troubleshooting concerns. We constructed a Markov macrosimulation model to estimate health gain (in quality-adjusted life-years or QALYs) and health system costs in New Zealand, compared with no CCC. Participants were modeled until death or till the age of 110 years. Some input parameters (e.g., the impact of a CCC on tamoxifen persistence) had sparse evidence. Therefore, we used estimates with generous uncertainty and conducted sensitivity analyses. Results: The cost-effectiveness of a CCC for regional ER+/PR /HER2+ breast cancer (worst prognosis) was NZ $23,400 (US $15,800) per QALY gained, compared with NZ $368,500 (US $248,800) for local ER+/PR+/HER2 breast cancer (best prognosis). Using a cost-effectiveness threshold of NZ $45,000 (US $30,400) per QALY, a CCC would be cost-effective only in the four subtypes with the worst prognoses. Conclusions: There is value in investigating cost-effectiveness by different subtypes within a disease.

We take advantage of a unique quasi-experimental setup in which deductibles and co-payments were zero in a managed care plan and nonzero in regular insurance, until a policy change forced all individuals with an active plan to cover a minimum amount of their expenses. Using panel data and a nonlinear difference-in-differences strategy, we find a demand elasticity of about -0.14 comparing full insurance with the cost-sharing model and a significant upward shift in the likelihood to generate costs.

We propose a cultural transmission model in which parents may socialize their sons and daughters differently and we derive gender specific cultural dynamics. We show how interactions between socialization behaviors and household's economic decisions shape these dynamics and the long-run definition of gender roles. We apply our theory to cultural traits related to the prescribed role of men and women within the society. Multiple equilibria may arise and an economy may be trapped in a situation in which males and females share inegalitarian views about gender roles. Institutional changes as a greater availability of child care facilities may help to reach another equilibrium in which a large proportion of individuals hold more egalitarian views about these roles.

All members of the jury know who the deserving winner is, but this contestant is unknown to the planner. The social optimum is that the jury selects the deserving winner. Each individual juror may be biased in favor (friend) or against (enemy) some contestant, and therefore her goal does not necessarily coincide with the social objective. We analyze the problem of designing extensive form mechanisms that give the jurors the right incentives to always choose the deserving winner when the solution concept is subgame perfect equilibrium. We restrict the class of mechanisms considered to those which satisfy two conditions: (1) the jurors take turns to announce the contestant they think should win the competition, and (2) telling the truth is always part of a profile equilibrium strategies. A necessary but not sufficient condition for these mechanisms to exist is that, for each possible pair of contestants, there is at least one juror who is impartial with respect to them. If, in addition, the planner knows the friend or the enemy of at least one juror, the existence of these mechanisms is guaranteed in the three contestants case. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Since 2013, partly to alleviate overcrowding at the Accident & Emergency (A&E) units of hospitals, the UK has been piloting 7-day opening of General Practitioner (GP) practices to improve primary care access for patients. We evaluate the impact of these pilots on patient attendances at A&E. We estimate that 7-day GP opening has reduced A&E attendances by patients of pilot practices by 9.9% with most of the impact on weekends which see A&E attendances fall by 17.9%. The effect is non-monotonic in case severity with most of the fall occurring in cases of moderate severity. An additional finding is that there is also a 9.9% fall in weekend hospital admissions (from A&E) which is entirely driven by a fall in admissions of elderly patients. The impact on A&E attendances appears to be bigger among wealthier patients. We present evidence in support of a causal interpretation of our results and discuss policy implications.

While economic evaluation provides a way of approaching the prioritisation of vertical projects, it provides less guidance on how to prioritise between horizontal and vertical spending. We approach this problem by formulating a mathematical program which captures the complementary benefits of funding both vertical projects and horizontal programmes. We show that our solution to this math program has an appealing intuitive structure. We illustrate our model by computationally solving two specialised versions of this problem, with illustrations based on the problem of allocating funding for infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. We conclude by reflecting on how such a model may be developed in the future and used to guide empirical data collection and theory development. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

The collection of data on patient-reported outcome measures for all patients undergoing four large-volume procedures facilitates analysis of the impact of waiting times on patient outcomes. The availability of patient-reported outcome measures before and after surgery allows us to estimate the impact of waiting times on the effectiveness of treatment, controlling for pre-surgery health and the endogeneity of waiting times caused by prioritisation with respect to pre-intervention health. We find that waiting time has a negative and statistically significant impact on the health gain from hip and knee replacement surgery and no impact on the effectiveness of varicose vein and hernia surgery. The magnitude of this effect at patient level is small, 0.1% of the outcome measure range for each additional week of waiting. However, the value of this effect is substantially larger than existing estimates of the disutility experienced during the waiting period. The health losses associated with an additional week of waiting for annual populations of hip and knee replacement patients are worth 11.1m pound and 11.5m pound, respectively.

Agents have single-dipped preferences over a set of feasible locations. We analyze coalitional behavior for any given mechanism for this situation. We identify a necessary and sufficient condition for a mechanism to possess a strong Nash equilibrium by applying the minimax theorem of von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944). We introduce a class of core solutions and show that these solutions are characterized by strong Nash implementability. As a byproduct of these results, we propose a simple mechanism that implements any core solution in strong Nash equilibria. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Then, we analyze the structure of the faces of the core of an airport game that correspond to the no-subsidy constraints to find that the faces of the core can be seen as new airport games, the face games, and that the core can be decomposed through the no-subsidy cones (those whose bases are the cores of the no-subsidy face games). As a consequence, we provide two methods for computing the core-center of an airport problem, both with interesting economic interpretations: one expresses the core-center as a ratio of the volume of the core of an airport game for which a player is cloned over the volume of the original core, the other defines a recursive algorithm to compute the core-center through the no-subsidy cones. Finally, we prove that the core-center is not only an intuitive appealing game-theoretic solution for the airport problem but it has also a good behavior with respect to the basic properties one expects an airport rule to satisfy. We examine some differences between the core-center and, arguably, the two more popular game theoretic solutions for airport problems: the Shapley value and the nucleolus. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper adduces theoretical and empirical reasons for rejecting the usual specification of homogeneous technical progress across countries and uses a panel of 95 developing countries for the period 1970-2000 to explore the consequences of heterogeneity. Allowing country-specific rates of technical progress sharply reduces the estimated income elasticity of 5q0 and points to country variation in technical progress as the principal source of the (large) cross-country variation in 5q0 decline. Education levels and physician coverage also contribute and are less affected than income of allowing country variation in technical progress. The paper concludes by decomposing 1970-2000 5q0 decline into its different sources for each country. (C) 2016 The Authors.

We study the blocking lemma and group incentive compatibility for this class of matching markets. We first show that the blocking lemma for matching with contracts holds if hospitals' choice functions satisfy substitutes and the law of aggregate demand. The blocking lemma for one-to-one matching (Gale and Sotomayor, 1985) and that for many-to-one matching (Martinez et al., 2010) are special cases of this result. Then, as an immediate consequence of the blocking lemma, we show that the doctor-optimal stable mechanism is group strategy-proof for doctors if hospitals' choice functions satisfy substitutes and the law of aggregate demand. Hatfield and Kojima (2009) originally obtain this result by skillfully using the strategy-proofness of the doctor-optimal stable mechanism.

A Note on Trading Off Health and Happiness in Rationing Decisions,VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,happiness; health; preferences; rationing decisions,OLDER-PEOPLE; SOCIAL CARE; METHODOLOGY; ADULTS,"Background: Economic evaluations typically value the effects of an intervention in terms of quality-adjusted life-years, which combine length and health-related quality of life. It has been suggested that economic evaluations should incorporate broader outcomes than health-related quality of life. Broader well-being, for instance measured as happiness, could be a better measure of the overall welfare effects in patients because of treatment. An underexplored question is whether and how people trade off information on health and broader outcomes from treatment in rationing decisions. Objectives: This article presents the results of a first experiment aimed at exploring such trade-offs between health and happiness. Methods: We used a Web-based questionnaire in a representative sample of the public from the Netherlands (N = 1015). People made choices between two groups of patients differing in terms of their health and happiness levels before treatment and gains from treatment. Results: The results showed that about half the respondents were willing to discriminate between patient groups on the basis of their health and happiness levels before and after treatment. In the trader group, health gains were considered somewhat more important than happiness gains. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that both health and happiness levels of patients may play a role in priority setting.","[van de Wetering, E. J.; van Exel, N. J. A.; Brouwer, W. B.

Objective To determine frequency and cost of selected adverse perinatal complications based on number of embryos transferred during IVF, and calculate incremental cost per IVF live birth. Methods Medical records of patients who conceived with IVF (n = 116) and delivered at >20 weeks gestational age between 2007 and 2011 were evaluated. Gestational age at delivery, low birth weight (LBW) term births, and delivery mode were tabulated. Healthcare costs per cohort, extrapolated costs assuming 100 patients per cohort, and incremental costs per infant delivered were calculated. Results The highest prematurity and cesarean section rates were recorded after double embryo transfers (DET), while the lowest rates were found in single embryo transfers (SET). Premature singleton deliveries increased directly with number of transferred embryos [6.3 % (SET), 9.1 % (DET) and 10.0 % for >= 3 embryos transferred]. This trend was also noted for rate of cesarean delivery [26.7 % (SET), 36.6 % (DET), and 47.1 % for >= 3 embryos transferred]. The proportion of LBW infants among deliveries after DET and for >= 3 embryos transferred was 3.9 and 9.1 %, respectively. Extrapolated costs per cohort were US$718,616, US$1,713,470 and US$1,227,396 for SET, DET, and >= 3 embryos transferred, respectively. Conclusion Attempting to improve IVF pregnancy rates by permitting multiple embryo transfers results in sharply increased rates of multiple gestation and preterm delivery. This practice yields a greater frequency of adverse perinatal outcomes and substantially increased healthcare spending. Better efforts to encourage SET are necessary to normalize healthcare expenditures considering the frequency of very high cost sequela associated with IVF where multiple embryo transfers occur.","[Carpinello, Olivia J.] Univ Vermont, Coll Med, Burlington, VT USA; [Casson, Peter R.; Raj, Renju S.] Univ Vermont, Coll Med, Dept Obstet Gynecol & Reprod Sci, Burlington, VT USA; [Kuo, Chia-Ling] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Hlth, Dept Community Med & Hlth Care, Farmington, CT USA; [Sills, E.

The approach uses the mechanism of self-generated instruments called IVX instrumentation developed by Magdalinos and Phillips (2009b). We first show that these methods remain valid for regressors with local unit roots in the explosive direction and mildly explosive roots, where the roots are further from unity in the explosive direction than 0 (n(-1)). It is also shown that Wald testing procedures remain robust for multivariate regressors with certain forms of mixed degrees of persistence. These robustifications are useful in econometric inference, for example, when there are periods of mildly explosive trends in some or all of time series employed in the analysis but the exact knowledge on the regressor persistence is unavailable. Some aspects of the choice of the IVX instruments are investigated and practical guidance is provided but the issue of optimal IVX instrument choice remains unresolved. The methods are straightforward to apply in practical work such as predictive regression applications in finance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Phillips, Peter C.

This paper proposes a framework for evaluating the de facto insurer incentives embedded in these complex payment systems. We discuss fit, power and balance, each of which addresses a distinct market failure in health insurance. We implement empirical metrics of fit, power, and balance in a study of Marketplace payment systems. Using data similar to that used to develop the Marketplace risk adjustment scheme, we quantify tradeoffs among the three classes of incentives. We show that an essential tradeoff arises between the goals of limiting costs and limiting cream skimming because risk adjustment, which is aimed at discouraging cream-skimming, weakens cost control incentives in practice. A simple reinsurance system scores better on our measures of fit, power and balance than the risk adjustment scheme in use in the Marketplaces. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, the proposed bootstrap is robust to model misspecification, i.e., it achieves asymptotic refinements regardless of whether the assumed moment condition model is correctly specified or not. This result is new, because asymptotic refinements of the bootstrap based on these estimators have not been established in the literature even under correct model specification. Monte Carlo experiments are conducted in dynamic panel data setting to support the theoretical finding, As an application, bootstrap confidence intervals for the returns to schooling of Hellerstein and Imbens (1999) are calculated. The result suggests that the returns to schooling may be higher. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The nowcasts are computed using the exact amount of information that policy makers have available at the time predictions are made. However, real time information arrives at different frequencies and asynchronously, which poses the challenge of mixed frequencies, missing data, and ragged edges. This paper proposes a multivariate state space model that not only takes into account asynchronous information inflow it also allows for potential parameter instability (DYMIBREAK). We use small scale confirmatory factor analysis in which the candidate variables are selected based on their ability to forecast nominal GDP. The model is fully estimated in one step using a nonlinear Kalman filter, which is applied to obtain simultaneously both optimal inferences on the dynamic factor and parameters. Differently from principal component analysis, the proposed factor model captures the comovement rather than the variance underlying the variables. We compare the predictive ability of the model with other univariate and multivariate specifications. The results indicate that the proposed model containing information on real economic activity, inflation, interest rates, and Divisia monetary aggregates produces the most accurate real time nowcasts of nominal GDP growth.

Each team consists of two agents who try to split their available power between the tasks of communication and jamming the nodes of the other team. The agents have constraints on their total energy and instantaneous power usage. The cost function is the difference between the rates of erroneously transmitted bits of each team. We present a 2-level game formulation: At the higher level, the agents solve a continuous-kernel power allocation game at each instant. Based on the communications model, we present sufficient conditions on the physical parameters of the agents for the existence of a Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium for the continuous-kernel power allocation game. At the lower level, we have a zero-sum differential game between the two teams and use Isaacs' approach to obtain necessary conditions for the optimal trajectories. The optimal power allocation scheme obtained at the upper level is used to solve the lower level differential game.

The concept of AOC, set up un 1936 by french Authorities, is entrusted to the INAO, public organization whose one of the missions is to validate the proposals of conditions of production developed jointly by producers within structures called organizations of defense and management. Compliance with these conditions is required to develop these products with a strong and not reproducible link with their terroir. However it appears difficult to develop these wines without worrying about the preservation of this terroir, which is the main tool for producers. This concern, which seems at present more and more obvious, however, was difficult to accept until recent years by the various components of the governance of the AOC, the producers, but also in some cases the public authorities. A first reflection to the integration of agri-environmental measures in the rules of AOC started in the early 2000s, and was suspended without being able to lead to significant changes in conditions of production contained in the rules of AOC. With the challenge of societal expectations and particularly the pressure of environmental expectations, the INAO has defined early 2016 innovative agro-ecological targets for all official signs of quality and origin, including wine geographical indications, inviting producers to move towards the ambitious guidelines that will apply to all producers of the GI. For the wine sector 5 main themes were selected by the INAO: The preservation and development of biodiversity, The control of fertilization and in particular mineral nitrogen fertilization, The reducing the use of pesticides in particular by developing the use of bio-control, Looking for a better water management by operators, Using a genetic most suited to the challenges of agro-ecology. This list is not exhaustive and can be completed according to local situations. For each theme a set of standard measures will be proposed by the INAO. The integration of these measures in the specifications will be almost automatic, if requested by the producers. Factsheet of these measures will be provided to defense organizations and management of GIs. Very soon, the ODG will have the opportunity to collectively define the measures they consider most appropriate, which will then be integrated into their specifications. All the proposed measures will make a response to the challenge of the expectations of society, in particular to strengthen an environmental approach, to enhance the credibility of a system based on the link between the product and its terroir, while preserving the collective heritage of GI French wine.","[Gautier, Jacques] INAO, Inst Natl Origine & Qual, Tours, France",,"Gautier, J (通讯作者)，INAO, Inst Natl Origine & Qual, Tours, France.",,,,,,,,0,2,2,1,12,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,3019.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160703019,0.0,,,3,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700097,0

For the viticulture, the challenges relate mainly to the reduction of the use of the plant health products. Within this framework, beyond the tweaking of the application of the plant health products, the vineyards must develop agro-ecological structures favorable to the biodiversity and valorization of the landscapes, support of eco-winetourism.

Energy output-input analysis is generally done to determine the scope of environment and energy efficiency of agricultural production. In this study the cost of raisin production was calculated by Manisa Viticulture Research Institute's records in 2015. Costs of inputs and prices of raisin were obtained from various sources such as Turkish Statistical Institute, Aegean Exporters' Association and Turkish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock. The total energy input necessity for raisin production was 39,066.91 MJ/ha. The research results indicated that the total energy input used for raisin was mainly dependent on non-renewable energy forms (%97). The high ratio of non-renewable energy in the total used energy inputs causes negative effects on the sustainability in agricultural production. Among input energy sources, diesel oil, chemical fertilizers and electricity contained highest energy shares with 34.30%, 26.96%, and 22.50% respectively. The energy ratio and energy productivity were found to be 6.04 and 0.51 kg/MJ. Gross production value and total variable costs for raisin were $ 8,600 and $ 4,528.25, respectively. As a result of cost analysis, gross margin was calculated as $ 4,071.75.","[Uysal, Hulya] Viticulture Res Inst, Dept Agr Econ, Manisa, Turkey; [Saner, Gamze] Aegean Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, Izmir, Turkey",Ege University,"Uysal, H (通讯作者)，Viticulture Res Inst, Dept Agr Econ, Manisa, Turkey.",,"Uysal, Hülya/HGE-3143-2022",,,,,,14,2,2,1,6,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,3020.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160703020,0.0,,,4,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700098,0

In this class we show that the monopolist optimally splits quantities in two groups: low and high demand. The marginal tariff is sufficient to determine the demand curve (or, equivalently, the monopolist can apply the demand profile approach) within each group. However, given the failure of the single-crossing condition, a global incentive compatibility constraint that prevents deviation across demand groups binds. Therefore, the demand profile approach is no longer valid and we have to modify it accordingly to deal with our problem. We give a complete characterization of its solution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We are interested in choosing weights for averaging across generalized least squares (GLS) estimators obtained from a set of approximating models. However, GLS estimators, depending on the unknown inverse covariance matrix of the errors, are usually infeasible. We therefore construct feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) estimators using a consistent estimator of the unknown inverse matrix. Based on this inverse covariance matrix estimator and FGLS estimators, we develop a feasible autocovariance-corrected Mallows model averaging criterion to select weights, thereby providing an FGLS model averaging estimator of the true regression function. We show that the generalized squared error loss of our averaging estimator is asymptotically equivalent to the minimum one among those of GLS model averaging estimators with the weight vectors belonging to a continuous set, which includes the discrete weight set used in Hansen (2007) as its proper subset.

The comparison of quality and use of resources was based on hospital-level random effects models estimated from patient-level data. After examining quality and use of resources separately, we analysed whether a cost-quality trade-off existed between the hospitals. Our results showed notable differences between hospitals and countries in both survival and use of resources. Some evidence would support increasing the horizontal integration: higher degrees of concentration of regional AMI care were associated with lower use of resources. A positive relation between cost and quality in the care of AMI patients existed in Hungary and Finland. In the care of stroke and hip fracture, we found no evidence of a cost-quality trade-off. Thus, the cost-quality association was inconsistent and prevailed for certain treatments or patient groups, but not in all countries.

Objective: The aim of this study was to provide evidence about the (cost-) effectiveness of Dutch DMPs as implemented in daily practice. Methods: We compared the physical activity, smoking status, quality-adjusted life-years, and yearly costs per patient between the most and the least comprehensive DMPs in four disease categories: primary CVR prevention, secondary CVR prevention, both types of CVR prevention, and COPD (N = 1034). Propensity score matching increased comparability between DMPs. A 2-year cost-utility analysis was performed from the health care and societal perspectives. Sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate the impact of DMP development and implementation costs on cost-effectiveness. Results: Patients in the most comprehensive DMPs increased their physical activity more (except for primary CVR prevention) and had higher smoking cessation rates. The incremental QALYs ranged from -0.032 to 0.038 across all diseases. From a societal perspective, the most comprehensive DMPs decreased costs in primary CVR prevention (certainty 57%), secondary CVR prevention (certainty 88%), and both types of CVR prevention (certainty 98%). Moreover, the implementation of comprehensive DMPs led to QALY gains in secondary CVR prevention (certainty 92%) and COPD (certainty 69%). Conclusions: The most comprehensive DMPs for CVR and COPD have the potential to be cost saving, effective, or cost-effective compared with the least comprehensive DMPs. The challenge for Dutch stakeholders is to find the optimal mixture of interventions that is most suited for each target group.","[Tsiachristas, Apostolos] Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, New Richards Bldg,Old Rd Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, England; [Tsiachristas, Apostolos; Burgers, Laura; Rutten-van Molken, Maureen P.
