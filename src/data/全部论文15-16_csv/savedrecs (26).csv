The use and design of MAP incentives depend on the signal quality of accounting versus stock performance, shareholder horizons, strategic imperatives, and board independence. After the technology bubble, option expensing, and the publicity of option backdating, firms increasingly use stock-based MAP plans to replace options, resulting in changes in pay structure, but not in pay level.

It is hypothesized that differences in deforestation among countries can be attributed to their colonial legacies shaping the current impact of the institutional background on deforestation. Overall, the author finds that institutions defined as the extent of democracy, the quality of property rights and the quality of government functioning (e.g., corruption), have a differential impact on deforestation rates according to colonial legacies as defined by the identity of the colonizer. More precisely, it is found that: (1) in countries characterized by 'bad' governance, former French colonies deforest relatively less than former British and Spanish colonies; whereas (2) in countries characterized by 'good' governance, the result is reversed. These results are robust when geography features are controlled for since the process of colonization was not random and depended on initial geographic and climatic conditions.","[Marchand, Sebastien] Univ Auvergne, CERDI, 65 Blvd F Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Marchand, S (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, CERDI, 65 Blvd F Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",sebastien.marchand@udamail.fr,"Marchand, Sebastien/B-1240-2010","Marchand, Sebastien/0000-0001-8265-5008","multi-training program 'International governance, universalism and relativism rules and institutions: what roles for international institutions?'; Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program 'Investissements d'avenir' [ANR-10-LABX-14-01]","multi-training program 'International governance, universalism and relativism rules and institutions: what roles for international institutions?'; Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program 'Investissements d'avenir'(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","The author would like to thank Pascale Combes Motel, Christian Ebeke, Louis-Marie Philippot, Gerard Duchene and Louis Hotte.

First, there is an important share of countries for which relatively robust evidence of predictability is found for both core and headline inflation. Second, the share of countries for which there is evidence of robust predictability is about the same for core and headline inflation, although gains in root-mean-squared prediction error are higher for headline inflation. Third, while the evidence indicates that an international inflation factor may be a useful predictor for several countries, it also indicates that, for many countries as well, predictability is either questionable, undetectable, non-robust or simply non-existent.","[Medel, Carlos A.] Cent Bank Chile, Financial Stabil, Santiago, Chile; [Pedersen, Michael] Cent Bank Chile, Econ Res, Santiago, Chile; [Pincheira, Pablo M.] Adolfo Ibanez Univ, Sch Business, Diagonal Torres 2640,Penalolen 7941169, Santiago, Chile",Central Bank of Chile; Central Bank of Chile; Universidad Adolfo Ibanez,"Pincheira, PM (通讯作者)，Adolfo Ibanez Univ, Sch Business, Diagonal Torres 2640,Penalolen 7941169, Santiago, Chile.",pablo.pincheira@uai.cl,"Pincheira, Pablo/HDM-9391-2022","Pedersen, Michael/0000-0002-8040-6566; Pincheira Brown, Pablo Matias/0000-0002-6662-8496",,,,,34,9,9,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

We use this approach to decompose the total correlations into short-(daily) and long-run (quarterly) correlations for the period from 1999 to 2011. We then examine the transmission mechanisms by regressing the quarterly economic, financial, and behavioral variables on the quarterly DCC-MIDAS correlations. We find that country specific factors are crisis contingent transmission mechanisms for the co-movements of emerging country pairs and mixed pairs of advanced and emerging countries during the global financial crisis. However, we do not observe wake-up calls in the transmission of the crisis among advanced country pairs. The classification of the transmission mechanisms for crisis and non-crisis periods with the different country pairs has important implications for crisis management as well as for portfolio investment strategies. Thus, our findings contribute to the discussion on the role and effectiveness of the international financial architecture. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Care managers can be considered as pure gatekeepers, in that their function is limited to referral people to specialists and they themselves do not provide care. Care managers are rewarded by capitation, which is considered as a cost-effective payment mechanism for insurers. However, many care managers actually work for firms that also operate as service providers. Service providers are rewarded by a fee for-service payment and can have a motivation to induce excess consumer demand. The violation of the neutrality of care managers might result in a financial burden on social insurance. In this study, we empirically test whether there is a positive correlation between care manager density and care costs, which might imply the existence of supplier-induced demand. Our results show a positive correlation, particularly in the case of care managers who work for firms that jointly operate in service provision sectors. Based on these results, we conduct a quantitative analysis, and show that the demand induced by care managers might produce a considerable financial burden on social insurance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Although the economic benefits of reputation systems have been well-documented, reputation systems might also have economic costs. In this article we ask whether transactions numerically scored as positive are more likely to be associated with negative written feedback when a seller has a relatively low reputation. Our analysis of this question is based on data from the Chinese online marketplace, Taobao.com. We collected over 2,500 numerical evaluations and written messages from buyers to sellers, where in all cases the buyers numerically scored their transaction experience as positive. Using the XH message classification game (Houser & Xiao, 2011), evaluators who were blind to the transaction details categorized buyer's written messages from these transactions as reflecting a positive, negative or neutral experience. We discover that positive numerical feedback is accompanied by less positive textual comments when sellers have already received more feedback (that is, when the sellers have been on Taobao longer or have had more transactions for other reasons). We discuss multiple competing explanations for this finding.","[Zhang, Xiaodan; Gong, Yanping] Cent South Univ, Dept Mkt, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Houser, Daniel] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Central South University; George Mason University,"Houser, D (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, ICES, 4400 Univ Dr,MSN 1B2, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",dhouser@gmu.edu,"Houser, Daniel/JXX-4326-2024",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71272066, 71210003]; Innovation-Driven Project of Central South University [2015CX010]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovation-Driven Project of Central South University,"Funding for this research was provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71272066, 71210003), and Innovation-Driven Project of Central South University (2015CX010).

Evidence on the substitutability between home and market goods confirms that complementarity is an empirically relevant driver of fiscal multipliers. However, in a housework model substantial complementarity can be generated without imposing a low wealth effect, which contradicts the microeconomic evidence.

The study is based on 20 in-depth interviews with parents of small children, who were highly skilled participants in specialized labour markets, living in the Gothenburg urban region of Sweden. The study applies a time-geography theoretical perspective and uses the concept of gender contract in analysing the interviews. In terms of work travel in everyday life, three distinctive types of gender contracts are identified: the traditional gender contract, the gender-equal contract, and the mixed gender contract. These contracts illustrate how individuals and households handle surrounding socio-spatial structures differently depending on their perceptions and manifestations of gender relationships. The identification of different contracts among the respondents indicates both re-enactment of and opposition to stereotypical gender structures in society; moreover, these contracts illustrate the individual's manoeuvring room within the frames of organizing structures.

We construct a measure of a bank's level of lending standards using micro-data from the sample of banks participating in the Eurosystem Bank Lending Survey in The Netherlands and show that this level measure affects business lending. The level effect is statistically robust and economically relevant; a one point tightening reduces a bank's quarterly growth rate of business lending by about half a percentage point until bank lending standards are eased. This level effect of bank lending standards helps to explain low bank lending growth after a period of prolonged tightening as well as high bank lending growth in a period of prolonged easing.

Linear Granger causality tests show that whilst economic policy and macroeconomic uncertainty indices can predict stock returns, firm-level uncertainty measures possess no predictability. However, given the existence of structural breaks and inherent nonlinearities in the series, we employ a non parametric causality methodology, as linear modeling leads to misspecifications thus the results cannot be considered reliable. The nonparametric test reveals that in fact no predictability can be observed for the various measures of uncertainty i.e., firm-level, macroeconomic and economic policy uncertainty, vis-A-vis real stock returns. In turn, a profound causal predictability is demonstrated for the volatility series, with the exception of firm-level uncertainty. Overall our results not only emphasize the role of economic and firm-level uncertainty measures in predicting the volatility of stock returns, but also presage against using linear models which are likely to suffer from misspecification in the presence of parameter instability and nonlinear spillover effects.

Like operating leverage, sticky wages are a source of risk for the firm. Firms, industries, regions, or times with especially high or rigid wages are especially risky. If wages are sticky, then wage growth should negatively forecast future stock returns because falling wages are associated with even bigger falls in output, and increases in operating leverage.

But it is clear that not all implementations of TOD are the same in every station catchment area across a transit network. This heterogeneity in station area contexts presents significant complexity for planners and policymakers interested in understanding existing TOD conditions, an area's TOD potential, and the relevant policy and planning interventions required to achieve planning goals. It also creates complications for researchers interested in associating station contexts with various TOD outcomes. In response, the present paper develops a model-based latent class method for distilling measures of station area TOD inputs into a set of more homogeneous station types. Its application to 372 existing and planned rapid transit stations in the Toronto region reveals a typology of 10 distinct TOD contexts across a number of present and future transit lines. The end result is an empirical tool for policy evaluation and prescription that can be used to benchmark and compare performance of TOD inputs around existing and planned transit stations and offers a foundation for further research into the relationship between TOD inputs and outcomes. Furthermore, the use of latent class analysis improves on the previous literature in this area by offering model results that are easily interpretable and extendable to other applications.

When risk is described as the frequency of returns below or above a threshold we observe more violations than for range and probability-based descriptions. Innumerate individuals are more likely to violate expected utility than those with high numeracy. Apart from the very elderly, older individuals are less likely to violate the restrictions. The results highlight the challenges of disclosure regulation.","[Bateman, Hazel] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Eckert, Christine; Geweke, John] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Louviere, Jordan] Univ S Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Satchell, Stephen] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Satchell, Stephen; Thorp, Susan] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Technology Sydney; University of South Australia; University of Cambridge; University of Sydney,"Bateman, H (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",,"Eckert, Christine/AAE-9676-2019","Eckert, Christine/0000-0002-8573-6978; Louviere, Jordan/0000-0001-7688-164X; Thorp, Susan/0000-0003-3462-0876",,,,,53,15,16,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Systemic risk is defined as the propensity of a financial institution to be undercapitalised when the financial system as a whole is undercapitalised. By the law of large numbers, traditional lines of insurance with idiosyncratic non-catastrophic risks cannot be systemic. On the contrary, undiversified insurers specialised in activities whose insured risks are highly correlated with GDP are systemic. In the life insurance sector, some contractual clauses such as unhedged minimum guarantees and free options to surrender raise the chance of systemic relevance. On the contrary, life insurers satisfying the classic solvency capital requirements contribute to the liquidity of financial markets thanks to the long-termist approach of their portfolio management. Finally, using historical data in the U.S. on the contribution of different sectors to the aggregate volatility of the economy, we show that investment banking is almost twice as volatile as aggregate GDP, while insurance is one fifth as volatile as aggregate GDP. The insurance sector thus appears to be a stabilising force of the economy.","[Bobtcheff, Catherine; Gollier, Christian] Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France; [Chaney, Thomas] Toulouse Sch Econ, Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Bobtcheff, C (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France.",,,,AXA; SCOR Chair Risk Markets and Value Creation at TSE,AXA; SCOR Chair Risk Markets and Value Creation at TSE,"We acknowledge the financial support of AXA for this research.

The causality between money and output is studied conditional on estimated DSGE models which allow for consideration of various channels where money and output interact. The causality tests are also conditioned on the structural shocks affecting both money and output. The results show that causality from money to either inflation or output at various horizons and for various specifications can be influenced by the preference, technological or interest rate shocks. It further shows that causality between money and output is not dependent on money demand shocks, though when money demand shocics are absent, there is no causality between money and inflation. Further robustness tests indicate that the results are also influenced by the filtering method used, although most of them are robust to the alternative filtering methods used before estimating the models.

However, the prognosis for the socioeconomic wellbeing of inhabitants remains unclear. In an empirical regularity that has been termed the boom bust pattern or the resource curse, the exploitation of natural resources is associated with short-run gains in welfare that dissipate over time. This coupling hypothesis asserts that deforestation and development are correlated such that deforestation leads to only short-term advances in economic welfare that are not sustained once natural forests (along with their mature timber and soil inputs) are exhausted. In contrast, the decoupling hypothesis asserts that deforestation and development need not be correlated over time. In this context, growth that is initially based on deforestation may be sustained and translated into prolonged welfare gains, even once the forest is exhausted. Using census and deforestation data from 1991, 2000 and 2010 for municipalities (i.e., counties) in the Amazon region we confirm that this boom bust pattern appears in cross-sectional data. However, using panel data we show that socioeconomic welfare has become decoupled from environmental factors and is converging to rising national averages. Our findings contradict the conventional wisdom that the exploitation of tropical forests is required to promote Amazonian development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Because the reverse mortgage (RM) can fulfill this requirement, it has become increasingly popular among elderly homeowners. Based on the assumption that seniors seek maximum utility, this article presents a theoretical economic model that derives a decision rule for participating in the RM program The model takes account of the influences of bequest motivation, random death times and stochastic house prices. A critical value for the intensity of house bequest motivation is also derived from our formula for the decision rule. We then use this value to show how the elder's desire to participate in the RM program is influenced by three sets of factors: the elder's personal characteristics and circumstances, the content of the RM contract, and the current economic situation. Elders' desire to participate in the RM program is found to be negatively correlated with the fixed cost of applying for an RM, the RM contract rate, and the cash income from the elder's retirement plan; on the contrary, the desire to participate is positively correlated with the RM principle limit factors, the elder's age at the time of joining the RM program, the elder's time preference, the elder't initial cash wealth, the elder's initial house price, the current interest rate, and the volatility of the house return. These analyses should help RM policy executors and providers understand the RM borrower's decision-making process and how the factors mentioned above influence an elder's desire to apply for an RM.

The reform has three stages: (1) establishment of a neutral organization of network operation, (2) extension of retail competition to household consumers, and (3) legal unbundling of the transmission distribution network sector. Currently, the first stage is underway and the Japanese government is preparing to implement the second stage for a fully liberalized retail market. This study employs government and company data to demonstrate the current and projected influences of the stages on numerous aspects of the reform. The results prove that resistance to nuclear power and promotion of renewable energy generation is expected to have a significant impact on consumer benefits, whereas new business alliances are expected to create new competitive energy markets. Periodic assessments of the status and progress of the stages of the reform are vital to achieving an efficient electricity market that benefits providers and consumers.","[Goto, Mika] Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo 152, Japan; [Sueyoshi, Toshiyuki] New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Socorro, NM 87801 USA",Tokyo Institute of Technology; New Mexico Institute of Mining Technology,"Goto, M (通讯作者)，Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo 152, Japan.",goto.m.af@m.titech.ac.jp,"Goto, Mika/C-9980-2015","Goto, Mika/0000-0001-7214-2233",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [26285050]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26285050] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) 26285050.,,21,6,6,0,13,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

Disruption to the supply-demand balance was especially severe in Tokyo and Tohoku in summer 2011, forcing the government to introduce mandatory rationing for large customers. Following intensive efforts, a reduction in demand of more than 15% compared with the 2010 level was achieved in these two regions. Surprisingly, most of the savings achieved in 2011 have persisted for almost four years. This paper examines the Japanese experience of saving electricity, based primarily on a detailed review of surveys of households and commercial and industrial customers we conducted each fall from 2011 to 2014. The paper analyzes major electricity saving measures, energy users' perceptions and motivations, and trends from 2011 to 2014. The results show that the implementation rates of various electricity-saving measures are declining from the 2011 or 2012 levels, while the actual reduction in demand has remained at almost the same level. This seemingly paradoxical finding can be explained by the cumulative effect of replacing old equipment with newel; more efficient models and adopting new technology such as LED lighting.","[Kimura, Osamu; Nishio, Ken-Ichiro] Cent Res Inst Elect Power Ind, Tokyo 201, Japan",Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry - Japan,"Kimura, O (通讯作者)，Cent Res Inst Elect Power Ind, Tokyo 201, Japan.",o-kimura@criepi.denken.or.jp,,"Kimura, Osamu/0000-0002-0271-8361",,,,,57,6,7,0,20,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

Using a regression discontinuity design, we find a reduction in overall truck traffic of around 4-6%, no effects on car traffic and time-shifted placebos, suggestive evidence for traffic substitution toward rail, and negative effects on nitrogen oxides at curbside monitors. Complementary estimates on the effects of the German mileage tax and complementary estimates based on the synthetic control method are broadly consistent with our main results, although the latter are not statistically significant.

Most researchers commonly believe that the global financial crisis originated in the United States, and spread immediately to global financial hubs where it eventually became the Eurozone crisis. Several studies have been conducted on financial market contagion during both global and Eurozone crises; however, the issue of whether equity market contagion spreads from the United States to the world equity markets during these crises has not been addressed yet. Through using US dollar-denominated MSCI daily indices from fiftyfive equity markets for the period 2003-2013, we have found evidence of contagion in developed and emerging markets during the global and Eurozone crises. We show that contagion spread from the United States to the world markets during both crises. Our regression results identify that the bank risk transfer between the United States and other countries is the key transmission channel for cross-country correlations. This study has an important policy implication for portfolio diversification between the United States and other countries during these crises. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that two different reference points are reasonable in this framework, state-dependent initial wealth or final wealth after buying full insurance. Applying the value function of Tversky and Kahneman (), we find that for both reference points subjects will either demand full insurance or no insurance at all. Moreover, this decision depends on the probability of the loss: the higher the probability of the loss, the higher is the propensity to take up insurance. This result can explain empirical evidence that has shown that people are unwilling to insure rare losses at subsidized premiums and at the same time take up insurance for moderate risks at highly loaded premiums.","[Schmidt, Ulrich] Kiel Inst World Econ, Dusternbrooker Weg 120, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Schmidt, Ulrich] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Schmidt, Ulrich] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Johannesburg, South Africa",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel; University of Johannesburg,"Schmidt, U (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Dusternbrooker Weg 120, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.;Schmidt, U (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany.;Schmidt, U (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Johannesburg, South Africa.",ulrich.schmidt@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,22,24,29,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

After differentiating between the nominal professional backgrounds and real professional backgrounds of IDs, we find that more than 85% of IDs have backgrounds in the party-state system. Based on IDs' real professional backgrounds, IDs' proportion of board seats is negatively correlated with corporate performance, indicating that IDs from the party-state system background did not play a positive and effective role in helping companies improve their corporate performance. Additional deep, broad analysis shows that the diversification of IDs' backgrounds in SOEs is positively correlated with corporate performance. Additionally, an SOE that has dissenting IDs or IDs with different voices achieves better corporate performance. Therefore, reducing the number of IDs from the party-state system and focusing more on IDs' professionalism and background diversity should be considered.

First, based on quarterly data over the 1990-2012 period, the study does not find a significant heterogeneity in the degree of pass-through across the monetary union members, in contrast to previous empirical studies. As the authors use a longer time span for the post-EA era than existing studies, this is not surprising, since the process of monetary union has entailed some convergence towards more stable macroeconomic conditions across EA member states. Second, when assessing the stability of pass-through elasticities, the authors find very weak evidence of a decline around the inception of the euro in 1999. However, their results reveal that a downtrend in ERPT estimates became apparent starting from the beginning of the 1990s. This observed decline was synchronous to the shift towards reduced inflation regimes in their sample of countries. Finally, the authors notice that the distinction between peripheral and core EA economies in terms of pass-through has significantly decreased over the last two decades.","[Ben Cheikh, Nidhaleddine] ESSCA Sch Management, 1 Rue Lakanal, F-49000 Angers, France; [Rault, Christophe] Univ Orleans, CNRS, UMR 7322, LEO, Rue Blois,BP 6739, F-45067 Orleans 2, France",ESSCA School of Management; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Orleans,"Rault, C (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, CNRS, UMR 7322, LEO, Rue Blois,BP 6739, F-45067 Orleans 2, France.",chrault@hotmail.com,"Ben Cheikh, Nidhaleddine/E-8449-2019","Ben Cheikh, Nidhaleddine/0000-0003-2550-6721",,,,,51,16,17,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

It also suggests that the peace-promotion effect of bilateral trade integration is significantly higher for contiguous countries that are likely to experience more conflict. More importantly, we find that not only bilateral trade but global trade openness also significantly promotes peace. It shows, however, that an increase in global trade openness reduces the probability of interstate conflict more for countries far apart from each other than it does for countries sharing borders.

Moreover, the equilibrium social welfare under private leadership competition is higher than that observed under Cournot competition and that observed under private leadership competition, which differs from the findings of Matsumura (). We also show that the endogenous timing game has a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium outcome, under which the government chooses a partial privatization policy, and private leadership competition emerges as the optimal output decision sequence of firms.

It argues that young individuals who join Islamist organisations do not necessarily hold pre-existing extremist views that dispose them towards such organisations. Instead, the radicalisation of personal beliefs and worldview may in fact also occur after joining such an organisation. Findings indicate that young members' gradual orientation to an Islamist ideology resulted from the interplay of a number of factors. First, their close and significant friendships increasingly became concentrated inside the organisation. Second, participation in various organisational meetings brought a personally meaningful improvement in their skills and self-esteem. Third, the organisation bestowed power and influence on its members, both in psychological and actual terms.","[Ahmad, Akhlaq] Univ Helsinki, Dept Social Res, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Ahmad, A (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Social Res, POB 16,Snellmaninkatu 12, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",akhlaq.ahmad@helsinki.fi,"Ahmad, Akhlaq/GVS-1598-2022",,Finnish Cultural Foundation; Otto A.

Methodology/methods Methods used are data envelopment analysis (DEA) including its constant returns to scale (CRS) and variable returns to scale models (VRS), stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) as well as regression analysis. The research covers pension fund management companies in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in post financial crisis years from 2009 to 2014. Efficiency is studied from the operational perspective in accordance with the financial models and underlying assumptions. Scientific aim The aim is to apply the stochastic frontier analysis and data envelopment analysis as efficiency assessment methodology in the pension funds industry in the Baltics and compare efficiency results obtained by various models. Findings All regression equations demonstrated strong correlation and significance, what means that in general results obtained by various efficiency assessment models are consistent. Pearson correlation coefficient for regression equations comprising SFA and DEA CRS was higher than for equations with SFA and DEA VRS. There are rather constant returns to scale than variable returns to scale. High correlation between DEA CRS and VRS regression equations also provides evidence that returns to scale are actually close to be constant. Conclusions In case of DEA CRS model any deviation from the top performers is considered to be inefficiency disregarding the fact whether it is caused by a smaller size of operations or inefficient processes. DEA VRS model is comprehensive from a production economic point of view. However, it is quite tricky from a managerial point of view because it assumes not only increasing returns to scale, but also decreasing returns within the same model. SFA model results proved to be closer to DEA CRS than VRS.","[Arefjevs, Ilja] BA Sch Business & Finance, K Valdemara 161, LV-1013 Riga, Latvia; [Sloka, Biruta] Latvian Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Aspazijas Bulvaris 5, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Arefjevs, I (通讯作者)，BA Sch Business & Finance, K Valdemara 161, LV-1013 Riga, Latvia.",ilja.arefjevs@inbox.lv,"Sloka, Biruta/K-5043-2017; Arefjevs, Ilja/IUQ-3756-2023",,,,,,28,0,0,0,4,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,706,713,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200087,0

An effective management of knowledge and knowledge exchanges is vital. This paper addresses this issue by analysing the case of employment services, which have been subjected to profound reforms in the last years with the aim of providing services that fit the needs of local companies and workers. This is why today labour markets are often managed at local or regional levels, and are populated by wide networks of public and private intermediaries that try to match companies and workers locally. However, these networks require effective management of knowledge exchanges between players, efficient coordination mechanisms, and appropriate use of IT. The paper analyses the processes of knowledge exchange and sharing that characterises a significant case of networked public employment services: the Province of Vicenza, located in Northeastern Italy. The study is based on direct interviews with main actors, on the analysis of support systems and services (e.g. databases, portals), and of available documents. The players in the employment system are identified, and their structure, functions, resources and management approaches are examined. Particularly, the processes of interaction and knowledge sharing between players are analysed, and the web of knowledge exchanges mapped. The related issues of coordination and knowledge management are also investigated. The findings can help public policy makers and private company managers to set appropriate policies for employment services.","[Bolisani, Ettore] Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, Padua, Italy; [Scarso, Enrico] Int Assoc Knowledge Management, Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Bolisani, E (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, Padua, Italy.",ettore.bolisani@unipd.it; enrico.scarso@unipd.it,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,28,37,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300004,0

Analysing the evolution of IC research (Guthrie et al., 2012, Petty and Guthrie, 2000) and considering the fact that some IC pioneers companies, like Skandia, have abandoned IC reporting, a recent stream has underlined the need to investigate the use of IC reports in practice (Dumay, 2013, Guthrie et al., 2012, Mouritsen, 2006) in order to understand if IC reporting is something relevant or just a managerial fashion (Dumay, 2012a, Mouritsen and Roslender, 2009, Fincham and Roslender, 2003). Moving from these considerations, the aim of our study is to explore if, how and why IC reports are used by companies and if, how and why IC measurement and reporting practices do (or do not) stabilize. In order to achieve this aim, a field study approach has been adopted (Roslender and Hart, 2003, Kaplan, 1986, Scapens, 1990). The paper discusses some preliminary findings which extend extant knowledge on IC measurements and contributes to reduce the gap between theory and practice. More specifically, the paper highlights how the IC report is frequently a 'personal business', delves into the relationship with the social report and other company reports, discusses the determining role of some 'key' actors (i.e. project sponsors, project leaders, controllers) in affecting if and which kind of evolutions IC reports may undergo. Further, the paper sheds light on the IC 'lock-in' phenomenon in the accounting or in other domains. Finally it contributes to confirm the fragility of IC indicators. Differently from the majority of extant studies, this one is not focused only on the production of IC measurements and reports or on their peculiarities but also on their use. Moreover, it is not focused on a specific moment but adopts a longitudinal perspective. Finally, this paper in not centred on a single case study but offers insights collected from several organisations in order to have a broader view on IC in practice.","[Chiucchi, Maria Serena; Giuliani, Marco; Marasca, Stefano] Univ Politecn Marche, Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Chiucchi, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Ancona, Italy.",m.s.chiucchi@univpm.it; m.giuliani@univpm.it; s.marasca@univpm.it,"GIULIANI, MARCO/ABF-2162-2021","GIULIANI, MARCO/0000-0002-0194-8616",,,,,41,1,1,0,0,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,54,60,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300007,0

However, reflecting weak links between research and policy as well as varying risk environments (across countries and over time), policy remains exposed to pitfalls, including overreacting, underreacting and applying the wrong or untimely medicine. To help policy makers navigate through the maze, this paper proposes a broad typology of financial frictions that classifies the root causes of socially pernicious financial dynamics under four paradigms', with distinct grounds, implications and aims for macroprudential policy: (i) offsetting the moral hazard implications of bailouts; (ii) protecting unsophisticated market participants from abusive practices; (iii) inducing market players to internalize the systemic consequences of their individual actions; and (iv) tempering destructive mood swings.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze collective efficiency in subsistence clusters as growth strategy and how is the process through which the relational capital and territorial proximity altogether improve performance of firms. Design/methodology/approach - The research uses partial least squares techniques applied to a sample of 113 SMEs of wood industry in Obera, Argentina. Findings - SMEs in subsistence clusters can use relational capital and territory as resources to generate competitive advantages. These competitive advantages foster performance. In consequence, collective efficiency appears as growth strategy in subsistence SMEs. Research limitations/implications - Data are cross-sectional and in a conjuncture of economy expansion, future research should monitor the sample of firms using panel data to assess the development of relations. Sample is in a particular region and sector and generalizations should be done carefully. Practical implications - SMEs probably should integrate and share industrial and business structures to develop systemic competitive advantages with a collective character. SMEs should leverage their spatial interaction to build trust and establish networks of cooperation that will be the source of their collective efficiency. These collaboration networks should base in the local knowledge. Social implications - Subsistence SMEs have strong impact on the most disadvantaged areas in developing countries. Growth strategies to professionalize these SMEs will have a major impact on the endogenous development of those territories. Originality/value - The research provides a mechanism through which collective efficiency leads to better performance for subsistence SMEs.","[F-Jardon, Carlos M.] Univ Vigo, Dept Appl Econ, Vigo, Spain; [F-Jardon, Carlos M.] Higher Sch Econ, Dept Econ & Management, Perm, Russia; [Pagani, Regina Negri] Fed Univ Technol, Dept Prod Engn, Ponta Grossa, Brazil",Universidade de Vigo; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana,"F-Jardon, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Dept Appl Econ, Vigo, Spain.;F-Jardon, CM (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Econ, Dept Econ & Management, Perm, Russia.",cjardon@uvigo.es,"Pagani, Regina Negri/M-2306-2013; Jardon, Carlos M./P-2461-2019","Pagani, Regina Negri/0000-0002-2655-6424; Jardon, Carlos M./0000-0003-0888-2055",Xunta de Galicia,Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia),"Authors thank Miguel Gonzalez Loureiro, business administration department of University of Vigo, M.

Empirically, it examines a recent attempt to establish more participative forms of resource and development governance for indigenous communities in Bolivia through Free Prior and Informed Consent/Consultation (FPIC). Rooted in international human rights law, FPIC aims at achieving more effective bottom-up participation by establishing an obligation to consult or obtain the consent of indigenous peoples before large development projects and legal reforms that would affect them can proceed. Interest in FPIC initiatives has been growing for reasons that range from efforts to build more equitable management of natural resources to attempts to introduce more effective local-scale practices of participation and active citizenship. We argue that the idea of prior consultation and FPIC itself are not neutral instruments; they will not automatically lead to better or more democratic governance and a more equal society. The way in which FPIC is currently being implemented and framed in Bolivia is in tension with broader ideas of representation and legitimacy, inclusiveness, and management of public and common goods because there is no real clarity as to who is entitled to participation, why they do, and whether they are doing so as a corrective to exclusion, a promotion of citizenship, or as a mechanism for redistribution. As we show here, FPIC implementation can have unintended consequences and consultation can sometimes embed existing social, cultural, and economic tensions. The paper offers some broader reflections on participatory governance and collective rights especially in relation to the tensions between inclusive participation and exclusive rights or put differently the challenges for building cultures of participation and inclusion in complex and ethnic diverse democracies.

The deficiencies in addressing the CSR activities in banks can be best highlighted by the moral implications of the credit institutions. The major responsibility of financial institutions, as the main agents that lend the funds, derive from the fact that financial resources significantly contribute to value creation in the economy, with a major impact on improving the quality of life. The analysis of the biggest scandals in which the Romanian banks were involved highlights both the legal and the moral dimension of corporate social responsibility that derives from his voluntary characteristics. Starting from the CSR minimum legal obligations in Romania, including CSR reporting, it will be established the institutional limits of this concept, extending the analysis to the codes of ethics that works in the banking system. Thus, the analysis will include a complex case study considering the Romanian banking sector and it will be completed with the implications of the ethics codes implemented by the banking organizations, in order to establish the current financial market imbalances and the impact of CSR measures on customer satisfaction, as representative stakeholders in this market. The purpose of this article is to investigate the ethical considerations that underlie the financial environment in Romania, by outlining the route followed by the Romanian banks in the post -communist period. There will be taken into account both the banking scandals implications on the behavior of financial services consumers and the implications of national legislation in eradicating the fraud in the system. On the other hand, in Romania, the majority of CSR efforts were made on the imitative basis, without a coherent adjustment to the national characteristics and without a real awareness of the ethical banking aspects. Therefore, the ethical banking is seen as a component of business ethics that is designed to prevent the deviations from moral norms, decisively contributing to prevent the doubtful and fraudulent practices.","[Frecea, Georgiana-Loredana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Romana Sq,Sect 1, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Frecea, GL (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Romana Sq,Sect 1, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",frecealoredana@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,815,825,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300067,0

We find plan preference is weakly related to estimates of the relative financial benefits of being in either the DB or hybrid system and strongly related to teacher age. Importantly, we also find that the majority of teachers prefer the hybrid plan, and that teachers opting into the hybrid plan tend to be more effective based on student output measures of teacher productivity. These results suggest that policy shifts toward pension systems that include DC options do not necessarily make teaching a less desirable profession, particularly for the most productive employees.","[Goldhaber, Dan; Grout, Cyrus] Univ Washington, Ctr Educ Data & Res, Seattle, WA 98103 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Goldhaber, D (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Ctr Educ Data & Res, 3876 Bridge Way N, Seattle, WA 98103 USA.",dgoldhab@uw.edu; cyrusgrout@gmail.com,"Grout, Cyrus/AFV-0461-2022","Grout, Cyrus/0000-0002-4065-4784","Joyce Foundation; Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER) through the Institute of Education Sciences, US Department of Education [R305C120008]","Joyce Foundation; Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER) through the Institute of Education Sciences, US Department of Education","We are grateful to the Washington State Department of Retirement Systems and the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction for providing the confidential data used in this study.

However, bond flows positively respond to past foreign stock returns. I argue that the importance of past foreign stock returns in driving U.S. investors' equity and bond flows is more likely because those returns reflect foreign fundamentals that are valuable to both U.S. equity and bond investors. I also provide additional evidences, which lead to my conclusion that U.S. investors' international trading is not simply driven by return chasing, but rather, foreign fundamentals.

The paper maps basic preconditions and key channel how central bank's words mirror into asset prices. A significant part of the paper concentrates on the Czech Republic where the exchange rate floor and accompanying frequent comments from the CNB's Bank Board are in operation since 2013. The first hypothesis tests whether there is asset price-making information during the Bank Board decision days. In this sense, the factor analysis confirms at least two factors which influence various asset prices. It is assumed that former factor concerns the surprise in monetary policy decision and the latter following press conference. The second hypothesis endeavours to specify the components of verbal interventions: position in the Bank Board, verbal intervention form and visibility of intervention topic. Only comments made by the CNB's governor proved to be significant, leading to higher volatility of the exchange rate.","[Haba, Stanislav] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Fak Financi & Ucetnictvi, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Hába, S (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Fak Financi & Ucetnictvi, Prague, Czech Republic.",xhabs01@vse.cz,,,,,,,21,1,1,1,7,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

This approach to conceptualising what sustainability is about has strong links to work published by Anil Markandya and colleagues over 20 years ago. In this paper, we use long-term data stretching back to 1870 to undertake empirical tests of the relationship between Genuine Savings (GS) and future well-being for three countries: Britain, the USA and Germany. Our tests are based on an underlying theoretical relationship between GS and changes in the present value of future consumption. Based on both single country and panel results, we find evidence supporting the existence of a cointegrating (long run equilibrium) relationship between GS and future well-being, and fail to reject the basic theoretical result on the relationship between these two macroeconomic variables. This provides some support for the GS measure of weak sustainability.","[Hanley, Nick; McLaughlin, Eoin] Univ St Andrews, Dept Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland; [Oxley, Les] Univ Waikato, Waikato, New Zealand; [Greasley, David] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Blum, Matthias] Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",University of St Andrews; University of Waikato; University of Edinburgh; Queens University Belfast,"Hanley, N (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Dept Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland.",ndh3@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012; Oxley, Les T/A-6075-2008; McLaughlin, Eoin/ABA-2401-2021; Oxley, Les/JDW-1971-2023","McLaughlin, Eoin/0000-0002-0307-3374; Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499; Oxley, Les/0000-0003-3621-2323",Leverhulme Trust [F00241],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"Nick Hanley thanks the University of Waikato for hosting him during the writing of this paper.

The article attempts to define the so-called green (environmental) competitiveness of countries. Moreover, the evaluation method of the competitiveness is also proposed. Research was carried out based on the so-called Hellwig's method, which enabled the construction of a synthetic measure of green competitiveness. It is based on indicators of state, pressure, and environmental protection, used by the Eurostat. This study evaluates the level of green competitiveness in selected European Union countries based on data collected from 2010 to 2014. The adopted method made it possible to evaluate the studied phenomenon as a whole, providing grounds for assigning the selected countries into four groups characterized by a similar level of green competitiveness.","[Kasztelan, Armand] Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Agribusiness, Akad 13, PL-20950 Lublin, Poland",,"Kasztelan, A (通讯作者)，Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Agribusiness, Akad 13, PL-20950 Lublin, Poland.",armand.kasztelan@up.lublin.pl,"KASZTELAN, ARMAND/T-3982-2018","KASZTELAN, ARMAND/0000-0002-1947-9846",,,,,29,15,15,1,6,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Based on the characteristics of administrative costs, the study shows that closed-end real estate funds do not behave as investment funds. The study proves that closed-end real estate funds behave more like businesses that are hiding behind investment funds. This conclusion is confirmed on the basis of extensive research, by collecting data from annual reports of independent auditors of all types of funds. More than 51 percent of closed-end real estate funds indicate very high administrative costs and profit reduction by more than half. More than 17 percent of funds decrease their taxable income through higher administrative costs, and thus reduce their tax base to zero or to an absolute minimum. The study points out that if there was a tax-neutral environment in the area of the investment funds in the Czech Republic and investment funds paid 19% tax on corporate income, tax revenues for the state budget would increase by CZK 784 million per year.","[Krcek, Tereza] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Krcek, T (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Narodohospodarska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic.",xsyrt00@vse.cz,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,2,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Using the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey, hedonic price models for fruit juice and fruit drinks are estimated to determine whether specific nutrients, product characteristics, packaging type and acquisition characteristics are associated with price premiums. Based on the results from the hedonic price models, three generalizations are made about the price premiums for nutrients and sugar in fruit beverages: (1) all nutrients garner premium prices in fruit juice, (2) sugar and select nutrients garner price premiums in non-diet fruit drinks and (3) all nutrients and sugar are associated with negative price premiums in diet fruit drinks. Findings further suggest that product attributes such as brand, flavor, organic labels, diet labels and package type, and acquisition characteristics such as store type, region, season and payment type are associated with price premiums in fruit beverages.","[Leschewski, Andrea; Weatherspoon, Dave D.] Michigan State Univ, Agr Food & Resource Econ, 208 Cook Hall,Justin S Morrill Hall Agr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kuhns, Annemarie] ERS, Food Markets Branch, Food Econ Div, 355 E St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA",Michigan State University,"Leschewski, A (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Agr Food & Resource Econ, 208 Cook Hall,Justin S Morrill Hall Agr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",leschews@msu.edu; weathe42@msu.edu; amkuhns@ers.usda.gov,,"Leschewski, Andrea/0000-0003-0376-6776",,,,,55,5,5,1,13,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The results show that a shift to suckler cow husbandry plus additional employment or to a job completely outside of agriculture would only be considered by dairy farmers in exchange for compensation of around 52,900 Swiss francs (CHF), equal to one-and-a-half times the annual on-farm income of a full-time family work unit. At CHF 45,800, the compensation required for farming without cattle is slightly lower, whilst giving up self-employment would require compensation of CHF 32,300. Dairy farmers would be willing to sacrifice around one-fifth of their annual income for an additional week's holiday, which shows how precious leisure time is for them. Overall, we conclude that the farmers interviewed are passionate about dairy production and that they clearly prefer to remain self-employed. Accordingly, there is evidence that these dairy farmers have substantial non-pecuniary job preferences.","[Lips, Markus; Gazzarin, Christian] Agroscope, CH-8356 Tanikon, Ettenhausen, Switzerland; [Telser, Harry] Polynomics AG, Olten, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope,"Lips, M (通讯作者)，Agroscope, CH-8356 Tanikon, Ettenhausen, Switzerland.",markus.lips@agroscope.admin.ch,,,,,,,25,6,6,0,9,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Unlike the existing literature, perceptions are not associated with the labour market status even if we control for endogeneity issues using an instrumental variable regression. Furthermore, higher-educated females are more likely to be unemployed in Egypt. These results imply that perceptions among females are not translated into their labour market behaviour and the supply-side policies alone may not be sufficient for improving young women's employment opportunities.","[Miyata, Sachiko] Tsuda Coll, Dept Int & Cultural Studies, 2-1-1 Tsuda Machi, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878577, Japan; [Yamada, Hiroyuki] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Keio University,"Miyata, S (通讯作者)，Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Business Adm, 2-150 Iwakura Cho, Ibaraki, Osaka 5678570, Japan.",miyata@fc.ritsumei.ac.jp,"Yamada, Hiroyuki/Q-3464-2019",,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15K03458]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03458] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors are grateful to the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science for its financial support (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research No.15K03458).

This study explores the macroeconomic impact of Japan's population aging from the 1980s to the 2000s using a full-fledged overlapping generations model. It finds that Japan's population aging as a whole adversely affects GNP growth by dampening factor inputs. It also negatively impacts on GNP per capita and fiscal variables, especially in the future, mainly due to the decline in the fraction of the population of working-age. For these findings, fertility rate decline plays a dominant role as it reduces both labor force and saver populations. The effects of increased longevity on economic growth are expansionary, but relatively small. The simulations predict that the adverse effects will expand during the next few decades. In addition to closed economy simulations, the paper examines the consequences of population aging in a small open economy setting. In this case a decline in the domestic capital return encourages investment in foreign capital, mitigating the adverse effects of population aging on GNP.","[Muto, Ichiro] Bank Japan BOJ, Monetary Affairs Dept, Tokyo, Japan; [Oda, Takemasa] BOJ, Inst Monetary & Econ Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Sudo, Nao] BOJ, Financial Syst & Bank Examinat Dept, Tokyo, Japan",Bank of Japan,"Muto, I (通讯作者)，Bank Japan BOJ, Monetary Affairs Dept, Tokyo, Japan.",,,,,,,,25,12,14,2,30,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

More specifically the paper studies how a discontinuity affects complex action patterns of the value appropriation process. Given that, the defined research area remains not well understood, the investigation followed a qualitative approach using a field-based case study method governed by a multiple case design research strategy. To accomplish research propositions five in-depth case studies were performed. All cases concerned the path dependency breaking the influence of discontinuities over value appropriation process in firms exhibiting highly intensive use of knowledge and technology in performed business activity. Extracted data enabled identification of discontinuities that occurred across different dimensions of environment and were addressed with path breaking alternations of value capturing practices. Obtained findings indicated that investigated firms exhibited a high responsiveness to sudden discontinuities. Deployed responses involved substantial changes in value appropriation, which concerned the quantity, diversity, and combination of formal and informal isolating mechanisms. Structured reactions induced branching of current action patterns of value appropriation. Given that branching was preceded by intended strategic information gathering, evidenced line of action complies with the concept of dynamic capabilities. The overall sequence of undertaken actions captured in an appealing framework complies with a graduated response to weak signals discussed by Ansoff (1975).","[Najda-Janoszka, Marta] Jagiellonian Univ, 4 Lojasiewicza, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland",Jagiellonian University,"Najda-Janoszka, M (通讯作者)，Jagiellonian Univ, 4 Lojasiewicza, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland.",eknajda@cyfronet.pl,,,National Science Centre of Poland (NCN) [2013/11/D/HS4/03965],National Science Centre of Poland (NCN),The study is a part of a larger project Dynamics and determinants of the process of appropriating value from projects implemented in the inter-organizational networks financed by National Science Centre of Poland (NCN) on the basis of the decision number-2013/11/D/HS4/03965.,,38,3,3,0,10,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,483,494,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300040,0

The extent to which new capital reduces strategy profitability is inversely related to turnover, and strategies based on size, value, and profitability have the greatest capacity to support new capital.

The implementation of innovation by firms brings about a variety of benefits, ia. the use of new technologies, the expansion of markets, the final decrease of operating costs, and the ability to meet customer needs. However, for the innovation implementation process to start, it is necessary to incur expenditures. Methodology/methods: This paper attempts to join the stream of studies on the Polish economy innovation on the background of the European Union, with the special focus on expenditures for the R&D activity, which is not directly associated with the creation of specific innovation, but constituting its significant component. Scientific aim: The considerations in this paper were based on the literature of the subject and secondary data from the Central Statistical Office of Poland and Eurostat. Findings: Collecting and analyzing of innovation activities data are particularly important to create, implement and monitor strategies, as well as research the issue of economic entities development. Conclusions: Data presented in the article clearly confirm that expenditures on R&D in Poland are among the lowest in Europe.

In this context, the purpose of this paper is to explore and understand the nature and scope of the collaboration between the public support services (PSS) in China and the Spanish enterprises which decided to be multilocated there. Design/methodology/approach - The present study examines the necessity of the PSS in China by employing a review of literature as well as both quantitative and qualitative surveys from 31 Spanish companies multilocated in China. Findings - The main conclusions highlight the fact that the PSS do not seem to have a big and homogenous influence on the multilocation process, although those companies with higher levels of commitment that have been operating in China for a longer time have used it more frequently. Originality/value - While other studies of multilocation have isolated the companies from their host environment, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the weak links between the PSS and companies in a culturally and psychically distant market. By providing an insight into the dynamics of how firms interact and collaborate with the PSS, this study contributes to guiding policy makers and managers in designing and implementing strategies to support enterprises in the multilocation process in China.","[Portero, Borja] Univ Politecn Valencia, Valencia, Spain; [Puig, Francisco] Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; University of Valencia,"Puig, F (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain.",francisco.puig@uv.es,"Puig, Francisco/M-8864-2015","Puig, Francisco/0000-0002-0502-7363",,,,,75,0,0,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

After a sketch on the improvement of non-financial communi-cation towards stakeholders, the work deals with social reporting in academic research and education, its poten-tial developments and the first results reached. Methodology/methods The research methodology used, based on observed cases analysis and content analysis, provides us with an interesting overview of the state-of-the-art and allows us to make some preliminary assess-ments about what lies behind the behavior that universities should adopt according to the reform. After a brief analysis of the most relevant literature regarding the topic, we shall address and compare Italian experiences of social reporting. Scientific aim This work aims to expand the set of knowledge related to accountability tools typical of universi-ty systems. Findings Effective accountability systems can indeed turn from tools into goals in public administrations, and in doing so reporting takes on a completely different meaning: it is a contribution to the social added value cre-ated by the university, an extra obligation to take towards stakeholders, a further service to engage in to strengthen democracy. Conclusions The culture of accountability should be introduced and guided mainly by law, with legal require-ments about deadlines, tools and goals, and supervised by third-party authorities. Further work is still needed to fully grasp measurement complexities and the potential lying in the evaluation of academic performance - es-pecially with relation to sociality and sustainability - that plays an important role in national and international ranking systems.","[Ricci, Paolo; Civitillo, Renato] Univ Sannio, Via Puglie 82, Benevento, Italy",University of Sannio,"Ricci, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sannio, Via Puglie 82, Benevento, Italy.",ricci@unisannio.it,"Civitillo, Renato/D-4243-2018","Civitillo, Renato/0000-0002-2564-0309",,,,,49,0,0,0,0,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,463,471,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200058,0

Entrepreneurs may be grouped according to their motivational orientation: promotion and prevention. Promotion entrepreneurs approach internationalization spurred on by an inherent motivation, whereas Prevention entrepreneurs engage in internationalization driven by the requirements of the competitive environment. Motivational orientation thus shapes the interests of the entrepreneurs. This study is carried out based on a regional analysis of the Spanish natural stone industry. The findings indicate that exploiting international opportunities is more closely linked to the personal motivation of the entrepreneurs (focus promotion) than to the demands of the competitive environment (focus prevention). With regard to informational concerns, the entrepreneurs consulted showed a clear preference for information related to support programmes, followed by issues linked to knowledge of markets. Nevertheless, entrepreneurs show different orientations and display quite differing informational concerns, especially in these regions leading the internationalization of industry. (C) 2015 AEDEM.

Therefore, policy-making should take account that fact and should minimise the economic and human cost of performance of small and medium sized enterprises. Methodology/methods Firstly, the method of description was used to describe the present situation of small and medium sized enterprises in EU. Secondly, the analysis of the indicator paying taxes was employed across EU Member States. As data source was mainly used annually published Doing Business report for 2016, where above mentioned indicator is reported based on the coordination of the World Bank, International Finance Corporation and PwC. Then the comparative analysis and evaluation of Paying taxes indicator were used to discuss the differences between compliance costs of each EU Member States in the area of paying taxes. Scientific aim The aim of the paper is to evaluate the compliance costs of taxation for medium sized enterprises in EU Member States based on the analysis of the indicator paying taxes. Findings The best EU Member State for medium sized enterprises performing its activities in respect of paying taxes, can be considered Ireland and Luxembourg. In contrast, the worst one can be considered Italy and the Czech Republic. Conclusions As regard to compliance costs of taxation, Italy and France are countries where medium sized enterprises bear the highest compliance costs of taxation. However, in respect of time needed for preparing, filing and paying of three major taxes, medium sized enterprises in EU Member States spend between 7 and 53 working days per year.","[Solilova, Veronika; Nerudova, Danuse] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Solilová, V (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",veronika.solilova@mendelu.cz,"Nerudova, Danuse/J-3034-2012; Solilova, Veronika/U-1720-2017","Nerudova, Danuse/0000-0001-8150-6107; Solilova, Veronika/0000-0002-9122-539X",,,,,15,1,1,0,8,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,688,695,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200085,0

According to Sriram (2005), fuzzy theory was designed with a specific purpose of mathematically representing vagueness and provides formalized procedures for tackling the impreciseness inherent in many variables in a multitude of problems. Crises, bubbles, fiscal politics etc. makes investing difficult in financial markets. These issues haphazardly raise and cause irregular characteristics which also raise risk. On the other hand, traders and market participants try to reduce risk and increase returns. We try to make dependable suggestion tool which contains a few technical indicators using fuzzy logic modeling. In financial markets technical analysis is commonly used to provide trading decisions. Technical analysis presumes that there are trends and patterns in financial assets' movements. In this study, BIST-30 and Islamic (Participation) Index data is used between March 2012 and November of 2014 taken from Borsa Istanbul. The aim of the study is to create a new technical analysis indicator using fuzzy logic method which could be an alternative to popular indicators used by traders. BUY and SELL signals given by indicators' after closing prices are assumed to be applied in the next day opening prices when calculating the indicators' performance. The performance of the indicator for BIST-30 and Islamic index is measured by modified sharpe ratio and compared to widely used indices like MACD, MA, RSI and OBV. The Sharpe ratio is used to calculate risk adjusted return. It shows the rate of return as opposed to risk. The asset which has the higher Sharpe Ratio is considered to yield better return for the same amount of risk. (C) 2016 The Authors.

IMC can reap rewards in two ways, firstly by avoiding communication/branding issues for the school, and second by making sure that a consistent message is always sent out. Most effective strategies for promoting schools are public relations, direct marketing and advertising and partly personal marketing. Primary schools used to promote school activities such as open day, various events and performances for the public and parents. These promotional activities are part of the public relations marketing communication. An important element became even school website. However, there can be assigned to work with the public, to direct marketing to advertise and personal marketing. This paper deals with research aimed at finding effective strategies used by primary school head teachers within school promotion. The main objective is to analyze the way of promotion, i.e. communication between the legal guardians of pupils and the school headmaster. Part of the objective is to establish effective strategies for schools to acquire potential customers. Our research problems were to determine how effective promotion strategies used schools to get as many customers.

The study builds on existing research where it has been noted that international business theory needs to adapt to the changes in the global economy, particularly the need to recognise the influence of several contingent variables in African emerging markets (AEMs). Design/methodology/approach - The study design was cross-sectional where a survey was administered to MNCs operating in four leading countries situated in key economic regions in Africa. Following validity and reliability testing, hypotheses were tested using regression analysis. Findings - Findings show that an independent judiciary system and an adequate national security system were found to have a positive and significant influence on the MNC's TBL reporting. These institutional factors highlight the perceived importance of law and order for MNCs in AEMs. Research limitations/implications - Policy implications relate to the need for specific and targeted interventions aimed at improving institutional factors in AEMs. Originality/value - Instead of focusing on the internationalisation of AEM firms, the study took a different approach by focusing instead on countries previously under researched and how MNCs are affected by the institutional regimes in these AEMs.","[Urban, Boris; Hwindingwi, Rutendo] Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Urban, B (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.",boris.urban@wits.ac.za,"urban, boris/Q-1768-2019","Urban, Boris/0000-0002-6212-0169",,,,,49,19,21,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

We also controlled the influence of neuroticism (NEO-FFI), job dynamicity and respondents' sex. Findings Job dynamicity, neuroticism and sex were weak predictors of job performance. Mindfulness had weak positive effect on job performance, too. However, mindfulness did not help to explain the variance in job performance beyond neuroticism, job dynamicity and sex. Mindfulness also had no relationship to job satisfaction. We did not find a significant relationship between job satisfaction and job performance and results did not support the hypothesis that mindfulness was a moderator of the relationship between job satisfaction and job performance.

First, the optimal entry mode for firm N in the absence of IPR protection is FDI when the innovation size is large but the variance of demand and the fixed setup cost are small, while selecting exporting otherwise. Second, the enforcement of IPR in the South can promote FDI when the innovation size is small, while discouraging FDI when the innovation size is moderate and large. Third, the enforcement of IPR protection will most likely decrease the total output and the welfare level in the South under international licensing, while the reverse may occur as a result of changing the firm N's entry mode from FDI to exporting.","[Wang, Kuang-Cheng Andy] Chang Gung Univ, Dept Ind & Business Management, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Wang, Yi-Jie; Liang, Wen-Jung] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Econ, Shoufeng, Taiwan",Chang Gung University; National Dong Hwa University,"Liang, WJ (通讯作者)，Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Econ, Shoufeng, Taiwan.",wjliang@mail.ndhu.edu.tw,,,,,,,26,7,7,2,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1608-1625,2164-2257,,ASIA-PAC J ACCOUNT E,Asia-Pac.

The Results show that: Seasonal variation of tourist flow is obvious, there exist great differences in winter half year and summer half year, the double peaks' feature is outstanding; April and June to August are all peaks. In the spatial density, it has the typical structural feature, which manifest as core-periphery structure features. From the first and fourth quarter to the second and third quarter, tourism activity expresses the situation which spread from the urban area to rural area. And the winter half year and the summer half year in special period are clearly convergent and divergent. In time period, tourist flow presents the skewed pyramid structural feature. It will reach to the summit from 11: 00 to 13: 00; tourism activities are throughout the most of scenic spots in Lanzhou from 11: 00 to 18: 00; and tourism activities are restricted to the main urban area and newly added district where have good tourist accommodation reception facilities from 19: 00 to 10: 00 at the next day. The turnout of females is more than males, at the same time, female tourists often fasten on main city, and male tourists prefer the suburban forest parks where they can go on rich outdoor activities, which reflecting the tourism time's preference about gender. Tourists inside the province mainly trend to main cities' scenic spots in the choice of tourism space, but they also have a definite preference about peripheral area's tourist resources; while foreign tourists mainly fasten on main urban area and some strongly recommended areas. From the view of tourism flow activities track, it shows up the obvious axis-point position. Main urban area is the highly gather palace about tourist flow.

The most important aspects of this Energiwende are the phase out of nuclear energy, promotion of renewable energy technologies, and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As a consequence, huge investments in power generation systems and infrastructure are needed. Wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) are important renewable energy sources for achieving the goals, but power generation depends on spatial and meteorological conditions on site. For new build PV systems, the level of on-site solar irradiation is crucial, whereas the yield of wind turbines is mainly determined by the wind speed on site. In the model-based analysis with the RETScreen software, we distinguish between three different regions in order to take differences in climatic and geographical conditions in Germany into account. For each region, six locations with specific site conditions are used for the calculations. Projections are made for the base year 2015 and the future year 2030. We find that PV systems achieve levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) below 11 sic-ct/kWh in 2030, with a GHG reduction potential of 133-289 sic/tCO(2). The LCOE of wind power ranges from 5.1-16.1 sic-ct/kWh and the related GHG mitigation costs from 101-321 sic/tCO(2). In light of these results, it seems to be possible to restructure the German electricity generation system in a cost-effective and environmentally efficient way. Due to decreasing unit investment costs and increasing capacity, solar PV and wind power become increasingly competitive against conventional power generation. Hence efforts are needed to enhance and optimize the grid integration of wind energy and PV and to maintain the long-term security of electricity supply during the transition process.

Against this background it is empirically analysed how consumers understand alpine milk and pasture-raised milk. Do consumers think that cows giving the milk for alpine milk are kept in a certain geographical region? And does pasture-raised milk mean to them that dairy cattle have access to pasture and if yes during which period?

There is no shortage of commentary and opinion on this dramatic period, but few have attempted to provide a coherent, in-depth, political-economic framework that explains the fundamental mechanisms behind China's rapid industrialization. This article reviews the New Stage Theory of economic development put forth by Wen (2016a). It illuminates the critical sequence of developmental stages since the reforms enacted by Deng Xiaoping in 1978: namely, small-scale commercialized agricultural production, proto-industrialization in the countryside, a formal industrial revolution based on mass production of labor-intensive light consumer goods, a sustainable industrial trinity boom in energy/motive power/infrastructure, and a second industrial revolution involving the mass production of heavy industrial goods. This developmental sequence follows essentially the same pattern as Great Britain's Industrial Revolution, despite sharp differences in political and institutional conditions. One of the key conclusions exemplified by China's economic rise is that the extent of industrialization is limited by the extent of the market. One of the key strategies behind the creation and nurturing of a continually growing market in China is based on this premise: The free market is a public good that is very costly for nations to create and support. Market creation requires a powerful mercantilist state and the correct sequence of developmental stages; China has been successfully accomplishing its industrialization through these stages, backed by measured, targeted reforms and direct participation from its central and local governments.","[Wen, Yi] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, St Louis, MO 63102 USA; [Fortier, George E.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Wen, Y (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,"Wen, Yi/I-5756-2016","Wen, Yi/0000-0001-5658-1578",,,,,46,2,2,0,10,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is twofold. First, we used external auditors (including the auditors of Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation and the auditors of two Big Four accounting firms - Deloitte & Touche and KPMG in Taiwan) as respondents in order to obtain less biased data. Second, we investigate the moderating effects of controlling shareholders and the divergence of cash-flow and control rights on the relationship between independent directors and earnings management. The results show that both the existence of controlling shareholders and the divergence of cash-flow and control rights have significant suppressing effects on the relationship between independent directors and earnings management.

SPACE analysis comprise of a four-quadrant matrix developed by Rowe et al. (1994). The SPACE matrix is commonly used in strategic management literature larger due to its integrative power over the standard tools and techniques (Radder & Louw, 1998). Despite the important use and simplicity, the application of this method in the banking industry is still rare. Thus, this study is trying to add to the literature the use of this tools for analyzing bank industry strategy, SPACE analysis methodology is a mixed method consisting of interview and survey. Prior to the study, 3 (three) experts on banking were asked to confirm the research indicators. The research then interviewed 12 banks representatives, who hold senior position in each bank surveyed. The bank were chosen based on different bank sizes in the industry following central's bank categorization. The respondents gave scoring on the internal and external factors sheet prepared for the analysis. The result of the analysis of SPACE matrix is presented in the interpretation of the postures in terms of its environmental stability, industry strength, competitive advantage and financial strength. A strategy is then derived from the posture to guide for the player's next action against competition in the industry. The study found that Indonesia banking industry has aggressive and conservative postures. The paper explores some of the bank surveyed, which represent each posture, and the strategies suggested in response of the postures. The study has provided a valuable insight to the banking industry's state of play and has practical value since it consists of suggestions of strategies that can be implemented by the companies.","[Wulandari, Nuri; Issegana, Riani] Indonesia Banking Sch, 35 Jl Kemang Raya, Jakarta, Indonesia",,"Wulandari, N (通讯作者)，Indonesia Banking Sch, 35 Jl Kemang Raya, Jakarta, Indonesia.",nuri.w.h@ibs.ac.id; rianiissegana@gmail.com,,,Indonesia Banking School,Indonesia Banking School,This research was supported by Indonesia Banking School.

Applying quantile regression methods based on a lender-provided dataset covering the period of 2002-2007, this paper is able to differentiate these effects with respect to distribution of mortgage pricing. The regression results indicate that loan applicants with higher levels of creditworthiness in terms of credit score receive a lower mortgage premium above default and interest rate risk. For every 10 point increases in credit scores, the mortgage premium above default and interest rate risk declines consistently from by 1 basis point at the 10th quantile to 5 basis points at the 90th quantile.

The shock to the public finances was nonetheless significant, and came on top of an already weak pre-crisis fiscal position. Part of this shock is expected to be permanent and the French government has so far mostly used increases in taxation to bring borrowing under control. However, in 2014, spending cuts took over as the main tool for balancing the public finances. Despite the significant fiscal adjustments that have been required, the crisis has not been used as an opportunity for reforms. Some reforms to labour and service markets have been carried out, but there have been no radical changes. While some tax changes, such as cuts to employer social security contributions and an increase in reduced rates of VAT, have improved the efficiency of the tax system, overall the tax and benefit system continues to be plagued by complexity and a sheer lack of transparency.

We investigate the causes of variation over time and donors by employing both a regression approach with aggregate data on bilateral aid and two short country studies on Germany and the United Kingdom. We find that there is a trade-off between the total amount of money given, and the amount of money given to poor countries. The trade-off is similar to the paradox of redistribution of targeting vs. redistribution in rich welfare states. Case-study evidence illustrates how countries have managed this tradeoff.

We propose a correction for periodicity that restores the properties of the test statistics. Empirically, the most plausible model for 1-min exchange rate data features Brownian motion and both finite activity and infinite activity jumps. Test rejection rates vary over time, however, indicating time variation in the data generating process. We discuss the implications of results for market microstructure and currency option pricing.

Our sample includes 160 countries of which 67 experienced economic sanctions over the period 1976-2012. We find, first, that UN sanctions have a statistically and economically significant influence on the target state's economic growth. On average, the imposition of UN sanctions decreases the target state's annual real per capita GDP growth rate by more than 2 percentage points (pp). These adverse effects last for a period of 10 years and lead to an aggregate decline in the target country's GDP per capita of 25.5%. Comprehensive UN economic sanctions, that is, embargoes affecting nearly all economic activity, trigger a reduction in GDP growth by more than 5 pp. Second, the effect of US sanctions is much smaller and less distinct. The imposition of US sanctions decreases the target state's GDP growth by 0.75-1 pp. This detrimental impact on growth persists for seven years and accounts for an aggregate decline in GDP of 13.4%.

The government faces a dynamic problem as it chooses the emission level and abates pollution. The stock of pollution damages consumers and its law of motion is influenced by emission level and the stock of pollution as well as the level of abatement. We show that such type of aid increases emissions, but its effect on pollution stock is ambiguous in the absence of trade. With trade, aid reduces both pollution and emissions given that the recipient country has comparative advantage in the pollution-intensive good. Moreover, such type of aid can be immiserizing with or without trade.","[Oladi, Reza] Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Beladi, Hamid] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Oladi, R (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",reza.oladi@usu.edu; hamid.beladi@utsa.edu,"Oladi, Reza/AAA-7218-2019","Oladi, Reza/0000-0002-4621-7622",Utah Agricultural Experiment Station,Utah Agricultural Experiment Station,The authors are grateful to two anonymous referees and an associate editor for their constructive comments and suggestions.

The study captures multiple snapshots of a dynamic financial network and uses counterfactual simulations to propagate shocks emerging from three sources of systemic risk: interbank, asset price, and sovereign credit risk markets. As conditions deteriorate, these channels trigger severe direct and indirect losses and cascades of defaults, whilst the dominance of the sovereign credit risk channel amplifies, as the primary source of financial contagion in the banking network. Systemic risk within the northern euro area banking system is less apparent, while the southern euro area banking system is more prone and susceptible to bank failures provoked by financial contagion. By modelling the contagion path the results demonstrate that the euro area banking system insists to be markedly vulnerable and conducive to systemic risks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

More specifically, the effect of married individuals' subjective beliefs of working full time after age 62 on household wealth was analyzed. Individuals' perceptions of the usual retirement age on the job was used as an instrument for their subjective beliefs of working full time after age 62. On a whole, the point estimates suggested that the responsiveness of married mens' saving behavior to retirement dates expectations was larger than that of married women. In particular, wealth of married households where men had the bargaining power in terms of being sole earners, exhibited the largest decrease in response to increases in subjective probabilities of working past age 62.","[Romm, Aylit] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Romm, AT (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa.",aylit.romm@wits.ac.za,,"Romm, Aylit/0000-0003-2217-6827",Economic Research Southern Africa,Economic Research Southern Africa,The author would like to thank Economic Research Southern Africa for financial support.,,51,7,7,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Our study investigates the permanent sales hypothesis (PSH) of firms' investment; it examines whether investment decisions are influenced by changes in the permanent, in contrast to transitory, component of sales income increases. Using the co-integration test and the structural vector auto-regression (SVAR) framework, our paper finds strong support for the hypothesis that investment behavior is primarily explained by permanent changes in sales income. Empirical multiple time series regression results also confirm that investments are a function of a number of past yearly sales changes. Our results show that larger, more liquid, and lower debt ratio firms follow PSH more closely than smaller, less liquid, higher debt ratio firms. Recent studies on corporate investment (i.e., Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen, 1988) have argued that the higher the dependence on the internal source of funding of the investment, the stronger the severity of financing constraints. Our study shows that the more dependent on the permanent cumulative increase of internal source of funding a firm's funding on investment, the less financially constrained firms.

In this paper we developed an integrated econometric-ecological modeling framework that examines the impact of changing prices for agricultural commodities on grassland bird abundance in the Midwest United States. Our econometric model of land use change predicts changes in cropland acreage in response to land owner's commodity price expectations. The ecological models predict changes in species abundance for twenty-two grassland birds in response to land use change. We demonstrate one application of our results by using parameter estimates from the models to simulate the effect of the 2006-2012 corn ethanol expansion on thirteen bird species of conservation concern. We found that a relatively inelastic total cropland acreage response to expected prices likely mitigated some of the ecological impact arising from increased demand for agricultural commodities. Furthermore, we found that impacts on species abundance are heterogeneous across different species and highly sensitive to model selection. Our findings emphasize the importance of using economically driven acreage expansion scenarios when estimating the environmental impacts of land use change.","[Evans, Samuel G.; Potts, Matthew D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy Biosci Inst, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA; [Potts, Matthew D.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Evans, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Energy Biosci Inst, Energy Biosci Bldg,2151 Berkeley Way, Berkeley, CA 94704 USA.",sgevans@berkeley.edu,,,Energy Biosciences Institute,Energy Biosciences Institute,We are grateful to the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

This paper analyzes strategic effects related to the timing of such commitments. Using a two-country model, we identify a redistributive effect that undermines long-term cooperation when countries are asymmetric and side payments are unavailable. The effect enables countries to shift rents strategically via their R&D efforts under delayed cooperation. In contrast, a complementarity effect stabilizes long-term cooperation, because early commitments in abatement induce countries to invest more in low-carbon technologies, and create additional knowledge spillovers.

We use the concurrent passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and changes to the NYSE/NASDAQ listing rules (collectively, SOX) as natural experiments, to examine whether board independence improves decision making by overconfident CEOs. The results are strongly supportive: after SOX, overconfident CEOs reduce investment and risk exposure, increase dividends, improve postacquisition performance, and have better operating performance and market value. Importantly, these changes are absent for overconfident-CEO firms that were compliant prior to SOX.","[Banerjee, Suman] Univ Wyoming, Coll Business, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Humphery-Jenner, Mark] UNSW Australia, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Nanda, Vikram] Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08854 USA; [Nanda, Vikram] Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75080 USA",University of Wyoming; University of New South Wales Sydney; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Nanda, V (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Naveen Jindal Sch Management, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",vnanda@business.rutgers.edu,"nanda, vikram/P-8953-2019; Humphery-Jenner, Mark/A-6357-2010","Humphery-Jenner, Mark/0000-0002-0541-1541; nanda, vikram/0000-0003-2463-4940","Ministry of Education, Singapore; ARC DECRA grant [DE150100895]; Australian Research Council [DE150100895] Funding Source: Australian Research Council","Ministry of Education, Singapore(Ministry of Education, Singapore); ARC DECRA grant(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","We acknowledge the thoughtful comments of David Hirshleifer (the editor) and two anonymous reviewers.

We compare the relative specialization indices of the different VC investor types across several dimensions that characterize investee companies: industry, age, size, stage of development, distance from the investor and country. Our findings indicate that VC investor types in Europe differ substantially in their investment patterns when compared to one another and that, in terms of investment patterns, governmental VC investors appear to be the most distinct type of VC investor. The investment patterns of different VC investors are stable over time and similar across different European countries.

However, to explain the labor force participation rates of women between 25 and 55 years, we need to study families and gender ideologies.

(2013) under an economic framework allowing for dynamic volatility and jump intensity. Based on the model, we examine the role of the variance premium and jump risk premium in explaining S&P 500 index option prices and returns. According to the results, the variance premium is equally important as the jump risk premium in explaining the empirical option data. Whereas the incorporation of the jump risk premium improves the model fit on option prices, the incorporation of the variance premium improves the fit on option returns. In particular, the variance premium can explain both 1-month holding period returns of 2-month maturity straddles, which are significantly negative, and call returns, which decrease according to moneyness. The model incorporating the jump risk premium only has a limitation in explaining the above two stylized returns. The outperformance of the model incorporating the variance premium on option returns stems from its ability to capture the wedge between physical and risk-neutral volatilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on all news stories about a firm, not just those that report on specific CSR initiatives, and find that more socially responsible firms receive more favorable news reportage overall, i.e., they have a more positive media image. These findings are robust after controlling for potential endogeneity. Further, consistent with firms actively managing their media image, we find a stronger relation between CSR and media favorability when incentives to improve a firm's media image are high, e.g., among firms in sin industries, during periods of low investor sentiment, and prior to seasoned equity offerings. Finally, we find that for firms that demonstrate superior social responsibility and receive more favorable news reporting, there is a significant interaction between social responsibility and media favorability that increases (decreases) a firm's equity valuation (cost of capital). Our results are consistent with the media slanting their reporting in favor of good performing CSR firms. Overall, we contribute to the literature by showing that firms can influence their media coverage through a relatively subtle channel, CSR performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our findings are consistent with a concave, upward-sloping maturity structure for all markets, with the largest negative premium for the shortest term maturity. The fact that both delta-vega and delta-gamma neutral straddle combinations earn positive returns that seem uncorrelated suggests that the term structure is affected by both jump risk and volatility risk.

However, starting from above-average EFW scores (>7.7 out of 10; examples in 2010 include the UK, Switzerland, and Hong Kong) the marginal effect turns negative. Taking this interaction into account, the marginal effect is positive and statistically significant for countries starting at initial EFW scores of around 6 or less.

As individuals' temporal distance to retirement decreases, their primary retirement goal is likely to change. Younger individuals are primarily driven by desirability goals, but older individuals are driven by feasibility goals. Results from an online survey show that indeed a construal level intervention-induced global mindset increases the impact of desirability considerations on planned retirement age for younger individuals (and lowers planned retirement age), but increases the impact of feasibility considerations for older individuals (and raises planned retirement age). The findings underline the importance of taking into account heterogeneity in individuals' chronic construals of decisions when designing construal level interventions to promote later planned retirement ages.

We apply a novel term structure model to decompose bond excess returns into expected excess returns (risk premia) and the innovation part. In order to explore these risk premia and innovations, we complement macro variables by financial condition variables as possible determinants of bond excess returns. We find that the expected part of bond excess returns is driven by macro factors, whereas innovations seem to be mainly influenced by financial conditions, before and after the financial crisis. Thus, financial conditions, such as financial stress, deserve attention when analyzing bond excess returns. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

People with more family responsibilities are those that use more this practice. However, work characteristics enable the most complete profile-description of workers using flexible work arrangement practices.

The role of terrain ruggedness,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,State capacity; Terrain ruggedness; Collective action; Early urbanization,PUBLIC-GOODS; PERSISTENCE; ORIGINS; CAPACITY; INCOME; TRADE; WARS,"This article documents terrain ruggedness as an underlying cause of lack of state capacity. The paper contends that rugged topography poses significant costs to cooperation among the constituent groups within the state. This problem then translates into inability to commit to policies and under-provision of public goods, leading to such outcomes as poor protection of rule of law, limited tax revenue, civil violence, and ultimately, a weak state apparatus. Using several indicators capturing different dimensions of state capacity, the paper econometrically tests its argument in a sample of 187 independent countries and finds robust and clear evidence in favor of its reasoning. Further, the paper documents that delayed urbanization constitutes an important transmission mechanism for the significant role of terrain ruggedness in reduced state capacity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Active fund managers exhibit outperformance before costs and fees generating, on average, gross returns of 1% per annum over the benchmark portfolio constructed using past holdings (approximately the same magnitude as expenses and transaction costs combined). This suggests that fund managers are able to earn back their fees and costs. There is evidence of neutral ability to time different portfolio allocations (sector, credit quality, and portfolio maturity allocations) and only a subgroup of bond funds exhibit successful timing ability. One performance measure based on portfolio holdings predicts future fund performance and provides information not contained in the standard measures.

This paper develops a general equilibrium model to analyze the interactions and to evaluate the price and welfare effect of biofuel mandates and subsidies. Results suggest that biofuel mandates are a primary cause of some of the major concerns associated with crop-based biofuel production, including higher food prices and lower consumer welfare. The price and welfare effects of biofuel subsidies depend on the level of the biofuel mandate. When the mandate is weak or not binding, a biofuel subsidy becomes a transfer from consumers to biofuel producers, which tends to reduce food and fuel prices because of the negative income effect. However, with a strong mandate, a biofuel subsidy will increase the prices of crops, food, and fuel when crops account for a large share of production cost and when the supply of crops is inelastic. Using parameter values consistent with empirical evidence found in the U.S., we calculated the price and welfare effects of the biofuel mandates and subsidies specified in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Results suggest that the biofuel mandates and subsidies increased the price of corn by 25-40 %, increased the price of food by 1.5-2.5 %, and lowered the price of gasoline by 5-10 %. Overall, the biofuel policies had only a small effect on consumer utility.","[Wu, JunJie; Langpap, Christian] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Wu, JJ (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",junjie.wu@oregonstate.edu,,"Langpap, Christian/0000-0002-6583-6402",,,,,44,14,15,0,43,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Agricultural and manufacturing firms locate on a hemisphere. Trade is costly, firms innovate, and technology diffuses over space. Emissions from energy used in production contribute to the atmospheric stock of carbon, which increases temperature. Warming differs across latitudes and its effect on productivity varies across sectors.

We assess quantitatively the impact of migration and trade restrictions, energy taxes, and innovation subsidies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Our results provide supporting evidence that, as a result of the liquidity shock, SOFOLES faced severely restricted access to their main funding sources (commercial bank loans, loans from other organizations, and public debt markets). After controlling for the potential endogeneity of their funding, we find that the liquidity shock explains 64 percent of SOFOLES' credit contraction during the recent financial crisis (2008-2009). We use our estimates to disentangle supply from demand factors as determinants of the credit contraction. After controlling for the large decline in loan demand during the financial crisis, our findings suggest that supply factors (such as nonperforming loans and lower liquidity buffers) also played a significant role. Finally, we find that financial deregulation implemented in 2006 may have amplified the effects of the global liquidity shock.","[Berrospide, Jose M.] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Herrerias, Renata] ITAM, Dept Business Adm, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico,"Berrospide, JM (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Mailstop 153,20th & C St NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",jose.m.berrospide@frb.gov; renata.herrerias@itam.mx,"Herrerias, Renata/JBJ-7372-2023","Herrerias, Renata/0000-0001-7200-1254","Department of Finance at Boston University; Asociacion Mexicana de Cultura, A.C.","Department of Finance at Boston University; Asociacion Mexicana de Cultura, A.C.","We would like to thank Iftekhar Hasan the editor of the IFS and two anonymous reviewers for their very helpful comments and suggestions.

We conceptualize social inequality as the relative position of individuals along a number of dimensions that measure achieved outcomes and, innovatively, expectations about future outcomes. Using data from 12 Central and Eastern European countries, we find that cross-national patterns of social inequality differ significantly from patterns derived from income inequality measures. Moreover, our measure of social inequality is much better correlated than income inequality with other country differences such as higher levels of economic performance and human development, and stronger political institutions.

This, in turn, carries much sway at the political level as if there is no budget constraint or consideration of value for money and coverage. This paper presents a stated choice experiment to investigate this context as two unlabelled options described by 20 potential drivers of community preferences for improved public transport. Each choice scenario is conditioned on a given route length but with different costs, reflecting different modal investment options for the same route length. To establish whether a modal bias exists within and between geographical jurisdictions, the choice scenario is followed by a labelling of each investment option to reveal whether the option is bus rapid transit (BRT) or light rail transit (LRT). Data from all eight capital cities of Australia, collected in mid-2014, form the empirical setting. Mixed logit random regret models provide new evidence on the nature and extent of community modal bias in this choice setting. The paper also proposes a complementary tool to benefit-cost analysis that uses the residence preferences model to show, through scenario analysis, the potential gains in public support for BRT over LRT. The results suggest that BRT should be in the mix of candidate projects if more than one mode is considered and not ignored, as is so often the case in developed economies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results suggest that greater access to financing allows financially constrained firms to invest in productive projects that may otherwise not be taken up.","[Krishnan, Karthik] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA USA; [Nandy, Debarshi K.] Brandeis Univ, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; [Puri, Manju] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Puri, Manju] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northeastern University; Brandeis University; Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Puri, M (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Finance, 100 Fuqua Dr, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",manju.puri@duke.edu,,"Nandy, Debarshi/0000-0002-9435-0129",,,,,43,97,117,5,90,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

In equilibrium, R&D endogenously drives a small, persistent component in productivity that generates long-run uncertainty about economic growth. With recursive preferences, households fear that persistent downturns in economic growth are accompanied by low asset valuations and command high-risk premia in asset markets. Empirically, we find substantial evidence for innovation-driven low-frequency movements in aggregate growth rates and asset market valuations. In short, equilibrium growth is risky.","[Kung, Howard] London Business Sch, London, England; [Schmid, Lukas] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Schmid, Lukas] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of London; London Business School; Duke University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Kung, H (通讯作者)，London Business Sch, London, England.",,"Kung, Howard/O-6693-2016",,,,,,45,101,122,13,151,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

In 1974, Seoul shifted away from an exam based high school admission system, created high school districts and randomly allocated students to schools within each district. Furthermore, the city government relocated South Korea's then most prestigious high school from the city center to the city periphery in order to reduce central city congestion. I examine how residential land prices change across school districts using a first differenced boundary discontinuity design. By focusing on the immediate years before and after the creation of school districts and using general functional forms in distance, I find that residential land prices increase by about 13% points more on average and by about 26% points across boundaries in the better school district. Furthermore, there is evidence of dynamic sorting whereby the increase in neighborhood income attracts other high schools to relocate in the following years. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The study used cross-sectional data from 2009. The empirical analysis employed was based on the estimation of a twostage Heckman model and the quantile regression model. Results indicated that young married and employees get more loans than others. Furthermore, the probability of getting a loan was higher for homeowners and credit card holders. In contrast, savings negatively affected the probability of getting a loan. It was also found that amount of loan was influenced mainly by income, homeownership and the proportion of household members working. Households that saved money held small loan amounts. Age affected the high loan amount, but the effect of homeownership was higher in the low loan amount.","[Pastrapa, E.; Apostolopoulos, C.] Harokopio Univ, 70 El Venizelou Ave, Athens 17671, Greece",Harokopio University Athens,"Pastrapa, E (通讯作者)，Harokopio Univ, 70 El Venizelou Ave, Athens 17671, Greece.",epastrapa@hua.gr,,"Pastrapa, Eleni/0009-0007-2154-3732",,,,,68,6,7,0,3,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Policy-bloc firms benefit from free quota allocations, which are updated according to either firms' past emissions, or outputs. We show that the resulting abatement and its allocation between policy bloc and fringe are both inefficient. When all quotas are traded freely at a single price, the policy bloc chooses to either not constrain the offset market, leading to suboptimal policy-bloc mitigation; or ban offsets completely. The former (latter) case occurs when free allocation of quotas is not (very) generous, and the offset market is large (small). It is preferable for policy-bloc countries' governments to instead buy offsets directly from the fringe at a quota price below marginal damage cost of emissions, while the policy-bloc quota price will be above this cost. With maximization of global welfare and a unified quota price, this price is higher, and offsets constrained in fewer cases, but the solution still inefficient. Full efficiency then requires a higher quota price in the policy bloc than in the fringe.","[Rosendahl, Knut Einar] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Econ & Business, N-1432 As, Norway; [Strand, Jon] World Bank, Environm & Energy Team, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Norwegian University of Life Sciences; The World Bank,"Strand, J (通讯作者)，World Bank, Environm & Energy Team, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",knut.einar.rosendahl@nmbu.no; jstrand1@worldbank.org,,"Strand, Jon/0000-0001-8620-8504",,,,,32,6,6,1,37,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This paper estimates the social welfare function of Japan's central government from FY 1955 to 2010. We assume that the central government determines its subsidies to the local governments of prefectures to maximize a social welfare function, which is assumed to be a weighted sum of the utility of a representative resident of each prefecture. The weight on each prefecture is estimated from the amounts of subsidies using the method developed by Iritani and Tamaoka (2005). Using regression analysis, we show that the weight on a prefecture is approximately equal to the prefecture's population. The correlation coefficient between weights and populations is 0.969. This implies that the social welfare function is approximately the (unweighted) sum of the utilities of all individuals in the entire country, that is, utilitarian with identical weights on all individuals Japanese Int.

We consider three production systems: specialized crops, livestock and mixed crop-livestock farming. In general, we find specialized crop farmers to be the most vulnerable, while mixed crop-livestock farmers appear to be least vulnerable, suggesting that crop-livestock diversification is a potential coping strategy among poor subsistence farming households. We observe qualitatively similar results when we use self-reported food adequacy as the outcome. Furthermore, predicted impact shows that the climatic changes will be mildly harmful at first but will grow over time and lead to a 151 per cent loss in net revenue by the year 2080. Interestingly, we observe that crop farmers receive higher revenue when land is owned by the household, while on the other hand, livestock farmers earn more revenue when the land is communal.","[Tibesigwa, Byela; Visser, Martine; Turpie, Jane] Univ Cape Town, Environm Econ Policy Res Unit, Sch Econ, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Tibesigwa, B (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Environm Econ Policy Res Unit, Sch Econ, Private Bag, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa.",byela.tibesigwa@gmail.com; martine.visser@uct.ac.za; jane@anchorenvironmental.co.za,,"VISSER, MARTINE/0000-0003-0889-2667; Turpie, Jane/0000-0003-1220-6295",,,,,37,17,18,0,33,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Can levered intermediaries bid up risky asset prices through asset substitution? We study an economy with Financial intermediaries that issue debt and equity to buy risky assets. Asset substitution alone cannot cause bubbles because it is priced into the intermediaries' securities. But incomplete contracts and managerial agency problems can make intermediaries take excessive risk to exploit limited liability, bidding up risky asset prices. This destroys welfare through misallocation of resources. We argue that incentives for private monitoring cannot solve this problem. Finally, even without agency problems, debt subsidies will create similar effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The estimated collateral demands include initial margin and the frictional demands associated with the movement of variation margin through the network of market participants. We estimate the impact on total collateral demand of more widespread initial margin requirements, increased novation of CDS to central clearing parties (CCPs), an increase in the number of clearing members, the proliferation of CCPs of both specialized and non-specialized types, collateral rehypothecation practices, and client clearing. System-wide collateral demand is increased significantly by the application of initial margin requirements for dealers, whether or not the CDS are cleared. Given these dealer-to-dealer initial margin requirements, mandatory central clearing is shown to lower, not raise, system-wide collateral demand, provided there is no significant proliferation of CCPs. Central clearing does, however, have significant distributional consequences for collateral requirements across market participants. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using a new dataset that covers 15 of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in the U.S. and a novel identification strategy, this paper provides new evidence on the size and source of these externalities. Our results show that a property in distress affects the value of neighboring properties from the time when the borrower becomes seriously delinquent on the mortgage until well after the bank sells the property to a new owner. Properties with seriously delinquent loans within 0.1 miles are found to decrease transaction prices of non-distressed properties by approximately one percent on average. The spillovers are found to dissipate rapidly with distance and completely disappear one year after the bank sells the property to a new homeowner. Importantly, we find that the size of the externality is sensitive to the condition of foreclosed properties, as bank-owned properties in poor condition lower nearby transaction prices by 2.6% on average while those in good condition marginally raise prices. We argue that the measured price spillovers are physical externalities caused by a lack of property maintenance and not pecuniary externalities that reflect local supply or demand shocks.

Our empirical findings suggest that return spillover is asymmetric in two aspects: the sign of the shock (good news or bad news) and the origin of the shock (interbank market or exchange market). Good news originating in the exchange market leads to higher interbank returns while bad news has no significant impact By contrast, both good and bad news from the interbank market lead to higher exchange returns, albeit in different sizes. In relation to volatility asymmetry, exchange T-bond volatility increases are significantly higher for negative exchange T-bond return shocks than for positive ones. In contrast, interbank T-bond volatility behavior is empirically indistinguishable from a symmetric process. Furthermore, there only exists a pattern of volatility spillover from the exchange T-bond market into the interbank T-bond market. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

I treat the designation of land-grant universities in the 1860s as a natural experiment after controlling for the confounding factors with a combination of synthetic control methods and event-study analyses. Three key results are obtained. First, the designation increased local population density by 6 percent within 10 years and 45 percent in 80 years. Second, the designation did not change the relative size of local manufacturing sector. Third, the designation enhanced local manufacturing output per worker by $2136 (1840 dollars; 57 percent) in 80 years while the short-run effects were negligible. This positive effect on the productivity in non-education sectors suggests the existence of local spillovers from universities. Over an 80-year horizon, my results indicate that the increase in manufacturing productivity reflects both the impact of direct spillovers from universities and general agglomeration economies that arise from the increase in population.

We then use nonparametric projections to compute a robust estimate of the conditional covariance between stock market returns and our daily economic activity index. We find that the new conditional covariance risk measure plays an important role in explaining time variation in the equity risk premium.

Using a sample of 120 publicly listed companies in Vietnam covering a 4-year period from 2008 to 2011, we examine this relationship in a dynamic modelling framework, which controls for potential sources of endogeneity. We find that board gender diversity appears to have an effect on firm performance. This finding remains robust when alternative proxies for gender diversity are employed and is consistent with the perspectives of agency theory and resource dependence theory. The number of female directors in the boardroom also matters, supporting the view that if female board representation affects firm outcomes, this effect is more pronounced when the number of female directors increases. It is observed, furthermore, that the marginal positive performance effect of board gender diversity ceases when the percentage of female directors reaches a breakpoint of about 20%. This finding suggests that there is perhaps a potential trade-off between the costs and benefits of board gender diversification. Our findings significantly contribute to the growing literature of non-US based studies, by providing robust empirical evidence from a transitional economy in East Asia.

However, more subjective aspects of the social network, such as social satisfaction and loneliness hardly received any attention in travel behavior research, whereas these aspects are very important in shaping quality of life. In this study, a path analysis is used to analyze the relationships between personal characteristics, neighborhood characteristics, travel behavior, social interactions, social satisfaction and loneliness. The analyses are based on data collected in Eindhoven and surrounding towns in the Netherlands in a survey among 177 respondents. Results show relationships between mobility and social aspects. They indicate that frequency of walking affects social satisfaction, frequency of cycling affects the number of social interactions and car ownership affects loneliness. Regarding the neighborhood characteristics, interesting results are found as well. The percentage of non-western ethnic minorities in the neighborhood is found to negatively affect social satisfaction, social cohesion is found to affect the number of social interactions and place attachment is found to affect loneliness.

This finding echoes recent explanations of the value and growth stock market anomaly.

We show that rationing depends on various dimensions of the firm-bank relationships and that the effects of relationship lending on rationing are not identical for different firm size groups. Multiple-banking increases the probability of rationing for small and large firms. Debt concentration with the main bank affects positively smaller firms, while the opposite is true for large companies. The length of the relationship with the main bank decreases the probability of rationing for both groups, but more so for large firms endowed with more bargaining power. Finally, the firm-bank spatial proximity, measured by the headquarters' vicinity, does not affect the firm's access to credit. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The game is played by groups of either five individuals or five two-person teams with either fixed or random re-matching protocols. When groups are fixed, teams perform at least as well as individuals, if not better, in terms of coordinating to the payoff dominant outcome. But with random re-matching, teams experience pervasive coordination failures. A public recommendation to a strategy or a performance bonus exhorting players to coordinate to the payoff-dominant equilibrium has similar impact on coordination for both individuals and teams playing with fixed matching. However, coordination is far more difficult to achieve with teams playing under random re-matching. Our results have implications for the design of work-groups in organizations.

Held technology should have a notable impact, especially in contexts in which specific know-how resides with experts as well as within organizational routines that are difficult to reproduce. By acquiring a target, firms obtain novel technologies, along with the knowledge and capabilities necessary to implement them. Such acquisitions become more relevant as the complexity of the technologies increases. With a focus on the US hospital market-in which technology is a relevant factor and complexity has been growing-the hypotheses tests use data from 222 mergers and acquisitions that took place between 1985 and 2000. The results confirm that technology is a fundamental driver of the US hospital consolidation process: hospitals prefer targets that hold a different set of technologies from their own, especially when those technologies are complex and involve some know-how that is difficult to replicate.","[Mas, Nuria] IESE Business Sch, Jaime Grego Chair Healthcare Management, Barcelona, Spain; [Mas, Nuria] PPSRC, Barcelona, Spain; [Valentini, Giovanni] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Technol, Milan, Italy; [Valentini, Giovanni] Bocconi Univ, CRIOS, Milan, Italy",University of Navarra; IESE Business School; Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Valentini, G (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Technol, Milan, Italy.",nmas@iese.edu; giovanni.valentini@unibocconi.it,,,"Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia [ECO2009-13169, ECO2012-38134]; AGAUR [2009 SGR919]",Ministerio de Educacion y Ciencia(Spanish Government); AGAUR(Agencia de Gestio D'Ajuts Universitaris de Recerca Agaur (AGAUR)),"The authors are grateful to L.

While most of the previous studies have focused on tournament vs. piece-rate schemes, the originality of our study consists in examining the gender gap in the context of a flat wage scheme. Our data indicate that females exert a significantly higher effort than men in fixed payment schemes. We find however no gender difference in performance under the tournament scheme, due to a combination of two effects. On the one hand, men more significantly increase their effort when switching from a flat wage to a tournament scheme. On the other hand, when switching from the flat wage to a tournament scheme, women have less margin to increase performance since their effort was already relatively high with a flat wage. We also find that females are more likely than males to choose a flat-wage scheme than a tournament. This gap however narrows dramatically when feedback on previous experience is provided.

What that evidence does not consider, however, is the fact that differences in socioeconomic status (SES) may seriously distort the reallocation of intergenerational flows. Mexico has long been a country permeated by high levels of inequality, it is then necessary to include its effects in the analysis of intergenerational transfers. Furthermore, age reallocations of economic flows do change over time and such changes might also involve greater economic inequality. In this paper, I assess the effects of SES inequality on the reallocation of intergenerational flows using NTA estimates for two particular years, 1994 and 2004. I show that the reallocation of economic resources, mainly to children and the elderly, by SES changed substantially within this period. The main intergenerational effects associated with SES inequality are: ( a) equalizing effects of labor income and remittances, (b) higher progressivity of public cash and educational transfers, and (c) crowding-out effects between private and public transfers among the elderly.

As a possible explanation of this differential effect, we explore whether government legitimacy (measured by satisfaction with the way democracy works) influences how a certain government size affects growth. On the positive side, a government perceived as legitimate may get away with being big since legitimacy can affect behavioral response to, and therefore the economic growth cost of, taxation and government expenditures. On the negative side, perceived legitimacy may make voters less prone to acquire information, which in turn facilitates interest-group oriented or populist policies that harm growth. A panel-data analysis of up to 30 developed countries, in which two different measures of the size of government are interacted with government legitimacy, reveals that perceived legitimacy exacerbates a negative growth effect of government size in the long run. This could be interpreted as governments taking advantage of being regarded as legitimate in order to secure short-term support at a long-term cost to the economy.","[Berggren, Niclas; Bjornskov, Christian] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Berggren, Niclas] Univ Econ, Dept Inst Environm & Expt Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Bjornskov, Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Lipka, David] Angloamer Univ, Sch Int Relat & Diplomacy, Prague 11800, Czech Republic; [Lipka, David] Univ JE Purkyne, Usti Nad Labem 40096, Czech Republic",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Prague University of Economics & Business; Aarhus University; Anglo-American University; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Berggren, N (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, POB 55665, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",niclas.berggren@ifn.se; chbj@econ.au.dk; david.lipka@aauni.edu,"lipka, david/K-8572-2012; Berggren, Niclas/N-3578-2019","Berggren, Niclas/0000-0003-0673-5123",Institute for Research in Economic and Fiscal Issues (IREF); Swedish Research Council; Johan & Jakob Soderberg's Foundation,Institute for Research in Economic and Fiscal Issues (IREF); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Johan & Jakob Soderberg's Foundation,"The authors wish to thank Andreas Bergh, Enrico Colombatto, Jerg Gutmann, Pelin Ayan Musil, Christoph Schenke, participants at the Institute for Research in Economic and Fiscal Issues (IREF) and Anglo-American University workshop in Prague and participants at the Public Choice Society Meetings in Charleston for useful comments and suggestions, and the Institute for Research in Economic and Fiscal Issues (IREF) (all), the Swedish Research Council (Berggren) and Johan & Jakob Soderberg's Foundation (Berggren) for financial support.

In view of these design shortcomings, the EU VAT is in danger of becoming an anachronism compared with modern VATs elsewhere.

The majority of recent research has focused on appropriately measuring the underfunding. In this paper, we employ a political economy framework to show that increases in partisan polarization and electoral uncertainty lead to greater underfunding. Using an unbalanced panel of individual pension plans, we find robust empirical evidence that higher legislative turnover rates, more electoral competition, and term limits all lead to more pension underfunding.

Our results indicate an overall decline in efficiency and no evidence of group convergence following the financial crisis.

The dimensions of country-level governance at macroeconomic level will be captured by using the following six indicators developed by the World Bank: 1. Voice and accountability; 2. Political stability and absence of violence; 3. Government effectiveness; 4. Regulatory quality; 5. Rule of law; 6. Control of corruption. To capture the quality of business environment we use the Ease of doing business index developed by the World Bank in its Doing Business report series. To measure entrepreneurship we use the World Bank Group Entrepreneurship Survey where the number of new registered businesses, as a percentage of the working age population is defined as a measure of formal entrepreneurship. In order to capture the extent to which country-level governance does influence business environment and entrepreneurship, we analyze the data using cross-sectional time-series random effects generalized least square (GLS) models. The results of this panel data analysis clarifies and quantifies the influence that various characteristics of country-level governance could have on business environment and entrepreneurship.

Different from the physical structure, the city structure beneath the complex travel-flow system shows the inherent connection patterns within the city. On the basis of taxi-trip data from Shanghai, we built spatially embedded networks to model intra-city spatial interactions and to introduce network science methods into the analysis. The community detection method is applied to reveal sub-regional structures, and several network measures are used to examine the properties of sub-regions. Considering the differences between long- and short-distance trips, we reveal a two-level hierarchical polycentric city structure in Shanghai. Further explorations of sub-network structures demonstrate that urban sub-regions have broader internal spatial interactions, while suburban centers are more influential on local traffic. By incorporating the land use of centers from a travel-pattern perspective, we investigate sub-region formation and the interaction patterns of center-local places. This study provides insights into using emerging data sources to reveal travel patterns and city structures, which could potentially aid in developing and applying urban transportation policies. The sub-regional structures revealed in this study are more easily interpreted for transportation-related issues than for other structures, such as administrative divisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The fundamental changes in economic situations (i.e. the 2000 high-tech bubble; the 2008 global financial crisis) had substantial impact on the US VC industry. In response to these dramatic changes, venture firms adjust their risk preferences and investment strategies by securing fewer deals with a smaller average amount per deal in general, increasing their allocations to the expansion and later-stage investments, and injecting a lower percent of cash in the first several financing sequences as opposed to their total committed investments to a company.

Overall the public transport distribution of the three socially disadvantaged groups was identified to be less equitable when compared to the population as a whole. The elderly had the most inequitable distribution of population relative to other cohorts. Perth's population exhibits a 0.52 Gini coefficient suggesting a relatively unequal spatial distribution of services to the population. However, this is much better than Melbourne (at 0.68).

Therefore, highly leveraged firms may lose potential profits from profitable investment opportunities in which they are unable to invest. On the other hand, highly leveraged small businesses can enhance their performance because banks and trade creditors monitor their activity and prevent inefficient management. Using small-business data for Japan, we empirically investigate the relationship between firm performance and leverage. We find, first, that highly leveraged small businesses increase their trade payables less even if they have investment opportunities. Second, highly leveraged small businesses convert more bills receivables into cash by selling them to finance companies to finance their growth opportunities. Third, highly leveraged firms enjoy stronger performance (measured as firm sales growth or profitability) compared with low-leveraged firms. These results highlight the benefits of high leverage for small businesses.","Nihon Univ, Coll Econ, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo 1028360, Japan",Nihon University,"Tsuruta, D (通讯作者)，Nihon Univ, Coll Econ, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-2 Misaki Cho, Tokyo 1028360, Japan.",tsuruta.daisuke@nihon-u.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24730275] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,30,21,26,2,69,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Nevertheless, Indonesia's rapid domestic-market growth has allowed it to attract foreign automotive investment without having to offer excessively generous incentives. While the continued entry of foreign suppliers of auto parts into Indonesia offers opportunities for local suppliers to upgrade their productive capabilities, it also limits their chances of becoming first-tier suppliers themselves.

Lending by state banks in high income countries is even countercyclical. On the liability side, state banks expand their total liabilities and, in particular, their non-deposit liabilities relatively little during booms. Public banks also report loan non-performance more evenly over the business cycle. Overall our results suggest that state banks can play a useful role in stabilizing credit over the business cycle as well as during periods of financial instability. However, the track record of state banks in credit allocation remains quite poor, questioning the wisdom of using state banks as a short term countercyclical tool. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

While we observe that market frictions account to some extent for negative spreads, we also found that volatility and liquidity widen spread magnitude, suggesting that speculation dominates arbitrage in this market. Puzzlingly, we found that informed trading impacts spreads in the opposite manner, depending on whether the contract is near expiration, highlighting the importance of controlling for expiration in basis-spread tests.

After 1990, a new reality gave birth to the opposite term: deindustrialisation. The primordial foundation underlying the development of industry in the 20th century, and particularly in its mid-third, was the manufacturing of metal, and especially steel. Following the two shock-waves in 1973 and 1978, when rocketing prices shook the oil industry, the production of steel reversed its trend in the majority of the developed countries, and mostly in the European Union member states, where, after 1990, steel production had a much lower, or, sometimes, a negative, rate of growth. This was paralleled by a growing volume of the trade in scrap iron. Encouraged by the generous principle of free circulation of products, such a trade seems, however, to be in contradiction with the principles of sustainable development, reduction of carbon emissions, and energy saving, promoted by the EU.

In this context, the paper proposes a system of indicators to encourage, recognize and reward the economic competitiveness in the companies and in its basic structures-plant, department, team and place of work. Since increasing competitiveness must be accompanied by the establishment, maintenance and increasing welfare, within the performance indicators a special attention is given to physical indicators, a fundamental condition to overcome the economic and financial crisis.

Among other issues, past studies have explored the potential for predicting these ratings using a variety of explanatory factors and modeling approaches. This paper describes a multi-criteria classification approach that combines accounting data with a structural default prediction model in order to obtain improved predictions and test the incremental information that a structural model provides in this context. Empirical results are presented for a panel data set of European listed firms during the period 2002 2012. The analysis indicates that a distance-to-default measure obtained from a structural model adds significant information compared to popular financial ratios. Nevertheless, its power is considerably weakened when market capitalization is also considered. The robustness of the results is examined over time and under different rating category specifications.

After applying classical tests of non-stationarity to a series of participating banks' LIBOR quotes, we detected some significant breaks in the data that correspond to significant economic events, namely Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy or central banks' decisions. Our conclusion is that a possible manipulation, confirmed ex post in the FSA report, can be deduced throughout the crisis period as a result of the behavior of the coefficients in a linear three-regime Threshold Regression model.

In 2010 International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) was founded and one year later it launched the pilot programme in order to find the basis for development of integrated reporting principles. Over 100 businesses all around the world participate in this programme and adopt integrated reporting principles. In our study we focus on the early adopters and investigate how the reporting changed since the adoption of IR. We investigate the reports before and after entry to this programme, i.e. years 2010 - 2014. We examine the number of disclosures, their form and use of information technology in connection with business sector, public or private sector and listed or non-listed entities.

A high population growth and erosion caused by deforestation can be considered the most serious one. The need for housing is increasing while deforestation causes a lack of sustainable and appropriate timber for construction. A challenge facing the Ethiopian society is thus to give a growing population opportunities to obtain decent, sustainable and affordable housing. One way to achieve this is to use adobe technology, which means that houses are built with sun-dried clay blocks. Used correctly, the adobe technology has many benefits. The main advantages are that the technique is relatively simple, local materials can be used and that timber demand is low. Because of this, the technology also has many advantages from a sustainability perspective. In Ethiopia, most attempts with the adobe technology have been less successful without lasting impacts. In this paper, the reasons for this are discussed. Six cases where adobe has been used are described an analysed. Many factors have been identified as being important for the diffusion of the technology, i.e., a strong champion, market and risk factors, cultural factors creating stigma and basic training.

The paper presents the process of the health care costs estimation in the regions of the Czech Republic by applying the empirical Bayesian credibility models. The credibility costs combines individual regional experience and collective experience through the credibility factor. The credibility factor expresses the level of confidence in individual risk experience and takes into account heterogeneity of portfolio and amount of experience within the portfolio.

However, the clients' first requirements may not address their real needs. The possibility to choose between multiple design solutions and the iteration of possible design solutions are important to clients. Knotworking is suggested as a working method to give designers the possibility to iterate their designs and combine each practitioner's expertise. Knotworking is a new way to work as a group for a short period of time to accomplish a task. It enables the client to take part in an early phase of design by actively commenting on and discussing solutions with designers, while obtaining realistic data from different design alternatives to help in decision-making. In the construction industry, the client's participation in knotworking is new. This study describes the client's participation in knotworking and how the client can benefit from knotworking. The data of the study consists of recordings of two one-day knots organized by the client in the early phase of design of a school building in Finland. In the knots, the client acted as an informant about the initial data and requirements and steered the design to fulfil the client's and users' needs. With the help of the results of knotworking, the client was also able to specify the needs and set new goals for the design work. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Moreover, many states were afraid of the impact of the implementation of the CCCTB system on the volume of tax revenues.

Even in distinct institutional settings, our empirical results reaffirm the well-known inverse relationship of returns and credit risk, which is robust with regard to cross-sectional and time-series scrutiny. We reveal that the underperformance of low-rated firms around their rating downgrades, when they are subject to both severe illiquidity and short-sale constraints, partially explains the abnormal returns of long-short portfolios, although the returns remain substantial when data associated with downgrades is removed. When targeting delisted firms, we observe that delistings among the lowest-rated firms exhibit extremely poor returns near the time of their downgrades. We find that the abnormal returns become insignificant in the long-short portfolio in the sample, from which delistings are excluded. Our empirical evidence suggests that market mispricing of delisted stocks near the time of their downgrades is a primary cause of the credit risk puzzle.

Without a conceptual framework, the bad accounting practices would triumph over the good accounting practices. Prudence, one of the oldest and the most well-known accounting concepts, although eliminated from the accounting conceptual framework in 2010, continues to draw attention. At an international level, opinions are divided. Each of the two accounting models, continental and Anglo-Saxon, have their say. Therefore, prudence should be maintained within the conceptual framework, according to the French Accounting Standards Authority, while the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) disagrees with its reintroduction. The discussions related to the reintroduction of prudence within the conceptual framework are concentrated either around the idea of prudence, but without a conservative basis, or around the idea of conservatism. However, starting from the idea that a cautious attitude in financial reporting is justified by the need to protect the investor's interests of the reporting entity, in the past years a number of decisions were taken both at the European and international level. The motivation for choosing this topic resides precisely in the novelty of the subject. We believe that the differences between the two points of view, the traditionalist one pertaining to the European Union, on the one hand, and the progressive one corresponding to IASB, on the other hand, in terms of the role of prudence in accounting, represents a subject of research.

Meeting the needs of customers is examined through a questionnaire survey. Customer satisfaction is thus a marker of quality of the final production of the enterprise. By linking customer satisfaction and financial performance, measured through the concept of INFA model, there is link between the issues of enterprise competitiveness and the quality of the final production. Methodically, article is based on the model under which it is assumed that if the enterprise is able to produce the positive-customer-rate final production, customers are willing to make greater and repeated purchases, thus it positively reflects in the volume of final production sold, or at prices of final products, and hence in the profit. Better corporate results in financial indicators of turnover and profit are then reflected also in better business performance results, respectively in the ability of enterprises to achieve even better results in the evaluation according to modified INFA model. On the base of verification of the abovementioned hypothesis - about relationship between the level of customer satisfaction and business financial performance - it is possible to speak about conclusions about the ability of enterprises managers, respectively its owners, to make decisions supporting the competitiveness of the company itself.","[Marinic, Peter] Masaryk Univ, Dept Business Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41-A, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Marinic, P (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Business Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41-A, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",marinic@mail.muni.cz,"Marinič, Peter/AAW-5203-2020","Marinič, Peter/0000-0001-9232-8713",,,,,8,0,0,0,3,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4200-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,590,595,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF1SG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380432500069,0

Thus, each stakeholder may influence a project negatively or positively. The literature suggests that the concepts of stakeholder, participation, social sustainability and sustainable development are intertwined and together can contribute to social change. To enhance transparency and involvement of a wide range of stakeholders, there is a need for a systematic process of stakeholder collaboration in urban property development projects. This paper describes two internal project meetings of a case study of a property development project with the aim to achieve sustainable development. Collaboration, participation and new forms of organising are needed to achieve sustainable property development. Stakeholder participation can contribute to this by providing forums for a dialogue and interactions in projects. Furthermore, institutionalisation, organisational change and commitment in project organisations are needed to safeguard good participation practice. These could be facilitated through action research-based, collaborative interventions where theory and practice contribute to desired organisational change. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The empirical results demonstrate that a few bank-specific variables do significantly influence credit risk of Malaysia Islamic banks. The findings show that financing quality and capital ratio demonstrate consistent results regardless of specification and estimation models. The inclusion of ownership status also suggests that there is a significant difference between the local and foreign ownership Islamic banks in this regard.

The reason is the effectiveness and efficiency of an audit depends on auditor's ability to accurately assess the existing audit risks (Jones, 2004). Applying to that, Malaysian Approved Standards on Auditing AI 240 on Fraud and Error, provides recommendation to auditors in assessing the client's likelihood of fraud risks based on the three elements of fraud triangle concept; opportunity, pressure and rationalization. Ideally, this audit standard highlighted the importance of auditors' to evaluate these elements as it will assist them to understand their clients' fraud reasoning motives and thus, properly assess the potential fraud risks that might be occurred. Based on the risk assessment, the auditors are required to plan the audit procedures in order to detect any material misstatement that may lead to fraud or error. In this study, as established in the ISA240, the fraud triangle concept has been used to examine the direct and interaction effect of the following fraud risk factors: (1) internal control system (opportunity); (2) pressure and; (3) type of auditors (internal and external auditors) on fraud risk assessment. An experimental research approach is adopted by sending a set of case scenarios to 129 auditors, comprises of both internal and external auditors. The respondents were required to complete two different case scenarios, where the level of internal controls and pressures were being manipulated; high and low. The results showed that there are significant relationships between each risk factors and fraud risk assessment. Furthermore, the results of the interaction effects (combination of two variables) also show significant effect on fraud risk assessment. The findings of this study may provide insights into the auditors' judgment in assessing fraud risk. It is also could be beneficial to the auditors to increase their awareness of the importance to understand their client's fraud motives during fraud risk assessment task and thus, improve the audit quality.

At European level, the main objective in energy independence, along with the desire to protect the environment, is that energy mix used by each individual state to be dominated by the idea of increasing energy efficiency satisfying consumption with minimal financial effort. The principal aim is to minimize the financial effort of the final consumer; this goal can be attained only through the involvement of financial levers of state power. The low level of state involvement in energy efficiency would create huge costs for final consumers, with devastating effects on all market participants.

At the beginning of this paper we have presented the motivations of this research, highlighting and explaining the specific factors which influence the density and insurance penetration. Implementation of Solvency Directive at European level, in the field of insurance and its transition from Solvency I to Solvency II is through specific consequences, an important motivation for the development of this sector of the national economy. The changes made to accounting legislation at national, European and international level, with immediate consequences on specific information presented in the financial statements of insurance companies, was another predominant reason of our research. The appearance of International Financial Reporting Standards in general, particularly the IFRS 4 named Insurance contracts, followed by its evolution phases (from Phase I to Phase II) allowed the creation of XBRL's in as the international standard of publication, exchange and financial analysis of data reported. Also, we cannot forget that the legislative changes in accounting have interesting consequences on economic risk management specific to this field, in terms of huge efforts from national and European supervisory authorities to control and prevent the bankruptcy of its firms.

The key difference between the previous studies is that in this paper we are concentrated on single barrier options. Barrier options were formed to provide risk managers with cheaper means to hedge their exposures without paying for the price changes they believed unlikely to occur. The methodology is based on the profit functions in analytical form. We propose various hedging possibilities and show its practical application. In our analysis we used vanilla and barrier European options on SPDR Gold Shares.

In order for the activity-based accounting to be implemented in a Russian company, it is necessary to open one group of accounts for usual responsibility and resource accounting purposes and another group of accounts to record costs by activities. These two groups of accounts are linked through the special temporary reflecting account. In order to do resource and responsibility accounting, a medium-size distribution company opened three accounts in accordance with its organizational structure: General Administration, Warehouse, and Fleet of Trucks. Each account had subaccounts for the resources consumed in the cost center (personnel, equipment, building, and inventory). To record costs by activities, the following accounts were opened for main business processes: Take and Process Customer Order, Complete Customer Order, Deliver Customer Orders, Finance Accounts Receivable Balances. Driving resource expenses to activities is recorded on the account Tracing Costs to Activities, which contains subaccounts for each activity mentioned in the Activity Dictionary. This account also allows accountants to apply standard costing approach in ABC-environment. Finally, to drive activity costs to customers of a distribution company, it is necessary to open subaccounts for major customers or distribution channels to traditional accounts Sales and Income Summary.

While in the past Czech exports were dominated by raw commodities, in nowadays Czech exports are based on semi finalized or already finalized agricultural and foodstuff products. The Czech agrarian imports are dominated by noncompetitive products. Despite of decreasing the share of agricultural trade in total Czech Foreign trade activities, the values of agrarian exports and imports are constantly increasing. The aim of the article is to identify the main tendencies and trends in territorial and commodity structure of the Czech foreign agrarian trade and paper is also identifying changes which have occurred in period after the EU accession. The paper provides the following results. The EU share in the Czech agricultural trade reaches about 90% in the long-term. Within the EU, the Czech Republic is oriented strongly on trade with new member states. In relation to the third countries, the CIS, EFTA and OECD countries belong to the most important export territories. Imports to the Czech Republic from third countries come mostly from developing countries. The Czech agricultural exports are based on a relatively small number of commodity aggregations, which represent a substantial part of the export value. The share of processed and semi-processed products increases and exceeded already 70%. The Czech agricultural market still does not have any profiled structure of comparative advantages.","[Smutka, Lubos; Steininger, Michal; Maitah, Mansoor; Skubna, Ondrej] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Smutka, L (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",smutka@pef.czu.cz,"Škubna, Ondřej/H-6992-2018; Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015; Steininger, Michal/H-3191-2018; Maitah, Mansoor/G-7556-2014","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333; Steininger, Michal/0000-0002-8121-8567; Maitah, Mansoor/0000-0003-2797-3155",,,,,14,19,19,0,13,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,385,392,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600043,0

Thus, the two central actors involved in architectural competitions, architects and building clients, are continually influenced by such developments, interpreting and adapting to changes according to their interests and horizons. During a project reviewing Nordic research literature on architectural competitions, a series of interviews was conducted with building clients as well as architects, focusing on the impact of the above-mentioned changes within the building sector on architectural competitions as an institution. In the interviews, ICT and not least BIM was a recurring theme that both parties saw as having a positive impact on competitions. But when looking closely into the answers, these revealed diverse understandings of how and why the impact of BIM on competitions could be said to be positive. The paper sheds light on the interaction between the actors (building clients, architects and client consultants) and the applied technologies (competition forms, ICT tools, directives) in architectural competitions in a theoretical actor-network perspective. The diverging understandings of the role of BIM are demonstrating one of many negotiations in progress in the network of architectural competitions. BIM is transformed from an inscription device visually representing the competition proposals to form an actant that challenges the very concept of architectural competition. The objective of the paper is to contribute to the understanding of BIM used in the kind of network that an architectural competition constitutes, and thereby give professional actors a possibility to act on the basis of a wider understanding of interrelations mediated by BIM.

The subsidy takes form of reduced rent which is financed both by the private owners and municipalities (i.e. public budgets). Besides the reduction of such subsidy, de-regulation process aims to improve effectiveness of housing market. This might increase overall mobility of households with subsequent potential positive impacts on diverse economic indicators. Our analysis deals with one potential impact of rent deregulation process - changes in tenure choice patterns. Existing literature defines several typical factors which influence this key decision every household has to make. The paper examines the potential factors using an econometric model drawing on sample data (the panel data based on investigation of EU-SILC) in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In our analysis we propose one more factor which might be of interest. Based on the Czech data covering the period of the rent deregulation process in 2007-2011 we assess to what extent rent deregulation itself has influenced the tenure choice patterns. Our analysis using probit model did prove that regulated rents were an important factor affecting tenure choice in the Czech Republic. After deregulation households living in apartments with regulated rent preferred to buy house rather than stay in rental sector.","[Spalek, Jiri; Spalkova, Dagmar] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Spalek, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic.",spalek@econ.muni.cz; dasa@econ.muni.cz,"Špalková, Dagmar/H-6423-2013; Špalek, Jiří/J-9210-2012; Špalková, Dagmar/JWO-4070-2024","Špalková, Dagmar/0000-0001-6977-1426; Špalek, Jiří/0000-0001-5832-4946;",,,,,17,0,0,0,1,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA & PRAZE,PRAHA 3,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAHA 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2094-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,256,261,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5NF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389582500044,0

The effects of different variables of financial analysis, such as profitability ratios, activity ratios, liquidity ratios and leverage ratios, are studied in this research. The results show that the years 2007 and 2008 were very risky for enterprises. Although the indicators show that Czech farmers had a satisfactory level of economic efficiency, the financial crises had an obvious impact. The results also indicate that the agricultural sector was able to overcome these obstacles. Liquidity ratios, in particular, showed good results.

Firstly it endeavours to explain the mechanism of the financial and real economy functioning with an emphasis on banking sector. The initial theoretical model is considered as unrealistic but proper for demonstration of the consequences of money endogeneity, mechanism of banking financing and dependency of economic growth on credit growth and savings. On the basis of this explanation the article identifies the real causes of credit cycles in the current credit-economy and performs some relevant empirical evidence. The causes include insufficient credit growth, significant concentration of monetary assets, disproportionate development between inflation and excess money growth, deregulation, transmission of credit risk, deleveraging of private sector and imperfect steering of interest rates. Subsequently, author constitutes the basic political-economic tools which could possibly eliminate (or at least mitigate) both the deep and shallow recessions in ex-ante and ex-post periods. The study concludes that possible political-economic tools are following: traditional and non-traditional monetary policy, fiscal expansion, redistribution through progressive taxation, microeconomic and macroeconomic regulation.

This approach evaluates efficiency score of a DMU as the maximum ratio of the weighted sum of outputs to the weighted sum of inputs subject to the condition that corresponding ratios for each DMU be less than or equal to one. From the theoretical and the computational points of view, strict positivity of the weights is an important and controversial condition to identify an efficient DMU. One significant method to achieve this condition is considering a positive lower bound on weights, known as non-Archimedean infinitesimal epsilon, nevertheless under some conditions the selected value for epsilon is quite small (sometimes even smaller than the zero tolerance of the computer). There is a two-phase approach which evaluates the efficiency of DMUs in envelopment model without determining a suitable value for epsilon, however it fails to give us a set of positive weights. In fact, finding a set of positive weights among all alternative solutions of multiplier model is a technical challenge in DEA. To meet the challenge, we propose a new two-phase approach which deals with multiplier model and determines positive weights, if there are. A case study of Iranian banking industry is taken as an example to illustrate the potential application of the suggested approach.

SMEs, account for approximately one-third of GDP, over 50% of the value added, 99% of the share of total registered enterprises, and represent 60% of total employment in the Czech Republic. In the light of this background, the paper explores the influence of some macroeconomic variables on SMEs growth in the Czech Republic for the period 1995-2013. In order to assess the impacts of the selected variables on SMEs growth, we employed an econometric technique. Our findings suggest a concave relationship between unemployment and SMEs growth in the Czech Republic. More precisely, it signifies that beyond a turning point, unemployment is likely to slow down SMEs growth in the country. Our results further hint at a positive relationship between economic growth and SMEs growth. However, our empirical estimates showed an insignificant relationship between domestic credit provided by the financial sector and SMEs growth in the country. The government of the Czech Republic should continue to provide an enabling investment climate and support for bolstering a sustainable SMEs development. For instance, the government should provide easier access and affordable credits and loans to SMEs and reduce bureaucratic bottlenecks.","[Verter, Nahanga; Becvarova, Vera] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Dev Studies, Brno, Czech Republic; [Osakwe, Christian Nedu; Chovancova, Miloslava] Tomas Bata Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Zlin, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Verter, N (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Dev Studies, Brno, Czech Republic.",xverter@mendelu.cz; osakwe@fame.utb.cz; chovancova@fame.utb.cz; vera.becvarova@mendelu.cz,"Bečvářová, Věra/E-4321-2018; Osakwe, Christian Nedu/E-2558-2015; Verter, Nahanga/E-4845-2018; Osakwe, Chris N./AAN-6706-2020; Chovancova, Miloslava/H-6542-2012","Verter, Nahanga/0000-0002-5889-134X; Becvarova, Vera/0000-0003-2015-574X; Chovancova, Miloslava/0000-0002-9244-9563",,,,,33,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,977,987,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000106,0

To reveal current situation in mentioned area, primary research on employee development in agriculture and forestry was driven. The aim of the paper is to describe and identify approaches to talent management and development in selected organisations in the Czech Republic and to analyse those approaches to evaluate the situation and formulate suggestions. The data were collected in 101 organisations operating in rural economy by CAWI and CATI method. The sample selection took into account the size of the organisation. Only respondents from upper or top management were answering the questionnaire. One respondent per organisation was questioned. The primary data were evaluated using the tools of descriptive statistics, analysis of correlation, and also, dependence among qualitative characteristics was tested for verification of the obtained data and their further analyses (multidimensional statistics). The results show orientation of surveyed organisations on development and education; 64% of respondents are being regularly developed on their job position and 12% are being developed for their future position or position on which they aspire. Total 54% of surveyed employees aspire on higher position (managerial or specialist). The impulse to development is mostly own ambition of each employee (58%). Only 12% of surveyed respondents are neither developed by themselves nor by organisation at all. The outputs of the survey were statistically tested on selected level of significance. 50 per cent of surveyed organisations in agribusiness are focused on development of their employees. They use either talent management, personnel planning or performance management. The results allow prediction of further development activities in the Czech Republic.","[Vnouckova, Lucie] Univ Econ & Management, Dept Management, Narozni 2600-9a, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic; [Urbancova, Hana] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Smolova, Helena] Univ Econ & Management, Dept Mkt, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Vnoucková, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ & Management, Dept Management, Narozni 2600-9a, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic.",lucie.vnouckova@vsem.cz; urbancova@pef.czu.cz; helena.smolova@vsem.cz,"Depoo, Lucie/ABE-4039-2020; Urbancova, Hana/K-5663-2015","Depoo, Lucie/0000-0003-4296-875X; Urbancova, Hana/0000-0001-6603-8691",,,,,26,1,1,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,519,527,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600060,0

In this model, we consider the three reality factors simultaneously: inspection errors, imperfect quality, multiple screening and shortage backordering. Based on it, we derive the optimal order size and the maximum shortage level. We also obtain three useful managerial insights. First, when the backordering cost increases, the buyer should decrease the order size and the shortage level simultaneously. Second, when freight transportation cost increases, the buyer should also increase the order size and the shortage level simultaneously. Third, the cost of accepting a defective item and the cost of rejecting a non-defective item have no impact on order size and the shortage level.

Therefore, the structure of road networks the pattern by which roads are connected can affect the safety of non-motorized road users. To understand the impact of roads' structural features on pedestrian and bicyclist safety, this study analyzes the associations between road network structure and non-motorist-involved crashes using data from 321 census tracts in Alameda County, California. Average geodesic distance, network betweenness centrality, and an overall clustering coefficient were calculated to quantify the structure of road networks. Three statistical models were developed using the geographically weighted regression (GWR) technique for the three structural factors, in addition to other zonal factors including traffic behavior, land use, transportation facility, and demographic features. The results indicate that longer average geodesic distance, higher network betweenness centrality, and a larger overall clustering coefficient were related to fewer non-motorist-involved accidents. Thus, results suggest that: (1) if a network is more highly centered on major roads, there will be fewer non-motorist-involyed crashes; (2) a network with a greater average number of intersections on the shortest path connecting each pair of roads tends to experience fewer crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists; and (3) the more clustered road networks are into several sub-core networks, the lower the non-motorist crash count. The three structural measurements can reflect the configuration of a network so that it can be used in other network analyses. More information about the types of road network structures that are conducive to non-motorist traffic safety can help to guide the design of new networks and the retrofitting of existing networks. The estimation results of GWR models explain the spatial heterogeneity of correlations between explanatory factors and non-motorist crashes, which can support regional agencies in establishing local safety policies.

The Fisher process is the positive relationship between inflation and interest rates wherein causality runs from inflation to interest rates. By contrast, the Wicksell process is the negative relationship between the two rates with causality from interest to inflation rates. While Fisher and Wicksell theories are ex ante relationships, empirical tests employ ex post interest and inflation rate series after the full realization of both Fisher and Wicksell effects. This ex post estimation procedure has led to less than unity Fisher coefficients, known as the Fisher puzzle. We derive linkages between ex ante and ex post coefficients in the Fisher and Wicksell equations and propose methods for recovering ex ante coefficients from ex post estimated relationships. Application of these methods to U.S. data and several other advanced economies supports both Fisher and Wicksell theories of interest and inflation rates and helps to explain the Fisher puzzle.","[Anari, Ali] Texas A&M Univ, Mays Business Sch, Real Estate Res Ctr, 1700 Res Pkwy, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Kolari, James] Texas A&M Univ, Mays Business Sch, Dept Finance, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Mays Business School; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Mays Business School,"Kolari, J (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Mays Business Sch, Dept Finance, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",m-anari@tamu.edu; j-kolari@tamu.edu,"Kolari, James/R-2498-2019",,"Center for International Business Studies and Real Estate Center, Mays Business School, Texas AM University","Center for International Business Studies and Real Estate Center, Mays Business School, Texas AM University","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Center for International Business Studies and Real Estate Center, Mays Business School, Texas A&M University.

The analysis of the present paper suggests that such stronger intergenerational altruism might undermine future well-being if not complemented by collective climate action. In the standard one-sector model of economic growth normatively attractive outcomes will be implemented if each generation has sufficient altruism for its descendants. This conclusion is radically changed in a two-sector model where one form of capital is more productive than the other but leads to negative atmospheric externalities. In fact, the model shows that, if each dynasty is trying to get ahead in a world threatened by climate change by increasing its intergenerational altruism, then long-term wellbeing will be seriously undermined.","[Asheim, Geir B.; Nesje, Frikk] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, POB 1095 Blindern, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Asheim, GB (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, POB 1095 Blindern, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",g.b.asheim@econ.uio.no; frikk.nesje@econ.uio.no,,"Nesje, Frikk/0000-0002-5675-136X; Asheim, Geir B./0000-0003-0669-4632",,,,,25,3,3,1,21,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Inspired by the multitude of ways used to elicit risk preferences, we conduct a holistic investigation of the most prevalent method, the multiple price list (MPL) and its derivations. In our experiment, we find that revealed preferences differ under various versions of MPLs as well as yield unstable results within a 30-minute time frame. We determine the most stable elicitation method with the highest forecast accuracy by using multiple measures of within-method consistency and by using behavior in two economically relevant games as benchmarks. A derivation of the well-known method by Holt and Laury (American Economic Review 92(5):1644-1655, 2002), where the highest payoff is varied instead of probabilities, emerges as the best MPL method in both dimensions. As we pinpoint each MPL characteristic's effect on the revealed preference and its consistency, our results have implications for preference elicitation procedures in general.","[Csermely, Tamas; Rabas, Alexander] Univ Vienna, Doctoral Sch Operat Management & Logist, Oskar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Csermely, Tamas] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Publ Sect Econ, Vienna, Austria; [Csermely, Tamas] Lauder Business Sch, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Csermely, T (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Doctoral Sch Operat Management & Logist, Oskar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.;Csermely, T (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Publ Sect Econ, Vienna, Austria.;Csermely, T (通讯作者)，Lauder Business Sch, Vienna, Austria.",csermi@gmail.com,,,University of Vienna; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [S10307-G14],University of Vienna; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"Open access funding provided by University of Vienna.

Two groups of materialistic subjects and one non-materialistic group were revealed in both studies. In one group, a high level of materialism was accompanied by low levels of honesty-humility, agreeableness, and emotionality and higher levels of extraversion (Peacock type). In the second group, materialism was found alongside lower levels of honesty-humility, agreeableness and extraversion but higher levels of emotionality (Mouse type). Peacocks were more prone than Mice to look for immediate financial gains and ostentatious consumption, whereas Mice were more anxious and insecure in their ambivalent attitudes to money and were more concerned about their financial futures. Despite the similar importance attached to material possessions, the two types of materialism should be considered separately in future research. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We also maintain that state capacity is a condition rooted in history and society: it can be built or purposefully undermined. In particular, in Latin America parties of the left have frequently operated to reallocate social and political clout in favor of underprivileged groups: the inclusion of the latter in the political process helped states to thwart pressures from dominant elites opposing redistribution and tax increases. These mobilized groups have also pushed for universal public services, as high-quality education, health care or public housing, which required well-functioning administrations and an adequate institutional capacity, thus contributing to consolidate stateness in the area. Whereas previous qualitative studies analyzed the mechanisms that relate democracy and political partisanship to state capacity, we test this hypothesis quantitatively. To this end, we estimate the effect over time of democracy, political parties and other socio-demographic factors on a composite measure of stateness, obtaining supportive evidence: in particular, we find that higher democracy levels and left-leaning governments favored the growth of state strength in the area during 1975-2009 and discuss these findings with reference to the political experience of Latin America.

This finding provides a reason why calibration approaches based on follow-up certainty questions have proven useful, but also suggests a degree of caution in applying the approach.

Using the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration as a case study, this paper investigates the redistribution of economic activities resulting from HSRs by developing a locally weighted regression model, geographically network weighted regression (GNWR). This GNWR is formulated in light of the current account identity in economics, and incorporates the changes in network-based travel time from HSRs and the degrees of cities, thereby offering a more appropriate method of capturing the movement of economic activities. Importantly, the coefficients in GNWR can reflect the net inflow or outflow of different cities in terms of their residents' investment and/or consumption. The results of the analysis show that HSRs have significantly changed the spatial redistribution of economic activities due to more frequent and rapid mobility. For investment activities, HSR drew the inflow to the second tier cities alongside HSR and strengthened the status of core cities; for consumption activities, HSR motivated the inflowto non-HSR cities located in the peripheral areas.

We expect individuals to use a mode of transportation that is used by others in their social network. However, other factors important to mode choice, such as commute characteristics or transit access, may influence multiple members of a social network at the same time. Thus it is necessary to estimate the effects of social influence while taking into account the potential effects of shared environmental characteristics. We hypothesize that social influence is relevant to transportation mode choice, even when accounting for shared environmental characteristics among members of a social network. We explore this hypothesis, utilizing survey data collected from a sample of university students, in Davis California. The survey collected information about respondents' social networks, the transportation mode choices of their social contacts, and geographic information for the respondent and their social network We estimate models using instrumental variables measuring neighborhood characteristics of the social contacts. Results provide evidence that social processes are important to travel behavior, even when accounting for similarities in behavior that may be attributed to similar choice environments.

Despite this little is known about how these traders behave in a micro-structure context. We consider a model of an order book based financial market. The market contains two groups: informed traders and technical traders. A numerical technique is used to identify a Markov perfect equilibrium of the trading game and so determine the optimal strategies. We find that technical trading rules are profitable and allow traders to increase their returns. The effect of technical traders on the market, however, is ambiguous. They decrease volatility and pricing errors but also increase trading costs despite primarily acting as liquidity suppliers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this context, the hospitality sector is facing as well an increasing pressure to pay attention to environmental issues, hotel organizations are increasingly tending to use environmentally friendly products and services, and to implement programs to manage energy and water consumption and waste. The adoption of green marketing in hospitality industry is significantly facilitated by internal and external factors. The paper focuses on the analysis of determinant internal factors: first and foremost on the pro-environmental behavior of the hotel managers and employees, and also on the already implemented green practices in the daily hotel activity. The implementation of green marketing strategies further examined being taken into account the organizational change theory, discloses a third determinant factor, namely, to what extent the process of changing is prepared. This paper is advancing an integrated model of determinant internal factors of green marketing implementation in the hospitality sector. The proposed research model has been tested and validated after analyzing the data collected in a quantitative research conducted on 330 managers and employees from the hospitality industry in Romania. The results show that the three predictors - pro-environmental behavior, current green practices and the change readiness - are having a significant influence on the implementation of green marketing.","[Vlad, Liviu B.; Vasile, Dragos C.; Tuclea, Claudia E.] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Macovei, Octav-Ionut] Univ South East Europe Bucharest Lumina, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Tuclea, CE (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",claudia.tuclea@com.ase.ro,"Tuclea, Claudia/R-7491-2019","TUCLEA, Claudia-Elena/0000-0002-8104-0041",,,,,38,3,3,3,35,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2016,18.0,,,,10,,862,874,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ED1SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388624700010,0

Following a task-based approach, we elaborate a measure of non-routine skill intensity that captures the effects of industry exposure to both technology and international trade. The article adds to previous literature by focusing on both the determinants of demand for non-routine skills and their effects on industry productivity and wages. The key finding is that import competition from low-wage countries has been a strong driver of demand for non-routine skills during the 2000s. Both technology and trade with low-wage countries are associated with mild cross-industry convergence in skill intensity, while trade with high- and medium-wage countries are at the root of persistent heterogeneity across occupational groups. We also find that higher non-routine skill intensity has had, at best, a modest effect on productivity and wages, except in high-skill occupations.","[Consoli, Davide] INGENIO CSIC UPV, Ciudad Politecn Innovac Edificio 8E Camino Vera, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Vona, Francesco] OFCE Sci Po, 60 Rue Fedor Dostoievski, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Vona, Francesco] SKEMA Business Sch, 60 Rue Fedor Dostoievski, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Rentocchini, Francesco] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1TR, Hants, England",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; CSIC-UPV - Instituto de Gestion de la Innovacion y del Conocimiento (INGENIO); SKEMA Business School; University of Southampton; Solent University,"Vona, F (通讯作者)，OFCE Sci Po, 60 Rue Fedor Dostoievski, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France.;Vona, F (通讯作者)，SKEMA Business Sch, 60 Rue Fedor Dostoievski, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France.",davide.consoli@ingenio.upv.es; francesco.vona@sciencespo.fr; f.rentocchini@soton.ac.uk,"Vona, Francesco/ABE-8328-2020; Consoli, Davide/H-3313-2011; Consoli, Davide/Q-7183-2019; Rentocchini, Francesco/A-5399-2009","Vona, Francesco/0000-0002-2112-5537; Consoli, Davide/0000-0002-7829-2838; Rentocchini, Francesco/0000-0002-6414-0577",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [RYC-2011-07888],Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),"Early versions of this article were presented at the EMAEE Conference (Skema Business School, Nice), at the seminar Economics of Innovation and Knowledge (Collegio Carlo Alberto, Turin) and at the SPRU Wednesday Seminar series (Brighton).

A vibrant literature examines the general contributions of universities within regional innovation ecosystems while another strain of literature examines individual intermediaries, such as technology licensing offices and incubators, in support of the university's economic development mission. Little research exists, however, that conceptualizes the structure and function of an entrepreneurial university ecosystem. This paper seeks to address this gap in the literature by examining the composition, contributions, and evolution of social networks among faculty and graduate student entrepreneurs and the role of knowledge intermediaries therein. While our investigation supports an emerging literature that finds academic entrepreneurs are typically limited by their own homophilous social networks, we also find that spinoff success relies upon academic and non-academic contacts who connect faculty and students to other social networks important to spinoff success. We investigate how by creating a taxonomy of social network evolution among spinoffs; the results show that the contributions of universities depend on the existence and interrelationship of loosely coordinated, heterogeneous knowledge intermediaries guided by a strong collective ethos to encourage and support academic entrepreneurship.","[Hayter, Christopher S.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Ctr Org Res & Design, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix,"Hayter, CS (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Ctr Org Res & Design, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.",chayter@asu.edu,,,Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation,Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation,I am grateful to the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation for their financial support of this research and also special thanks to Marla Parker and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions.,,98,140,150,8,279,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Using new data from the 2013 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice (SCPC) and models from earlier research, we estimate how various aspects of speed and security influence consumers' decisions to adopt and use payment instruments. Some aspects of speed and security have a statistically significant influence on the adoption and use of selected payment instruments, but not as much as other characteristics of payment instruments. Using econometric models to simulate selected policies proposed by the Fed, we show that faster speed of payment deduction for Automatic Clearing House (ACH) transactions would slightly increase consumers' adoption of ACH-based payment methods, while enhanced security of payment cards would marginally increase the use of credit and debit cards. However, neither improvement is likely to increase consumer welfare much because consumer demand for payments is very inelastic with respect to speed and security. Our analysis focuses exclusively on consumers' behavior and does not include potential benefits of improvements to the payment system that would directly benefit businesses or financial institutions. In addition, preventing security breaches may preserve public confidence in the payment system, benefitting consumers even if they do not change their payment behavior.

An important example is the ubiquitous yellow Energy-Guide label, which is required by law to be displayed on all major appliances sold in the United States. These labels report energy cost information based on average national usage and energy prices. We conduct an online stated-choice experiment to measure the potential welfare benefits from labels tailored to each household's state of residence. We find that state-specific labels lead to significantly better choices. Consumers choose to invest about the same amount overall in energy efficiency, but the allocation is much better with more investment in high-usage high-price states and less investment in low-usage low-price states.","[Davis, Lucas W.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Davis, Lucas W.] Haas, Energy Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Davis, Lucas W.; Metcalf, Gilbert E.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Metcalf, Gilbert E.] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; Tufts University,"Davis, LW (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Davis, LW (通讯作者)，Haas, Energy Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Davis, LW (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ldavis@haas.berkeley.edu; gmetcalf@tufts.edu,,,NSF [0818839],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We are grateful to Hunt Allcott, Stefano DellaVigna, Matthew Harding, Sebastien Houde, Kelsey Jack, and seminar participants at Iowa State, Illinois, University of California, Berkeley, Harvard, and the NBER for helpful comments.

This article provides a survey and synthesis of experiments and focuses on general principles that can be gleaned from these experiments to date. We identify four general insights from the literature. First, the law of demand is typically satisfied in experimental settings, but responsiveness to energy price changes can vary dramatically in different contexts. Second, information provision can help promote reductions in energy use, but it does not always work. Third, the use of social norms can change energy use. Finally, the economic welfare impacts of behavioral interventions aimed at promoting either energy conservation or energy efficiency are not well understood, but initial research suggests that some people want nudges and some do not.

We derive the asymptotic distribution of the statistics under the null hypothesis that simple gross returns are unpredictable after a constant mean adjustment This represents a test of the weak form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis.

The population with agricultural Hukou status and less educated workers also respond to demand shifts by adjusting their working hours to a larger extent. Our results suggest that China's Hukou system prevents the mobility of urban residents more than it prevents the mobility of rural residents.

Using Danish register data, we find strong support for the hypothesis that theoretical skills from schooling and practical skills acquired through wage-work are complementary inputs in the human capital earnings function of entrepreneurs. In fact, we find that schooling only pays off in combination with wage-work experience, as the returns to schooling are insignificant when the entrepreneur has no wage-work experience. The results are extremely robust toward more flexible specifications, including fixed-effect estimations dealing with unobserved heterogeneity. Furthermore, the interaction term is negligible for non-entrepreneurs, suggesting that the complementarity between wage-work experience and schooling is a distinctive characteristic of entrepreneurs.","[Iversen, Jens] Sveriges Riksbank, Monetary Policy Dept, Modelling Div, S-10337 Stockholm, Sweden; [Malchow-Moller, Nikolaj] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Business & Econ, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Sorensen, Anders] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Porcelaenshaven 16A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Sveriges Riksbank; University of Southern Denmark; Copenhagen Business School,"Sorensen, A (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Porcelaenshaven 16A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",as.eco@cbs.dk,,"Sorensen, Anders/0000-0002-8310-4221; Malchow-Moller, Nikolaj/0000-0001-5350-3152",National Agency for Enterprise and Housing; Tuborg Foundation,National Agency for Enterprise and Housing; Tuborg Foundation,Financial support from the National Agency for Enterprise and Housing and The Tuborg Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.,,26,16,20,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In part, this is due to the persistence of resource-fueled criminal networks developed under the auspices of armed conflict. In this paper we focus on the Colombian armed conflict, one of the longest-lasting conflicts in the world. Recent evidence suggests that gold mining in Colombia has been permeated by illegal organizations linked to the drug trade, driving armed conflict and criminality. This reveals that attention to drugs alone as a conflict resource in this particular case has overshadowed the degree to which legal resources and economic activities have been permeated by illegal organizations and interests. This paper provides a framework of the gold-drugs relationship, which reveals the existence of resource portfolios, or the parallel participation and exchangeability of resources in the provision of funding for illegal organizations. We argue that, in addition to the impact of each resource on armed conflict and criminality, illegal organizations develop abilities to extract benefits of different resources at once or interchangeably (a resource portfolio), which should be taken into account when analyzing the consequences of war on countries' social and economic institutions. In addition, political or reputational factors have been insufficiently considered in analyzing groups' decisions to engage in or abandon specific economic activities. We show that, along with expectations of revenue, resource portfolios may also respond to political conditions, as illegal organizations accustomed to deriving income from coercive practices such as kidnappings until recently a widespread phenomenon in Colombia have caused increasing international and domestic outrage followed by pressure to stop this brutal violation of Human Rights. Based on field research in gold mining Colombian regions combining more than seventy semi-structured interviews with first-hand observation during field trips and a careful review of press, non-governmental organizations' and official reports in local, regional, and national media, the paper provides a general framework of this complex relationship, paying specific attention to the evolution of the links and interchangeable nature of gold and drugs as conflict resources throughout the production phases of the gold extraction process. At a time when Colombia's ongoing peace process is likely to put an end to the armed confrontation between guerrilla groups and the Colombian state, our paper raises a warning sign for scholars and policymakers to consider the potential transformations of illicit markets and their role in shaping the prospects of durable peace.

Banking Crises and Institutional Change,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,banking crisis; institutions; economic growth; reforms,GROWTH,"We test if banking crises cause institutional reforms. Many banking crises are indirectly caused by a weak and volatile macroeconomic environment. This weakness is in turn often caused by the countries' economic and political institutions. A possible outcome of a banking crisis is therefore institutional reforms that improve the macroeconomic outcome and consequently reduce the risk of future problems in the banking sector. Specifically, we test three hypotheses: that only major banking crisis that affects economic growth leads to institutional reforms, that reforms implemented lead to more market-oriented economic institutions and more accountable and stable political institutions, and that democratic countries are more likely to reform than non-democratic countries. Our hypotheses are tested using a data set including 56 countries from 1985 to 2009. Institutional quality is measured using four indices: the ICRG index of political institutions, the Fraser index of economic freedom, the KOF index of trade and capital restrictions and the KOF index of political globalization. Our results support the first two hypotheses: only major banking crises cause institutional reforms and those reforms make economic institutions more market oriented and political institutions more stable and accountable. Our results do not support the third hypothesis, all countries irrespective of political regime reform institutions following a major banking crisis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our model predicts that even a monopolist strategic trader improves market quality and increases liquidator proceeds if trades' temporary price impacts are quickly reversed, and that competition among strategic traders strictly improves market quality. We provide related empirical evidence by studying prices, liquidity, and individual account trading activity around the large and predictable roll trades undertaken by a large exchange-traded fund (ETF). The evidence indicates narrower bid-ask spreads, greater order book depth, and improved resiliency on roll dates. We find that a larger number of individual trading accounts provide liquidity on roll dates, and do not find evidence of the systematic use of predatory strategies. On balance, the theory and evidence imply that traders supply liquidity to rather than exploit predictable trades in resilient markets. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, the research examines the following three hypotheses: job accessibility positively influences apartment rents, the effect of job accessibility on apartment rents varies by transportation mode, and the effect of job accessibility on apartment rents varies by rent level. To examine these hypotheses, this study applies gravity-type job accessibility indexes based on a study sample of 7077 observations in the Taipei Metropolitan Area, Taiwan, from the year 2009. The sample data are analyzed using linear and quantile regressions. The empirical evidence confirms the positive effect of job accessibility on apartment rents, and its variability depending on the transportation mode and rental level. The effect of job accessibility on apartment rent is significantly positive in the median or lower-rent-level sub-markets, but insignificantly negative in higher-rent-level sub-markets. Job accessibility by motorcycle and public transit has a higher positive influence on rent than accessibility by car. These findings provide new knowledge on the role of access to jobs in explaining apartment rents, and reveal a fresh policy direction on rental subsidy programs for lower-income workers living in cities.

A key question the paper seeks to examine is how far the restricted mobility and activity patterns of citizens in these low-income communities influences or interacts with their quality of life outcomes in terms of their wealth, health and wellbeing? A second question is whether transport planning and policy can have a role to play in enhancing their future life chances? Currently, transport planners and policymakers in Brazil know very little about the specific accessibility and mobility needs of people living in Brazilian low-income communities. Our aim is to shed some light on the issue of their mobility needs in the context of a wider set of policy discussions about how to protect the livelihoods and wellbeing of low-income populations within rapidly emerging urban economies.

Given the large heterogeneity of contract farming arrangements, it is debatable whether all kinds of contract farming arrangements offer benefits to participating smallholders. Nonetheless, many donor agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and governments of developing countries are increasingly pushing for contract farming and outgrower schemes as an instrument to commercialize small-scale farming. Their desire for such arrangements is further reinforced by the recent rush for large-scale agricultural land acquisition in most developing countries, often described as land grabbing, because contract farming and outgrower schemes can result in the same advantages as large-scale farming, but avoid its main drawback namely the displacement of the current land-users. Using data from the oldest and some more recently established sugarcane outgrower schemes in Ethiopia, this paper examines the effects of compulsory participation in sugarcane outgrower production on total household income and asset stocks. Because outgrowers and non-outgrowers may have some differences prior to joining sugarcane outgrower schemes, we use genetic matching and propensity score matching to make the two groups comparable based on their observable characteristics. Our results indicate that compulsory participation in an outgrower scheme significantly reduces the income and asset stocks of outgrowers who contributed irrigated land to the outgrower scheme, while the effect is insignificant for outgrowers who contributed rain-fed land. We provide several explanations and discuss policy implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using data from the UK, we find that firms in losing industries significantly outperform those in winning industries over the subsequent five years. These industry reversals remain strong and persistent after controlling for stock momentum, industry momentum, seasonal effects and traditional risk factors. We find a strong influence of past industry performance on stock return reversals. Our results also show that past industry performance is the driving force behind long-term reversals. Specifically, we find that industry components drive stock reversals, while past stock performance does not explain industry reversals. Further analysis suggests that industry reversals are present in both good and bad states of the economy and are stronger in industries with high valuation uncertainty. This implies that industry reversals are more likely to be a result of mispricing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We examine the impact of bilateral default risk and collateral rules on the marking to market of longevity swaps, and show how longevity swap rates must be determined endogenously from the collateral flows associated with the marking-to-market procedure. For typical interest rate and mortality parameters, we find that the impact of collateralization is modest in the presence of symmetric default risk, but more pronounced when default risk and/or collateral rules are asymmetric. Our results suggest that the overall cost of collateralization is comparable with, and often much smaller than, that found in the interest rate swaps market, which may then provide the appropriate reference framework for the credit enhancement of both indemnity-based and indexed longevity risk solutions.","[Biffis, Enrico; Sun, Ariel] Imperial Coll London, Imperial Coll Business Sch, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Blake, David] Cass Business Sch, Pens Inst, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England; [Pitotti, Lorenzo] Credit Suisse Secur Ltd, One Cabot Sq, London E14 4QJ, England",Imperial College London; City University London,"Biffis, E (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Imperial Coll Business Sch, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",E.Biffis@imperial.ac.uk; D.Blake@city.ac.uk; Lorenzo.Pitotti@credit-suisse.com; jingjing.sun08@imperial.ac.uk,"Sun, Ariel J./I-5630-2019; Biffis, Enrico/C-5855-2008","Sun, Ariel J./0000-0002-3576-935X; Biffis, Enrico/0000-0001-5984-0942",,,,,52,23,23,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

In this paper, we draw on a data set containing annual individual-level records for every Wisconsin student ever classified as an ELL between the 2006-07 and 2012-13 school years to estimate the effects of being reclassified at the end of 10th gradea crucial period on the pathway to postsecondary educationon several measures related to students' postsecondary attainments. We estimate these effects in a regression discontinuity framework, exploiting Wisconsin's policy rule that automatically reclassifies ELLs who score above a specified cutoff on the state's English language proficiency exam. Our analysis indicates that being reclassified as fully English proficient in 10th grade has a positive effect on students' ACT scores. It also provides some evidence of a positive effect on high school graduation and the probability of enrolling in a postsecondary institution the fall after graduation. Together, our analyses provide evidence on the effects of a policy directly relevant to the country's fastest growing student population, and we close the paper with a discussion of the implications for research and policy.","[Carlson, Deven] Univ Oklahoma, Polit Sci, 205 Dale Hall Tower,455 W Lindsey St, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Knowles, Jared E.] Wisconsin Dept Publ Instruct, POB 7841, Madison, WI 53707 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Carlson, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Polit Sci, 205 Dale Hall Tower,455 W Lindsey St, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",decarlson@ou.edu; jknowles@gmail.com,,"Carlson, Deven/0000-0002-3406-7022",,,,,29,31,55,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

We derive theoretical predictions that are tested with a 10-year cohort of 6579 UK new ventures in the UK.

We present an analytical general equilibrium model to study the effect of distortionary subsidies on factor prices, pollution, and welfare. Based on real-world policies, we model an output subsidy, a capital subsidy, relief from environmental regulation, and a minimum level of labor employment that firms must agree to in exchange for the subsidies. Each policy creates both output effects and substitution effects on input prices and emissions. We calibrate the model to the Chinese economy. Variation in production substitution elasticities does not substantially affect input prices, but it does substantially affect emissions. Distortionary subsidies can both raise emissions and decrease output. Therefore, reducing distortionary subsidies can reduce emissions without a trade-off in lost output. Such opportunities arise when the subsidized sector is moderate in size.","[Heutel, Garth] Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, POB 3992, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Heutel, Garth] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kelly, David L.] Univ Miami, Dept Econ, POB 248126, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Miami,"Heutel, G (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Dept Econ, POB 3992, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.;Heutel, G (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",gheutel@gsu.edu; dkelly@miami.edu,"Kelly, David/JMQ-6083-2023; Kelly, David L/D-1398-2013","Kelly, David/0000-0002-6132-6317",,,,,32,1,1,0,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

By dividing the knowledge pool into pools within and outside a sector to which a firm belongs, we reexamine the ongoing debate on the relative size of the intra- versus inter-sector spillovers, and address a new question on the relative size of spillovers from networks compared with that from arm's length industries. We find that, although both intra- and inter-sector spillovers are significant, no evidence proves the dominance of either type of spillover, whether the spillover is from industries or from networks. More importantly, we find that spillovers from networks are greater than those from industries, regardless of whether the comparison was made between intra- and intra-, inter- and inter-, intra- and inter-, or inter- and intra-sector spillovers. Results imply that knowledge spillover is not automatic, and knowledge can be transferred better through direct interaction, which is more prevalent within network organizations, such as business groups.","[Lee, Keun] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151746, South Korea; [Choo, Kineung] Korea Naval Acad, Chang Won 645797, South Korea; [Yoon, Minho] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Daegu 702701, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Kyungpook National University,"Lee, K (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151746, South Korea.",kenneth@snu.ac.kr; kineungchoo@gmail.com; racoon22@knu.ac.kr,"Lee, Keun/AAU-8046-2020","Lee, Keun/0000-0002-0403-6348",National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2013-S1A3A2053312],National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),The authors gratefully acknowledge the support provided by the National Research Foundation of Korea ( Grant no.

We set the stage for the interview by summarizing Smith's scholarly contributions and early life experience. Our interview begins with a discussion of Smith's childhood education and experiences which shaped his attitude toward scholarship, entrepreneurship, markets, and work. We then turn to Smith's lifelong nurturing of scholarly interests in multiple academic fields including engineering, economics, and philosophy, and probe how this multidisciplinary approach may have led him to eschew the standard thinking about the boundaries of economics and pioneer the field of experimental economics. As Smith has been a student or professor at more than a dozen universities in a career spanning more than seven decades, we probe his philosophies on business education, including the best models for business schools. We then discuss Smith's ability to focus intensely-a phenomenon he labels defective switching. The final interview questions center on topics which have fascinated Smith throughout his career: Scottish Enlightenment economist Adam Smith, ethics, and management. Our conclusion highlights Smith's contributions and their implications for business education, particularly small business economics and entrepreneurship.","[Terjesen, Siri] Amer Univ, Kogod Sch Business, Dept Management, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Terjesen, Siri] Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway; [Willis, Amy] Liberty Fund, 8335 Allison Pointe Trail, Indianapolis, IN 46250 USA",American University; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Terjesen, S (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Kogod Sch Business, Dept Management, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",terjesen@american.edu; awillis@libertyfund.org,,,,,,,25,1,1,2,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Through place-based research on mobility and immobility of Chinese (im)migrants in Flushing, Queens, New York City, this paper explores: 1) mobility patterns of recent (im)migrants in an urban setting; 2) the constraints, resources and their coping strategies for everyday mobility; and 3) the dialectal relationship between voluntary and involuntary immobility, and between mobility and ethnic communities. This study reveals that immobility is not always the result of inaccessi-bility, but structural barriers in the broader society such as socioeconomic inequality and racial discrimination. Involuntary immobility encourages overdependence on locality. With its high place accessibility, Flushing provides (im)migrants with a plethora of ethnic mobile resources, as well as social networks and community resources. The relative immobility among Chinese (im)migrants in Flushing is compensated by the flows and movements of people, goods and information both at the local and transnational scale. The contrast between insider-ness and outsider-ness further enhances their attachment to the local community and discourages them from moving. Thus, locality mitigates involuntary immobility but paradoxically nurtures voluntary immobility that hinders the transfer of potential mobility to actual mobility, and physical mobility to social mobility. Without considering locality, stillness is easily mistaken for immobility; without considering intentionality, accessibility is easily equated to mobility. Therefore, solutions to transportation equity do not lie solely in transportation accessibility itself, but more broadly in individual capability, immigration policy, labor market equality and community development.

The results indicate that station accessibility significantly improved from 2007 to 2012. HSR has not only brought a time-space contraction effect to the region from the station to the north-western area but also strengthened interactions among different regions. Due to the reduction of some conventional railway routes, the shortest travel times from the station to the north-eastern areas have slightly increased. Although this factor has some negative effects, it has not affected the ascending trend of enhanced accessibility. Road network improvement is identified as a key factor with balanced impacts on all four-hour isochrones. The results of this study generate supportive information for the planning and construction of HSR stations and networks and provide references for comprehensive transport policymaking.

Using data on 134 countries over a 28-year period and several identification strategies we find that the introduction of deposit insurance retards the equity market, the non-bank depositaries sector, and the banking sector when law and order is weak. While strong law and order mitigates this effect, it does not lead to a positive outcome for all markets. For non-bank financial markets, the effect is greater in the long run so that while deposit insurance increases banking sector development in the long run, it retards non-bank financial markets regardless of the level of law and order.

Three distinct procurement regimes endogenously arise: buying, making, or concurrent sourcing for, respectively, low, intermediate, and high demand. Capital constraints encourage buying or concurrent sourcing. Operating leverage peaks when the firm switches between buying and making, and it is lowest (and negative) at the switch between making and concurrent sourcing.

Our results provide an alternative explanation of a trend observed in the past half century: a rise in real wage inequality between relatively skilled workers and less-skilled workers because of technological progress in numerous countries.","[Yin, Xiaopeng] Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuntong] Univ Windsor, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada",University of International Business & Economics; University of Windsor,"Yin, XP (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",xyin_ca@yahoo.com,,,,,,,13,1,1,2,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Ex ante efficiency calls for high labour market rigidity, as this favours workers' acquisition of specific skills which have higher productivity in equilibrium. Ex post efficiency calls for low market rigidity, as this allows more workers to transfer to the innovating sector of the economy. The trade-off between these two mechanisms results in an inverse-U shaped relationship between output and labour market rigidity, which implies that a positive level of labour market rigidity is in general beneficial for the economy.","[Grimalda, Gianluca] Univ Jaume 1, Ave Vicent Sos Baynat, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain; [Grimalda, Gianluca] Univ Kiel, Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Grimalda, Gianluca] Univ Duisburg Essen, Ctr Global Cooperat Res, Essen, Germany",Universitat Jaume I; University of Kiel; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Duisburg Essen,"Grimalda, G (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Ave Vicent Sos Baynat, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain.;Grimalda, G (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.;Grimalda, G (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Ctr Global Cooperat Res, Essen, Germany.",grimalda@uji.es,"Grimalda, Gianluca/C-6441-2015","Grimalda, Gianluca/0000-0002-5605-5591",,,,,53,8,8,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

Because permits are supplied for a fixed level of pollution, allowing the market for permits to determine the price, price control mechanisms may be needed to protect firms from price spikes caused by fluctuations in the demand for permits. We test permit markets in an experimental laboratory setting to determine the effectiveness of several price control mechanisms, with special attention on the soft price ceiling. We focus on a static setting similar to some of the earliest experimental work focused on price ceilings. Results indicate that both permit supply adjustments and price ceilings (hard ceilings) effectively limit elevated prices in this setting. By contrast, reserve auctions to implement soft ceilings do not consistently control prices, especially when a minimum reserve permit price is applied. Furthermore, the grandfathering of permits allows permit sellers to realize significant welfare gains at the expense of buyers under a soft ceiling policy. Our results thus highlight several advantages of hard ceilings for controlling short term price increases.","[Perkis, David F.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Cason, Timothy N.] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, Dept Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Tyner, Wallace E.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Perkis, DF (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",perkis@purdue.edu,,,"National Science Foundation Human and Social Dimensions Grant [0729348]; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Center for Environmental Research (NCER) Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program [R833672]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0729348] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; EPA [909242, R833672] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","National Science Foundation Human and Social Dimensions Grant; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Center for Environmental Research (NCER) Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); EPA(United States Environmental Protection Agency)",This research was funded by the National Science Foundation Human and Social Dimensions Grant 0729348.

Specifically, we develop the concept of entrepreneurial readiness as a factor consisting of four items relating to individuals' skills, fear of failure, social connectedness, and opportunity perception. The results indicate that this entrepreneurial readiness construct is a more parsimonious and cogent representation of individual-level characteristics than several loosely connected individual traits. Moreover, we demonstrate that entrepreneurial readiness has substantial explanatory power with regard to individuals' entrepreneurial intention. Individuals' entrepreneurial intentions are also influenced by several dimensions of the national environment such that entrepreneurial readiness and these national environmental conditions are mutually reinforcing. These findings lend support to the importance of viewing entrepreneurship from a systems perspective and underscore the importance of institutional conditions in fostering entrepreneurship.","[Schillo, R.

A DTC L,vy process is a generalized time-changed L,vy process whose continuous and pure jump parts are allowed to follow separate random time scalings; we devise the martingale structure for a DTC L,vy-driven asset and revisit many popular models which fall under this framework. Postulating different time changes for the underlying L,vy decomposition allows the introduction of asset price models consistent with the assumption of a correlated pair of continuous and jump market activity rates; we study one illustrative DTC model of this kind based on the so-called Wishart process. The theory we develop is applied to the problem of pricing not only claims that depend on the price or the volatility of an underlying asset, but also more sophisticated derivatives whose payoffs rely on the joint performance of these two financial variables, such as the target volatility option. We solve the pricing problem through a Fourier-inversion method. Numerical analyses validating our techniques are provided. In particular, we present some evidence that correlating the activity rates could be beneficial for modeling the volatility skew dynamics.","[Torricelli, Lorenzo] UCL, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Torricelli, L (通讯作者)，UCL, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",lo.tor@tiscali.it,,,,,,,40,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

Our analysis shows that more than half of this decline was predictable in real time as of June 2014. We attribute $11 of this predictable decline to the cumulative effects of negative demand shocks prior to July 2014 which can be traced to a slowing global economy. The remaining $16 of the predictable decline is due to positive shocks to current and expected oil production prior to July 2014. The rest of the $49 cumulative decline was unpredictable and reflected a shock to oil price expectations in July 2014 which lowered the demand for oil inventories and a negative demand shock caused by an unexpected weakening of the global economy in December 2014.

The model predicts that firms with large underpricing can attract attention from speculators by announcing repurchases, and the subsequent trades from these speculators lead to value corrections. Firms with small underpricing, however, cannot attract attention by announcing repurchases, and these firms have to use costly share repurchases as a value-correcting signal.

It is argued that the centrality profiles have implications for the decisions that young adults currently make that could lead them along various trajectories toward adulthood that influence if and how adult roles are realized.","[Hall, Scott S.] Ball State Univ, Dept Family & Consumer Sci, Muncie, IN 47306 USA; [Willoughby, Brian J.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Family Life, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Ball State University; Brigham Young University,"Hall, SS (通讯作者)，Ball State Univ, Dept Family & Consumer Sci, Muncie, IN 47306 USA.",sshall@bsu.edu; brian.willoughyby@byu.edu,,,,,,,75,8,9,0,18,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

We implement a gravity model, in which international currency distribution depends on the characteristics of the source and destination countries. We find that the source country's currency is more likely to be used in the financial market transactions of the destination country if the bilateral trade and capital flows are large or the destination country's economy is the larger of the two. We also find that the level of development of the destination country's financial market and whether the two countries use a common language are important determinants of the currency distribution. In addition, our model suggests that, to be a true international currency, the renminbi should be used more extensively in the financial markets of the US and UK. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

I embed this bias in an overlapping generations equilibrium model in which the period that investors first enter the market establishes the starting point of their experience history. The difference in the individuals' experience leads to heterogeneity among agents and perceived noise trading. The model captures several empirical findings. It explains why returns on high-volume trading days tend to revert. Furthermore, it provides explanations for a high trading volume, a connection between trading volume and volatility, excess volatility, and overreaction and reversal patterns. Consistent with empirical evidence, young investors buy high and sell low, trade frequently, and obtain lower returns. For intraday trading, it predicts a high trading volume around the opening hours, especially for cross-listed stocks.","[Schraeder, Stefanie] Univ Lausanne, Swiss Finance Inst, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); University of Lausanne,"Schraeder, S (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Swiss Finance Inst, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",,,"Schraeder, Stefanie/0000-0001-8098-8343",Shmuel Kandel Outstanding PhD Award at the Utah Winter Finance Conference; Best Paper in Investments Award at the FMA; Best Quantitative Paper Award at the Behavioral Finance Working Group Conference; PhD award at the Eastern Finance Conference; PhD award at the Academy of Behavioral Finance,Shmuel Kandel Outstanding PhD Award at the Utah Winter Finance Conference; Best Paper in Investments Award at the FMA; Best Quantitative Paper Award at the Behavioral Finance Working Group Conference; PhD award at the Eastern Finance Conference; PhD award at the Academy of Behavioral Finance,"I am grateful to an anonymous referee, Pierre Collin-Dufresne, Amit Goyal, Bart Lambrecht, Jan Noessner, Michael Rockinger, and Norman Schurhoff for helpful comments.

However, research on how the two types of capital interact in shaping relevant outcomes has produced inconclusive results. Attempting to explain the inconsistencies in previous findings, we suggest that the relationship between entrepreneurs' human and social capital is neither fundamentally complementary nor fundamentally compensatory; instead, the nature of this relationship is contingent on the type of support derived from the network. Our analyses, based on 474 solo nascent entrepreneurs from the PSED II, support our reasoning. While we find nascent entrepreneurs' human capital and their financial social capital to positively interact in shaping start-up progress, we observe a negative interaction between nascent entrepreneurs' human capital and their informational social capital.

The results indicate that the positive influences of human capital on people's engagement in managerial jobs, skilled jobs and self-employment are greater for migrants than for their local peers. Political capital increases the access for local off-farm workers to white-collar jobs and self-employment but this impact is reduced when it comes to migrants' choices. Counterfactual comparisons reveal that migrants, had they stayed locally, would be more likely to engage in occupations with high human capital requirements, and less likely to conduct self-employed business. Overall, human capital nearly plays its full role in the migration destination's labor market, while political capital remains effective in the local labor market (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We examine these causal relationships empirically, using data on three commodities (crude oil, gold, copper) and four countries (Canada, Australia, Norway, Chile), over the period 1986-2015. To go beyond pure significance tests of Granger non-causality and provide a relatively complete picture of the links, measures of the strength of causality for different horizons and directions are estimated and compared. Since low-frequency data may easily fail to capture important features of the relevant causal links, daily and some 5-minute data are exploited. Both unconditional and conditional (given general stock market conditions and short-term interest rates) causality measures are considered, and allowance for dollar effects is made by considering non-U.S. dollar exchange rates. We identify clear causal patterns: (1) there is evidence of Granger-causality between commodity prices and exchange rates in both directions across multiple horizons, but the statistical evidence and measured intensity of the effects are much stronger in the direction of commodity prices to exchange rates, especially at horizon one: the ratios of causality measures in two different directions can be quite high; (2) causality is stronger at short horizons, and becomes weaker as the horizon increases; (3) conditioning on equity prices (the S&P500) does not change the patterns of causality measures found in the unconditional cases; (4) the main results are robust to eliminating U.S.-dollar denomination effects and including a short-term interest rate as the conditioning variable. In contrast with earlier results on the non-predictability of exchange rates, we find that the macroeconomic/trade-based mechanism plays a central role in exchange-rate dynamics, despite the financial feature of these markets.

In a first experiment, we replicated the standard reversal pattern and found that choices associated with reversals take significantly longer than non-reversals, and non-reversal choices take longer whenever long-shot lotteries are selected. These results can be explained by a combination of noisy lottery evaluations (imprecise preferences) and an overpricing phenomenon associated with the compatibility hypothesis. The first cause explains the existence of reversals, while the second explains the predominance of a particular type thereof. A second experiment showed that the overpricing phenomenon can be shut down, greatly reducing reversals, by using ranking-based, ordinally-framed evaluation tasks. This experiment also disentangled the two determinants of reversals, because imprecise evaluations still deliver testable predictions on decision times even in the absence of the overpricing phenomenon. Strikingly, when unframed ranking tasks were used, decision times in the choice phase were greatly reduced, even though this phase was identical across treatments. This observation is consistent with psychological insights on conflicting decision processes.","[Alos-Ferrer, Carlos; Granic, Dura-Georg; Kern, Johannes; Wagner, Alexander K.] Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Granic, Dura-Georg] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Wagner, Alexander K.] Univ Vienna, Vienna Ctr Expt Econ, Oskar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Wagner, Alexander K.] Univ Vienna, Dept Econ, Oskar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",University of Cologne; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; University of Vienna; University of Vienna,"Alós-Ferrer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",Carlos.Alos-Ferrer@uni-koeln.de; granic@ese.eur.nl; johannes.kern@uni-koeln.de; alexander.k.wagner@univie.ac.at,"Alos-Ferrer, Carlos/GQO-9340-2022; Granic, Georg/AAG-8606-2020","Alos-Ferrer, Carlos/0000-0002-1668-9784; Granic, Georg/0000-0001-9504-3545; Wagner, Alexander K./0000-0002-2124-7550",German Research Foundation (DFG) [WA3559/1-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge helpful comments from an anonymous referee, Monica Capra, Urs Fischbacher, Nikos Georgantzis, Werner Guth, and seminar participants at Ca' Foscari University (Venice), Emory University (Atlanta), University of Indiana at Bloomington, University of Innsbruck, Universidad Jaume I (Castellon), the TIBER XI conference in Tilburg, the Economic Science Association 2012 conference in Cologne, and the FUR XVI conference in Rotterdam.

The regional differences of business and personalized consultancy services are considered for discussion and revealed in the specific of the national network that has a clearly defined center. The concentration of the consultancy companies and most employees in four regions reflects the theory according to which the supply of these services is unevenly distributed, following the potential clients from better developed areas of the country.

In particular, we predict that it resolves debt-equity conflicts, facilitating a firm's access to debt financing and limiting under investment. This permits the financing of prudent investments that otherwise might not be pursued. Our empirical results confirm these predictions. We find that more conservative firms invest more and issue more debt in settings prone to underinvestment and that these effects are more pronounced in firms characterized by greater information asymmetries. We also find that conservatism is associated with reduced overinvestment, even for opaque investments such as research and development. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper focuses on two main sources of tenure insecurity, informal short-term tenancy contracts, and customary gender-biased inheritance practices. Using a large plot-level dataset from Malawi, the analysis employs a linear probability model with household fixed effects and finds that both sources of insecurity have a negative effect on soil conservation investments. These findings suggest that future land reforms should deal with the informality of the land rental market and address the gap between users and owners of land created by existing customary practices.

Political ecology and legal anthropology have rightly questioned dominant approaches in theorizing land-related conflict that are centered on scarcity and institutional failure. While underlining the contribution of these critical approaches, we argue that questions about what is actually at stake in so-called land-conflicts, and in particular how localized land disputes and large-scale violence get connected, are not yet adequately addressed. To further theorizing on this point the paper proposes to take on board advances made in the wider field of conflict studies, notably the notions of war as a social project and warscapes. We emphasize the importance of alliances between local disputes and broader cleavages, and of processes of framing. The added value of such a perspective is then illustrated by case-studies based on original fieldwork in Burundi and Chiapas (Mexico), that bring out how sense-making of social actors at different levels, including development interveners, interlocks through alliances and framing. We suggest that academic research should analyze how particular land-related conflicts are performed, stimulated, interpreted, and used. Our argument also implies that policy makers and development practitioners should be aware that their work is not neutral, and should be more attentive to how their programs feed into processes of sense-making and mobilization. More generally, the paper de-naturalizes the link between land and conflict and draws land conflict analysis into the realm of social practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We highlight and compare the properties of European, American, and hybrid strangles with pricing and hedging in mind. The new quadrature approach we propose can account for systems of coupled integral equations that locate the early exercise boundaries of finite-lived contracts. We show that this method is efficient, accurate, and fast for pricing all types of early exercisable strangles. Other advantages of this technique are that it avoids the non-monotonic gradient problem faced by others and it allows users to control for errors. We then investigate the hedging of all strangles, we derive analytical expressions for some Greek parameters, and we stress how these parameters can differ (or not) from each other.

In particular, we employ the most general differentiation setting with four firms by introducing a new parameter describing the highest degree of differentiation. We analyze how the degree of product differentiation affects the emergence of sequential mergers and find that when the value of this new parameter decreases, sequential mergers are more likely to emerge. Furthermore, we also provide welfare and numerical analyses to discuss the product differentiation ranges that would or would not lead to sequential mergers or no mergers in equilibrium. Consequently, policymakers can use this new parameter as a rule-of-thumb parameter in predicting the future merger structure.","[Ebina, Takeshi] Shinshu Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Inst Social Sci, Acad Assembly, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Shimizu, Daisuke] Gakushuin Univ, Fac Econ, Toshima Ku, Tokyo, Japan",Shinshu University; Gakushuin University,"Shimizu, D (通讯作者)，Gakushuin Univ, Fac Econ, Toshima Ku, Tokyo, Japan.",daisuke.shimizu@gakushuin.ac.jp,"Ebina, Takeshi/E-2239-2014","Ebina, Takeshi/0000-0002-1902-4788","MEXT [15K17047, 15H03349, 24530264]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K17047, 24530264, 15H03349] Funding Source: KAKEN","MEXT(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists [grant number 15K17047]; Basic Research [grant number 15H03349], [grant number 24530264]; from the MEXT and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

We assume that managers act entirely in their own long-run interests, subject to a governance constraint that limits their rents. Risk-neutral managers invest to maximize value but wait too long to disinvest. Efficient disinvestment can be forced by the right level of debt or by takeovers. Risk-averse managers underinvest; they do not waste free cash flow, because the governance constraint is binding. They smooth rents and consequently payout, so that changes in borrowing become a shock absorber for volatility of operating income. We obtain the Lintner model of payout if risk-averse managers have a utility function with habit formation. We show how to adapt the dynamic framework to analyze several other issues, including the effects of asymmetric information. We show that Lintner-style payout smoothing can also arise when risk-neutral managers are better informed than outsiders.","[Lambrecht, Bart M.] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England; [Lambrecht, Bart M.] Ctr Econ & Policy Res, London EC1V 0DX, England; [Myers, Stewart C.] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Myers, Stewart C.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Cambridge; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lambrecht, BM (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England.;Lambrecht, BM (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ & Policy Res, London EC1V 0DX, England.",b.lambrecht@jbs.cam.ac.uk; scmyers@mit.edu,,,,,,,50,2,2,0,14,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4808-3,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

In the input oriented model the inputs used were capital (K), labor (L), renewable energy (R) and fossil fuel (F). In the output oriented model the inputs considered were GDP/L, GDP/K, F/GDP and R/GDP (share of renewable energy in Gross Domestic Product (GDP)), and for both the output considered is GDP per greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. Our results show that economic and environmental estimates for these European countries change if we propose different input or output-oriented models. It changes mainly in terms of years and technical efficiency versions.

Banks have been forced to take on more capital and liquidity, remove riskier types of activity and also shrink their balance sheets. Numerous new rules have been put in place to constrain their risk-taking business including moves to remove executive excesses by curtailing their remuneration packages. All these new rules place a straightjacket around banker's activities and as a consequence inhibit their freedom and this new environment has led various commentators to talk about banks being no more private free-wheeling profit-maximising firms, but more like public utilities that provide a service to society that should be regulated more heavily, namely limiting prices and profits. These arguments stem from the similarity that banks have with public utilities and the problems associated with current banking size and structures. This chapter outlines various features of European banking along with a brief analysis of proposed structural regulatory reforms aimed at reducing the likelihood of systemic bank failure, too-big-to-fail guarantees and other forms of taxpayer support for troubled banking systems. We finish off by looking at why banks are maybe turning into public utilities.","[Molyneux, Philip] Bangor Univ, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales",Bangor University,"Molyneux, P (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales.",p.molyneux@bangor.ac.uk,,"Molyneux, Philip/0000-0001-6210-7418",,,,,23,3,3,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-17413-6; 978-3-319-17412-9,CONTRIB ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,67,80,,10.1007/978-3-319-17413-6_5,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL6BZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000453295500005,0

Here, the sustainability of agriculture has been defined in terms of whether the farm household in question is able to yield an energy surplus when its members and the animals in its possession are obtaining an adequate 'energy income' or Calorie intake. To evaluate the sustainability of 590 farming households in the state of West Bengal, India, during 2004-5, four progressively stricter definitions of sustainability have been proposed, defined and applied. The method of energy balance analysis was followed. A negative surplus was found to be near-universal across size-groups in terms of the net area sown (NAS), the gross cultivated area (GCA) and agro-climatic zones. The threshold output for a non-negative surplus during the cultivating period was 700,000 megajoules (MJ); in terms of the GCA for a positive 'full and final' annual surplus, it was 3 hectares, and in NAS terms it was 2.5 hectares; against NAS per household size, it was 0.6 hectares, for ensuring a positive surplus beyond the annual sustainability. No evidence could be found in favour of household size as an explanation for the negative surplus.","[Nawn, Nandan] TERI Univ, Dept Policy Studies, New Delhi 110070, India; [Nawn, Nandan] West Bengal Natl Univ Jurid Sci, Econ, Kolkata 700098, India",TERI University,"Nawn, N (通讯作者)，TERI Univ, Dept Policy Studies, 10 Vasant Kunj Inst Area, New Delhi 110070, India.",nandan.nawn@teriuniversity.ac.in,"Nawn, Nandan/AAS-1608-2020","Nawn, Nandan/0000-0002-2724-7818",University Grants Commission; Indian Council of Social Science Research,"University Grants Commission(University Grants Commission, India); Indian Council of Social Science Research","The author wishes to thank Prabhat Patnaik for his comments on the conceptual framework, and the analysis, and Debabrata Ghosh for his assistance in handling the data set.

Rejecting interest policy as an instrument for any business activity, Islamic banking is based on the non-interest substitutions that are profit, rental, commission, and wage, all of which are regarded as legitimate earnings of trade, its kinds, leasing, joint venture and partnerships, and other lawful and real productive economic activities. From Islamic perspective, interest is a value that is transferred from one party to another in any transaction without any matching value given back, resulting in an unequal distribution of income between individuals or groups. It takes place not only in loans but also in the sales of goods for each other or in the exchanges of currencies as well. The saying of the prophet Muhammed called The Hadith or Saying of Six Things concisely expresses 66 sales/exchanges that bear interest out of at least 114 transactions included in that saying. After dealing with that saying and defining the kinds of interest by making use of this saying, this paper tries to introduce some solutions to financial crises as a reply to the suggestion of the Vatican, and then it briefly introduces non-interest finance modes of banking and finance.

Design/methodology/approach - First, the author examined sector-specific factors and institutional forces that affect the development of the Russian economy's industries. Second, the author has classified the sectors included in this study into four groups according to the following two main criteria: the interest of the government in the development of the sector, and the degree of state control for the firms in the sector. Third, the author has analyzed the forms and types of the government participation in firms' internationalization in defined groups based on the observation of industries' legislative acts and state decrees and orders. After that, the author has verified the existence of certain similarities of strategies under the governmental influence, and finally discussed the extent of the control and interest implied by the government toward these firms. Findings - After analyzing the patterns of the state involvement in firms' internationalization in various groups the author found that some of the groups are characterized by similar types of government role and their responses are, also, sometimes similar. The author presents a more detailed look at the above results in Table III, and explain the two-sided role of the government in different groups of firms. Research limitations/implications - While the literature emphasizes that institutional forces shape the internationalization of emerging multinational enterprises, they have not been comprehensively linked to explaining the contradictory role of the government in this process. The author addresses this gap by examining an integrated influence that home government factors (namely, control and interest) exert in enabling firms to compete abroad. In addition, the author contributes to the knowledge about the behavior of Russian firms, which is one of the less researched areas in the field of international management. Practical implications - The paper also has value for companies' strategists as it provides them with understanding of the complexity of government-related determinants influencing the internationalization process of their firms and the types of firms' abilities to be developed or supported. It also provides a practical tool for modeling their international strategy formation and accounting for different types of state influences on internationalization of EM firms. Originality/value - This paper highlights the government-related aspects of the internationalization of Russian MNEs. Even when they go abroad with strong product capabilities and a proactive managerial style, they still benefit from home country institutional resources. The author sees the strength of the empirical findings in further extension of the understanding of origins, consequences and prospects of internationalization of emerging market firms with the home government involvement.","[Panibratov, Andrei] St Petersburg State Univ, Grad Sch Management, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Panibratov, A (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Grad Sch Management, St Petersburg, Russia.",panibratov@mail.ru,"Panibratov, Andrei/K-4217-2013","Panibratov, Andrei/0000-0002-3996-3790",,,,,45,22,23,1,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The authors analyzed data from 42 large Brazilian multinational enterprises (MNEs) and found that results support previous research on the degree of satisfaction with prior internationalization efforts and future intent to internationalize, such that the relationship between the two is positive. Yet contrary to existing literature, the degree to which a firm was committed to internationalization has a negative influence on the positive relationship between satisfaction and intent. Design/methodology/approach - All Brazilian firms that have entered foreign markets via FDI were surveyed to measure the firm's: intent to internationalize; satisfaction with prior internationalization; and commitment to internationalization. Intent to internationalize is future based while both satisfaction and commitment reflect previous year's activities. The potential response pool included publically traded companies listed on the Bovespa (Sao Paulo Stock Exchange) and private limited companies (Ltda.). The authors conducted a hierarchical moderated regression analysis to test the moderating effect of commitment to internationalization on the relationship between international satisfaction and intent to internationalize. Findings - This study adds to the literature by examining how past international satisfaction and commitment affect the future intent to internationalize for large Brazilian MNEs. The results confirm that the degree of past satisfaction regarding a firm's international business is positively related to the firm's future intent to internationalize. However, the results diverge from past research in two important ways. First, contrary to the organizational behavior literature, past commitment to internationalization does not have a significant relationship with future intention to internationalize. Second, the results show the relationship between satisfaction and intent is weakened by a high degree of international commitment. Research limitations/implications - A limitation of this study is the small sample size. While it encompasses the vast majority of large MNEs in Brazil, the authors still do not have enough data points to test more hypotheses such as the effects of firm size, number of countries the firm is in, and age of the firm. Future studies should attempt to expand the work done here by examining these effects. Another limitation of this study is that it is based on solely one country; Brazil. Future studies should attempt to replicate these findings in other emerging market countries. Practical implications - These results have three main managerial implications. First, international strategists analyzing the trajectory of a firm's future intentions to internationalize should focus on how satisfied the firm has been with its past efforts. Second, managers should not assume that just because their firms have a large presence abroad that this will subsequently lead to future plans to internationalize. Finally, for emerging market MNEs in a period of the financial crises, committing more to internationalization may reduce the positive relationship between satisfaction and intention. Originality/value - The purpose of this study is to add to the small but growing work on large MNEs from Brazil in order to better understand their internationalization strategies. While there are literally hundreds of articles investigating the individual-level relationship between satisfaction and the intent to do something, there are a dearth at the firm level (see Wood et al., 2011, as a notable exception). The authors therefore attempt to extend the literature on internationalization by discussing how satisfaction at the firm level affects a firm-level decision.","[Ramsey, Jase R.; Ganey, Thomas; Voloshin, Olesea] Univ Alabama, Dept Int Business, Tuscaloosa, AL USA; [Ramsey, Jase R.] Fundacao Dom Cabral, Nova Lima, Brazil; [Barakat, Livia L.] Fundacao Dom Cabral, Dept Int Business, Nova Lima, Brazil; [Mitchell, Matthew C.] Drake Univ, Dept Int Business, Des Moines, IA 50311 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Drake University,"Mitchell, MC (通讯作者)，Drake Univ, Dept Int Business, Des Moines, IA 50311 USA.",matthew.mitchell@drake.edu,"Mitchell, Matthew/JSK-9297-2023","Barakat, Livia/0000-0002-5998-2059",,,,,64,5,5,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Methodology/methods The quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted on the sample of 128 individuals from subsidiaries of various MNCs located in Poland involved in intercultural interactions. Scientific aim The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between thriving and job satisfaction in multicultural workplaces of MNCs. It was assumed that learning is more salient than vitality in a multicultural work setting. Further, it was supposed that both components of thriving relate to overall job satisfaction and the satisfaction with intercultural interactions at work. Job tenure, job position and gender were controlled. Findings Learning was more salient than vitality in a group of specialists and managers working in multicultural work settings. After the control for job tenure, job position and gender, it was vitality not learning that was related to their overall satisfaction. In contrast, both components of thriving were related to the participants' satisfaction with intercultural interactions Conclusions It is probably the first study which quantitatively tests thriving in the model of intercultural interactions at work and includes job satisfaction as an outcome of thriving. The limitations concern a cross-sectional study and a convenient sample from different units and MNCs. The study contributes to the literature on job satisfaction in MNCs and cross-cultural management. It emphasizes the role of thriving in job satisfaction in the multicultural context. It shows that MNCs should hire employees who want to enhance their growth. In MNCs' multicultural environments such employees may thrive, which also helps them to be satisfied with their job. MNCs should also be concerned with employees' affective states to enhance their opportunities for learning.","[Rozkwitalska, Malgorzata] Gdansk Sch Banking, PL-80266 Gdansk, Poland; [Basinska, Beata A.] Gdansk Univ Technol, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Rozkwitalska, M (通讯作者)，Gdansk Sch Banking, PL-80266 Gdansk, Poland.",mrozkwitalska@wsb.gda.pl,"Rozkwitalska, Malgorzata/AAO-4454-2020; Rozkwitalska, Malgorzata/D-7828-2016","Rozkwitalska, Malgorzata/0000-0003-3184-871X;",National Science Centre of Poland [DEC-2013/09/B/HS4/00498],"National Science Centre of Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","We acknowledge the financial support of National Science Centre of Poland within the research Cross-cultural interactions in foreign subsidiaries of multinational corporations - traditional and Positive Organizational Scholarship approaches No. DEC-2013/09/B/HS4/00498.

Food wastage stands for a topical problem for each individual when satisfying his/her basic life requirements. The aim of this paper is to examine the approach of Czech households to food wastage in general and to suggest options which would prevent food wastage generated by households in particular. Comprehensive comparative research combined with quantitative and qualitative analysis was applied as the primary method to obtain input data. The first investigation was held in November 2014 in 121 households. It focused on the relevance of food wastage from the households' point of view. Within the second follow-up investigation, 64 households were approached in March 2015. They were asked to record their actual daily food wastage in a logbook for a period of one month and comment on their general attitudes towards food handling. The results indicate that the level of the Czech domestic food wastage is high. On one hand, there are households which do not waste any food at all (with unused food utilised as compost or livestock feed). On the other hand, there are households which dispose food products almost on a daily basis. Expired date of consumption and not consumed stored meals are the most frequent reasons of food wastage. People largely do not even realise the high volumes of food wasted by themselves albeit they consider food wastage a significant social problem in general. However, more efficient food handling can positively contribute to households' economies. A change at the level of consumer buying habits is a key factor in the extensive application of more responsible choices made by end users. Furthermore, monitoring the date of food expiry and date of consumption stand for the most crucial factors.","[Salkova, Daniela] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Finance, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Lustigova, Lenka] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Languages, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Sálková, D (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Finance, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",salkova@pef.czu.cz; lustigova@pef.czu.cz,"Regnerová, Marta/F-3375-2017; Lustigova, Lenka/F-4398-2014; Salkova, Daniela/H-4401-2018","REGNEROVA, Marta/0000-0001-8315-8513; Lustigova, Lenka/0000-0003-2831-0126; Salkova, Daniela/0000-0002-9930-8595",,,,,18,2,2,1,11,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-4781,,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,351,357,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000045,0

At the core of the debate are the current levels of global population growth and resource consumption, and its effects on living standards in the foreseeable future. While this is well explored in a global context, little research has been done to explore the long-term relationship between population growth and food security in the context of a particular developing economy, such as South Africa. This paper explores long-term trends in population growth and agricultural output in a South African context. Similar measures are also considered for various Southern African Development Community (SADC) member countries, as well as various top countries in the 2015 Global Food Security Index, to explore the relative position of South Africa (a developing economy). This paper shows that the South African per capita cereal production has steadily declined since the 1970s, while the opposite is true for the top countries in the 2015 Global Food Security Index, as well as the world on average. It also demonstrates the need to consider the state of food security of individual countries or regions (as opposed to a global view). Aggregate global data may obscure cases where a food security crisis is closer than anticipated and imported grains may become an increasingly volatile alternative.","[Strydom, Nico; Struweg, Jean] Univ Johannesburg, Corner Kingsway & Univ Rd, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Johannesburg,"Strydom, N (通讯作者)，Univ Johannesburg, Corner Kingsway & Univ Rd, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",nicost@uj.ac.za; jstruweg@uj.ac.za,,"Strydom, Nicolaas Tjaart/0000-0003-2305-0599",,,,,34,3,4,0,19,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2016,55.0,1-2,,,,,34,61,,10.1080/03031853.2016.1159585,0.0,,,28,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,DN4OB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000377046000002,0

Prescribed high wheat quality, which is enforced via cultivar release criteria, is believed to have negatively influenced the productivity and competitiveness of producers. The main hypothesis is that producers deliver lower yields because of high quality requirements and are not compensated for this high quality since prices are still determined by the lowest import parity price. Whether or not this is actually the case must be determined, firstly, by identifying the factors that influence the price of wheat, and secondly, by identifying the factors that do not influence the price of wheat but nevertheless have an adverse effect on producers' productivity. In this study, a hedonic price model, built on the premise that price is a function of all the characteristics that the product possesses, is used to precisely determine the factors that impact - or otherwise - on price levels in the South African wheat industry. The authors apply the hedonic price model using a three-step process to obtain the best-fitting model for the available data. The results reveal that variations in price are mainly a function of Colour, P/L, Defects and Fall, and that these factors should form the basis of the prescribed quality to producers. By knowing the wheat characteristics that must be included in, and excluded from, the release criteria (prescribed quality) system, producers will be able to produce goods that positively impact their productivity as well as their competitiveness.","[van der Merwe, Johannes Daniel; Cloete, Philippus Christoffel] North West Univ, Trade Res Niche Unit, Potchefstroom Campus, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [van Schalkwyk, Herman Daniel] North West Univ, Off Rector, Potchefstroom Campus, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; North West University - South Africa,"van der Merwe, JD (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Trade Res Niche Unit, Potchefstroom Campus, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",Johnny.vandermerwe@nwu.ac.za,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2016,55.0,4,,,,,411,435,,10.1080/03031853.2016.1243061,0.0,,,25,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EI7SI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392703200005,0

The US dairy industry has participated significantly in this growth, increasing its exports from an estimated 5.3% of domestic milk solids production in 2002 to 15.5 % in 2013 and 15.3 % in 2014 (U.S. Dairy Export Council 2016). This article focuses on the factors contributing to this growth and discusses the current world dairy market situation and challenges the US dairy industry faces in an increasingly competitive export market environment going forward.

Tourism is becoming more and more important in today's society. Tourism can promote regional economic development, improve people's income, and provide more employment opportunities for local residents. Tourism is conducive to expanding the regional economic cooperation and exchanges. Located in the hinterland of the Central Plains, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, Henan has a long history, splendid culture, magnificent mountains, and rich humanistic and natural tourism resources. In addition, it has a large population, good location and developed traffic. So, it enjoys exceptional advantages to develop tourism. As early as 1990s, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have clearly put forward the development strategy of to pave a way with tourism, to promote a full range of opening up and to prosper Henan's economy. Green tourism can make people long living in the city away from noise and pollution, enable them to get close to the nature and gain a healthy body. Tourism can protect environment and ecological balance, which is a response to the national strategic objective of taking the road of sustainable development. The richness of the green tourism resources in Henan provides the basis for its development. This paper analyzes the advantages and the main problems in the development of green tourism in Henan, and puts forward some countermeasures.","[Wang, Yachang] Huanghe Sci & Technol Coll, Zhengzhou, Henan, Peoples R China",,"Wang, YC (通讯作者)，Huanghe Sci & Technol Coll, Zhengzhou, Henan, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,5,2,2,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-291-6,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,20.0,,,,,,290,293,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ8XD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000428893700066,0

Generally, beta convergence hypothesis is used for determining whether imparities are lowered. beta-convergence refers to an inverse relation between the relative growth rate of macroeconomic variable and its initial level. As a proxy variable for health care service, the number of practicing physicians per 10,000 individuals is used. The convergence hypothesis for health care service during the period from 2002 until 2010 is investigated by using the spatial quantile method. The results confirmed that there is convergence on province-basis for the period studied.

Comparing subjects' affective state before and after the experiment, we find that individual charitable donations create a feeling of warm glow while collective donations do not. Proposing to donate the full endowment collectively improves subjects' affective state significantly, though the behavioral data suggests that this result cannot be explained by the notion of expressive voting. We also find that subjects who consider Kant's Categorical Imperative to be an important guideline for individual decisions are more likely to donate the full endowment to charity.

For this purpose, the main players-both the French and their Spanish partners-have been identified, and the strategies, models, and sectors in which the French technical consultancies specialized in Spain have been analyzed. Our research reveals that French firms mainly operated via technical assistance contracts when providing services to the classical sectors of French investment in Spain between the first and the second industrial revolutions. These sectors include mining, railroads, iron and steel, chemicals, and electricity. The French role in these activities was based on their experience and knowledge of the market, in turn resulting from their historical presence in the neighboring country. The article is also useful to assist the available literature regarding business consultancy in the conceptualization of how management knowledge is transferred from one country to another.","[Castro Balaguer, Rafael] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Sanchez Sanchez, Esther M.] Univ Salamanca, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; University of Salamanca,"Balaguer, RC (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, Madrid, Spain.",rafael.castro@uam.es; esther.sanchez@usal.es,"castro, rafael/Z-2447-2019; Sanchez-Sanchez, Esther M/L-1837-2014","Sanchez-Sanchez, Esther M/0000-0002-8986-9911; CASTRO BALAGUER, RAFAEL JORGE/0000-0003-4725-9389","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation/Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-35266, HAR2010-21694, HAR2012-33298]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation/Economy and Competitiveness,"Research for this work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation/Economy and Competitiveness (projects ECO2012-35266, HAR2010-21694 and HAR2012-33298).",,105,2,2,1,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We do not find support for an aspiration level at zero, neither for simple lotteries nor for complex lotteries.

If the brown lobby is stronger than the green one, our main results are (i) that the outcome of the three-party lobbying game is a green tax, if preferences are not green, and (ii) that green consumer preferences are necessary but not sufficient for generating a green subsidy in the lobbying game.","[Eichner, Thomas] Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, Univ Str 41, D-58097 Hagen, Germany; [Pethig, Ruediger] Univ Siegen, Dept Econ, Holderlinstr 3, D-57068 Siegen, Germany",Fern University Hagen; Universitat Siegen,"Eichner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, Univ Str 41, D-58097 Hagen, Germany.",thomas.eichner@fernuni-hagen.de; pethig@vwl.wiwi.uni-siegen.de,,"Pethig, Ruediger/0000-0002-4037-4416",,,,,31,5,6,3,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

However, concerns have surfaced that the transmission of low policy rates to lending rates has been weaker than in the past. Has the transmission of policy rates to lending rates been impaired by the global financial crisis? To answer this question, we first estimate standard cointegrating equations linking policy and lending rates for non-financial firms in Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. We then test for structural change in the cointegration parameters, finding strong evidence of a break after Lehman Brothers' default. Such a structural break is owed to a strong increase in the mark-up of the lending rate over the policy rate that standard models assume constant in the long run. The structural shift is explained by compounding the lending rate equation with measures of risk.","[Gambacorta, Leonardo; Illes, Anamaria; Lombardi, Marco Jacopo] Bank Int Settlements, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"Gambacorta, L (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Monetary & Econ Dept, Cent Bahnpl 2, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",leonardo.gambacorta@bis.org,"Gambacorta, Leonardo/KDM-8428-2024",,,,,,26,23,24,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

The elevated tax revenue volatility is due to both economic uncertainty and the riskiness of the tax portfolios state governments are holding. Since the Great Recession, 18 states have increased the riskiness of their tax portfolio. However, many of these states were constrained to accept additional volatility in exchange for additional tax revenues. The mean-volatility constraint state governments face depends on numerous tax system characteristics. For example, states that tax groceries under the sales tax base and have less progressive income taxes are able to increase revenues and accept less volatility than states that exempt groceries from their sales tax base and have a progressive income tax.","[Seegert, Nathan] Univ Utah, Dept Finance, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Seegert, N (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Dept Finance, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",Nathan.seegert@business.utah.edu,,,,,,,13,8,12,0,8,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

We test the hypothesis that commitment to hunger reduction is empirically different from commitment to reducing undernutrition through expert surveys in five high-burden countries: Bangladesh, Malawi, Nepal, Tanzania, and Zambia. Our findings confirm the hypothesis. We conclude that sensitive commitment metrics are needed to guide government and donor policies and programmatic action.

We examine the effect of the representative heuristic on the demand for insurance and participation in mitigation activities. Pre-disaster, the representative heuristic leads to lower demand for insurance, even for a subsidized policy; indeed zero coverage may be optimal for a subsidized policy. After a disaster occurs, the heuristic causes individuals to demand more insurance than those not subject to the heuristic, even if policies are unfairly priced. We depict the subsidization needed prior to a disaster to induce individuals to purchase insurance and show the level of unfair pricing that can be tolerated post-disaster. Similarly, the heuristic causes individuals to have a lower willingness to pay for mitigation activities pre-disaster, relative to an individual not subject to the heuristic.

Because of textiles' large weighting in proto-industrialization gross domestic product (GDP), we postulate that China's initial 20-year lag in textiles vis-a-visJapan turns out to be fatal for its industry and that it eventually ordains totally different development patterns for the textile industry in the two countries, which ultimately led to different growth patterns for the overall economy. Although both countries saw rapid growth of textile exports, the nature of those exports and the entailed position of each country in the industry value chain of trade were quite different. We then use Granger causality tests to show that in one case (Japan) it is in support of the export-led-growth hypothesis (ELG) while in another (China) it is not. Our study then also explains why Japan's industrial revolution took place much earlier than China's.","[Dong, Baomin; Peng, Kaixiang] Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Kaifeng 475000, Peoples R China; [Gong, Jiong; Zhao, Zhongxiu] Univ Int Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",Henan University; University of International Business & Economics,"Dong, BM (通讯作者)，Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Kaifeng 475000, Peoples R China.",baomindon@gmail.com,"Dong, Baomin/AAV-7741-2021","Dong, Baomin/0000-0002-4787-021X",,,,,60,7,8,0,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Currently. Romanian meat market is dependent on the imports of meat, as carcasses or processed products. There have been mainly live animals or semi-finished products which are exported, fact which led to an imbalance of trade and to low revenues for the domestic meat industry.

The study indicates that in the last few years. Romania has recorded significant progress in the meat processing and production domain; nevertheless, the financial performance of the local companies is inferior to that of the EU companies. Except the poultry meat and mutton sectors, in which the export value exceeds imports, the other sectors show a deficit, the domestic demand not being covered. The low concentration degree of the companies from the meat processing industry show a continued market fragmentation and a growth potential for the existing companies.","[Stanciu, Silvius] Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Bucharest, Romania; [Rizea, Raluca Daniela; Ilie, Anca Gabriela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Dunarea De Jos University Galati; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Stanciu, S (通讯作者)，Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Bucharest, Romania.",sstanciu@ugal.ro,"STANCIU, SILVIUS/R-8246-2017","STANCIU, SILVIUS/0000-0001-7697-0968","European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development, project POSDRU [/159/1.5/S/138907]","European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development, project POSDRU","This paper was co-financed from the European Social Fund through Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project POSDRU number /159/1.5/S/138907 Excellence in scientific interdisciplinary research, doctoral and postdoctoral school, in the economic, social and medical fields-EXCELIS, coordinator The Bucharest University of Economic Studies.",,27,15,15,0,22,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2015,17.0,,,,9,,1331,1345,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365318300016,0

The results reveal that housing and stock prices do not have a long-term integral relationship, but exhibit a substantial short-term causal relationship. Therefore, the paper further evaluates the information transfer in the two markets. Results of this study show that the transmission mechanism of information among stock and real estate markets varies for different periods. In normal periods, the housing market transfers information to the stock market. However, during financial crisis, the stock market exhibits a net spillover of information. In addition, money supply affects information spillovers in the housing and stock markets, and the relationship between the two markets affects the treasury bill rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The current paper develops a break-even analysis on how this presence of structured products can be understood based on cumulative prospect theory. The framework provides additional insights into the behavioral conditions and required return expectations that make investors buy into expensive structured products with uncertain rewards. We make the strong assumption that the structured product has a zero prospect value when considered as a stand-alone investment. Still the optimized portfolio typically includes structured products. The degree of probability distortion determines the entry of structured products in the optimal portfolio. Once included it is the curvature of the value function that guides the actual weight of structured products and the potential increase in portfolio prospect value. Structured products receive a higher weight and increase the portfolio prospect value more if the investor is less conservative.,"[Vandenbroucke, Juergen] Univ Antwerp, B-1080 Brussels, Belgium; [Vandenbroucke, Juergen] KBC Asset Management, B-1080 Brussels, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Vandenbroucke, J (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Havenlaan 2, B-1080 Brussels, Belgium.",jurgenvandenbroucke@hotmail.com,"Vandenbroucke, Jurgen/AAF-2242-2020",,,,,,24,4,7,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

Moreover, the tax compliance rate is surprisingly higher than what the standard economic model would predict. In the last fifteen years, literature aimed at solving this so called puzzle of compliance has increased and pointed out several factors that could possibly explain tax compliance processes, e.g., knowledge of the tax laws, trust toward the political system, as well as personal or social norms. The studies presented here examined the impact of social value orientation on tax morale and intention to avoid/evade taxes. Social value orientation was examined both as a chronic personal orientation (Studies 1 and 2) and as a contextual factor made salient by experimental manipulations (Study 3). The results are supportive of a relationship between social value orientation and measures of tax compliance. Furthermore, results of Study 3 provided evidence for a causal effect of social value orientation on intended tax non-compliance. The effect of social value orientation on intended tax non-compliance was mediated by tax morale (Studies 2 and 3). Results are discussed with reference to their potential practical applications.

A (simple) proposal,JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STABILITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bank failure; Banking supervision; Basel; Capital adequacy; Forbearance; Prompt corrective action,RISK; FAILURES; REQUIREMENTS; PERFORMANCE; FDICIA; BUFFER; IMPACT,"In this study, we test the predictive power of several alternative measures of bank capital adequacy in identifying U.S. bank failures during the recent crisis period. We find that an unconventional ratio - the non-performing asset coverage ratio (NPACR) - significantly outperforms Basel-based ratios including the Tier 1 ratio, the Total Capital Ratio, and the Leverage ratio - throughout the crisis period. It also outperforms in predicting failures among well-capitalized banks (as defined by the current Prompt Corrective Action guidelines). Based on our results, we argue that NPACR outperforms other ratios in at least five aspects: (i) it aligns capital and credit risks - the two primary risks of bank failures - in one measure; (ii) it is easier to calculate than the Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios, as it requires calculation of no complex risk weights; (iii) it allows one to account for various time period and cross-country provisioning rules and regimes, including episodes of regulatory forbearance and cross-country differences; (iv) it removes the incentives of both banks and regulators to mask capital deficiencies by creating/requiring insufficient loan-loss reserves; and (v) it outperforms all other commonly used capital ratios in predicting bank failures. We believe that all the above features of proposed measure promise its effective use in the prompt corrective actions by bank regulators. We also expect that this single and informative measure of bank risk can be efficiently used in empirical banking studies. The results of this study also shed light on regulatory forbearance during the recent banking crisis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

CPFL enables workers to take at most 6 weeks of paid leave over a 12-month period in order to bond with new born or adopted children, or to care for sick family members or ailing parents. The policy benefits women, especially young women, as they are more prone to take such a leave. However, the effect of the policy on overall labor market outcomes is less clear. We apply difference-in-difference techniques to identify the effects of the CPFL legislation on young women's labor force participation and unemployment. We find that the labor force participation rate, the unemployment rate, and the duration of unemployment among young women rose in California compared to men (particularly young men) and older women in California, and to other young women, men, and older women in states that did not adopt PFL. The latter two findings regarding higher young women's unemployment and unemployment duration are unanticipated effects of the CPFL program.

Drawing on the concept of communities of practice, this paper seeks to operationalize an understanding of how the social relations that underpin smallholder-related value chains can be better supported to enhance resilience.

We have developed a method for generating a privacy-preserving heat map with user diversity (ppDIV), in which the density of trajectories, as well as the diversity of users, is taken into account, thus preventing the bias effects caused by participation inequality. The method is applied to public cycling workouts and compared with privacy-preserving kernel density estimation (ppKDE) focusing only on the density of the recorded trajectories and privacy-preserving user count calculation (ppUCC), which is similar to the quadrat-count of individual application users. An awareness of privacy was introduced to all methods as a data pre-processing step following the principle of k-Anonymity. Calibration results for our heat maps using bicycle counting data gathered by the city of Helsinki are good (R-2 > 0.7) and raise high expectations for utilizing heat maps in a city planning context. This is further supported by the diurnal distribution of the workouts indicating that, in addition to sports-oriented cyclists, many utilitarian cyclists are tracking their commutes. However, sports tracking data can only enrich official in-situ counts with its high spatio-temporal resolution and coverage, not replace them. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, as many NGOs have missions related to social outcomes such as education or health, what is their role in regard to government provision of these social goods?

I find that municipalities with higher concentrations of NGOs tend to have lower levels of social spending, except in areas of high poverty.

Although this hypothesis stems from the extant theoretical literature, there is no empirical work examining whether it is supported in the data. We test this hypothesis, measuring participation using equity fund flows and ambiguity with dispersion in analyst forecasts about aggregate returns. Our results confirm this hypothesis, as we show that, controlling for other factors that affect flows, increases in ambiguity are associated with outflows from equity funds. Moreover, using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, we find that increases in ambiguity significantly reduce the likelihood that the average household invests in equities.

The results reveal large total surpluses gains for producers from coordinating the institutions to jointly manage the freshwater and marine ecosystems.

Using a matching procedure to select a suitable control group, we find that the participating municipalities on average expanded their child-care sector less than municipalities in the control group.

This perceived risk subsides after two days accompanied by an increase in the option trading volume and the underlying index's actual price volatility.

Here we use a team-based status game to examine factors that determine the postgame testosterone (T) levels of participants who were on the winning or losing team in a status game. We focused on functional polymorphisms in 2 candidate genes, namely DRD4 and COMT because these genes are densely expressed in the prefrontal cortex and thus affect peoples' self-regulation ability. Being on the winning team does not automatically lead to higher postgame T levels. Postgame T levels were affected by pregame T level and genetic makeup of the DRD4 gene variants for male and COMT gene variants for female participants, respectively. These findings remain robust when we controlled for contextual variables related to game play. Such insights, based on genetic markers, might motivate researchers in neuro-economics to look closer at neuro-biological mechanisms, specifically the prefrontal-limbic connectivity that modifies when people engage in status games.","[Verbeke, Willem J.

In this article, we focus on bureaucratic autonomy as a distinct concept and discuss its connection to state capacity in detail. Using panel data over 1990-2010 and a novel indicator of autonomy, we estimate the separate effect of state capacity and bureaucratic autonomy on child mortality and tuberculosis prevalence.

This tends to amplify the effect of exogenous changes in the underlying information environment. Due to complementarities, greater diversity of information in the economy improves price informativeness.

Quantification of the collection effect provides a theoretical basis for making optimal collection decisions with respect to loan accounts. A parameterization process is presented to reduce the number of parameters required to estimate. The quantification process consists of two steps. First, a Chi-square test detects whether the transition probability distributions with and without collection differ significantly. Second, a regression and a t-test are used to assess the magnitude of the collection effect. Application of this method to quantify collection effects in a Chinese automobile loan financing company shows that the method is able to recognize the magnitude and significance of collection effects.

We then comprehensively study their interaction with popular proxies for time-varying market-level sentiment and arbitrage conditions. We find a powerful (relatively weak) role of the variation in proxies for sentiment (arbitrage constraints). In this context, the predictive power of sentiment is mostly restricted to the short leg of strategy returns.

We measure the risk attitude of more than 4,000 households in Thailand and Vietnam via a simple survey item. The experience of adverse shocks, which is typical for poor and vulnerable households, is related to a higher degree of risk aversion, even when controlled for a large set of socio-demographic variables. Therefore, shocks perpetuate vulnerability to poverty via their effect on risk attitude. We extend this general finding to various categories of shocks and find differences between Thailand and Vietnam. This suggests that risk-coping strategies profit from case-specific design.

They show that these multilateral resistance terms are implicitly defined by a system of non-linear equations involving all regions' GDP shares and a global interdependence structure involving trade costs. We show how linearizing the system of non-linear relationships around a free trade world leads to an interdependence structure that can be used as a Bayesian prior to produce statistical estimates of the inward and outward multilateral resistance indices. This reflects a statistical approach that has advantages over the non-stochastic numerical approach used by Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) to solve for these indices.","[Koch, Wilfried] Univ Quebec, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Koch, Wilfried] CIRPEE, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [LeSage, James P.] Texas State Univ, San Marcos, TX USA",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos,"Koch, W (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",,,,,,,,24,11,12,2,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

We use quarterly time-series data on the real house price index and real GDP per capita, covering the period 1963:Q1 to 2012:Q2. The full-sample bootstrap non-Granger causality test result suggests the existence of a unidirectional causality running from the real house price index to real GDP per capita. A wide variety of tests of parameter constancy used to examine the stability of the estimated vector autoregressive models indicate short- and long-run instability. This suggests that we cannot rely on the full-sample causality tests and, hence, this warrants a time-varying (bootstrap) rolling-window approach to examine the causal relationship between these two variables. Using a rolling window size of 28 quarters, we find that while causality from the real house price to real GDP per capita occurs frequently, significant, but less frequent, evidence of real GDP per capita causing the real house price also occurs. These results imply that while the real house price leads real GDP per capita, in general (both during expansions and recessions), significant feedbacks also exist from real GDP per capita to the real house price.

Separating research from production (specialization) solves the two-tier agency problem of inducing simultaneously research effort and managerial truthful-reporting but is costly when capital markets are imperfect. Improvements in capital markets, therefore, promote specialization, allowing a greater number of specialized firms to be established and also enabling them to undertake innovative projects with larger potential outcomes. Moreover, this capital market improvement effect is stronger for innovative activities that are less capital-intensive and that have weaker synergies with existing production activities. The model can help us understand the explosion of small company innovation in the U.S. since late 1970s and the contribution of venture capital to this change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We investigate the dramatic historical changes in nutritional intake in the Chinese countryside. There are two main explanations for the decline: first, the changing demographic and economic structure contributes to a lower demand for energy compared to traditional rural society; and, second, the rising cost of non-food essential goods could lead to a squeeze in the food budget. Using both national-level and provincial-level data, we find evidence for both factors. We further argue that the current abnormally low level of nutritional intake is mainly due to commodification in the context of diet westernization. Rural residents' nutritional intake declines as they divert their consumption from relatively cheap sources of energy (grain and vegetable) to more expensive alternatives (meat and poultry) under a squeezed budget. The shocking failure of sustaining a healthy rural population is a unique manifestation of the contradiction in the Chinese agrarian relations.","[Xu, Zhun] Howard Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20059 USA; [Zhang, Wei] Renmin Univ China, Sch Labour & Human Resources, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Howard University; Renmin University of China,"Zhang, W (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Labour & Human Resources, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",xuzhunjune@gmail.com; wzhang12@ruc.edu.cn,"Shi, Z/ISB-4324-2023; Xu, Zhun/ABD-2912-2020","Xu, Zhun/0000-0003-3309-2602",Renmin University of China,Renmin University of China,"The authors would like to thank Henry Bernstein, Carlos Oya, Hairong Yan, Jingzhong Ye, Qian Zhang, the participants at the JAC special issue workshop at the China Agricultural University and the editors and anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions.

Panel regression analysis demonstrates that corporate governance structures and credit ratings play a significant role in the capital structure of Greek listed firms, especially during the crisis period (2008-2010). Moreover, firm-specific determinants such as size, profitability, asset structure and growth opportunities are also significant determinants of leverage. Finally, we detect that the influence of corporate governance variables on the capital structure of SMEs is less evident compared with large firms. We attribute this to the active involvement of owners in the management of SMEs, which reduces the need for shareholders to bear the costs of monitoring agents.","[Dasilas, Apostolos] Univ Macedonia, Dept Appl Informat, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece; [Papasyriopoulos, Nicolas] Univ Macedonia, Dept Balkan Slav & Oriental Studies, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece",University of Macedonia; University of Macedonia,"Dasilas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Dept Appl Informat, 156 Egnatia Str, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece.",dasilas@uom.gr; papasur@uom.gr,"Dasilas, Apostolos/AAL-4860-2021","Dasilas, Apostolos/0000-0001-6258-0467",Greek State Foundation of Scholarships (IKY),Greek State Foundation of Scholarships (IKY),"The authors would like to thank three anonymous reviewers and the editor for useful comments and suggestions, which have considerably improved the paper.

Using data from a large cross section of British establishments, we show that the positive relationship found in the empirical literature masks a stark difference across jobs. Classifying jobs into two categories (complex jobs, including professional, technical and scientific occupations, and simple jobs, consisting of all other non-managerial occupations) we find a positive relationship for simple jobs and a negative relationship for complex jobs. To explain this negative relationship, we develop a model where stronger incentives distort a worker's decisions towards low risk-return tasks.","[De Varo, Jed] Calif State Univ, Dept Management, Hayward, CA 94542 USA; [De Varo, Jed] Calif State Univ, Dept Econ, East Bay, CA USA; [Prasad, Suraj] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"De Varo, J (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ, Dept Management, Hayward, CA 94542 USA.",jed.devaro@csueastbay.edu; suraj.prasad@sydney.edu.au,,"Prasad, Suraj/0000-0003-4596-5319",J.

The fair value accounting rules were amended at the height of the crisis to break the vicious link between allegedly irrational market prices and regulatory constraints. Anecdotal evidence from the recent crisis suggests that funding constraints posed more serious problems to banks than regulatory constraints. Simulation results show that, for low equity and high levels of short-term debt relative to liquid asset holdings, the contagion potential arising due to funding constraints is higher than the one due to accounting induced regulatory constraints. Allowing balance sheet valuation to affect the expectations about future insolvency, and implicitly, the roll-over decision of short-term creditors, can mitigate or amplify systemic risk depending on which contagion channel is dominating. These results could be interesting for a regulator wishing to achieve a trade-off between transparency, the main goal of fair value accounting, and financial stability.","[Georgescu, Oana-Maria] Deutsch Bundesbank, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany; [Georgescu, Oana-Maria] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Georgescu, OM (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",oana-maria.georgescu@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,51,12,12,0,28,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1572-3089,1878-0962,,J FINANC STABIL,J.

A safe haven currency is a currency that offers hedging value against global risk, both on average and in particular in crisis episodes. To explore these issues we estimate the relationship between exchange rate returns and risk factors in augmented UIP regressions, using recently developed econometric methods to account for the possibility that the regression coefficients may be changing over time. Our results highlight that in response to increases in global risk the Swiss franc appreciates against typical carry trade investment currencies such as the Australian dollar, but depreciates against the US dollar, the Yen and the British pound. Thus, the Swiss franc exhibits safehaven characteristics against many, but not all other currencies. We find statistically significant time variation in the relationship between Swiss franc returns and risk factors, with this link becoming stronger in times of stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The Report criminalized self-defense against state-sponsored or state-perpetrated terror. We use voting on the two UN General Assembly resolutions relating to the Goldstone Report to study whether support for the Goldstone principle of criminalization of self-defense against terror was influenced by countries' political institutions. Our results, using different measures of political institutions, reveal systematic differences in voting by democracies and autocracies: as an example, based on the Chief-in-Executive measure of political institutions, a country with the highest democracy score was some 55 % points less likely to vote in favor of the second of the two UN Goldstone resolutions and some 55 % points more likely to abstain than a country with the highest autocratic score. The differences between democracies and autocracies in willingness to initiate symmetric warfare are therefore also reflected in differences in sensitivities to loss of life and harm in asymmetric warfare, through broad support by democracies, but not by autocracies, for legitimacy of self-defense against state-supported or state-perpetrated terror.","[Hillman, Arye L.] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-5290002 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Hillman, Arye L.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Potrafke, Niklas] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Potrafke, Niklas] Ifo Inst, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Bar Ilan University; Ifo Institut; University of Munich; Ifo Institut,"Potrafke, N (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",arye.hillman@biu.ac.il; Potrafke@ifo.de,,,,,,,75,11,11,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUN,2015,163.0,3-4,,,,,247,266,,10.1007/s11127-015-0247-x,0.0,,,20,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CI0DY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354407500003,0

Our spatial study combines census area cohort population model projections, community asset mapping, and a municipal policy review with coastal sea rise scenarios to the year 2025-2026. This integrated information provides the basis to assess the vulnerability of our case study communities in Nova Scotia, Canada. Nova Scotia has the oldest population of any Canadian province, the majority of whom reside in coastal communities on the Atlantic, making it an ideal site for such analysis. Through this work we forward a useful decision-making support tool for policy and planning one that can help coastal communities respond to the particular needs of seniors in rural areas and adapt to impacts of coastal climate change. Throughout we argue that social vulnerability must be considered alongside place vulnerability in the design of climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts.

The exact relationship between lag and investment trigger depends on the level of debt used by the firm. For an optimally-levered firm, a crucial determinant of the lag-investment relationship is the fraction of investment cost that has to be incurred upfront. If this fraction is small, investment trigger is a decreasing function of implementation lag and the effect can be economically significant. If this fraction is large, investment trigger can be either increasing or decreasing in lag, depending on parameter values, but the magnitude of the effect is not large. Optimally levering a firm makes the implementation lag more investment-friendly relative to an unlevered firm, thus it is possible that the lag has a negative effect on investment if the firm is unlevered but a positive effect if the same firm is optimally-levered. For an optimally-levered firm, implementation lag generally has a non-negative effect on investment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, much of the work on this topic is not explicit about the role of values in this transmission process. Furthermore, nearly all studies neglect potential heterogeneity of values among entrepreneurial parents. This paper contributes to the literature by making use of a natural experiment that allows (1) identifying a group of entrepreneurial parents who have a distinct priority of challenging existing conditions (mastery) and (2) detecting whether this value orientation is transmitted. Comparing German entrepreneurs two decades after Reunification reveals that the children of self-employed parents who encountered a great deal of resistance in the socialist German Democratic Republic due to their self-employment are much more likely to give mastery as the reason for running their own venture compared to entrepreneurs whose parents did not have to overcome this sort of challenge.","Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, D-07743 Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Wyrwich, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",michael.wyrwich@uni-jena.de,,,German Science Foundation,German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I am indebted to Michael Fritsch, Maximilian Gothner, Alexander Oettl, and Johan P.

We distinguish between homevoters, i.e., voters who are homeowners, and leasevoters, i.e., voters who lease their homes. We expect that homevoters would be more likely to support initiatives that positively affect the amenity value of a neighborhood because some of the related benefits of leasevoters are neutralized by adjustments in market rents. Likewise, homevoters would be more likely to oppose initiatives that negatively affect the amenity value of a neighborhood.

As these features are not randomly assigned across homes, we develop an instrumental variable (IV) strategy that relies on the differential decline in the health and functional status of spouses to identify impacts. Specifically, we use the deceased spouse's functional status when alive, as measured by limits to Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), as an IV for the presence of home safety and accessibility features for the surviving spouse in the years after widowhood, and then estimate the effect of these features on the likelihood of a serious fall for the widow using rich longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study. The presence of such features reduces the likelihood of a fall requiring medical treatment by 20 percentage points, a substantial effect. However, falls are not the type of health shock that is a main driver of housing tenure transitions among the elderly. Although somewhat speculative, cost-benefit estimates suggest that investments in home safety for the elderly may generate in the short run as much as a dollar-for-dollar reduction in medical expenditures.

First, the ratio of specific and residual decision rights is developed as a measure of contractual completeness. Second, we extend the transaction cost perspective of contractual completeness in franchising by arguing that the franchisor's and franchisees' investments have a negative effect on contractual completeness under bilateral dependence and a positive effect under unilateral dependence. Third, we complement the transaction cost perspective by developing new hypotheses regarding the impact of general and knowledge-based trust on contractual completeness. General trust of the franchisor reduces the franchisor's perception of relational risk and hence the necessity to control the network relationship by more complete contract planning, and knowledge-based trust increases information sharing between the partners and hence the knowledge base for specifying more detailed contracts. The data from the German franchise sector provide some support of the hypotheses.","[Hendrikse, George] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Hippmann, Patrick; Windsperger, Josef] Univ Vienna, Dept Business Adm, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of Vienna,"Windsperger, J (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Dept Business Adm, Oskar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",ghendrikse@rsm.nl; patrick.hippmann@univie.ac.at; josef.windsperger@univie.ac.at,,"Hippmann, Patrick/0000-0003-3365-5604; windsperger, josef/0000-0002-3413-5160",,,,,163,40,42,0,102,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Two types of environmental practices are distinguished: practices related to production processes (greening processes) and practices related to products and services (greening product and service offerings). Despite a growing literature on socially responsible behavior of large firms, the role of SMEs remains underexposed. This neglect is remarkable given the substantial impact of SMEs on the economy and the natural environment. By using unique data for almost 8,000 SMEs across 12 sectors in 36 countries, we study the influence of firm characteristics on SMEs' environmental behavior. Our results suggest that different characteristics have dissimilar influences on both types of environmental practices such as the type of customers served. Stringent environmental legislation encourages firms to actively take on environmental activities, but only in case of green products and services. Moreover, the dominant idea that small firms are reluctant to invest in environmental practices is clearly more nuanced: firm size matters most for engagement in greening processes. Finally, SMEs active in tangible sectors and that receive financial support are more involved in either type of environmental practices.","[Hoogendoorn, Brigitte; van der Zwan, Peter] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Guerra, Daniela] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Ctr Innovat Technol & Policy Res, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"Hoogendoorn, B (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",bhoogendoorn@ese.eur.nl,"Guerra, Daniela/GWC-8572-2022","Hoogendoorn, Brigitte/0000-0001-8078-9520; van der Zwan, Peter/0000-0003-2654-4367",Erasmus School of Economics; Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs; research program SCALES,"Erasmus School of Economics; Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs(Ministry of Economic Affairs, Netherlands); research program SCALES","We would like to thank Dr. Luca Barani and Dr. Isabel Grilo of the European Commission for providing and explaining data from the Flash Eurobarometer 342.

I present a model where the financial sector and the central bank jointly respond to demand for money-like claims. The model generates predictions about the prices and quantities of Treasury bills, central bank reserves, and shadow bank debt.

Accessibility is generally evaluated using conventional traffic measures such as travel time and distance, but traffic volume, which is a product of the travel trips induced by people's needs, may also be positively related to accessibility. This study tests the hypothesis can freeway traffic volume information facilitate urban accessibility assessment? Traffic volume based accessibility models are proposed to investigate this relationship and test the hypothesis. The results indicate that the answer to this question is a qualified yes, as there is a statistically significant relationship between traffic volume differences and accessibility. The coefficients of the models can potentially be used as a reference to guide the urban planning process. The limitations of the proposed models can be addressed by deploying Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) traffic sensors on ramps and arterial roadways. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Egypt's first free presidential elections represent a good case study to answer the question whether private gain outweighs ideology in voter behavior on a broader level. First, we combine election results with household surveys and national statistics to estimate the impact of patronage (measured by public employment) on voting for the pre-revolution regime candidate. Second, using results of the first round of elections as a proxy for ideology, we test for the effect of ideological preferences on voting behavior, Additionally, we test for candidates' ability to mobilize supporters. Our results suggest that patronage has a stronger effect than secularist ideology but a weaker effect than pro-change ideology. Results show that the number of public sector and government employees in each electoral district has a positive impact on participation rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is a growing interest in whether performance-based incentives based on rigorous teacher evaluations can improve teacher retention and performance. The evidence available to date has been mixed at best. This study presents novel evidence on this topic based on IMPACT, the controversial teacher-evaluation system introduced in the District of Columbia Public Schools by then-Chancellor Michelle Rhee. IMPACT implemented uniquely high-powered incentives linked to multiple measures of teacher performance (i.e., several structured observational measures as well as test performance). We present regression-discontinuity (RD) estimates that compare the retention and performance outcomes among low-performing teachers whose ratings placed them near the threshold that implied a strong dismissal threat. We also compare outcomes among high-performing teachers whose rating placed them near a threshold that implied an unusually large financial incentive. Our RD results indicate that dismissal threats increased the voluntary attrition of low-performing teachers by 11 percentage points (i.e., more than 50 percent) and improved the performance of teachers who remained by 0.27 of a teacher-level standard deviation. We also find evidence that financial incentives further improved the performance of high-performing teachers (effect size = 0.24).","[Dee, Thomas S.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ & Res Associate, Natl Bur Econ Res, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wyckoff, James] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Wyckoff, James] Ctr Educ Policy & Workforce Competitiveness, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; Stanford University; University of Virginia,"Dee, TS (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ & Res Associate, Natl Bur Econ Res, 520 Galvez Mall,CERAS Bldg, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",tdee@stanford.edu; wyck-off@virginia.edu,,"Wyckoff, James/0000-0002-5223-6221",Carnegie Corporation of New York; National Center for the Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER); IES [R305A060018],Carnegie Corporation of New York; National Center for the Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER); IES(US Department of EducationInstitute of Education Sciences (IES)),"We received exceptional research assistance from Mindy Adnot and Veronica Katz at the University of Virginia.

In equilibrium, editors accede to reviewer insistence upon such cosmetic surgery. If blemishes are sometimes unremovable, demands for repair sometimes block good papers from publication. This implies a social value to active editing. Reviewer signal-jamming may especially suppress innovative research and research designed to verify others' findings. This perspective strongly suggests that the growth of the review process is harmful. I therefore offer tentative proposals for reform.","[Hirshleifer, David] Univ Calif Irvine, Merage Sch Business, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Hirshleifer, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Paul Merage Sch Business, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",david.h@uci.edu,"Hirshleifer, David/E-4342-2012","Hirshleifer, David/0000-0003-0280-8882",,,,,5,12,12,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

When the penalty is imposed on the undeclared income, an increase in the tax rate leads to more evasion. If the penalty is imposed on the evaded tax, the effect of the tax rate on evasion depends on the level of income. With savings, the relationship between tax rates and evasion depends additionally on the preferences toward risk and the penalty rate.","San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University,"Lee, K (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",klee@mail.sdsu.edu,,,,,,,27,2,2,3,23,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,MAR,2015,71.0,1,,,,,37,52,,10.1628/001522115X14180276055699,0.0,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CH2MJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353859000002,0

This paper uses longitudinal data to examine the level and dynamics of energy poverty in Spain, comparing the results to the level and dynamics of income poverty. Two alternative measures of energy poverty are used in the analysis one based on energy expenditure, the other reflecting an individual's perceptions of difficulty in heating their home, paying utility bills and housing condition. The proportion of those in income poverty and also in energy poverty is relatively low suggesting a need for specific as opposed to general measures to address the latter In relation to the dynamics of energy poverty, at the aggregate level there is a substantially greater movement out of expenditure-based energy poverty relative to subjective energy poverty and income poverty while the rate of re-entry into poverty was highest for the subjective energy poverty measure. The analysis also provides evidence of duration dependence in energy poverty. The results show clearly how mitigating expenditure behaviour reduces the level and alters the dynamics of expenditure-based energy poverty compared to subjective energy poverty The implications for designing, targeting and monitoring energy policy are considered.","[Phimister, Euan; Roberts, Deborah] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen Ctr Res Energy Econ & Finance, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Vera-Toscano, Esperanza] CSIC, Inst Estudios Sociales Avanzados, Cordoba, Spain; [Roberts, Deborah] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Aberdeen, Scotland",University of Aberdeen; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC-IESA - Instituto de Estudios Sociales Avanzados; James Hutton Institute,"Phimister, E (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Sch Business, Aberdeen Ctr Res Energy Econ & Finance, Aberdeen, Scotland.",e.phimister@abdn.ac.uk; esperanza.vera@csic.es; deb.roberts@hutton.ac.uk,"Roberts, Deborah/G-8693-2013; Vera-Toscano, Esperanza/ABA-8720-2020","Roberts, Deborah/0000-0003-0018-6039; Phimister, Euan/0000-0002-6483-0113; vera-toscano, esperanza/0000-0002-0736-1381",Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division (RESAS),Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division (RESAS),Deborah Roberts acknowledges the support of funding from the Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division (RESAS).

Seasonal migration due to agricultural downturns is a common phenomenon in developing countries. Using primary data from a cross-sectional household survey of the northwest part of Bangladesh, this paper quantifies the factors that influence such migration decisions. Our results suggest that people with prior access to microcredit are more likely to migrate during an agricultural lean season. Furthermore, we find evidence of a negative selection effect between microcredit and seasonal migration, conditional on an individual's village of residence and observed characteristics. Our results have numerous potential policy implications, including the design of typical microcredit schemes for developing countries.","[Shonchoy, Abu S.] JETRO, Inst Dev Econ, Chiba, Japan",,"Shonchoy, A (通讯作者)，Japan External Trade Org, Inst Dev Econ, Ctr Dev Studies, Microecon Anal Studies Grp,Mihama Ku, 3-2-2 Wakaba, Chiba, Chiba 2618545, Japan.",parves.shonchoy@gmail.com,", Abu Syeid Shonchoy/AAM-6472-2021",", Abu Syeid Shonchoy/0000-0001-9999-2326",,,,,57,5,5,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

In this paper, we address the implications of such findings by creating a network of student flows from 11 cohorts of eighth-grade students in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS). We applied a custom algorithm to group together schools with similar sending and receiving patterns, and calculated the difference in mean achievement between a student's attended and assigned high schools. For all identified school groupings, we found that the students were on average moving to higher achieving schools. We also found that the movement toward higher achieving schools of the top achievement quartile of students was over twice as large as that of the bottom quartile, but that the flows of both the highest and lowest achieving student quartiles were toward higher achieving destinations. Our results suggest that student movements in CPS between the years of 2001 to 2005 were consistent with creating market pressure for improvement as well as increasing segregation by achievement. However, further research into how schools responded to those movements is required to make inferences about the level or consequences of competition generated by choice-related reforms during that time.","[Sirer, M.

It differs from other analyses by looking at a carbon tax as a purely revenue raising measure, not as an optimal Pigouvian tax or as an instrument to achieve a predetermined reduction in emissions. Thus it addresses the question of whether a carbon tax would be part of an optimal tax policy even if there were no damages to the United States from CO2 emissions. We use a computable general equilibrium model (NERA's N(ew)ERA model) that consists of a top-down macro model of the U.S. economy and a detailed bottom-up model of the North American electricity sector: The N(ew)ERA model is an integrated energy and economic model that includes a detailed plant-level representation of the electricity sector with an aggregate level representation of the rest of the economy. The analysis shows that using revenues for either debt or tax rate reduction can reduce the welfare losses from a carbon tax; however, the savings from reducing either federal debt or the marginal rates of other distorting taxes are still less than the economic costs imposed by the narrowly based tax on CO2 emissions. The higher the carbon tax, the greater the disparity becomes.","[Tuladhar, Sugandha D.; Montgomery, W.

The decline in cash ETR equates to $10.69 million in tax savings for the average firm and $4.0 billion for the entire sample of 375 new derivatives users.

Induced values are used to compare behavior in dynamic and static auction structures. Past research on this topic has understudied dynamic elements such as strategic entry and endogenous bidder selection that arise in a dynamic environment. The results suggest complex behavioral patterns in which some sellers overenter early and others strategically wait. This affects the owners' abilities to extract rents in a dynamic setting.

Some may not view this exclusion as an issue, on the grounds that the omitted economic units reflect survivorship rather than entrepreneurship. However, the thresholds that determine the truncation of the data are relatively arbitrary, and the firms that are typically excluded are associated with a large share of total employment. This paper assesses the ways in which the conventional wisdom on developing countries would change if micro- and small enterprises were taken into account in the analyses. The assessment shows that micro- and small enterprises account for a greater share of gross job creation and destruction than acknowledged by the conventional wisdom. It also reveals a greater dispersion of firm productivity, a weaker correlation between firm productivity and firm size, and a smaller contribution of within-firm productivity gains to aggregate productivity growth. This assessment points to new directions in the data and research efforts needed to understand the role of micro- and small enterprises and to identify policies with the potential to foster job creation and aggregate productivity growth in developing countries.","[Li, Yue; Rama, Martin] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Li, Y (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW,MSN MC10-1011, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",yli7@worldbank.org,,,,,,,102,45,55,0,51,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

Although the economic dimensions of labor market outcomes are relatively well documented, evidence on the link between social cohesion and jobs is still surprisingly scarce. This paper, based on an earlier background report for the WDR 2013, presents empirical evidence for pathways between labor market outcomes and social cohesion. The findings indicate that formal employment is associated with a range of social outcomes and behaviors that are typically associated with higher levels of social cohesion. However, there are also indications that this relationship varies across dimensions of social wellbeing. In particular, social interactions and political activism among those in regular employment can either improve the quality of aggregate institutions or deepen existing social divides.","London Sch Econ, Dept Int Dev, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Wietzke, FB (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Int Dev, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",f.b.wietzke@lse.ac.uk,"Wietzke, Frank-Borge/N-4014-2018","Wietzke, Frank-Borge/0000-0002-4720-708X",,,,,151,7,8,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

Therefore, this research was conducted to analyze the effectiveness of communication used by the Government in instilling Malaysian consumers' mind-set to accept GST, and also to evaluate the effectiveness of communication tools used. The findings indicated that further efforts should be taken by the government to widen the communication channel so that the information on GST will be easily accessible and understood by every consumer in Malaysia, thus it will enhance the acceptance and implementation process of GST.","[Ahmad, Rohizan; Ahmad, Rahilah; Alwie, Sueraya Mohamad] Asia Pacific Univ Technol & Innovat, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Asia Pacific University of Technology & Innovation,"Ahmad, R (通讯作者)，Asia Pacific Univ Technol & Innovat, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",rohizan@apu.edu.my; rahilah@apu.edu.my; sueraya@apu.edu.my,"Ahmad, Rohizan/ITT-8144-2023; AHMAD, RAHILAH/IUN-3391-2023",,,,,,13,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-15880-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,121,134,,10.1007/978-3-319-15880-8_10,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3WD,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360224400010,0

Using a large extent of these rules has been determined, on the one hand by the high capacity of characterize monetary policy actions, and on the other hand the simplicity of their handling of economic models. One of the most popular ideas in the monetary economy is that the central bank should follow the Taylor rule, under which the central bank should take into account in setting the interest rate of two factors: the inflation rate and the gap between the Gross Domestic Product and potential Gross Domestic Product (output gap). It should be noted that monetary policy decisions affect the decisions of consumption / investment, but also on the asset allocation. Taylor rule guides monetary policy to reconcile price stability and full employment rate, goals that are sometimes divergent on short-term. In the short term perspective of Romanian banking system the main problem that arises is determined by the terminus point of monetary policy normalization: how far the central bank will cut the benchmark interest rate? In this paper, we want to apply the Taylor rule (the monetary policy instrument used by central banks in developed countries before the Great Recession), in order to see if we are approaching the end of the process of normalizing monetary policy in Romanian banking system. In other words, this paper aims to examine whether the use of interest rate as an instrument, following a Taylor rule type, would have been used successfully by National Bank of Romania. In the financial literature, the Taylor rule is considered an accurate description of how monetary policy decisions are taken by the FED, but also by other central banks. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Little academic research has been invested in actually trying to build successful real-time trading models for the high-frequency foreign exchange market, which is characterized by inherent complexity and heterogeneity. The present work opens new directions for inference on market efficiency in an attempt to account for the use of technical analysis by practitioners over many years now. This paper presents a heuristic model that efficiently emulates the dynamic learning of intraday traders. The proposed setup incorporates agent beliefs, preferences and expectations while it integrates the calibration of technical rules by means of adaptive training. The study focuses on EUR/USD which is the most liquid and widely traded currency pair. The data consist of a very large tick-by-tick sample of bid and ask prices covering many trading periods to enhance robustness in the results. The efficiency of a technical trading strategy based on the proposed model is investigated in terms of directional predictability. The heuristic learning system is compared against many non-linear models, a random walk and a buy & hold strategy. Based on statistical testing it is shown that, with the inclusion of transaction costs, the profitability of the new model is consistently superior. These findings provide evidence of technical predictability under incomplete information and can be justified by invoking the existence of heterogeneity caused by many factors affecting market microstructure.

Insurance penetration is a share of total premium income in insurance to GDP of country presented in a percentage. Insurance penetration of the emerging economies was at one third compared to average total premium income of OECD countries. At the beginning of the millennium, in selected countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which are members of the OECD, was the insurance penetration at the level of developing countries. For this reason it would be appropriate to measure the natural development of the insurance market by other indicators. It is also advisable to use indicators that take into account the status development in various economics in different countries. In 2008 economists started to deal with the use of global average insurance penetration as a function of per capita income as a benchmark for determining the development of insurance. This makes sense if you are trying to understand what should be the rational development of the insurance sector in the economy. The aim of this publication is to assess the adequacy of the development of the insurance market to the needs of the economy. A subsequent aim is to focus on understanding the barriers that exist in these economies with stagnant insurance industry. In this case we are talking about those barriers that must be removed in order to allow further development of the sector. We also focus on enhancers, which should be strengthened in order to intensify the development of insurance market.","[Beslerova, Stela] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Econ Seat Kosice, Dept Financial Management, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04130, Slovakia; [Tobak, Juraj] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Econ Seat Kosice, Dept Econ, Kosice 04130, Slovakia; [Tobakova, Petra] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Econ Seat Kosice, Dept Management, Kosice 04130, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; University of Economics Bratislava; University of Presov; University of Economics Bratislava,"Beslerová, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Econ Seat Kosice, Dept Financial Management, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04130, Slovakia.",stela.beslerova@euke.sk; juraj.tobak@euke.sk; petra.tutkova@euke.sk,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4200-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,862,871,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF1SG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380432500103,0

Part 1: Agrarian Reform and Peasant Differentiation in Cotopaxi (Ecuador),JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Ecuador; Andes; agrarian reform; rural development; indigenous movement; neo-liberalism,RIGHTS,"This paper, published in two parts, contains an analysis of the links between the agrarian question' in the Ecuadorian Andes and the creation of a network of indigenous-peasant organizations that became the backbone of the national indigenous movement. Based on a monographic study in the province of Cotopaxi, in Ecuador's central sierra, I explore the relations between agrarian and social change. I analyse the agrarian roots of Andean ethnic platforms at the local level, attempting to see how those processes that politicized ethnicity came about between the 1960s and the first decade of the twenty-first century. Beginning with the redistributive results of the state-driven agrarian reform (1964-73), the paper demonstrates that the articulation of the contemporary indigenous movement cannot be explained without an understanding of the implications that the reform process entailed and the synergies it unleashed, amongst these being an increase in the internal differentiation of the peasantry until then subject to the power of large estate owners. Throughout this process, the leaders, authentic organic intellectuals, played a fundamental role, picking up the reins of the organizations, weaving their own political discourse and becoming independent of their external allies. In a second stage, the NGOs and cooperation agencies that focused their attention on the indigenous world made organizational strengthening a banner of their work on the ground, consolidating that structural transformation. In this paper, I explore the deep roots of the agrarian system's political economy in order to come to a full understanding of the social differentiation process and the ethnicization of the peasant movement. This contributes towards the comparative reflection of other scenarios in the Andean region and, in general, of those Latin American spaces characterized by the presence of significant contingents of indigenous-peasant populations.","[Breton Solo De Zaldivar, Victor] Univ Lleida, Dept Art Hist & Social Hist, Lleida, Spain; [Breton Solo De Zaldivar, Victor] Latin Amer Social Sci Fac, Dept Anthropol Hist & Humanities, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universitat de Lleida,"De Zaldívar, VBS (通讯作者)，Univ Lleida, Dept Art Hist & Social Hist, Lleida, Spain.",breton@hahs.udl.cat,,,,,,,91,10,12,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Taking as a granted that National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) focuses on regional disparities reduction, the main scope of this paper is to examine the influence of the NSRF programs on Regional Unity of Serres taking under consideration the existence of great intraregional disparities in region of Central Macedonia. Recently, peripheral disparities undoubtedly deteriorate Greek recession, something that is underlined at the relevant literature. According to Joseph Stiglitz with inequality at its highest level since before the Depression, a robust recovery will be difficult in the short term Also, Paul Krugman adds countries doing a lot of redistribution have, if anything, weathered the crisis better than those that do less As enterprises confront huge sustainability problems, their investments are deteriorated. Greek state, under the framework of NSRF 2007-2013, announced on spring 2013 the program Support of SME's which are activated in Manufacturing-Tourism Commerce & Services (the program will de completed until the end of 2015). The NSRF provide subsidizes using general geographical-economic (mainly income) criteria (at regional level NUTS2) without examining the NUTS3 level. It is common knowledge that Greek banks nowadays do not support firms sufficiently. Thus, many of the eligible (under the umbrella of the examining program) investments may not be completed. Hellenic Fund for Entrepreneurship and Development (ETEAN), the associated institution, does not provide the necessary funds to all the entrepreneurs. During the last 4 years the 20% of local enterprises have been closed. It is obvious that crisis badly affected local entrepreneurship. According to Serres Chamber of Commerce and Industry the number of enterprises at Regional Unity of Serres have been reduced from 14.103 (January 2010) to 10.715 (January 2015). All the above mentioned are analyzed in our theoretical part. Our empirical research was conducted in February 2014. The survey consists of two parts. At the first part, a comparative analysis between the region of Central Macedonia and the Borough of Serres takes place. At the second part, all the local eligible enterprises, that will receive subsidizes from ESPA were participated in this research (total 123 ones). The used methodology is the calculation of the main descriptive statistical measures (the average, the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation) and the statistical moment of distribution (the coefficient correlation). According to our main findings, the contribution of NSRF programs as they are regulated by the developmental national laws to the survival and development of local enterprises has been significant, although the legislator disregarded the fact that borough of Serres is poorer than the core region Thessaloniki. The intraregional disparities (which have been indicated both in the theoretical and in the empirical part) should be taken under consideration when a low is reconsidered. Finally it should point out that the general results of our empirical research are relying to the relevant used literature.

Volunteering at major sporting events contributes significantly to the phenomenon of voluntary service on a global basis. The organizers of sporting events per year involve voluntary thousands of volunteers who have significant roles in the unfolding of events and carry a number of different and specific responsibilities. The aim of this paper is to highlight the importance of the participation of volunteers in sport and sporting events.","[Dadic, Mario; Zekan, Senka Borovac] Univ Split, Univ Dept Profess Studies, Split, Croatia; [Peronja, Marija] Vodovod & Kanalizacija Doo Split, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Dadic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Univ Dept Profess Studies, Split, Croatia.",mario.dadic@gmail.com,"Borovac Zekan, Senka/G-4826-2017; Zekan, Senka Borovac/AAP-8000-2020; Dadić, Mario/Q-8894-2018","Borovac Zekan, Senka/0000-0002-6130-4337;",,,,,8,0,0,0,5,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,565,577,,,,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700035,0

H.; Louw, M.",,,EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF PROPOSED TARIFF PROTECTION FOR THE SOUTH AFRICAN BROILER INDUSTRY,AGREKON,,,English,Article,,,,,,Tarrifs; South African Poultry; Error Correction Model; Partial Equilibruim Model,,"Following the application in March 2013 by the South African Poultry Association for increased tariffs to ensure the sustainability of South African broiler production, this article critically evaluates the effect of increased tariffs on broiler producers and chicken meat consumers in South Africa. Arguing beyond the level of tariffs, it highlights some of the deeper underlying drivers of competitiveness in the industry. From a self-sufficiency perspective, the need to support broiler producers is clear, yet the cost to consumers as well as the segment of the population that would have to bear the cost of higher tariffs is questioned. The proposed tariffs as well as two other possible scenarios are simulated within a partial equilibrium framework in order to determine the effect on the fundamentals of the South African broiler industry. Simulations highlight the difference in outcomes when imports originating from the EU are also included in the general tariff increase. Under the basic scenario that simulates the impact of the current tariff application by SAPA, consumer prices for whole frozen chicken will increase by 2.6% while producers will enjoy an increase in producer prices of approximately 5%. On average, local production will increase by 16 000 tons per annum in the long run. Although 5% is a significant margin on the bottom line for broiler producers and a 2% increase in the average consumer price seems to be digestible, one has to take a step back and ask the question why our chicken producers cannot compete against imported chicken.","[Davids, P.; Meyer, F.

What characterizes the Andean comunidad are not notions of belonging and identity, but the existence of a fundamental antagonism (what I call the Real of community'). The argument unfolds ethnographically. Usibamba, a peasant comunidad in the central Peruvian Andes, is known as a highly egalitarian and disciplined comunidad. However, a disjunction exists between deep-seated aspirations of justice and egalitarianism and the particularistic interests of families and individuals. This disjunction manifests itself in a contradictory, schizophrenic regime of discipline and negotiation that produces split subjects'. Desiring development and the staging of theatrical performances of egalitarianism enables Usibambinos to deal with this disjunction and to present an image of unity and determination. I conclude that the comunidad persists through impossible political acts' brought about by a residual but growing category of landless comuneros who constitute the part of no part', the uncounted or unnamed.","Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"de Vries, P (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dept Social Sci, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",pieter.devries@wur.nl,,,,,,,46,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The state does not only spend vast sums of money on the public procurement, but also influence the market with legislation changes and policy making. Impact of the legislation changes on the economic indicators is shown, mainly of the most dramatic change in the procurement law in 2012.

The paper deals with the analysis and quantification of some characteristics of companies that may affect their ranking in local search results using the search domain Google. In the paper we try to experimentally determine which factors affect ranking in Google search. Of course, it is necessary to quantify the impact of these factors. To select these factors and to determine their impact, we use exact methods of mathematical statistics, hypothesis testing, correlation and regression analysis.

The 3-level framework of campus retrofitting processes was employed when conducting the three case studies. The cases were about the new ways of researching, collaborating and learning with the concepts of Living lab, Creative community for innovation and entrepreneurship and Network of learning hubs. The cases provided the first insights on retrofitting based on users' changing needs and the requirements of more sustainable solutions at campuses. Notably, a technical and spatial solution covers only part of retrofitting processes. The activity-based retrofitting consists on multidisciplinary collaboration and learning processes where diverse users have diverse roles during retrofitting processes.

The 20th century saw four phases of convergence and divergence in terms of globalization. In particular, capital markets were severely hit and their reconstruction took several steps, among which the introduction of Gold Standard institution, which turned out to be a mistake. A lack of monetary policy in the after-war period with no complement of fiscal policy made protection inevitable. The only way how to implement any policies was through trade. However, fear drove politicians to impose very high tariffs that yet caused more harm to the already destroyed economies. Possibly, we can argue that the non-economic implications of the war, such as the rise of extreme nationalism, communism, etc. were even worse than the economic ones. On a positive note, innovations brought technological advances and ideas to preserve peace led to the creation of many regional and world integration organisations, leading to a world convergence in the late 20th century.","[Gardonova, Kristina] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Econ Res, Sancova 56, Bratislava 81105, Slovakia",Slovak Academy of Sciences,"Gardonová, K (通讯作者)，Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Econ Res, Sancova 56, Bratislava 81105, Slovakia.",gardonova@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4200-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,204,211,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF1SG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380432500023,0

We outline literature results relating to income effects of economic crises in various parts of the world in general and the recent economic crisis in particular. What if revealed is that crises always affect the distribution of income and aggravate the problem of poverty, since the weight tends to be unevenly distributed. During the recent economic crisis, risk of poverty has increased, employment prospects are deteriorating and fiscal consolidation measures tend to reinforce inequality. Based on the results of an empirical investigation of secondary data on the income tax and its share on professional and income groups, we study the effects of the economic crisis and the measures implemented to deal with it in Greece. During the recent crisis in Greece, despite the reduction in income, total tax burden was increased due to the increased share of indirect taxes in total tax revenue. Furthermore the share of wages on GDP declined dramatically. It is the lower income groups that shouldered the brunt of fiscal adjustment. After the applied measures, a redistribution of income from the middle and mainly from low to high and very high income groups is recorded, despite the fact that wages and salaries, much less than corporate profits, contribute to overall inequality mainly due to tax evasion. The main mechanism responsible for unequal income distribution involves anti-development and anti-social austerity measures (fiscal and institutional arrangements to enhance labour market flexibility, etc.) implemented under the Memorandum, which led to an increase in the tax burden, mostly of lower incomes, a reduction on available income of households and a deterioration in indicators of economic and social welfare, income inequality and absolute poverty. The economic crisis and the measures implemented to deal with it in Greece, as in other regions of the world in the past and today, is utilized for a high-intensity (in size) and area (in the range of social groups affected) redistribution of wealth, through which the poor become poorer and the rich richer. The European strategy to address the crisis in the Eurozone and especially in Greece reinforced the inequalities and therefore operates as an obstacle to economic recovery and the equitable sharing of its results.

We are witnessing a revival of trading nations' interest in international trade agenda and trade talks, which have taken a backseat since the economic downturn following the global crisis. The improved outlook for global trade growth, but also the acute need for adjusting the world trading system to the ongoing structural changes in the spheres of international trade and industrial organization are, essentially, behind this policy shift. This paper takes stock of recent developments in the world trading system and highlights the prospects for global trade governance. It focuses on three issues: (1) the significance of the Ninth WTO Ministerial Conference in December 2013 for resuming global trade cooperation; (2) the recent drive towards plurilateral sector-specific trade deals; and (3) the outstanding pace and scale of negotiations on new preferential trade agreements (PTAs). The paper concludes with a discussion of the future direction of the world trading system. It argues that despite improved prospects for multilateral trade liberalization, the world trading system is becoming more fragmented and less coherent, and also more uncertain, being increasingly driven by PTAs and a variable geometry approach to WTO trade agreements.

Higher R&D investments in member states, as well as the design and implementation of adequate national research and development policies should not only reduce disparities with respect to R&D, but also foster economic growth and stimulate convergence. Romanian national strategies also acknowledge R&D as a priority sector, given its potential to increase labour productivity, competitiveness and economic growth, but up to now there is low convergence of the Romanian R&D system with the European one. In this context, our paper aims to assess the time required to close the gaps in research and development between Romania and the EU by means of catching-up computational methods. We analyze the likelihood of equalizing EU average using data on various indicators in the R&D field over 2005-2012. The necessary growth rate to achieve this goal is estimated under different scenarios: pessimistic, realistic and optimistic. We found that the time span required to fill the Romanian R&D system's gaps against EU varies between 5 and 25 years, depending on the indicator considered. Unfortunately, there are also R&D indicators for which the gaps got larger over 2005-2012, therefore catching-up is unlikely on the short run. As regards the Summary Innovation Index, efforts to equalize EU-28 average would be considerable since Romania should increase its annual SII rhythm of growth by four times, even in the pessimistic scenario of 30 years time horizon.

We employ World Bank survey data on regulations to test our conjectures. We find that regulatory restrictions, official supervisory power, capital stringency, along with private monitoring can explain bank risk in both crises. Additionally, we find that deposit insurance schemes enhance moral hazard, as this encouraged banks to take on more risk and perform poorly during the sovereign debt crisis.

Mortgage bonds have been sensitively linked to the mortgage credit market and it is therefore necessary to consider the development of a mortgage system in this mutual connection between sources (mortgage bonds) and loans.,"[Horvatova, Eva] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Economz, Dolnozemska 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia; [Horvatova, Eva] Masaryk Univ, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno 60300, Czech Republic",University of Economics Bratislava; Masaryk University Brno,"Horvátová, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Economz, Dolnozemska 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",eva.horvatova@euba.sk,"Horvatova, Eva/D-3928-2015",,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,201,210,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200028,0

The study was conducted on a sample of 68 companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) that have introduced quality management system ISO 9001. Study results indicate that the most common reasons for failure to implement procedures of quality management system were two factors; the first factor it's not my job and the other factor I planned to finish that later. By verifying hypothesis it was found that there is insufficient evidence to confirm that the consistent application of ISO 9001 affects company productivity. By verifying the auxiliary hypothesis it was found that managers and employees of BIH companies understand the purpose of ISO 9001. Auxiliary hypothesis, that BIH companies implementing ISO 9001 consistently apply proper procedures of quality management system, is confirmed.","[Isakovic, Suvad] Univ Zenica, Fac Polytech, Zenica, Bosnia & Herceg; [Husakovic, Dijana] Univ Zenica, Fac Econ, Zenica, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Zenica; University of Zenica,"Isakovic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zenica, Fac Polytech, Zenica, Bosnia & Herceg.",suvad.isakovic@ef.unze.ba; dijana.husakovic@ef.unze.ba,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,791,808,,,,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700050,0

Second, if bubbles exist, what are the implications for the pricing of derivatives on the bubble-laden asset? Third, if bubbles can exist, how can they be empirically determined. Answers are provided for three frictionless and competitive economies with increasingly restrictive structures. The least restrictive economy just assumes no arbitrage. The next satisfies no arbitrage and no dominance.

The presence of severe agency problems generated by the wedge between ownership and control may increase the demand for conservatism, while the greater managerial motivation and latitude in making accounting choices borne by the entrenchment problems can adversely affect the degree of financial reporting conservatism. We find that the ownership-control wedge is negatively associated with various proxies for conservatism, consistent with the entrenchment argument. Additional analyses reveal that a wide divergence between ownership and control adversely affects the corporate governance of a firm. Further, we find that the negative effects of the ownership-control wedge on conservatism are particularly strong for firms with weak corporate governance. Overall, we provide evidence that controlling shareholders act as a mechanism to mitigate the role of corporate governance, thus reducing implementation of conservatism.","[Kim, Myung-In] Inha Univ, Coll Business Adm, Inchon, South Korea; [Sonu, Catherine Heyjung; Choi, Jong-Hag] Seoul Natl Univ, Business Sch, Seoul, South Korea",Inha University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Sonu, CH (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Business Sch, Seoul, South Korea.",csonu@snu.ac.kr,"KIM, M.

Therefore, we apply the fractional multinomial logit model in our estimation of expenditure shares, because it more readily accommodates these theoretical restrictions.

One authentic example of subsidy use for forestation of a property with its costs and incomes was calculated and compared to other possibilities, using the property in a time period of 16 years. It is the time period of the forestation plan. Net present value (NPV) of cash flows from forestation plan was compared with present value from renting the property for the same time and as well as for infinity. Internal rate of return 2% p.a. was used for calculations. Results prove that initial investment for foresting was paid back already in the first year by subsidy and the NPV of forestation plan is more than 111 thousands CZK per 1 ha (4,044 EUR) what is almost 2 times higher, compared to renting this property for market price.","[Kohler, Pavlina; Preckova, Lenka] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Kohler, P (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",haltofova@opf.slu.cz; jarys.v@centrum.cz; preckova@opf.slu.cz,"Kohler, Philipp/AFH-8715-2022; Přečková, Lenka/AAR-4460-2020","Kohler, Philipp/0000-0003-0427-8934; Přečková, Lenka/0000-0002-1973-3293",,,,,2,0,0,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,406,414,,,,,,9,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300043,0

We extend prior studies to consider bank equity risk exposure to market-wide default risk, the structured finance market, and the asset-backed money market in a variance decomposition. Four important results emerge: (1) the risk in bank opaque assets is not accurately priced; (2) banks with lower earnings have higher risk; (3) a positive relationship between non-performing loans and bank risk increased threefold during the crisis and (4) banks with a larger buffer of Tier 1 capital have lower risk and lower exposure to shocks in market-wide default risk and the structured finance market in particular. These results highlight the importance to investors of studying fundamentals, while from a bank regulatory perspective, effective management of regulatory capital may manage risks arising from contagion stemming from structured finance markets and funding illiquidity.

The development of tax havens was favored by some factors at macroeconomic level, but also by tax noncompliance behavior of individuals who are seeking different ways to avoid taxation. Based on a logistic regression this study reveals the most important factors that favor a country's tax haven status. The main finding of this approach is that low taxation is not enough for a country to be a tax haven. Despite the fact that the corporate tax rate is indeed significant according to the model, the percentage of services in GDP proves to be the most prominent variable, and only the countries which have an important part of their GDP made up of services are likely to acquire tax haven status. Since offshore finance is one of the main pillars on which tax havens lie down, the importance of the services sector comes as no surprise. Using the logit model, each country's tax haven status is determined. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The research was performed through a questionnaire survey executed in the Vysocina Region and in the USK Banska Bystrica. The theoretical basis was a research of Raymond van Wijk et al. (2008), which had dealt with process management in organisations from the perspective of the use and transfer of intangible capital in intraorganisational and interorganisational context. The first stage of the project focused on assessing the situation in the area of existing conditions for state and local administration activities performance and the existing processes in the surveyed organisations. The survey was carried out in four public administration organisations, out of which two organisations are in the CR and two in the SR. The questions that were answered by respondents were divided into six topics, which are essential for ensuring process quality both in business sector organisations and in the public sector. These are human resources, organisational capital, information capital, customer capital, performance evaluation, and innovation capital of the organisation. To evaluate the research task, three assumptions were provided and consequently verified on the grounds of answers obtained from respondents. The survey results were evaluated by the correspondence analysis method by means of Pearson's chi-square test in contingency tables and based on correspondence analysis graphic output. The results showed very different levels in individual organizations where both good solution practices and improvement opportunities were identified in the area of their own activity and provided public service quality.","[Mertlova, Libuse; Dostalova, Zdenka; Prokop, Martin] Coll Polytech Jihlava, Tolsteho 16, Jihlava 58600, Czech Republic; [Koziak, Radoslav] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",College of Polytechnics Jihlava; Matej Bel University,"Mertlová, L (通讯作者)，Coll Polytech Jihlava, Tolsteho 16, Jihlava 58600, Czech Republic.",mertlova@vspj.cz; zdenka.dostalova@vspj.cz; martin.prokop@vspj.cz; radoslav.koziak@umb.sk,"Kožiak, Radoslav/AAA-9190-2021","Kožiak, Radoslav/0000-0003-0888-7980",,,,,16,0,0,0,4,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

It solved the problem of getting mentors (the Chartered Accountants), particularly in the workplaces with insufficient Chartered Accountants. Participation in CARE was a compulsory practical experience requirement, enforced by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) since year 2009. However, in year 2014, the Committee to Strengthen the Accountancy Profession in Malaysia (CSAP) argued on the ineffectiveness of distance mentoring. In Malaysia, little attention has been given on understanding on the effectiveness of distance mentoring in CARE. In the nurses' mentoring programme, distance mentoring was effectively implemented. Particularly, it overcame the issue of insufficient mentors in the United States. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to identify the factors influencing the effective distance mentoring in the nursing mentoring programme. It explores how technology has supported connectivity in distance mentoring. In the theoretical perspective, this paper extended the concept of distance mentoring in the lens of mentoring theory. The insights from this paper would assist the accounting graduates, mentors and MIA to enhance the distance mentoring in CARE. (C) 2015 The Authors.

These responsibilities can only be born if the these managers have the appropriate knowledge in their respective fields of expertise and know how to share this knowledge sustainable among each other, and have an effective awareness of the need for a knowledge sharing network within the organization. In this study, we develop a social media based knowledge management system for a company which operates in the telecommunications market, serving a special niche market. Managers from similar disciplines contribute to the project in sharing their knowledge on social media, mainly Google Plus. We develop structures for a sustainable knowledge management environment for companies in the example of managers, all of who have expertise in management or information technology.

In Romania, although discussed and debated in recent years, this subject has generated and still produces theoretical, methodological and practical issues. Economic and social consequences of changes in forest ecosystems are difficult to predict. Changes in the dynamics of river basins, ecologic regions or wildlife systems, for example, can reduce or increase various aspects of human welfare. Without sufficient knowledge about the value of forest ecosystem services, consequences unpredictability tends to increase with the degree of change. This paper will address some issues related to estimating the economic value of forests in Romania and ecosystem services provided by forests. The methodology used includes: clarifying and defining the main methodological and operational concepts, charts and diagrams to describe correlations and mechanisms of forest functions, qualitative and quantitative assessment (tables, matrices) of ecosystem services, with identification of the most important benefits, analysis of main methods of economic assessment of forest ecosystem services with recommendations and conclusions.

Recently, the debate has moved from the trade determination of growth to the openness-growth interdependence and growth spillovers through trade links. The aim of this paper is to empirically investigate the impact of the trading partners' performance on domestic economic growth. We employ panel data estimation for EU countries during 1999-2011, with the weights of trade partners based on export shares. We also enhance the model by the inclusion of the trade structure (by the means of the Grubel-Lloyd (GL) index). We find the inclusion of the trade partners' growth overtakes the significance of the trade openness measure. Furthermore, the consideration of the trade structure, so far neglected in the literature, seems to be a valid extension of the model. The elasticity of domestic growth with respect to trade partners' growth is around 0.85. An increase of 0.1 in GL index (a change of trade structure towards more intra-industry trade) further increases this elasticity approximately by 0.036.","[Radimersky, Miroslav; Hajko, Vladimir] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Radimersky, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",miroslav.radimersky@mendelu.cz; vladimir.hajko@mendelu.cz,"Hajko, Vladimir/I-4626-2018","Hajko, Vladimir/0000-0002-4089-979X",,,,,30,0,0,0,3,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,756,765,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000082,0

Moreover limited human capital, high uncertainty in terms of product and market, volatile development process, weak partnership ties are the utmost impediments for successful start-ups development (Fielden, Davidson and Makin, 2000). It has been finalised that venture capitalists are valuable contributors in both filling the financial gap (1), and providing value added services (2) like financial, technological, managerial support, and contacts (Hellmann, Puri 2002; Dubocage, Rivaud-Danset & Redi, 2012; Caselli et al., 2009; Bertoni & Tykvova, 2012). Still the research on venture capital role on the start-ups performance is fragmented the impact on the companies' performance indicators is revealed in some extent (Peneder, 2010). Having all mentioned the scientific problem emerges: what is the role of venture capital in start-ups development specifically on the performance indicators (turnover, number of employees). Purpose of study is to explore the role of venture capital funds as a catalyst for start-ups to overcome the valley of death especially focusing on the value added provision in terms of financial and innovation perspectives. Research is carried out by combining qualitative and quantitative research techniques including analysis and synthesis of the scientific literature, case studies and statistical data as well. The literature research has identified the characteristics of venture capital financing, specifically there are evidences that venture capital funds trigger the growth of company, product development, inspire entrepreneurship and thus enhancing the competitiveness of start-ups. Regarding the analysis of venture capital backed companies' cases in Lithuania it has been revealed that investments were made not only in start-ups, but for mature companies as well and covered various sectors, not solely high-tech, but also including energy, food, and textile sectors.

It is accredited the idea that local and regional development policies can be run more efficiently at the local level. Local public administration authorities, under the autonomy they have, hold an important position in the local development process. In this context, in our article we intend to analyze the link between the degree of local financial autonomy and the local development level, by considering the experiences of the Romanian local communities. The research made on the facts existing at the local communities level in our country has shown that with increasing degree of local financial autonomy, tends to increase the level of local development. A strong argument in support of this result is that greater financial autonomy to local government means greater ability of local public authorities to serve the needs of local communities, leading, consequently, to local development.

Using the panel of European transition economies and panel of other developed economies the specific role of trade openness is tested. The results from four different estimation method of panel data did not offer fully consistent outcome. The estimates for transition economics panel proved the significant role of trade openness but they did confirm statistically the impact of labour and capital. Such results are not consistent with Solow implications. The similar is valid also for the second panel of other developed countries excluding the fixed effect approach.,"[Sevela, Marcel] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Business Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Sevela, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Business Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",sevela@mendelu.cz,"Sevela, Marcel/N-4904-2019; Ševela, Marcel/I-4832-2018","Sevela, Marcel/0000-0003-3689-5929;",,,,,25,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,882,889,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000096,0

Historically, Slovakia has applied rigorous accounting rules for a long time, and we have selected its reporting system for examination of a relevance. Because Slovak companies are funded by borrowings rather than by investors, we have investigated the validity of the hypothesis, that their costs of debts align with accounting data (more specifically, accruals). Following prior studies, the logistic regression model have been built with accounting data covering three years' periods results of 1 687 Slovak companies.

The managers struggle, daily, with increasingly complex problems, caused by fierce competition in the market but also from the rising demands of customers. In this context, managers are tempted to pick an easy way, a shortcut, which will give them an advantage over the competitors. Usually this shortcut is in contradiction with the request of ethics and deontology in business, however many managers ignore this situation and choose to make short-term profit. This leads to the following question: Is it possible to be successful by respecting the ethics and deontology in business, considering that some of the competitors have an advantage through non-compliance to these requests? The research made in this article approach this sensitive aspect of business ethics and offer some practical solution and recommendation for managers, highlighting the ethics principles and the consequences of an unethical behaviour. This paper is written such that any manager, regardless of the experience or knowledge, can have a clear image over business ethics and to be sure, that success can be achieve by respecting ethics and deontology in business.

Thus, the objective of the study was to establish the research methodology for the assessment of strategic partnerships, as well as to carry out empirical study on the extent to which the existing strategic partnerships influence the industry's value chain. There was carried out an analysis of the construction industry's structure in Latvia on the basis of the statistical data, developed the methodology for partnership analysis, approximated and analysed the major partnerships, and carried out the market stakeholders survey and focus group discussions to substantiate the findings. The study highlights partnership differentiation both by structure and strategic goals. It was discovered that customer-focused partnerships tended to last much longer leading to customer loyalty and repeated business, while profit-focused partnerships were often only a temporary solution, the major influencing factor for any successful partnership being the alignment of the strategic goals of all involved partners.","[Vanags, Andris; Zarina, Vita] Turiba Univ, Riga, Latvia; [Begec, Suat] Cag Univ, Riga, Turkey",Cag University - Turkey,"Zarina, V (通讯作者)，Turiba Univ, Riga, Latvia.",Andris.vanags@sacret.lv; suat_beges@yahoo.com; vita.zarina@turiba.lv,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,10,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-15880-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,69,78,,10.1007/978-3-319-15880-8_6,0.0,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD3WD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360224400006,0

There are still many open questions related to the definition of competitiveness, competitiveness factors, the applicability and the practical approaches to foster competitiveness.

Taking into consideration the vital importance of funding the national economy by crediting, especially under crisis and after crisis circumstances, we analyzed the influence of regional loans in lei and foreign currency on the size of GDP at county level. The main objective is to establish the relationship or the extent to which the magnitude of regional crediting is connected with the level of economic and social development of counties. On the other hand we tried to identify several groups of counties depending on the size of their credit relative to national average. We regressed GDP on loans in foreign exchange and in lei, using up to two years lags. The main result is that, as expected, both loans in foreign exchange and in lei have positive and statistically significant influence on GDP at county level. We also found that all lagged regressors are statistically insignificant and only the contemporaneous variables influence the GDP.

Our main contributions are threefold. First, we characterize the distributional behavior of high-frequency asset returns both in ordinary clock time and in trade time. We show that when controlling for pre-scheduled market news events, trade-time returns of the near-month E-mini S & P 500 futures contract are well characterized by a Gaussian distribution at very fine time scales. Second, we develop a structured and parsimonious model of clock-time returns using a time-changed Brownian motion composed with a general, non-Levy directing process. Particular cases of this model allow for leptokurtosis and volatility clustering in clock-time returns, even when trade-time returns are Gaussian. Finally, we highlight conditions for the directing process which are required in order to generate proper volatility dynamics while simultaneously matching the unconditional distribution of returns. In-sample fitting and out-of-sample realized volatility forecasting demonstrate the strength of our model relative to leading candidates.","[Aldrich, Eric M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Heckenbach, Indra] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Phys, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Laughlin, Gregory] Yale Univ, Dept Astron, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Yale University,"Aldrich, EM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",ealdrich@ucsc.edu; iheckenb@ucsc.edu; greg.laughlin@yale.edu,,,Hellman Fellows Fund,Hellman Fellows Fund,This work was supported by the Hellman Fellows Fund.,,43,4,4,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

In particular, we argue that different combinations of asset specificity and agency costs are associated to firm age and sector of activity and predict heterogenous effects of ownership concentration on innovation across different types of firms. We use a unique data set of about 35,000 Italian manufacturing corporations over the 2002-2007 period and run a hurdle model, distinguishing four subgroups of firms on the basis of their age (greater or lower than 15 years) and of whether they belong to a high-technology or low-technology sector. We find that the effects of ownership concentration on innovation are coherent with the predictions of so-called shareholder theory when agency cost effects dominate over asset specificity effects and that they are coherent with the predictions of so-called stakeholder theory when asset specificity effects dominate over agency cost effects. These findings are robust to a number of identification issues, including the possible endogeneity of corporate ownership structures. Our results may allow to make sense of the contradictory findings of the literature on corporate governance and innovation, especially as regards the role played by ownership concentration, and may help policymakers to define more effective type-specific initiatives to stimulate firm innovation.","[Belloc, Filippo] Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Econ Studies, Chieti, Italy; [Laurenza, Eleonora] Bank Italy, Econ & Financial Stat Dept, Rome, Italy; [Rossi, M.

The effect is strongest when volatility is highest, for deals taking longer to close, and for larger targets. Merging parties attempt to shorten the interim window as risk increases.

The evolution of the field is analyzed for the period 2008-2014 using county level data sourced from the National Institute of Statistics and from the Office of the Trade Register. The evolution of the main characteristics of the field: number of companies, number of employees, total turnover of the companies from the field and number of newly established companies, suggest the existence of significant disparities at the county level. The research reveals the fact that the total number of employees from the field (companies which have sent the final year documentation to the MPF) has decreased during the analyzed period with over 20%, fact that is a clear indicator of the magnitude of the effects of the crisis. The analysis of the disparities has revealed that Bucharest which is the most important concentration pole in this field, accounting for almost 11% from the total number of companies in 2008, has diminished its importance to little under 8.7%, in 2014. Using panel data regression we have identified some of the main characteristics of the Romanian counties that can be considered as indicators of the development perspectives of the tourism (hotels and restaurants) at county level (NUTS 3).","[Strat, Vasile Alecsandru; Davidescu, Adriana Ana Maria; Grosu, Raluca Mariana; Zgura, Ion-Daniel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Strat, VA (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",vasile.strat@csie.ase.ro,"Strat, Vasile/AAS-3578-2021; Grosu, Raluca Mariana/I-5331-2017; Zgura, Daniel ion/Q-1685-2016; Strat, Vasile A/J-5917-2016","Strat, Vasile/0000-0002-5074-1419; Grosu, Raluca Mariana/0000-0003-4246-2433; Zgura, Daniel ion/0000-0002-5780-4590; Davidescu, Adriana AnaMaria/0000-0002-9847-1200",,,,,34,0,0,0,12,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2016,18.0,,,,10,,815,828,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ED1SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388624700007,0

We find strong evidence that, on average, firms do not issue mispriced stocks to exploit investors but, rather, to finance their investment opportunities in the form of real assets, inventory, and capital expenses. Firms that issue overvalued stocks with the view to increase their cash holdings experience poor long-run performance. Overall, our results show that stock mispricing drives equity offerings through IPOs and SEOs. Nonetheless, high transparency and balanced regulation in the marketplace deter issuing firms from investing their proceeds in non-value-creating activities.

Contemporary Venezuela offers an optimal venue for examining this question. The Chavista movement did not replace the previous state: instead, its leaders attempted to reform existing state entities and establish new ones in pursuit of its transformation agenda. It has also used its oil wealth to support cooperatively-oriented economic activity, without necessarily fundamentally altering the property structure. Thus, the social change-oriented political economy exists alongside the traditional one. Focusing on agrarian transformation, we examine ethnographically how these factors have impacted the state's capacity to attain its goal of national food sovereignty. We find that the state's ability to accomplish this objective has been compromised by lack of agency-level capacity, inter-agency conflict and the persistence of the previously-extant agrarian property structure. These dynamics have influenced the state to shift from its initial objective of food sovereignty to a policy of nationalist food security.","[Enriquez, Laura J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, 410 Barrows Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Newman, Simeon J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Sociol, 3001 LSA Bldg,500 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Enríquez, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, 410 Barrows Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",enriquez@berkeley.edu; simnew@umich.edu,,,Committee on Research of the University of California at Berkeley,Committee on Research of the University of California at Berkeley,"We would like to thank the numerous individuals who gave their time to be interviewed for this paper, including many government officials, representatives of non-governmental organizations and farmers.

These transaction systems, also known as matching markets, can be seen in a variety of phenomena in transnational development governance, including private aid, public private sustainable development projects, and transnational polycentric governance initiatives. In this paper, we utilize the matching market framework to develop a new approach to addressing an important question in development studies: how do donors (understood as donor agencies, funds and foundations, and firms) choose which projects to support? Beginning with the observation that matching markets in sustainable development governance are heavily constrained by transaction costs in the absence of formal institutions that lower costs of searching, monitoring, and communicating with potential partners, we hypothesize that both donors and project participants are motivated to utilize strategies to lower transaction costs of making connections, which results in selection of projects based on the presence of transnational brokers or familiar partners or as part of a strategy of spatial specialization. Conceptualizing the choices made in this matching market as an affiliation network connecting donors to sponsored projects, we utilize exponential random graph models of 91 funders' support of 195 Reducing Emissions from Deforestation (REDD+) and sustainable forest management pilot projects undertaken between 1989 and June 2012 to test the effects of transaction costs on donors' choices of projects to sponsor. We find that brokerage, prior collaboration with the donor in question, and spatial specialization all contribute to the ability of project proponents to attract funder support, often outperforming relevant project characteristics such as carbon density and accessibility. These findings suggest tensions between local scale project implementation and the transnational search for resource support observed qualitatively in the development studies literature can have significant effects on the overall structure of transnational collaboration on sustainable development.

Rather than flattening civic participation, a randomly assigned civic education course in Mali widened the gender gap when it increased civic activity among men while decreasing it among women. Qualitative data collected through focus groups and interviews reveal mechanisms by which the intervention generated these perverse consequences for women. In a place where women are traditionally unwelcome actors in the public sphere, female participation in the course constituted deviation from a pre-existing social norm. As compensation, women self-impose limits to future civic participation and men erect new barriers as a form of backlash. These findings are consistent with the resource paradox described in the literature in which increasing resources among women can yield negative outcomes when asymmetric or gendered social norms neutralize, or even invert, whatever benefits the resource confers on the woman. The civics intervention did, however, work to improve civic and political knowledge for men and women. Together, these findings suggest that resource constraints limit civic participation, but increasing informational resources cannot overcome discriminatory gender norms and may even exacerbate them. One implication of the study is that future participatory interventions like this one should be more attuned to the social constraints faced by women and other marginalized groups to both avoid setting untenable expectation and anticipate reactions to breaches of the status quo.

We address the extent to which individuals enter the state of GIS receipt at various ages as well as the extent to which individuals who receive GIS benefits at the earliest age of eligibility subsequently exit the regime. We first measure these transition rates, and then we focus our analysis primarily on the impact of three attributes of recipients: changes in marital status, entry cohort, and current age. The econometric equations include simple transition models of both entries and exits, as well as hazard models of the probability of exit. Among our many empirical findings is a non-trivial incidence of delayed entry into the regime as well as exit from the regime conditional on prior receipt of benefits. Women who transit from married to single status are more likely to enter, but the opposite finding is discerned for men. The hazard model for the risk of exiting the GIS regime conditioned on the duration of the ongoing spell of receipt reveals a sharp pattern of negative duration dependence.","[Finnie, Ross] Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Gray, David] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Zhang, Yan] STAT Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; Statistics Canada,"Finnie, R (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,,Canadian Labour Market and Skills Research Network; Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC),Canadian Labour Market and Skills Research Network; Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC),"We gratefully acknowledge funding from the Canadian Labour Market and Skills Research Network as well as Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC).

The premium increase resulting from natural catastrophes can primarily be attributed to an increased coefficient of expected loss calculated by catastrophe modeling companies. Furthermore, our results indicate a positive relationship between corporate spreads and CAT bond premiums. Thus, CAT bonds should not be regarded as zero-beta securities. Moreover, our results indicate that deal complexity, ratings, and the reinsurance cycle are significant drivers of CAT bond premiums.","[Guertler, Marc] Braunschweig Inst Technol, Dept Finance, Braunschweig, Germany; [Hibbeln, Martin] Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany; [Winkelvos, Christine] Volkswagen Financial Serv AG, Braunschweig, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; Volkswagen; Volkswagen Germany,"Hibbeln, M (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany.",martin.hibbeln@tu-bs.de,"Hibbeln, Martin/JOZ-3019-2023","Hibbeln, Martin/0000-0003-2350-9830",,,,,35,42,44,2,27,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

However, in practice, charging such a levy may give rise to distortions and unwanted effects on the real economy. Credibility that the levy will be imposed as a once-only measure is key to ensuring that harmful distortions in the allocation of resources are kept to a minimum. This paper confirms this using an analysis based on a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. In practice, while a government cannot guarantee that such a measure will be taken once only, it can contribute to the credibility of this in a number of ways. First, the country's future 'business model' must become apparent; second, there has to be a basic level of confidence in the government and a firm belief that the budgetary imbalances were not actively caused by the state - at least not by the government currently in power; third, a verifiable outlook of sustainable public finances must be in place; and fourth, the political costs of a repeat levy must be high. This paper also discusses the potential impact of alternative model set-ups as well as some practical implementation problems.","[Kempkes, Gerhard; Staehler, Nikolai] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Kempkes, G (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany.",gerhard.kempkes@bundesbank.de; nikolai.staehler@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,43,2,2,0,1,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

We find that residual basis, the part of the CDS-bond basis that cannot be explained by a wide range of market frictions such as counterparty risk, funding risk, and liquidity risk, strongly negatively predicts excess returns. Controlling for systematic risk factors, including credit risk and liquidity risk, we find that a bond portfolio formed on the residual basis generates a significant abnormal bond return of 1.79% at the 20-day horizon. The abnormal returns due to the residual basis reflect mispricing rather than missing systematic risk factors. These results are robust to different horizons and sample periods and to the various characteristics of bonds. Overall, our results imply a beneficial role of CDS in the bond market as the existence of mispricing between CDS and bonds results in a subsequent price convergence in bonds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Also, monetary incentives motivated participants in the deliberative mindset to overcome low expectancies of success; by choosing low risks but achieving high hit rates, deliberative participants' profits were comparable to those in the control group. Gender influenced risk taking but not profits, demonstrating overconfidence in men and underconfidence in women.

When Sovereigns finance bailouts with newly issued debt and the price of Sovereign debt is sensitive to unanticipated debt issues, then bailouts dilute the value of banks' Sovereign debt holdings rendering bailouts less effective. We explore this feedback mechanism in a model of financial intermediation in which banks are subject to managerial moral hazard and ex ante optimality requires lenders to commit to ex post inefficient bank liquidations. A benevolent Sovereign may desire to enact bailouts to prevent such liquidations thereby neutralizing lenders' commitment. In this context, home bias for Sovereign debt may arise as a mechanism to deter bailouts and restore lenders' commitment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis tackles this issue both theoretically and empirically. In the theoretical section of the paper, we describe a model of intergenerational transmission of cultural traits. In the empirical section, we use survey data from the European Values Study, to empirically identify this cultural component in environmental attitudes. We use a comparative approach that exploits variations associated with European migration flows. Our findings suggest that culture has a persistent and statistically significant impact on the environmental values of migrants: differences in environmental attitudes among migrants can be traced back to social values that persist in their countries of origin. We also show that environmental attitudes are resilient to incentives derived from the external environment: environmental conditions migrants have been exposed to in their countries of origin do not have a significant impact on their preferences when living in the host country. Our empirical findings are robust to a number of alternative assumptions and present interesting dimensions of heterogeneity concerning the cultural transmission process. These results imply that in the presence of multiple environmental problems that require collective action, comprehending the driving forces behind the formation of an environmental culture is critical to effective policy formation.

Despite the increasing development of green labels in the food market, to our knowledge no study has investigated implicit attitudes toward organic food nor has tried to change them. Capitalizing on the important role of the self in consumer or pro-environmental behavior, we aim to change or form implicit and explicit attitudes toward organic food brands using the self. Moreover, we investigate the possibility of changing hypothetical shopping behavior, brand identification, and attitude change persistence. Targeting two fictitious brands of organic food in two studies, we use the Self-Referencing (SR) task, an evaluative learning paradigm that relies on both the use of the self as a positive source of evaluation and the common action to classify the self and a target. We assess its effects on implicit attitudes, using one of the most common indirect measure (Implicit Association Test), as well as on explicit attitudes. We show that the SR manipulation results in more positive implicit attitudes, explicit attitudes, and to more frequent hypothetical choice of products for the eco-brand paired with the self compared to the other eco-brand. SR manipulation also results in higher level of brand identification. Moreover, changes in implicit attitude mediate changes in explicit attitude, identification, and hypothetical choice. Finally, we provide evidence for the persistence of the effect: Participants liked and identified more with the brand originally paired with the self even after removing the pairing with the self. The discussion is organized around the importance of taking into account implicit attitudes toward organic food brands and the usefulness of the self in changing or forming these attitudes.

We focus on the effects of taxes on equilibrium quota prices and on violations under the assumption that enforcement to induce compliance is imperfect and costly. The use of taxes is motivated by the regulator's need to recover costs for enforcement activities. We propose the use of a tax on the price of the processed products based on its impact on violations and the information that is required to implement it. We also show that this tax has a double pay-off for enforcement because it reduces the demand for illegal fishing and increases revenue for enforcement activities without producing a deadweight loss in the quota market. We present an application of our model to the case of the red shrimp fishery in Chile. In our simulation example, a tax of 7 % on the price of fish exports could sufficiently reduce harvest demand and generate enough funding to completely eliminate quota violations, which, in the absence of taxes, can be more than 100 % of the total allowable catch. At the same time, this tax could increase the equilibrium quota price by 19 %.","[Salgado, Hugo] Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Negocios, Res Nucleus Environm & Nat Resource Econ NENRE, Lircay S-N, Talca, Chile; [Salgado, Hugo] Univ Talca, Interdisciplinary Ctr Aquaculture Res INCAR, Lircay S-N, Talca, Chile; [Chavez, Carlos] Univ Concepcion, Dept Econ, Res Nucleus Environm & Nat Resource Econ NENRE, Victoria 471, Concepcion, Chile; [Chavez, Carlos] Univ Concepcion, Interdisciplinary Ctr Aquaculture Res INCAR, Victoria 471, Concepcion, Chile",Universidad de Talca; Universidad de Talca; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de Concepcion,"Salgado, H (通讯作者)，Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Negocios, Res Nucleus Environm & Nat Resource Econ NENRE, Lircay S-N, Talca, Chile.;Salgado, H (通讯作者)，Univ Talca, Interdisciplinary Ctr Aquaculture Res INCAR, Lircay S-N, Talca, Chile.",hsalgado@utalca.cl,"Chávez, Carlos/AAL-9080-2021","Chávez, Carlos/0000-0002-6045-2282","Scientific Millenium Initiative of the Chilean Ministry of Economics, Promotion and Tourism [NS 100007]; Conicyt-Chile under project Fondecyt [1110073]; [CONICYT/FONDAP/15110027]","Scientific Millenium Initiative of the Chilean Ministry of Economics, Promotion and Tourism; Conicyt-Chile under project Fondecyt(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT);","We thank two anonymous referees whose suggestions and comments have allowed us to improve the quality of the paper.

We investigate the organizational link between formal and informal sectors in India and argue that the spread of internationalization is more when production outsourcing prevails between such units. Higher wage in the organized sector is a factor that breaks standard institutional barriers leading to outsourcing of production to informal units. The evidence is puzzling to the extent that foreign capital and better know-how as drivers of international business to developing countries usually relax the credit constraint facing formal sector units at the destination and cause expansion of formal units. Using a measure of technology and a panel data for a large number of industrial units in India, we show that FDI transmitted through technology spillover leads to significant increase in the gross value added for several industries located in the informal sector. The paper points out that production re-organization associated with international capital movements should provide additional insights for standard measures of internationalization of production and services.

This paper addresses the question by examining the quality of fiscal forecasts at different stages of the budget process in 13 European Union countries by using annual forecast vintages (1999-2013) from Stability and Convergence Programmes. Both the role of political structures and the balance of power between the executive and the legislature are assessed as determinants of systematic forecasting errors. The findings suggest that the forecasting bias is more effectively countered in presidential and semi/presidential systems, in parliamentary systems with strong bicameralism and when executive/legislature relations are constrained by checks and balances. Confirmation of these results is also provided by linking our approach to the fiscal institutionalist approach based on the form of fiscal governance and the stringency of fiscal rules. In terms of institutional capacity, if fiscal rules and legislative organizational and research capacity counter the executive's monopoly of fiscal forecasting, strengthening the legislature's formal powers negatively influences the fiscal forecast accuracy. Indeed, strategic considerations may induce the executive to anticipate the legislature's amendment or rejection of the tabled budget by means of more favourable economic and fiscal assumptions. The crisis and its urgencies crisis seem to have weakened the effect of institutional executive/legislature relations on fiscal forecast accuracy.","[Giuriato, Luisa] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Rome, Italy; [Cepparulo, Alessandra] Univ Urbino, Dept Econ, Urbino, Italy; [Barberi, Matteo] Coll Europe, European Econ Studies Dept, Brugge, Belgium",Sapienza University Rome; University of Urbino,"Giuriato, L (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Rome, Italy.",luisa.giuriato@uniroma1.it,"Cepparulo, Alessandra/GNN-0407-2022","Cepparulo, Alessandra/0000-0001-7706-3868",Italian Ministry for University and Research,"Italian Ministry for University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","This paper has benefited from valuable comments by G.

Given the current state of technology and skepticism regarding the future purchasing power of existing monies, why have cryptocurrencies failed to gain widespread acceptance? I offer an explanation based on network effects and switching costs. In order to articulate the problem that agents considering cryptocurrencies face, I employ a simple model developed by Dowd and Greenaway (1993) (Dowd, K., and D. Greenaway. Currency Competition, Network Externalities, and Switching Costs: Towards an Alternative View of Optimum Currency Areas. The Economic Journal, 103(420), 1993, 1180-89). The model demonstrates that agents may fail to adopt an alternative currency when network effects and switching costs are present, even if all agents agree that the prevailing currency is inferior. The limited success of bitcoin-almost certainly the most popular cryptocurrency to date-serves to illustrate. After briefly surveying episodes of successful monetary transition, I conclude that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are unlikely to generate widespread acceptance in the absence of either significant monetary instability or government support.","[Luther, William J.] Kenyon Coll, Dept Econ, Gambier, OH 43022 USA",University System of Ohio; Kenyon College,"Luther, WJ (通讯作者)，Kenyon Coll, Dept Econ, Gambier, OH 43022 USA.",lutherw@kenyon.edu,,"Luther, William/0000-0002-7945-9927",,,,,58,68,76,2,101,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

This may result in rates of decumulation that are contradictory to the goals that motivated accumulation, leading to potentially large utility losses. We investigated the relevance of cognitive ability to asset decumulation decisions within our sample. We found that cognitive ability was a significant predictor of the rate of asset decumulation, and that those with lower levels of cognitive ability were decumulating at a significantly lower rate. We also showed that the level of cognitive ability influenced the effects of expected longevity, market returns, and medical costs. While the estimates for these factors were consistent between those with high and low cognitive ability, there were significant differences in how the estimates were incorporated into the asset decumulation decisions of the two groups.","[Browning, Chris; Huston, Sandra; Finke, Michael S.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Personal Financial Planning, 15th St & Akron, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Browning, C (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Personal Financial Planning, 15th St & Akron, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",christopher.m.browning@ttu.edu; sandra.huston@ttu.edu; michael.finke@ttu.edu,,,,,,,32,10,12,1,2,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

We hypothesize that the proportion of women directors, the proportion of independent, institutional, and executive female directors, and the percentage of shares held by female directors on BD, have an impact on the dividends policy of Spanish companies. Our findings, analyzing the whole sample, show that the proportion of female directors and shares held by female directors are positively associated with dividend payout, while the percentage of institutional female directors has a negative impact. The percentage of independent and executive female directors has no effect on dividend payout. When companies with losses are removed from the sample, the findings report that the percentage of female directors on BD and the percentage of independent female directors impact positively on dividend policy, while the percentage of institutional and executive female directors has a negative effect. The proportion of shares held by female directors on BD does not have an effect on dividend payout when only companies with profits are examined. Thus, the results confirm that gender diversity has an influence on dividend payout, so the existing legislation should encourage more participation by women in governing bodies. Our evidence supports the Act for Effective Equality between Women and Men, which establishes that listing companies have to achieve a quota of 40% of women in decision-making bodies by 2015.","[Consuelo Pucheta-Martinez, Maria] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Finance & Accounting, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Bel-Oms, Inmaculada] Univ Jaume, Dept Finance & Account, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Jaume I,"Pucheta-Martínez, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Finance & Accounting, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",pucheta@uji.es; bel@uji.es,"CHORMALE, Devyani/L-4782-2019; BEL-OMS, IMMACULADA/AAN-1614-2020; Bel-Oms, Inmaculada/J-8232-2017","BEL-OMS, IMMACULADA/0000-0001-9612-7660;",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2011-29144-C03-02]; FEDER,Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government),This article has received financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation under project ECO2011-29144-C03-02 and FEDER.

We define evasive entrepreneurship as profit-driven business activity in the market aimed at circumventing the existing institutional framework by using innovations to exploit contradictions in that framework. We formulate four propositions of evasive entrepreneurship and illustrate them with a number of real-life examples, ranging from a secret agreement among Chinese farmers in the 1970s to activities of rides-for-hire start-ups in the modern sharing economy. We demonstrate that while evasive entrepreneurship can either be productive, unproductive, or destructive, it may prevent economic development from being stifled by existing institutions during times of rapid economic change. Furthermore, it can spur institutional change with important welfare effects.","[Elert, Niklas; Henrekson, Magnus] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Box 55665, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Henrekson, M (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Box 55665, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",niklas.elert@ifn.se; magnus.henrekson@ifn.se,"Henrekson, Magnus/JXL-1358-2024","Henrekson, Magnus/0000-0002-1640-7126",Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Research Foundation,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Research Foundation,"We are grateful for useful comments and suggestions from Niclas Berggren, Wolf von Laer, Tomasz Mickiewicz, Erik Stam, and Karl Wennberg.

The quarterly component of dynamic correlations indicates the divergence of integration in Europe and highlights the heterogeneity in these markets. Panel regressions on these dynamic correlations, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, offer new insights into the role of macro-economic determinants of financial markets between assets and regions. This combined analysis of markets provides evidence on the importance of macro-economic factors such as inflation, uncertainty, debt, current account and economic growth in European financial integration. These factors may be overlooked when analysing a single market for individual pairs of countries. As a result we find that the robust role of economic fundamentals in European financial market correlations points to the need for European economic integration based on sound macro-economic fundamentals for both current and future Euro-zone members.

We account for heterogeneity among countries in the optimal entrepreneurship rate, in the growth penalty from deviating from that optimum, and in other factors affecting growth. Notwithstanding that developing countries have more of their population running nascent small firms than in developed countries, a marginal increase in the entrepreneurship rate in developing countries has a positive effect on growth. On the contrary, in developed countries, there is no evident growth penalty. Supplemental results suggest that is because in developed countries as a whole, entrepreneurship is now close to its optimal level, whereas in developing countries the optimal rates of entrepreneurship are much higher. We also explore how the growth penalty varies with characteristics of the country, allowing us to test theories regarding the relationship between entrepreneurship and growth. We show that higher levels of R&D capability decrease the growth penalty of having too few entrepreneurs, suggesting that entrepreneurship and R&D are substitutes. Availability of venture capital also increases the growth penalty, but only in developing countries, where our data on venture capital best proxy its availability to start-ups. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We build quarterly and monthly housing market datasets for eight OECD countries, estimating a range of specifications in panel vector autoregressions identified through a combination of zero and sign restrictions across both frequencies. Despite a minor amount of individual cross-country heterogeneity, our mean group panel estimators show a positive, persistent response of house prices which peaks at between one and two years following a policy shock. Residential investment responds more strongly than house prices, but takes longer to peak, consistent with the conveyancing procedures involved in construction.

This energy poverty has harmful economic and social consequences in rural areas, such as low productivity, lack of income-generating opportunities and poor housing conditions. In this paper, we consider electrification as a technical shock that may affect household time allocation. Using the 2010-11 General Household Survey, we investigate how electrification affects female and male labor supply decisions within rural households in Nigeria. Focusing on husband wife data, we consider potential dependence in spouses' labor supply decisions and address the challenge of zero hours of work using a recent copula-based bivariate hurdle model (Deb et al., 2013). In addition, an instrumental variable strategy helps identify the causal effect of electrification. Our results underline that this dependence in spouses' labor supply decisions is critical to consider when assessing the impact of electrification on these outcomes. Electrification increases the working time of both spouses in the separate assessments, but the joint analysis emphasizes only a positive effect of electrification on husbands' working time. In line with the household labor supply approach, our findings highlight that, within the household, the labor supply decisions of one spouse significantly affect those of the other spouse. Thus, if we neglect the effect of electrification on the spouse of the individual examined, we may fail to assess how this individual has been actually affected by this common shock on both spouses. Our results suggest that these within household relationships promote husbands' working time at the expense of wives' working time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

While also examining both the direct and indirect channels through which the effect of financial integration works, our research considers the tripartite relationship between financial openness, financial market development and economic growth. We test the simultaneous openness hypothesis of Rajan and Zingales and examine joint influence of both capital and trade openness on financial development in the region. While using a wide array of measures of financial market development capturing activity and size of financial intermediation and rule-based and quantity-based indicators of IFI, our result shows a negative association between financial integration and economic growth rate in SSA countries, contrary to the theoretical expectation. However, the study identifies a positive and significant association between IFI and financial development, supporting the indirect hypothesis view that IFI may positively influence economic growth through enhancing the depth of the domestic financial system. We observe empirical evidence supporting the simultaneous openness hypothesis in the SSA region. Policy wise, we argue that SSA countries should put in place and strengthen institutions of governance (security of property rights, transparency of legal system and investor-friendly laws) and enhance human capital formation to facilitate technology diffusion and cross-border capital flows.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse beta and sigma convergence in the 8 Economic Development Regions of Romania by a tourism approach. The concept of beta-convergence represents the process of quicker development of poor regions than the rich ones, and sigma-convergence is evaluating the process of decrease of regional economic disparities in time. The analysis based on beta-convergence was performed using econometric modelling techniques of linear correlation. For sigma-convergence, we measured the dispersion of real GDPT per in habitant by the use of the variation coefficient sigma(t). The purpose is to check the hypothesis according to which the beta-convergence approach and the sigma-convergence concept can lead to different results for the Economic Development Regions of Romania.

The principal purpose of this paper is to present the effects of the EU integration process on tourist movements in Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro during the period 2006-2014, as 2006 was the year when one of the surveyed countries initiated EU accession negotiations, and tourism sector contribution to GDP in these countries in the period from 2002-2013 based on the data available for these years. To that end, the authors have compared the relationship between the number of foreign tourist arrivals and overnight stays and the GDP rates in the surveyed countries. Upon reviewing the available sources, the authors have reached the conclusion that during the EU integration period, an increase in the number of foreign tourists and overnight stays positively correlated with the GDP growth. EU integration process has had a positive bearing on tourism movements in the surveyed countries. The panel regression method has shown that despite a continuous increase in the number of foreign tourist arrivals, tourism sector still makes a modest direct contribution to the overall economic growth of the surveyed countries (Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia). Also, the Granger causality test was applied to demonstrate that it is not possible to predict GDP values in any of the surveyed countries based on the tourism revenue growth, while tourism contribution to GDP in Macedonia and Montenegro can be predicted based on their GDP.","[Cerovic, Slobodan; Knezevic, Miroslav; Pavlovic, Danijel] Singidunum Univ, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Cerovic, S (通讯作者)，Singidunum Univ, Belgrade, Serbia.",scerovic@singidunum.ac.rs,"Pavlović, Danijel/AAJ-1713-2021; Cerovic, Slobodan/GXF-9147-2022","Pavlović, Danijel/0000-0003-2472-2043; Cerovic, Slobodan/0000-0002-4646-2476; Knezevic, Miroslav/0000-0002-5586-7213",,,,,31,1,1,1,15,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2016,18.0,42,,,,,407,422,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DP1SW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378270700011,0

High interest currencies more often tend to appreciate rather than depreciate, as noted by Fama (1984). In this paper, we treat volatility as the critical state variable and show that positive returns to the carry trade are overwhelmingly generated in the low-volatility normal state, whereas the high-volatility state is associated with lower returns or with losses as currencies revert to the long run level approximated by their mean real exchange rate - in other words, purchasing-power parity (PPP) tends to reassert itself, at least to some extent, during periods of turbulence. We confirm these results by comparing the returns from three possible monthly trading strategies: the carry trade, a strategy which is long the undervalued and short the overvalued currencies (the fundamental strategy) and a mixed strategy which involves switching from carry trade to fundamentals whenever the previous period's volatility was in the top quartile. We are left with the anomalous (but apparently robust) result that the mixed strategy appears to generate higher returns and Sharpe ratios than either of the pure strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While observers continue to discuss the sector in terms of its international work opportunities, in recent years the sector has increasingly focused on contracts sourced from Kenyan and other East African clients. The government has also refocused efforts on attracting international BPO companies. This domestic turn signals both the difficulties of gaining access to overseas work due to the power of incumbents and the increasing use of the internet and ICT-enabled automation within Kenyan organisations. In effect, better connectivity has enabled a two-way globalisation of services: Kenyan BPO companies can access international work opportunities but connectivity has also contributed to the inflow of international business practices into Kenya.

We rely on an ego-depletion manipulation which consumes self-control resources, thereby enhancing the influence of default reactions, or in psychological terms, automatic processes. Experimental results provide evidence that proposers make higher offers under ego depletion. Based on findings from a closely related dictator game study, which shows that depleted dictators give less than non-depleted ones, we discard the possibility that other-regarding concerns are the default mode. Instead, we conclude that depleted proposers offer more because of a strategic 'fear of rejection' of low offers, consistent with self-centered monetary concerns. For responders, ego depletion increases the likelihood to accept offers, in line with unconditional monetary concerns being more automatic than affect-influenced reactions to reject unfair offers.

We also differentiate between innovative and non-innovative industries and find for each subsample that overconfident CEOs create firm value. We find these results even when we control for founder CEOs as they add value and make similar corporate policy decisions as overconfident CEOs. Finally, consistent with the predictions of Goel and Thakor (2008), we find that overconfident CEOs are hired less frequently, take less risk, and add less value after the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, which put in place strict penalties for poor quality information disclosures by corporations. This finding has significant implications for empirical study as this paper provides evidence of the important impact the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has on the relation between CEO overconfidence and firm policies.

The volatility risk premium the difference between expected realized volatility and model-free implied volatility reflects the costs of insuring against currency volatility fluctuations. The strategy sells high insurance-cost currencies and buys low insurance-cost currencies. A distinctive feature of the strategy's returns is that they are mainly generated by movements in spot exchange rates instead of interest rate differentials.

Adjusting for the resulting selection bias reduces average annual index returns from 8.7% to 6.3%, lowers Sharpe ratios from 0.27 to 0.11, and materially impacts portfolio allocations. Investing in a broad portfolio of paintings is not attractive, but targeting specific styles or top-selling artists may add value.

However, if mining firms want to take advantage of the most mineral-rich terrain in developing countries, they must engage with the communities living near projected mining operations. Firms may sometimes use violence to quiet local opposition, but increasingly, they will seek a social license to operate. This term refers not to the legal requirements firm must obtain, such as governmental and environmental clearances, but rather the elusive support of the affected local population that will help a firm avoid project delays, maintain a positive public image, and prevent further regulation of the mining industry. There is a lack of research on how firms pursue a social license to operate. Through a qualitative case study of a mining conflict in Guatemala, this article addresses two questions: First, how do mining firms obtain a social license to operate, in practice? Second, what results from this process? Using a mix of qualitative data collected in 2009-2011, the article analyzes how a large Guatemalan construction materials firm, Cementos Progreso, sought a social license to operate in the indigenous municipality of San Juan Sacatepequez, Guatemala, and with what results. An alliance of firm and state constructed new institutions for citizen participation in local governance, promoted from within them the idea that mining was complementary with development, and backed up this discourse with tangible results. Government transparency and accountability improved, as did provision of basic services. The findings suggest that the local state, especially institutions designed to encourage citizen participation in local governance, can play a crucial role in determining whether and how mining firms can operate.

We find that ownership does not explain market power at the individual bank level. However, at the country level, foreign bank ownership has a positive and significant impact on market power mainly because foreign banks enter through mergers or acquisitions and not through greenfield investments. The observed increases in market power primarily originate from decreases in the marginal cost.","[Delis, Manthos D.] Univ Surrey, Surrey Business Sch, Financial Econ & Banking, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England; [Kokas, Sotirios] Univ Essex, Essex Business Sch, Finance, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Ongena, Steven] Univ Zurich, Banking, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Surrey; University of Essex; University of Zurich,"Delis, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Surrey Business Sch, Financial Econ & Banking, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England.;Kokas, S (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Essex Business Sch, Finance, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.;Ongena, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Banking, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",m.delis@surrey.ac.uk; skokas@essex.ac.uk; steven.ongena@bf.uzh.ch,,"Ongena, Steven/0000-0002-8381-0062","Centre of Money, Banking, and Institutions of the University of Surrey; Department of Economics of the University of Cyprus","Centre of Money, Banking, and Institutions of the University of Surrey; Department of Economics of the University of Cyprus","We are especially indebted to Sofronis Clerides, Robert De Young (editor), and two anonymous referees for many valuable comments, as well as to Stijn Claessens and Neeltje van Horen for the access to their data set on foreign ownership of banks.

Gain/loss ratios around 2: 1 mark an indifference point with a maximum decision conflict. Biological/psychological mechanisms behind this decision bias are largely unknown. Previous studies used a trait perspective with LA as an overall decision strategy, aggregated over many decisions. The present event-related potential (ERP) study on N = 36 healthy participants investigates neural correlates of LA using a different, situational approach by contrasting the 2: 1 ratio trials with low conflict trials and examining the interaction with trait LA. Results show an attenuation of a posterior positive slow wave in 2: 1 compared with low conflict decisions. In participants with high trait LA, this attenuation appears even in low conflict decisions. We suggest this indicates a relative negativity associated with conflict detection and perception depending on trait LA.","[Heeren, Gesine; Markett, Sebastian; Gibbons, Henning; Reuter, Martin] Univ Bonn, Dept Psychol, Kaiser Karl Ring 9, D-53111 Bonn, Germany; [Markett, Sebastian; Reuter, Martin] Univ Bonn, Ctr Econ & Neurosci, D-53111 Bonn, Germany; [Montag, Christian] Univ Ulm, Dept Mol Psychol, D-89069 Ulm, Germany",University of Bonn; University of Bonn; Ulm University,"Heeren, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Dept Psychol, Kaiser Karl Ring 9, D-53111 Bonn, Germany.",gesine.voigt@uni-bonn-diff.de,"Reuter, Martin/B-3456-2010; Montag, Christian/H-6536-2019; Markett, Sebastian/G-6328-2018","Montag, Christian/0000-0001-8112-0837;",,,,,69,6,8,4,45,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

In this article, we estimate the effects of industrial property tax abatements on industrial, residential, and commercial property value growth in the context of regional competition for a panel of 152 communities in the five counties surrounding Detroit from 1983 through 2002. We find that: (1) offering tax abatements yields statistically significant positive impacts on industrial property value growth; (2) the impacts are larger in high tax than in low tax communities; (3) there are positive spillover effects of industrial tax abatements on residential and commercial property value growth; (4) tax abatements offered in competitor communities do not appear to influence own industrial property value growth; and (5) changes in the own as well as competitor property tax rates are important determinants of industrial property value growth. However, the fiscal benefits of tax abatements are quite small as compared with the costs of offering abatements even when spillover benefits to residential and commercial properties are considered.

Evidence from China,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Asia; China; quality of governance; economic growth,GOOD ENOUGH GOVERNANCE; REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; PANEL-DATA; INSTITUTIONS; FEDERALISM; REFORM; MARKET; DECENTRALIZATION; BUREAUCRACY,"This study tests the causal relationships between quality of governance and economic growth at the provincial level in China during the post-Mao reform era. Exploiting the wide cross-provincial variation and rapid change over time in governance institutions and economic performance in China during this period (covering 1985-2005), the study provides a new perspective on the relationship between governance and growth. Whereas a large body of prior literature has demonstrated a strong positive association between high-quality governance institutions and good economic performance at the cross-country level, few quantitative studies have explicitly tested the direction of causality between changes in governance quality and changes in economic outcomes. This study aims to address this gap in the literature by testing two causal hypotheses on the interplay between provincial-level governance and economic performance in China: (i) improvements in provincial quality of governance predict subsequent economic growth rates, and (ii) increases in provincial economic growth rates predict subsequent changes in quality of governance. Using new heterogeneous Granger causality tests that allow for potential differences in the causal relations across provinces, I show a significant and positive effect of economic growth on subsequent quality of governance, largely driven by growth in the secondary sector, but no significant effect of quality of governance on economic growth. These findings suggest that improvements in formal governance have not been a key factor driving China's rapid growth; instead, the observed positive association between governance and growth reflects the ability of provincial governments to harness the potential created by economic growth to implement subsequent governance improvements. For researchers studying the effect of governance on growth, the results suggest that greater attention should be paid to possible reverse causality from economic outcomes to governance changes.

Nonetheless, there is lack of knowledge on how to assess and quantify the robustness value of new investments. This study investigates the robustness of alternative public transport networks by assessing the consequences of link failures on network performance. A full-scan disruption impact analysis is performed and its implications on passenger's group composition and travel time losses are analysed for a public transport development plan in Stockholm, Sweden. The results suggest that as a result of the development plan, the robustness of the case study network will improve in terms of average performance deterioration as well as worst case scenario for all performance indicators. Neglecting abnormal operations in project appraisal can potentially lead to the underestimation of its benefits. Moreover, the critical links in each network are identified and impact disparity is investigated. The analysis method presented in this study can support the consideration of development plan impacts on network robustness in the strategic planning process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The sample consists of 89 drivers who performed 42 thousand paths in the province of Reggio Emilia, in Italy, during the seventeen considered months. Four attributes that may be important for the driver are identified and four optimal alternative paths are created based on the selected objectives to evaluate route choice behaviour. The comparison between the characteristics of the paths allows to conclude that drivers select routes that are overall longer than their optimal alternatives but that allow for higher speeds. Furthermore the statistical analysis of drivers' route choices in macroareas evidences that drivers have different behaviours depending on the geography of the territory. Specifically, there is higher heterogeneity of route choices in the plain areas compared to the mountains. In the second part of this work, clusters of repetitive travels are identified and a Geographical Route Directness Index is proposed to identify the areas of the province where the deviation from the shortest alternative path is higher. The analysis shows that, among groups of repetitive travels, the value of the index is higher along the ring road of the city of Reggio Emilia and there is a strong negative correlation between the frequency the driver selects the longer alternative that allow for higher speed, and the number of additional kilometres the same driver has to travel.

Both a fundamental model and an augmented model are established, using export data of intermediate goods and two subcategories, processed goods and parts and components (P&C). We find that output growth is positively correlated with outsourcing, and outsourcing from the USA and Japan exerts lower effects than the average level. Our results show that Chinese outsourcees not only access higher productivity than their domestic non-outsourcee counterparts, but also generate spillover effects to the non-outsourcees. Moreover, outsourcees of Japanese multinational corporations (MNCs) gain more technological advantage while outsourcees of US origin act as a more effective external stimulus to increase production of non-outsourcees in China.","[Ma, Jingmei; Jia, Hongyu] Harbin Univ Sci & Technol, 138 Mailbox,52 Xuefu Rd, Harbin 150080, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Ding, Yibing] Jilin Univ, 2699 Qianjin Rd, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China",Harbin University of Science & Technology; Jilin University,"Jia, HY (通讯作者)，Harbin Univ Sci & Technol, 138 Mailbox,52 Xuefu Rd, Harbin 150080, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",maggiesisu@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71303071],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The paper is sponsored by The National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71303071).,,13,0,1,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

A comparative analysis of urban carbon management policies in the UK and Germany,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Governance; Carbon; Climate change; Targets; Institutions; Cross-national comparison; COP21,CLIMATE-CHANGE; GOVERNANCE,"The paper addresses the important question of how institutional structures matter to the delivery of climate change policy for urban transport. It examines the strategic goals, policy tools in operation and initial progress towards carbon emission reduction in seven cities across the UK and Germany where different institutional structures exist The UK has the presence of a strong national carbon target and strong hierarchical national local government relationships whilst Germany has a more integrated system of local transport provision in a context where local and regional government is stronger. Our findings show that the carbon agenda has made very little difference to what is happening on the ground in the cities. Across all sites, progress is being made but largely through technological improvements which are being almost completely offset by population growth. Even in the more integrated city environments there has not be an additional stimulus to manage the demand for travel. Contrary to previous research therefore, we cannot conclude that institutional structures are paramount in delivering effective carbon reduction policies. The institutional structures in the UK and in Germany are not perfectly aligned to carbon management but, given the cross policy impacts of most transport interventions, this is perhaps inevitable. We can clearly conclude however that better structures are not sufficient to achieve the implementation of more effective carbon policies. Whilst institutional structures must matter, it is the broader governance environment and the resources and politics involved in transport policy that currently seem to dominate the importance of the carbon agenda and implementation paths that emerge.

This paper describes how National and Regional Human Development Reports have generated a rich and analytically fruitful set of approaches to examining and responding to contextual threats, following human security principles - for people-centred, comprehensive, context-specific and prevention-oriented analysis and exploring basic security questions. However, this richness has not fed back yet into the global apex of Human Development Reports and related work, reflecting a disconnection between levels of analysis that hinders the transformation of development and security narratives.","[Gomez, Oscar A.] JICA Res Inst, Tokyo 1628433, Japan; [Gasper, Des] Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands; [Mine, Yoichi] Doshisha Univ, Grad Sch Global Studies, Kyoto 602, Japan",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Doshisha University,"Gomez, OA (通讯作者)，JICA Res Inst, Shinjuku Ku, 10-5 Ichigaya Honmuracho, Tokyo 1628433, Japan.",Gomez.Oscar@jica.go.jp,,"Gomez, Oscar A./0000-0002-9419-295X",,,,,64,7,7,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The PPE results from an interplay between agents acting in a volatile market that is characterized by predatory behaviors. Prior to the 2008 subprime crisis, average investors are assumed to have displaced their logical PPEs in large part as a consequence of their attraction towards predatory mortgages and teaser rates. A better understanding of average investor's vulnerabilities may help governments to implement more efficient measures aimed at curving predatory behaviors.","[Mesly, Olivier; Tessier, David] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Gatineau, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais,"Mesly, O (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec Outaouais, Mkt, Dept Adm Sci, 2nd Floor,101 St Jean Bosco St, Gatineau, PQ J8X 3X7, Canada.",olivier.mesly@uqo.ca,,,,,,,48,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

The research is divided into two sections and the approach used is mainly theoretical and qualitative. In the first part the UE financial and non-financial information regulations is analyzed; the European Union launched a process of harmonization - in order to reduce the variability of accounting rules by issuing important Directives - then subsequently it moved to the standardization process, consisting in the adoption of a single set of accounting principles to be applied uniformly to all businesses: the Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 is part of the standardization process (It must be applied in its entirety across the EU) while the Directive 2014/95/EU is part of the harmonization process (it sets out a goal that all EU countries must achieve). The Directive 2014/95/EU states that large undertakings [...] shall include in the management report a non-financial statement [...] thus making mandatory the preparation of non-financial statements. In the second part of the research, not considering the firm only as a system for the production of financia/economic value but also as economic social actor which operates in a social environment to which it belongs and with which it interacts, the concept of social entrepreneurship is explained associating to it a unique role in efficiently contributing to the achievement of sustainable development goals. Social entrepreneurship belongs to the entrepreneurs who draw up the social balance, required or permitted by the UE legislation. For this reason, the introduction of obligations in disclosing non financial information (i.e. the drafting of the social balance) in a corporate social responsibility point of view, could lead to the increase of entrepreneurship, with positive consequences in the creation of tangible benefits to both the business community and the global community.","[Amelio, Stefano] Univ Insubria, 2 Via Ravasi, Varese, Italy",University of Insubria,"Amelio, S (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, 2 Via Ravasi, Varese, Italy.",stefano.amelio@uninsubria.it,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,11,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,885,897,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300073,0

We model this demand by means of a generalization of the linear expenditure system allowing to differentiate within the residential water consumption a captive component independent of prices and household income, and a variable component as a function of prices and household income, which can be influenced by a relevant water pricing policy. Our estimates carried out by taking into account possible selection bias reveal the importance of captive consumption resulting both from household basic needs and from the outdoor uses of water. Therefore, it is advisable to complement pricing policies with other measures, such as information campaigns focusing on the outdoor uses of water.","[Binet, Marie-Estelle] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, Fac Sci Econ, CREM,UMR 6211, 7 Pl Hoche, F-35065 Rennes, France; [Carlevaro, Fabrizio] Univ Geneva, GSEM, UNIMAIL, Blvd Pont Arve 40, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Paul, Michel] Univ La Reunion, Fac Droit & Econ, CEMOI, 15 Ave Rene Cassin,CS 92003, F-97744 St Denis 9, France",Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); University of Geneva; University of La Reunion,"Paul, M (通讯作者)，Univ La Reunion, Fac Droit & Econ, CEMOI, 15 Ave Rene Cassin,CS 92003, F-97744 St Denis 9, France.",michel.paul@univ-reunion.fr,,,,,,,54,2,2,0,4,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Modeling the persistent component of interest rates has important consequence for forecasting. Factor models of the term structure are restricted VAR models that project over a long-horizon the one period risk free rate to obtain yields at longer horizon as the sum of the expected future monetary policy and the term premia. The included factors are typically mean reverting and the equilibrium real rates are considered constant (think, for example, of the standard Taylor rule), partial adjustments to equilibrium yields are then used to rationalize the persistence in the observed data. As a result, the empirical models feature a very high level of persistence that makes long-horizon predictions inherently inaccurate. This paper relates the common persistent component of the U.S. term structure of interest rates to the age composition of population. The composition of age structure determines the equilibrium rate in the monetary policy rule and therefore the persistent component in one period yields. Fluctuations in demographics are then transmitted to the whole-term structure via the expected policy rate components. We build an affine term structure model (ATSM) which exploits demographic information to capture the dynamics of yields and produce useful forecasts of bond yields and excess returns that provide economic value for long-term investors.","[Favero, Carlo A.] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Gozluklu, Arie E.] Univ Warwick, Finance, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Yang, Haoxi] Nankai Univ, Sch Finance, Nankai, Peoples R China",University of Oxford; University of Warwick; Nankai University,"Yang, HX (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Sch Finance, Nankai, Peoples R China.",carlo.favero@unibocconi.it; arie.gozluklu@wbs.ac.uk; haoxi.yang@outlook.com,,,,,,,99,16,17,3,16,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

From our preliminary analysis it emerges that, on the demand side, female firms apply for bank loans less than male firms, and one of the relevant determinants for their decision not to apply is the fear of rejection. On the supply side, when applying, female firms face a higher rate of rejection or receive less bank financing than male firms. No general patterns seem to emerge when crossing micro and macro data, even though at the country level, we detect some correspondence between banking system characteristics, socio-institutional indicators and gender differences in access to formal credit.","[Galli, Emma] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Social & Econ Sci, Rome, Italy; [Rossi, Stefania P.

Consumers' rights and protecting their safety are priorities for the European Union, alleging a partnership between member states and citizens.

The interest of this paper is finding out if consumers consider themselves well-informed, and which are the main channels used with a view to feeling comfortable and to trusting European market dynamics. Consumers' opinions about the efficiency of online communication have a double impact on the social spectrum: being adaptive or being repellent. Hereby, the research questions are: 1) Is consumers' communication endeavoring the European spirit?; 2) Has online communication diluted barriers in Europeans' perceptions about a common market?; 3) Has online communication system delineated economic transactions?. Our approach is from a social-cognitive perspective, acknowledging the importance of behavioral communication in economic boundaries. The environment in which consumers work or spend spare time determines and influences their acts, attitudes and social behavior. In order to understand how consumers' look at the European Union's interest in being more open to citizens and to how their social behavior in the online area can mark the way consumers react to European goods, we resorted to a qualitative research, with in-depth interviews. Investigating the bond between consumers' trust and consumers' acts in acquiring European services brings into light the fact that communication remains unavoidable and compulsory for gaining citizens' credential regardless of the frame of reference.","[Gorgos, Elena-Alexandra; Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Gorgos, EA (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",alexa_elena85@yahoo.com; madalina.vatamanescu@facultateademanagement.ro,"Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina/F-4872-2017","Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina/0000-0002-9397-0385",,,,,26,1,1,0,4,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,359,369,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300029,0

We establish that, from a theoretical perspective, Expected Shortfall based regulation can provide a misleading assessment of tail behavior, does not necessarily protect liability holders' interests much better than Value-at-Risk based regulation, and may also allow for regulatory arbitrage when used as a global solvency measure. We also show that, for a value-maximizing financial institution, the benefits derived from protecting its franchise may not be sufficient to disincentivize excessive risk taking. We further interpret our results in the context of portfolio risk measurement. Our results do not invalidate the possible merits of Expected Shortfall as a risk measure but instead highlight the need for its cautious use in the context of capital adequacy regimes and of portfolio risk control.

This chapter presents the share of demand reported in public tenders against the total market demand. Moreover, in order to identify the market concentration level, measurement was performed on the basis of discrete and accumulated measures. The analysis of the share of the volume of transport services purchased in tenders led to the conclusion that it could play a part in shaping market behaviours of units in the highly concentrated rail freight transport market.

Recently, Garter, Malmendier, and Tate (2008) started to look at the different effects of the bankers with different expertise on the investment strategy and post-entry performance of the firms on which they have board seats. This study extends this line of research to further examine the relationship between the change of different types of financial professionals' equity holdings of acquiring firms prior to merger completion dates and these acquirers' post-merger performance. Using 381 U.S. listed acquirers during 2000-2005, we find that the changes of the ownership of commercial banks and insurance companies are positively related to the acquirers' short-term performance. However, only the changes of the ownership of investment bankers are negatively related to the bidders' long-term performance, implying that, due to conflict of interests, investment bankers probably aim at the increase of the short-run post-merger performance of the acquiring companies of which they have relatively larger equity holdings.

The main aim was to analyse the spatial diversity of countries in terms of the degree of implementation of the strategy and the progress that countries have made in this regard. An attempt was made to assess the relative developmental disparities between countries. Methodology/methods The methods of multivariate statistical analysis were applied. To assess the degree of implementation of the strategy a dynamic version of Hellwig's synthetic variable method was used. The analysis of the disparities between countries was made with a dynamic measure of the relative taxonomy, proposed by Wydymus. Scientific aim The scientific aim was to evaluate the progress made by countries in implementing the objectives of the strategy and the relative developmental disparities between Member States with particular attention to the countries that joined the EU in 2004. Findings The study confirmed the strong differentiation of EU Member States. The majority of countries that joined the Community in 2004, has made significant progress and reduced the disparities compared to others. The countries, political leaders of EU (Germany, France, Great Britain, and Italy) have achieved rather disappointing results. Conclusions Most of the countries made significant progress in achieving specific objectives such as increasing investment in R & D, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increase the use of renewable energy and reducing the number of young people do not continue education. The biggest problem remains the fight against poverty and social exclusion. The evaluation of the progress made by individual EU members can not only help to identify good practices, but also to prevent making the same mistakes. The results of the study can be used by the European Commission as well as the institutions and authorities of the different countries of the Community to evaluate the progress made and to take appropriate actions.","[Mueller-Fraczek, Iwona; Muszynska, Joanna] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Gagarina St 11, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Muszynska, J (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Gagarina St 11, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",Joanna.Muszynska@umk.pl,"Müller-Frączek, Iwona/E-6592-2019; Muszyńska, Joanna/Q-6761-2017","Müller-Frączek, Iwona/0000-0002-1996-3275;",,,,,12,3,3,0,3,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,346,355,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200043,0

Design/methodology/approach - Since the authors combined individual-level and country-level observations, data were analyzed employing hierarchical linear modeling methods and random-effect logistic regressions to estimate the influence of country-level factors on the likelihood of individuals' entry into techno-entrepreneurship. The data set comprised 10,280 observations for 18 emerging countries during the 2002-2008 period. Findings - The selected informal institutions relate to techno-entrepreneurship as follows: the size of the shadow economy has a U-shaped relationship; ethnic diversity is positively associated; and ethnic polarization is negatively associated, though the latter is not significant. Research limitations/implications - The authors did not theorize on cross-level mechanisms through which these informal institutions could influence individual-level attitudes, nor did the authors assess the role of such institutions on general entrepreneurship. However, this paper provides a base for more fine-grained studies. Originality/value - The authors disseminate novel insights into the particularities of emerging economies since all informal institutions studied here have been negatively associated with the overall economic experiences of developing and least developed countries. In addition, the authors provide a unique contribution by identifying a potential U-shaped relationship between the size of the shadow economy and the likelihood of individuals engaging in techno-entrepreneurship.","[Pathak, Saurav; Laplume, Andre O.; Xavier-Oliveira, Emanuel] Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",Michigan Technological University,"Pathak, S (通讯作者)，Michigan Technol Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",sauravp@mtu.edu,,,,,,,59,10,10,1,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The set of changes affecting the world of tourism, both as regard the demand and supply sides, is accompanied by increasing attention and sensitivity to sustainability understood in its social, environmental and economic dimension. These trends have led to the emergence of a new type of tourist, who aims to live a territory and to interact with the local community, in a relationship of mutual exchange, which translate into a new experience for tourists. In this perspective, starting from the review of the scarce literature on the subject and by the definitions of sustainable tourism offered by different international institutions official documents, the paper aims to deepen both characteristics and evolutionary trends of sustainable tourism, with the aim of capturing the impact this type of tourism could have on tourist destinations.","[Pavione, Enrica; Pezzetti, Roberta] Univ Insubria, Via Monte Generoso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy",University of Insubria,"Pavione, E (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, Via Monte Generoso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",enrica.pavione@uninsubria.it; roberta.pezzetti@uninsubria.it,,,,,,,55,2,2,0,8,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,986,996,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300082,0

Depending on how effective farmers and other market players are, the politicians can make adequate decisions. The effectiveness of farmers mainly depends on their costs and harvest selling price. Fertilizers and other operating materials are an important parts of the farmer's budget. The fertilizer price can have a huge impact on farmers financial situation. For farmers, as well as other agribusiness, accurate fertilizers price forecast has direct impact on the cost and profitability. On the other hand depending on fertilizer price forecast, industry can try to balance its production and maximize the profit. Methodology/methods The following statistic and econometric methods have been used: statistical analysis, random walk, ARIMA, linear regression with lagged variables, neural network. Data was collected from different German and international fertilizer market publications. Scientific aim The main purpose of the paper is to compare four different models of one step-ahead forecasts of weekly fertilizer (Calcium ammonium nitrate) price in Germany. Several models are build and tested in the paper: random walk model, univariate AR times series model, linear model with lagged two independent variables (sold quantity and price of substitute product) and neural network model. Findings Our research suggests that the forecasting of fertilizer price is important from a practical and theoretical point of view. Mainly due to the constantly growing fertilizer price (Riester, 2015) which constitutes a significant part in all farmers costs, fertilizers price forecast can be crucial for farmers. Conclusions Results suggest that all models are suitable for forecasting fertilizer price; but the most accurate models has been univariate AR(6) times series model and neural network model.","[Pilinkiene, Vaida] Kaunas Univ Technol, Donelaicio G 20-334 Kab, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Zuoza, Aurelijus Kazys] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Sporto Str 6, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Zuoza, Andrius] Agro Baltic GmbH, Rungestr 17, D-18055 Rostock, Germany",Kaunas University of Technology; Lithuanian Sports University,"Zuoza, A (通讯作者)，Agro Baltic GmbH, Rungestr 17, D-18055 Rostock, Germany.",azuoza@gmail.com,"Zuoza, Andrius/AFQ-3753-2022",,,,,,19,0,0,0,6,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,370,378,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200046,0

Methodology/methods Consumers chocolate motives were measured by using the classification of psychological motives developed by McGuire (1976). The sample was 202 respondents (159 people were from Estonian ethnicity and 43 people from Russian ethnicity). The survey was conducted in internet. The questionnaires were available in Estonian and in Russian. The main results were analyzed by t-test. Scientific aim Consumers' purchases are dependent on their needs and motives. In Estonia is not enough information about the motive differences of chocolate buying between two ethnic groups - Estonians and Russians, therefore it was important to find out the the differences of purchase motives in different ethnic groups. Findings Estonians and Russians motives differed from each other. There were six McGuire's motives that by result of the t-test had statistical difference between two ethnic groups: consistency, attribution, categorization, autonomy, reinforcement, and affiliation. Estonians chocolate purchase motives were more influenced by affiliation, but Russian ethnicity was more influenced by categorization, and reinforcement. Moreover, Russians bought chocolate more frequently than Estonians. Conclusions Current research offered important implications for chocolate producers and importers. It showed that Estonian and Russian ethnic groups need different marketing approaches in chocolate selling. Moreover, this was the first study that examined chocolate purchase motives in Estonia and it gave vital ideas how to be successful in advertising campaigns using the information about the consumer motives.

In this paper, we use four waves of a primary panel household survey conducted in 17 remote natural villages in China to study how road access shapes farmers' production patterns, input use, and rural poverty. We adopt a difference-in-difference approach by comparing the outcomes of the households in villages with and without road access, before and after the introduction of each road. Our results show that access to roads facilitates specialization in agricultural production. In natural villages with better road access, farmers plant fewer numbers of crops, purchase more fertilizer, and hire more labor. Consequently, road connections improve household agricultural income and reduce poverty. In addition, road access significantly increases local nonfarm income for the relatively poor households, but not the rich. Overall, our research provides empirical justification on the importance of rural road on agricultural specialization and poverty reduction, especially in isolated and impoverished regions.

On the contrary, the promotion of energy efficiency actions (accomplished by a large number of industrial and domestic consumers that are very poorly supported by energy policies), are still little explored. According to ODYSSEE-MURE, energy efficiency at the EU-28 level improved by 1.2%/ year on average from 2000 to 2013, while for the case of Spain, the rate of improvement was only 0.6 %/year on average throughout that period (the lowest rate of energy efficiency improvement in the EU-28). This work seeks to compare the integration of renewable production with energy efficiency plans, in order to advance their potential economic impact in the wholesale market and consumers. To reach that goal, the hourly market data retrieved from the Spanish/Iberian Market Operator (OMIE) for 2014 will be used as a base. Then, a set of pseudoheuristic scenarios with integration of renewable production and energy efficiency (load saving) will be elaborated and analyzed to quantify what are expected to be the main effects on the Spanish electricity market and consumers. The results will show that energy efficiency exhibits the best performance in terms of economic efficiency (less cost of the traded energy) and environmental sustainability (greater replacement of fossil fuels).

Increasingly, regions and even cities may be forced to act in ways which in the past were mainly attributed to firms. Demanding more entrepreneurial spirit from the regional business community is unlikely to be effective, if the regions themselves cannot put forward a leading entrepreneurial spirit transcending single firms, be it in offering bold incentives or in making local Intellectual Capital (IC) more attractive and accessible. We propose to research both factors and effects leading to increasing chances for young candidate entrepreneurs (YCE) to succeed on South East European (SEE) markets. This research attempts to uncover deficiencies to be found in pertinent social and technological knowledge management (KM) of some SEE regions. From the methodological point of view we begin by asking: what are nonstandard features or influences of small and medium enterprises (SME) which are notoriously absent in SEE. A literature review leads to the following two main groups of influences: a) venture capital (VC) and crowdfunding (CF), and b) the technologically highly specialized yet economically mysteriously successful hidden champions (HC) as can be found at present mainly in Western and Central Europe. As findings we propose a knowledge based model cycle which considers awareness of highly successful but less well known models of entrepreneurship, e.g. like the ones used by hidden champions. In the model cycle, entrepreneurial success may also be associated with different startup catalysts such as venture capital and crowdfunding. The study has the limitation of relying on insights and data concerning mainly the financial literacy of young people found in a SEE region. By extrapolating to entrepreneurial literacy of persons which may be related to regional IC as sketched in the model cycle, we hope to eventually propose effective instruments in order to attract economically more resilient SME which help to transform otherwise decaying or structurally underdeveloped regions.","[Schebesch, Klaus Bruno] Vasile Goldis Western Univ Arad, Dept Comp Sci, Arad, Romania; [Pribac, Loredana; Blaga, Radu] Vasile Goldis Western Univ Arad, Dept Mkt, Arad, Romania",Vasile Goldis Western University of Arad; Vasile Goldis Western University of Arad,"Schebesch, KB (通讯作者)，Vasile Goldis Western Univ Arad, Dept Comp Sci, Arad, Romania.",kbschebesch@uvvg.ro; pribacloredana@yahoo.com; buteniradu@yahoo.com,"Blaga, Radu Lucian/AEL-9184-2022","Blaga, Radu Lucian/0000-0001-7562-5900",,,,,30,1,1,1,28,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,262,270,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300032,0

A comprehensive and theoretically grounded examination of how national culture is likely to affect offshoring performance is necessary. The present article aims to provide a further step in cultural research exploring the magnitude of cultural influence factors on the additional costs of near-and offshoring projects in comparison with other cost drivers. Methodology/methods Prior research on software development outsourcing is almost exclusively based upon the cultural model created by Geert Hofstede. Hofstede's model, though, is criticised within the cultural research community. A more recent study addressing this criticism is the Globe Study, which has been used in this study. Eight interviews with project managers were conducted, half of whom were responsible for software development nearshoring projects in Russia, and offshoring projects in India. Scientific aims The research deals with the following main questions: (1) To what extent are cultural influence factors responsible for additional costs in near-and offshoring projects? (2) Is it possible to draw conclusions from the results regarding the advantages and disadvantages of near-and offshoring? Findings According to the present study as software development projects offshored to India as expected were influenced more by cultural factors than those nearshored to Russia. In contrast, projects nearshored to Russia were obviously most influenced by non-cultural factors, namely Knowledge Deficits and Geographical Distance. Cultural aspects were only ranked third. Despite these apparent differences, a deeper analysis showed that both project categories were most influenced by the availability of skilled personnel. Cocnlusion The study confirms the general expectation that the higher cultural distance of the offshoring location India as compared to Russia results in significantly higher ratings regarding the effects of culture in the projects offshored to India that were researched. This result should not be interpreted by practitioners prematurely as a recommendation for nearshoring as a silver bullet to avoid negative cultural effects.","[Sebelin, Oliver] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005 25, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Sebelin, O (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005 25, Slovakia.",oliver.sebelin@web.de,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,1,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,128,137,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200015,0

This paper extends a search model with exogenous human capital accumulation to include the informal sector. The model is parametrized to match Argentinian data between 1996 and 1998 - before the onset of the declining trend - and it is used to investigate the contribution of labor market measures to the falling informality, unemployment, and wage dispersion. The findings indicate that institutional factors did not contribute to the positive labor market trends observed; on the contrary, results show that higher severance pay and minimum wages increase informality and that the introduction of unemployment assistance contributed to the spread of informal contracts across the work force. Further, I find that compliance with minimum wage regulation strongly affects the final impact of these policies. While non perfect compliance might reduce unemployment, it reinforces the incentives of workers to move to the informal sector.","[Trentini, Claudia] United Nations Conf Trade & Dev UNCTAD, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Trentini, C (通讯作者)，United Nations Conf Trade & Dev UNCTAD, Geneva, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,61,1,1,1,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78560-993-0; 978-1-78560-994-7,RES ECON INEQUAL,,,2016,24.0,,,,,,83,120,,10.1108/S1049-258520160000024005,0.0,,,38,Economics; Social Issues,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Issues,BI1QE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406693400004,0

Intellectual capital is a subject of many studies, which examines the relationship between its level and different measures of firm performance and other characteristics. Within the last decades there have been a number of methods developed to measure intellectual capital and its constituents. Alas, none of these methods has been commonly accepted. This article contributes to the intellectual capital literature with proposition of new method for IC measurement - Intellectual Capital Efficiency Ratio (ICER) and investigation of associations between this ratio and its constituents with different measures of firm performance. Research was conducted for the year 2011 based on the sample of 211 companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. This study reveals strong, significant and positive relationship between ICER ratio and its constituents with company performance measures: return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), economic profit margin (EPM) and significant and positive but weaker relationship between ICER ratio and its components and shareholder value measure - price to book value (P/BV).","[Urbanek, Grzegorz] Univ Lodz, Dept Finance & Strateg Management, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Urbanek, G (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Dept Finance & Strateg Management, Lodz, Poland.",gregu@uni.lodz.pl,,,,,,,18,2,2,1,16,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,309,316,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300038,0

The paper aims to analyze China's air deregulation experience over the last two decades and its impact on airline competition from a geographical perspective. After the establishment of the Big Three in 2002, the paper reveals that there has been a trade-off between the extent of deregulation and airline competition in China because the central government has tended to strengthen the Big Three rather than totally open the market to private and locally owned airlines. The paper uses each airline group as the basic unit of analysis and reveals that (1) the air market has been more concentrated in the Big Three as a result of the process of air deregulation; (2) airline competition in over two thirds of the airports and one half of the routes has increased in the last 18 years, but the core airports and trunk routes are chiefly dominated by the Big Three. The peripheral airports and thin routes have been operated by private and locally owned airlines; and (3) regionally, airline competition has occurred in most airports of the eastern region, and it is more intense than in the central and western regions. But even here, competition in the eastern region has however decreased in 1994-2012. The three main contributions of the paper are: (1) the use of two measures of competition in the airline market; (2) the analysis of the historical evolution of competition; and (3) an understanding the role of the geography of competition in the Chinese airline market.

This informal movement has at its foundation both economic and non-economic causes. The author indicates that the cause is the consumer choice theory. Methodology The study focused on food cooperatives signature web pages. A procedure was defined to seek information about goals of the food cooperatives outlined in the web pages and social media 30 food coops. The search was limited to the web pages of the polish food cooperatives. Scientific aim Historical references indicate that the primary cause of the rise of food coops in the past is a form of grassroots response of consumers to the consumer enslavement in the nineteenth century by industrial capitalism, in the twenty-first century enslavement by corporate capitalism. This issue is still important today. Findings When creating food coops starting point is the lower price and higher quality - resulting from the value of healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle. This is the objective pursued in the first place by far the largest part of the cooperatives. Most cooperatives operate in large cities. There is a greater number of people choosing a healthy lifestyle, as well as the more difficult it is, because of the remoteness of agricultural production, access to a truly healthy food. Conclusions Food coops as a movement are real informal market actors. Their action allows the implementation of members' needs and contributes to greater openness market for organic farmers. These operate on the basis of formal laws. In any event, the State should not restrict activities food coops especially through taxation. Because it is the consumer's choice which facilitates creation of the framework for civil society.","[Zimnoch, Krystyna] Bialystok Tech Univ, Ul Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Zimnoch, K (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Ul Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",k.zimnoch@pb.edu.pl,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,2,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,514,521,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200064,0

The Effect of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme in China,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HEALTH-INSURANCE; ADVERSE SELECTION; RURAL CHINA; CARE; SERVICES,"In 2003, a public insurance system was introduced in Chinese rural areas. In the meantime, subjective health status improved. We used a unique household longitudinal survey to analyse how the introduction of an insurance system, known as the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), has contributed to the change. This health insurance programme was launched sequentially over counties starting in 2003, and households voluntarily chose whether to participate the programme after its launch by the county. These characteristics make it feasible to disentangle two channels of the influence of the NCMS on self-reported health status. One is the insurance effect of the coverage, which can be estimated by comparing the insured households with non-participants in the villages located in counties that have launched the programme (NCMS counties); the other is the general equilibrium effect that affects all residents in the NCMS counties, and can be estimated by comparing non-participants with the non-exposed households. The longitudinal data also allow us to examine how the effect changes with the duration of households' subscription to the programme. The empirical findings include: first, a positive extensive margin: an individual feels better about his or her health status when covered by the NCMS. However, there is no intensive margin: there is no additional gain in the self-assessment of health status with the individual's number of years enrolled in the programme. Second, we find a positive general equilibrium effect of introducing the NCMS programme on non-participants in the NCMS county. This effect accumulates over time.","[Milcent, Carine] Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France; [Milcent, Carine] French Ctr Res Contemporary China CEFC, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Binzhen] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Paris School of Economics; Tsinghua University,"Milcent, C (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",milcent@pse.ens.fr,"Wu, Binzhen/JQI-5598-2023","Milcent, Carine/0000-0002-9367-2716",,,,,16,1,1,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Additionally, the price discovery contribution of Weeklys, albeit modest when compared to the underlying index itself, is substantially larger than that of Monthlys.

This research models individualism as a dimension of both national culture and personal values. Based on HLM of data from six countries and ten industries, study 1 shows that cultural individualism is more influential than personal individualism. Individualism positively moderates the effect of customer satisfaction and negatively moderates the effects of public brand image and relational switching costs on repurchase intent. While the effects of customer satisfaction and relational switching costs are moderated more strongly for services, the effect of public brand image is moderated more strongly for products. Study 2 illuminates psychological processes operating behind these moderating effects: importance of relational switching costs - reliance on salespeople; importance of public brand image - meeting social preferences (impressing others, expressing group identify), but not trustworthiness; importance of customer satisfaction - customization, distinctiveness, but not functional benefits. This research also tests extant theories about the main effect of individualism on repurchase intent.

Jumps are detected in both the transaction price (observation equation) and fundamental value (state equation). The model's parameters and variances are updated in real time. Prices can be altered by both the size and direction of trades, and the effects of buy-initiated and sell-initiated trades are different. We estimate this model using tick-by-tick data for 12 large-capitalization stocks traded on the Euronext-Paris Bourse. We find that, at tick frequency, the overnight return, the intraday jumps, and the continuous innovations represent approximately 7%, 8.5%, and 36.7% of the total variation of stock returns. The microstructure model explains on average 47.7% of the total variation. Once jumps are filtered and parameters are estimated in real time, we also find that the price impact of trades is symmetric on average. However, the price of highly liquid stocks with a large proportion of sell-initiated orders tends to be more sensitive to buy trades, whereas the price of less liquid stocks with a large proportion of buy-initiated orders tends to be more sensitive to sell trades.

To this end, we derive a statistically motivated benchmark for new venture team heterogeneity in terms of observed team member characteristics to generate stylized facts about team member diversity at startup and how it evolves as the new venture matures. We use the population of Danish startups that were established in 1998 and track them until 2001. Main findings are that teams are relatively more homogeneous at startup compared to our benchmark, indicating that difficulties associated with workforce heterogeneity (like affective conflict or coordination cost) as well as homophily (people's inclination to bound with others with similar characteristics) may overweigh the benefits of heterogeneity. While workforce heterogeneity does increase over time, the increase is smaller compared to our benchmark but substantially larger than if team additions and replacements had the same characteristics as the initial team members.","[Kaiser, Ulrich] Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, Chair Entrepreneurship, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Mueller, Bettina] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Res Dept Ind Econ & Int Management, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany",University of Zurich; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Müller, B (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Res Dept Ind Econ & Int Management, POB 103443, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany.",ulrich.kaiser@business.uzh.ch; bettina.mueller@zew.de,,"Kaiser, Ulrich/0000-0003-4372-2479",,,,,82,25,32,3,82,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We find that financial globalization and low interest rates create an environment that is conducive to credit bubbles. These bubbles raise world savings and generate capital flows that may not be efficient. A global planner would adopt a policy of leaning-against-investor-sentiment, taxing credit in those times and countries where credit is excessive and subsidizing it elsewhere. An important characteristic of this policy is that it is expectationally robust, in the sense that it isolates the world economy from fluctuations in investor sentiment. This policy may be hard to implement in a decentralized fashion,though,as individual countries are unlikely to internalize the effects of their policies on the world interest rate.

An input output structural decomposition analysis is extended and applied to the social accounting matrices of 1970 and 2000. The results indicate that the expansion of exports and the changes in the compensation of labor and capital inputs are the main determinants for the income changes. The effects differ largely between rural and urban areas, between skilled and unskilled workers, and between the major ethnic groups. The combination of these two determinants, however, is a dominant factor in explaining the increase in income inequality in Malaysia. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

With the aim to determine the effects of different incentive schemes (piece rate, competition, choice between piece rate and competition, social or increased monetary incentives) on performance of young and older subjects, we look at behavior of a group of younger and older adults on a well-established real effort task. Based on the theory of Social Production Functions, we hypothesize age effects that depend on the incentive schemes used. We show that older adults are less productive than younger adults in all conditions, but that different incentive schemes exert similar influences on productivity in both age groups. While we do not find a significant age difference in competitiveness and reject the age-related predictions of the Social Production Functions Theory, we replicate the gender difference in competitiveness found in the literature. Social incentives in men have an at least as strong or even stronger effect on performance than increased monetary incentives. Women do not show an increase in performance with social incentives.

This is tested by means of a very general Markov-switching augmented Dickey-Fuller (MS-ADF) model, which expands and improves simpler existing models of this type, and produces more reliable results than conventional state-invariant unit-root tests. Long data series (in some cases with more than 200 observations) on the debt-to-GDP ratio are analyzed for 16 countries. Empirical results indicate that Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK have sustainable fiscal policies. Greece and Japan have unsustainable fiscal policies, which could lead to ebt default unless appropriate measures are taken. The remaining countries are characterized as having uncertain debt policies, which governments could take as a warning to try to better balance their budgets.

Yet, first degree price discrimination is common in the pricing of higher education, and I use data on prices and the characteristics of students admitted to a professional graduate program at a public university to estimate a matriculation demand function. I then derive linear pricing functions that maximize revenue for a target number of students. By allowing these functions to depend on progressively richer sets of observables, I explore the effect of personalization of pricing on profit. Tailoring prices to a one-dimensional measure of student quality would raise revenue by 2.2 per cent above the revenue with uniform pricing. Pricing based on both student quality and state residency raises revenue by 8.4 per cent, and further tailoring based on available observables raises prices 9.0 per cent above the maximum revenue under uniform pricing. Pricing that obeys current statutory tuition limits raises revenue less but still by just over half as much. I also infer the welfare weights that the pricing process implicitly attaches to student characteristics.","[Waldfogel, Joel] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Waldfogel, Joel] Univ Minnesota, Sch Law, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Waldfogel, Joel] NBER, Minneapolis, MN USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Waldfogel, J (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",jwaldfog@umn.edu,"Waldfogel, Joel/A-4916-2015","Waldfogel, Joel/0000-0002-8040-7227",,,,,22,10,14,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

If future job opportunities motivate SEC lawyers to develop and/or showcase their enforcement expertise, then the revolving door phenomenon will promote more aggressive regulatory activity (the human capital hypothesis). In contrast, SEC lawyers can relax enforcement efforts in order to develop networking skills and/or curry favor with prospective employers at private law firms (the rent seeking hypothesis). We collect data on the career paths of 336 SEC lawyers that span 284 SEC civil cases against accounting misrepresentation over the period 1990-2007. Our overall evidence is consistent with the human capital hypothesis. However, we find some evidence of rent seeking when SEC lawyers are based in Washington DC and when defense firms employ more former SEC lawyers. The revolving door likely impacts numerous aspects of SEC regulation setting and enforcement. This study examines accounting-related civil cases and is not able to study administrative or non-accounting enforcement cases. Further, the study does not address the choice of which cases to pursue, the incentives of employees other than trial lawyers, or how the revolving door affects rule making. Subject to these caveats, our study provides an important first look into the effects of revolving door incentives on the SEC's enforcement process and lays the groundwork for future research.

The main objective of the study was to reveal the private costs to farmers of avoiding rice straw burning. The study used survey and auction data from a sample of 317 farmers from 18 villages in Southern Nepal. Using a sealed bid one-shot reverse auction a level of payment was determined at which farmers would find acceptable to not engage in residue burning. Based on the bid amount, 167 winner farmers were enrolled in a real payment programme. The results revealed that 86 % of the farmers complied with the programme to refrain from burning rice straw with an average payment of US$ 78.76/ha of paddy farm, which represents US$ 13.17/ton of of emissions. To identify the policy variables, linear and log-linear regressions were fitted with the bid amount using socioeconomic variables. Land area, farmer education, practice of joint household decision making, wage rate for farm labour and straw yield increased the bid amount. The design and methods of field implementation of the reverse auction gave useful information for the advancement of conservation auctions and their replication in developing countries.","Kathmandu Univ, Kathmandu, Nepal",Kathmandu University,"Pant, KP (通讯作者)，Kathmandu Univ, Ichangu 6, Kathmandu, Nepal.",kppant@gmail.com,,,South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE),South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE),This work has been undertaken with the financial support of the South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE) and its sponsors.

To analyse the relationship between green innovation and performance, new industry-level panel data were exploited: these include 12 OECD countries, the whole manufacturing sector and a period of 30 years. The results show that green inventions are U-shape related to performance. However, the turning point is quite high and hence only relevant for a few industries.

We use a unique data set collected on migrants aged 45-70 living in France, with detailed information on both return intentions at retirement and on private transfers. We find that the temporary nature of migration strongly influences the pattern of transfers made by migrants. The probability of remitting for either personal savings or to family members in the origin country increases by more than 10 percentage points with return plans, the latter having no effect on gifts to family members living in France. At the intensive margin, the amount of personal savings sent to the origin country is about twice as high for migrants who intend to return.","[Wolff, Francois-Charles] Univ Nantes, F-44322 Nantes, France; [Wolff, Francois-Charles] INED, Paris, France",Nantes Universite,"Wolff, FC (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, BP 52231 Chemin Cens du Tertre, F-44322 Nantes, France.",francois.wolff@univ-nantes.fr,,,,,,,25,10,11,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

This paper provides a tool to,assess the enabling economic, environmental, and transport geography conditions to design sustainable closed-loop networks for the management of a generic product along its life-cycle. The proposed tool is built through a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for the strategic design of a multi-echelon closed-loop network. The product life cycle is handled via a cascade through seven stages, including raw material suppliers, manufacturing plants, distribution centers, retailers, collection nodes for waste and by-products, recycling centers, and landfills. The model minimizes a cost-based and a carbon-based function to determine the optimal geographic location of the nodes of the network and the allocation of transport flows. The model is applied to a case study inspired by the furniture industry over the Italian geography and a multi-scenario analysis is illustrated. The resulting considerations on the economic, environmental performances of the network couple with the transport geography to provide guidelines for designer, logistics planners and regional geographers toward a circular economy scenario.

Consequently, the endowment effect is viewed as a self-enhancement strategy originating or following from this self-object link. Within this perspective, subsequent self-threat typically enhances the endowment effect, whereas self-affirmation eliminates the endowment effect. Contrasting these findings and drawing on the idea that initial self-evaluations constrain the value of a newly acquired object, we reasoned that failures (successes) of the self experienced before the endowment will lower (raise) the value of possessions and influence the endowment effect accordingly. In Studies 1 and 2, we show that a private self-threat (vs. no threat) induced before endowing (vs. presenting) participants with a good eliminates the endowment effect. In Study 3, we show that feelings of pride (vs. no pride) induced via proprioceptive feedback yields a reliable endowment effect. These findings suggest that initial self-success/failure moderate the endowment effect and further show that bodily cues influence property transaction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study answers this question by using firm-level export and balance sheet data covering a large sample of French manufacturing exporters over the period 1997-2007. The main result is that there is a negative causal relation between a firm's leverage and export quality, where quality is inferred from the estimation of a discrete choice model of foreign consumers' demand. This result is robust across different specifications and estimation techniques. In addition, by estimating investment models we find that the negative impact of leverage on quality is consistent with theories predicting that the agency cost of debt determines suboptimal investment.

Using both fixed effects and dynamic-GMM estimations, I find greater capitalization, liquidity risks, poor credit quality, greater cost inefficiency and banking industry size to significantly increase NPLs, while greater bank profitability lowers NPLs. Moreover, higher state real GDP and real personal income growth rates, and changes in state housing price index reduce NPLs, while inflation, state unemployment rates, and US public debt significantly increase NPLs. The findings imply that regular stress tests on banks' loan quality that typically underpin scenarios for a rise in NPLs, should take into account the impact of 'micro' or state-level economic conditions on NPLs, in addition to banks' capital and credit quality, and effective cost management in assessing banks financial health.

Lenders anticipated this problem and attached substantial prepayment penalties to subprime mortgages. Some state governments responded with regulations that banned prepayment penalties. This created a natural experiment in which the effects of prepayment penalties on the supply and performance of endorsed mortgages can be evaluated. Ho and Pennington Cross (2008) have demonstrated that these regulations reduced the supply of mortgage credit. In this paper, the effect of prepayment penalty restrictions on the performance of endorsed subprime mortgages is tested. Theory predicts that the restrictions should raise prepayment and lower default. The empirical results strongly confirm the first prediction while the effects on default have the correct sign but lack significance.

To analyze these questions, we use data on the recent, impactful triple disaster on March 11,2011 in Japan (3-11). Coincidentally, only three months after the disaster, a long-planned change in tax law was put into effect that allows higher tax deductions for charitable donations. Applying a moderated mediation analysis to a unique dataset, we are able to disentangle the total rise of donations into positive effects that are caused by the disaster itself and positive effects that are caused by the recent change in the Japanese tax law. The results of our study are as follows: First, we show that about 30% of the direct negative effect of 3-11 on SWB is mediated and mitigated by donations. Second, we show that the change in taxation law could have further mitigated the negative SWB effects of 3-11, if more people had been aware of it. However, since a large majority of the Japanese public had not even been aware of the tax law change, potential mitigating effects by increased donations have not been realized. As for policy implications, our results show that governments can create incentives for donations that not only support disaster reconstruction, but also mitigate the negative SWB effects of disasters.

We show that international consumption risks are not perfectly shared owing to the presence of a funding constraint and various discount factors. We explicitly specify a risk premium term and measure it in response to negative productivity shocks, policy shocks, and exchange rate shocks. The results indicate that these shocks, especially the policy shocks, widen the uncovered interest parity deviations to a great extent. Our research is compatible with the empirical evidence that funding illiquidity led to a significant uncovered interest parity violation during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Microeconomic studies increasingly stress the lack of land rights in many poor countries as an important source of low productivity. This paper examines the role played by land titles in explaining differences in agricultural productivity for 93 countries. Using the per capita accumulated value of gold and silver production in the 16th and 17th centuries as instruments for land rights it is shown that enforcement of land titles is a significant source of agricultural productivity inequality across the world.

We found that the decrease could in part be attributed to shifts in household income, but it also reflected a dramatic decline in food insecurity among social assistance recipients. While food insecurity rose in the province overall in 2012, it continued to decline among households receiving social assistance, possibly reflecting the cumulative impact of changes introduced through the province's poverty reduction strategy.","[Loopstra, Rachel] Univ Oxford, Dept Sociol, Oxford, England; [Dachner, Naomi; Tarasuk, Valerie] Univ Toronto, Dept Nutr Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Oxford; University of Toronto,"Loopstra, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Sociol, Oxford, England.",,"Loopstra, Rachel/I-7253-2013","Loopstra, Rachel/0000-0002-7541-6209","Programmatic Grant in Health and Health Equity, Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [ERN 115208]","Programmatic Grant in Health and Health Equity, Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)","This research was supported by a Programmatic Grant in Health and Health Equity, Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) (ERN 115208).

In a large sample of U.S. IPOs over 1981-2012, we find that firms with exports and/or foreign sales prior to going public have significantly lower underpricing than firms without international business activity. Furthermore, firms with international business activity significantly outperform purely domestic IPO firms over 3- and 5-year periods after going public and have a significantly higher survival rate.

The well established stylized facts on volatility persistence and asymmetric effects are re-examined in light of such dichotomy. To analyze the dynamics of down and up volatilities estimated from daily returns I use a bivariate generalization of the standard EGARCH model. As a robustness check, I also investigate various specifications of down and up realized measures estimated from high-frequency data. The empirical findings point to the existence of a marked diversity in the volatilities of positive and negative daily returns in terms of persistence and sensitivity to good and bad news.

State RPS policies are heterogeneously designed, particularly with respect to their use of flexibility mechanisms that allow obligations to be met with renewable energy generated in other states. However; the renewable energy that is produced within an RPS-enacting state itself is of high political importance, making in-state renewable energy deployment an important evaluation metric for RPS policies. In this papen we develop a novel dataset of state-level RPS policies and renewable energy deployment. We show that failing to effectively limit comparisons to similarly designed RPS policies may lead to the misperception that more stringent RPS policies do not necessarily lead to higher renewable deployment. We then show that after controlling for specific policy design features, states with more stringent RPS policies tend to have greater in-state renewable energy deployment. Specifically, we find that a 1 percentage point increase in the stringency of an RPS policy is associated with a a28-0.29 percentage point increase in the share of in-state renewable electricity capacity Articulate modeling of policy variety has been largely lacking from past studies and is essential for accurate econometric analysis of heterogeneous energy policies.","[Shrimall, Gireesh] Monterey Inst Int Studies, Monterey, CA 93940 USA; [Shrimall, Gireesh] Stanford Univ, Steyer Taylor Ctr Energy Finance & Policy, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Chan, Gabriel] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Jenner, Steffen] Tech Univ Berlin, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Groba, Felix] German Inst Econ Res, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Indvik, Joe] SparkFund, Washington, DC 20004 USA",Stanford University; Harvard University; Technical University of Berlin; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Jenner, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.",gshrimali@miis.edu; gabe_chan@hksphd.harvard.edu; steffenjenner@campus.tu-berlin.de; felix.groba@gmx.net; joe.indvik@gmail.com,,"Chan, Gabriel/0000-0001-9382-919X",,,,,26,19,20,1,27,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

Unconditional figures show that trading establishments have lower worker turnover rates than non-traders, suggesting a higher degree of employment stability. Conditional on an extensive set of control variables, exporting is further associated with a higher net job flow rate, which is almost entirely due to a lower separation rate (particularly for high-skilled workers and transitions into non-employment). In contrast, both an increase and a decrease in import intensity are (weakly) associated with a lower accession rate. These results are predominantly driven by smaller establishments, and they partly lose statistical significance once unobservable establishment characteristics are taken into account.","[Baumgarten, Daniel] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Baumgarten, Daniel] Rheinisch Westfalisches Inst Wirtschaftsforsch RW, Essen, Germany",University of Munich; RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Baumgarten, D (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Ludwigstr 28 VG, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",daniel.baumgarten@econ.lmu.de,,,Leibniz Association,Leibniz Association,"The author is grateful to Thomas K.

Our empirical results are robust to alternative measures of investor sentiment and definitions of long- and short-term horizons.","[Chang, Chuang-Chang] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Pei-Fang] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [Wang, Yaw-Huei] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",National Central University; National Tsing Hua University; National Taiwan University,"Hsieh, PF (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",ccchang@cc.ncu.edu.tw; pfhsieh@mx.nthu.edu.tw; wangyh@ntu.edu.tw,,"Wang, Yaw-Huei/0000-0003-3051-4339","Ministry of Science and Technology, ROC","Ministry of Science and Technology, ROC","Chang, ccchang@cc.ncu.edu.tw, National Central University, Department of Finance, Taiwan; Hsieh (corresponding author), pfhsieh@mx.nthu.edu.tw, Department of Quantitative Finance, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan; and Wang, wangyh@ntu.edu.tw, Department of Finance, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.

During this period the industry, which was initially concentrated on the east coast of the United States, became increasingly clustered in Silicon Valley (SV), California. This location shift was accompanied by a change in the technology used to produce semiconductor devices. By studying how diversifiers and new firms enter into IC production, and the technology they choose to produce ICs, we document the process of growth of SV. In particular, we analyze how agglomeration economies, as well as the heritage of new firms' founders affect the opportunities pursued by entrants and their long-term likelihood of success. We find that IC entrants in SV were more likely to enter at the technological frontier than IC entrants in other clusters. However, we find no evidence suggesting that being located in a cluster helped existing IC producers that were not initially at the technological frontier to catch up with the rest of the industry. Examining long-term performance, we find that firms that become top producers are disproportionately spinoffs of leading firms or diversifiers with a transistor background. While most of these firms were located in SV, after controlling for heritage and background, location has no significance on the likelihood of becoming a top producer.","[Cheyre, Cristobal] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Kowalski, Jon] McKinsey & Co Inc, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 USA; [Veloso, Francisco M.] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Catolica Lisbon Sch Business & Econ, P-1649023 Lisbon, Portugal",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; McKinsey & Company; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Cheyre, C (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Engn, Santiago, Chile.",ccheyre@ing.puc.cl; jon@jonkowalski.com; fveloso@ucp.pt,"Veloso, Francisco/A-2279-2008","Veloso, Francisco/0000-0003-1383-9852","National Science Foundation [SBE-0965451, SBE-0738182, SES-0727000]; Richard King Mellon Foundation; Claire, and John Bertucci Fellowship; Dean's Fellowship from the Carnegie Institute of Technology Engineering & Technology Innovation Management (ETIM) program at Carnegie Mellon; William P.

Therefore, it is important to introduce measures that lower waste collection and disposal costs. Based on a large panel data set for the Netherlands we show that unit-based pricing systems are more important from a cost-minimizing point of view than the institutional mode of waste collection. In particular, the bag-based and frequency-based pricing systems are preferred. Moreover, dividing the cost effects between cost price and quantity effects, we illustrate that lower administrative costs and a smaller waste quantity are the most important drivers of cost decreases. It also shows that a disadvantage of the bag-based system is that it is not easy to price compostable waste. In addition, if more general cost functions are analyzed, these estimations suggest that there are economies of scale for small municipalities.","[Dijkgraaf, Elbert] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Econ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Gradus, Raymond] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Dijkgraaf, E (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",dijkgraaf@ese.eur.nl; r.h.j.m.gradus@vu.nl,"GRADUS, RAYMOND/HLW-0327-2023","GRADUS, RAYMOND/0000-0002-4519-4633; Dijkgraaf, Elbert/0000-0003-3568-1558",,,,,27,20,20,0,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We examine the determination of the TAC which maximises the present value of the fishery, given the agreed quota shares and each country's harvest and enforcement best-response functions. Inefficiency may derive not only from non-optimal TAC shares but also from the countries' implicit preferences for compliance. We illustrate these findings with a set of numerical simulations.

The offshoring of mobile phone assembly to China, India, Brazil and Vietnam did not result in a reduction of domestic jobs. On the contrary, Samsung's domestic employment increased from 5960 persons in 2002 to 20,500 in 2012. This increase mainly reflects a net increase in high-paying jobs (R&D, engineering, design, marketing) while the number of low-paying jobs (assembly) remained stagnant. To cope with possible technological hollowing out, Samsung kept its core engineers/technicians in a special unit, instead of firing them, whenever domestic assembly lines were reduced or foreign lines were established. They were kept inside the so-called global manufacturing technology center, with the number of its employees increasing from 80 in 2006 to more than 1103 in 2011. These employees visit overseas factories to conduct activities such as maintenance, monitoring, re-modeling of assembly lines, and automation. In terms of strategy, Samsung engages in offshoring, but not outsourcing. This is in contrast to Apple which does both offshoring and outsourcing by contracting with Foxconn.","[Lee, Keun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Jung, Moosup] Dong A Univ, Dept Int Trade, Busan, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Dong A University,"Lee, K (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",kenneth@snu.ac.kr; msjung@dau.ac.kr,"Lee, Keun/AAU-8046-2020","Lee, Keun/0000-0002-0403-6348",,,,,27,10,10,2,75,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

We present a new experiment that refines the study of intention-based other-regarding motives. Using a series of mini-ultimatum games that have been extensively studied in the literature, we compare the behaviour of normally-developing (ND) children to that of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), who typically lack the ability to attribute intentions to the observed actions of others. We find that ND children's rejection behaviour responds systematically to changes in the set of available options, in line with previous findings. ASD children's rejections are virtually unaffected by the intentions that could be inferred from the games' strategy space. These differences are mainly driven by ASD children with low mentalising abilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

One can notice that measuring of environmental indicators related to environmentally responsible behaviour is complicated and demanding task. It is also important to define the main drivers of environmentally responsible development. The objective of this paper is to provide comparatives analysis of indicators of environmentally responsible behaviour in the Baltic States by comparing and assessing them in terms of the EU-28 average and to present the main drivers of environmentally responsible behaviour in Lithuania. Environmentally responsible behaviour is related to resource and energy savings, use of renewable energy sources, waste sorting and recycling, wastewater disposal etc. Comparative assessment of environmentally responsible behaviour indicators in the Baltic States indicated that all these indicators are bellow the EU-average, except the use of renewable energy sources. The main drivers of consumption behaviour in Lithuania were assessed by applying households surveys in order to define the major issues of concern and to develop relevant policies targeting these issues. Age, gender, education, and income of Lithuanian residents do not have impact on environmentally responsible behaviour in Lithuanian households (energy saving, buying energy efficient electric appliances, willingness to pay electricity from renewable energy sources use of biofuels). Only environmental awareness has impact on energy saving behaviour at home and use of biofuels in cars and waste recycle.","[Streimikiene, Dalia] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Kaunas, Lithuania",Lithuanian Sports University,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Kaunas, Lithuania.",dalia.streimikiene@lei.lt,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020","Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912;",,,,,25,4,4,1,23,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2015,17.0,40,,,,,1023,1035,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365317700012,0

New immigrants who match occupations obtain an earnings premium, but surprisingly, on average, even they obtain no return to their pre-migration labour market experience. Only males with substantial English proficiency who also match occupations receive any return to such experience. Moreover, occupational matching and English skills are also seen to interact with education in an unexpected way. For both sexes, only those with a match and/or strong English proficiency obtain a positive return to their schooling. The commonly observed low rate of return to education for new immigrants appears to be a combination of zero for some and a large return for others.

A substantial body of work and recent experimental results show conclusively that this approach is invalid: subjective and objective probabilities cannot be treated as two sides of the same coin. This raises serious questions about calculations based on that assumption, decisions based on those calculations, and what to do if assigning numerical values and calculating expected values based on subjective probabilities is invalid. This paper presents a radical re-formulation of subjective probability, showing that what have been called subjective probabilities are properly formulated as uncertainty appraisals, re-descriptions of states of affairs carrying tautological implications for action. A novel formulation of the decision maker's field-of-view, based on the concept of Actor, Observer, and Critic roles, combined with the uncertainty appraisal formulation, is used to develop new methods for evaluating data, finding patterns in data, and integrating probabilities and uncertainty appraisals, that is, those aspects that have, until now, been called subjective probabilities.","[Jeffrey, H.

We took advantage of a set of natural experiments to estimate the impact of changes in state and federal level nonprescription emergency contraception access on the probability of high-school students' sexual and contraceptive behaviors. We extracted data from the Youth Risk Behavioral Survey for New England states that had data about contraceptive use (Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont) from 2003 to 2009. We combined this student-level data with information on when states and the FDA began allowing nonprescription sales of emergency contraceptives. We estimated a series of difference-in-difference models on the impact of these policies on the probability that students were sexually active and on the probability of condom or hormonal birth control use conditional on sexual activity. We found that switching emergency contraception to a nonprescription status had no systematic effect on the probability of sexual activity or the conditional probability of hormonal birth control use, but that it significantly reduced the probability that public school students used condoms by between 5.2% and 7.2%.

Using a total of 18 predictor variables that include traditional fundamental indicators such as excess demand, inventories and the convenience yield, as well as indicators related to global risk appetite, momentum, the term spread, and various other financial series, we show that there exists a considerable predictive component in copper returns. Covering an out-of-sample period from May 2002 to June 2014 and employing standard statistical evaluation criteria we show that the out-of-sample R-2 (relative to a random walk benchmark) can be as high as 18.5 percent for the DMA framework. Time series plots of the cumulative mean squared forecast errors and time varying coefficients show further that firstly, a large part of the improvement in the forecasts is realised during the peak of the financial crisis period at the end of 2008, and secondly that the importance of the most relevant predictor variables has changed substantially over the out-of-sample period. The coefficients of the SP500, the VIX, the yield spread, the TED spread, industrial production and the convenience yield predictors are most heavily affected, with the TED spread and yield spread coefficients even changing signs over this period. Our predictability results remain valid for forecast horizons up to 6 months ahead, but are weaker and smaller than at the one month horizon. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Among three types of exchange listings, NASDAQ-to-AMEX firms report significantly higher pre-listing abnormal accruals than do NASDAQ-to-NYSE and AMEX-to-NYSE firms. The pre-listing abnormal accruals are negatively associated with the post-listing performance, with the association driven mainly by NASDAQ-to-AMEX firms. These results suggest that the type of listing change affects managers' reporting behavior in the sense that the switch to an exchange with stricter listing standards appears to mitigate managerial incentives to inflate reported earnings.

We add to this literature using bid-ask spread to capture differences in the level of information asymmetry just prior to the announcement of an open market acquisition of acreage or reserves by U.S. oil and gas firms over the period 1993 to 2011. Acreage is an area of land that is believed to contain reserves and so information asymmetry is expected to be greater around announcement of acreage than for reserve acquisition. We find that for an oil and gas producer, the bid-ask spread just prior to announcement of acquisition of acreage is greater than the bid-ask spread just prior to the announcement of an acquisition of reserves. We then split the sample into firms with share price less than $4.00 (small share price firms) and the remainder (high share price firms). We find that this effect is associated with small share price firms and not high share price firms. Thus, for the firms with share price less than $4.00, the level of information asymmetry associated with an oil and gas firm varies with the type of asset acquisition announcement though this is not so apparent for the firms having a share price of $4.00 or more.

With a growing population, less arable land and often relatively low-quality land, Chinese peasant agriculture has been undergoing a form of modernization. While peasants enjoy land-contract rights as a result of the Household Responsibility System (HRS), the state has been promoting transfer of land-use rights in order to promote modern agriculture. This paper seeks to understand recent developments in land and agriculture, particularly exploring the transitions of land and agricultural institutions since 1949 and land transfers since the HRS. In so doing, this paper reveals that the state has been strategically responding to various challenges in order that land institutions and policies are always geared to achieving agricultural modernization. During the state's continual drive for modernizations, particularly agricultural modernization, peasants' livelihood is impacted and needs to be protected.","[Ye, Jingzhong] China Agr Univ, Dev Studies, 2 Yuanmingyuan West Rd, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Ye, Jingzhong] China Agr Univ, Coll Humanitites & Dev Studies COHD, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University,"Ye, JZ (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Dev Studies, 2 Yuanmingyuan West Rd, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",yejz@cau.edu.cn,"Chekalin, Vyacheslav/S-6391-2017","Ye, Jingzhong/0000-0003-4917-3431",National Social Science Fund of China [13ASH007],National Social Science Fund of China,"I wish to express my special thanks to Juan Liu, Chunyu Wang, Huijiao Xu and Yan Jiang for helping collect data for this paper.

Rethinking India's Food Subsidy Policies,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PROGRAMS,"Critics argue that India's mismanaged Public Distribution System (PDS), which sells subsidised cereals to poor families, should be replaced by cash transfers. Others fear cash may be misused. Using National Sample Survey data, this article demonstrates that families treat additional PDS subsidies wholly as a source of cash - exactly like a cash transfer. More worryingly, cereal consumption has not increased, despite higher real subsidies. Moreover, neither the PDS nor cash transfers are likely to raise total food expenditure in poor families. Finally, therefore, the paper explores how higher food consumption and other objectives of PDS subsidies may be achieved.","Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Social Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Balasubramanian, S (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Social Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",sujata@ust.hk,,"Balasubramanian, Sujata/0000-0001-8486-0056",,,,,40,7,7,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

We find that the variance in contributions is significantly reduced for low and high levels of endowment in comparison with an intermediate level of endowment. This difference emerges with experience. Evidence on whether the level of endowment influences the success rate at providing public goods is more mixed. We provide, however, a measure of endowment size that correlates with success rate. Our interpretation suggests that people find it hardest to coordinate on the provision of threshold public goods when endowments are of intermediate size. By intermediate we mean that the endowment is small enough that people need to contribute relatively a lot to fund the good, but also large enough that no one person is critical in providing the good.","[Alberti, Federica] Max Planck Inst Econ, D-07745 Jena, Germany; [Cartwright, Edward J.] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England",Max Planck Society; University of Kent,"Alberti, F (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Econ, Kahlaische Str 10, D-07745 Jena, Germany.",al-berti@econ.mpg.de; E.J.Cartwright@kent.ac.uk,,"Cartwright, Edward/0000-0003-0194-9368; Alberti, Federica/0000-0001-5946-5804",Centre for Reasoning at the University of Kent under a project on Reasoning and focal points; Max Planck Society,Centre for Reasoning at the University of Kent under a project on Reasoning and focal points; Max Planck Society(Max Planck Society),This paper was supported by the Centre for Reasoning at the University of Kent under a project on Reasoning and focal points.

We examine three issues: the magnitude of the marriage tax/subsidy and its evolution over time, its effects on the distribution of income (including the effects of different demographic characteristics on the magnitudes and trends), and the causal factors in its evolution (e.g., tax changes, demographic changes). We find that the tax treatment of the family has changed significantly over time, from a large average marriage bonus in 1969, to a large marriage tax in much of the 1990s and early 2000s, to a large marriage subsidy since 2003. We also find that the marriage tax varies significantly and systematically by income level, as well as by the number of children in the family, the earnings ratios of the spouses, the race of the family, and the age of the household head. Finally, we find that changes in income and family composition have influenced the magnitudes and trends of marriage taxes and subsidies, but that adjustments in the federal income tax code account for most of the observed changes.","[Alm, James] Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Leguizamon, J.

The results suggest that the existence of abundant fixed duties necessary to maintain the internal organization of a firm primarily account for the increase in working hours of male employees during the recession.

Using an extensive data set covering 128 countries for the period 1995 to 2009, we present empirical evidence that the banking sector tends to be smaller in resource-dependent economies. Moreover, we locate a low threshold level at which the higher resource-dependence begins to be harmful for domestic banking sector. We also find evidence that the use of market-based financing is more common in resource-dependent economies. Further, our results suggest that a financial sector formed according to the needs of the resource sector might be unfavorable for emerging businesses, thereby hampering economic diversification and reinforcing the resource curse.

Using a representative watershed quality data series, the EPA's National Rivers and Streams Assessment and Wadeable Streams Assessment, in conjunction with a watershed management regime database coded for this analysis, I test the relationship between collaborative governance and watershed quality for 357 watersheds. Since these are observational data, a multilevel propensity score matching method is used to control for selection bias. Using an augmented inverse propensity weighted estimator, I estimate the average treatment effect on the treated for six different water quality and habitat condition metrics. Collaborative watershed groups are found to improve water chemistry and in-stream habitat conditions. I then use hierarchical linear regression modeling to examine how group responsibilities, membership diversity, and formalization affect the predicted impact of a collaborative group. Groups that engage in management activities (in comparison to coordination or planning) are found to achieve greater environmental gains. Limited differentiation is found with regards to the presence of a group coordinator, increased goal specificity, or greater stakeholder diversity.","Univ Georgia, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Scott, T (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, 204 Baldwin Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",tyler.scott@uga.edu,,,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [R24 HD042828],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"The author thanks Craig Thomas, Ryan Scott, Grant Blume, Ann Bostrom, and Winfield Wilson for feedback on early drafts, and three anonymous reviewers for their careful and constructive reviews.

This approach captures the dependence between the distributions of oil price shocks and the US stock return and uncovers two nuance features in the oil stock relationship. First, large, negative oil price shocks (i.e. low oil price shock quantiles) can affect US equities positively when the US market is performing well (i.e. at high US return quantiles). Second, while negative oil price shocks could affect the US stock market, the influence of positive oil price shocks is weak, which suggests that the relationship between oil prices on the US equities is asymmetric.

Unlike capital investment, R&D is more inflexible and subject to high adjustment costs. Moreover, R&D intensive firms face severe financial constraints and are more likely to suspend/discontinue R&D projects. Therefore, firms' distress risk increases with their R&D intensity. Using a large panel of US companies over the 1980 to 2011 period, I find a robust empirical relation between R&D and distress risk, primarily among financially constrained firms.

It has been influenced by the country's level of development and the conflict between openness and protectionism; external developments, such as commodity booms and busts and increased competition; and international commitments, whether multilateral or regional. As a result, trade policy has often been ambivalent and ineffective. Given that Indonesia has undergone various transformations and that the world is a different place from what it was in 1965, the country needs to take a more pragmatic and forward-looking stance. Trade policy needs to be part of a comprehensive strategy to improve competitiveness and diversify exports. If Indonesia is to be part of the new paradigm, where the production of goods and services is based on production networks and global value chains, its policy focus will need to shift from protecting and favouring sectors to promoting trade and industrial policies that encourage the flow of goods, services, and people.","[Pangestu, Mari; Ing, Lili Yan] Univ Indonesia, Bogor, Indonesia",University of Indonesia,"Pangestu, M (通讯作者)，Univ Indonesia, Bogor, Indonesia.",,,,,,,,49,31,36,2,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

First, the role of the participation margin appears robust to adjustments for spurious transitions induced by reporting error. Second, conventional stocks-based analyses are subject to a stock-flow fallacy, neglecting offsetting forces of worker flows on the participation rate.

We consider a carbon footprint tax (CFT), which would be modeled after a credit-method value added tax. The basis for the tax would be a product's carbon footprint, which includes all of the emissions released during production of the good and its inputs as well as any greenhouse gases latent in the product. Our analysis suggests that a pure CFT, requiring the calculation of the carbon footprint of every individual product, may be prohibitively costly. However a hybrid CFT seems economically feasible. The hybrid CFT would give firms the option to either calculate the carbon footprint of their outputs-and have their products taxed based on those footprints-or use product-class specific default carbon footprints as the tax basis, thereby saving on calculation costs. Because the CFT would be levied on all goods consumed domestically, the CFT would keep domestic firms on an even footing with those producing in countries without active climate policy, protecting competitiveness and reducing leakage.","[McAusland, Carol] Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Najjar, Nouri] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Sch Econ, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"McAusland, C (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, 2357 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",carol.mcausland@ubc.ca; nouri.najjar@alumni.ubc.ca,,"Najjar, Nouri/0000-0003-3090-9576",,,,,99,29,31,19,108,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

There are reports of peasant suicides due to non-profitability of farming. However, scant empirical evidence is available on changes in real income and wages in the Indian agricultural sector. The present study uses data from the National Accounts Statistics and Cost of Cultivation Surveys to analyse the changes in real income and discusses the underlying reasons. The study reveals that the purchasing power of farmers has remained low and has worsened over recent years. The value of crop output has increased, but a disproportionate rise in input costs has resulted in a fall in crop incomes in several states, with the agriculturally developed Punjab being an exception. Interestingly, real wage rates for agricultural labour have shown an increasing trend, indicating improvement in the welfare of labour.","ISEC, Bangalore 560072, Karnataka, India",,"Kannan, E (通讯作者)，ISEC, Bangalore 560072, Karnataka, India.",elumalaik@isec.ac.in,,"Kannan, Elumalai/0000-0003-1789-4592",,,,,61,13,16,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

A key focus area is implementing policies to dissuade individuals from accessing accumulated retirement funds when changing jobs. While traditional economic theories assume that individuals act rationally and make optimal decisions without outside intervention, current policy interventions support behavioural theories of decision-making where sub-optimal choices occur due to limitations in human decision-making. Therefore, interventions are based on the assumption that individuals act irrationally. Despite these interventions, many individuals still access their funds suggesting that current interventions may not be sufficiently aligned with the factors influencing decision making in this environment. The main research objective of this study was to test empirically both rational and behavioural factors that could potentially influence retirement preservation decisions, to determine which factors were the best predictors of whether an individual preserved funds when changing jobs. A research instrument was designed using a combination of existing psychometric measures and customised questions to form an analytical survey. This was used to test the factors that predicted the preservation decisions of a sample of 256 academic and non-academic personnel at a tertiary education institution in South Africa. The study found that behavioural factors play an important role in predicting preservation decisions. In particular, behavioural factors related to bounded rationality, due to the computational complexity of the decision-making environment, emerged as important explanatory variables, indicating that interventions such as decision support and guidance may assist individuals in making optimal decisions.
