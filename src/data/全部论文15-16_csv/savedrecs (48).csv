Depending on the model being employed, we find evidence of convergence of operational efficiency towards either a national steady state or towards their own steady states, with the latter process occurring more rapidly. In essence, our study provides evidence of negative effects of government intervention. Additionally, we use the nonparametric distribution dynamics approach to analyze intra-distributional dynamics of technical efficiency and productivity. We find some support for productivity convergence while technical efficiency does not converge for provinces with relatively low levels. We discuss policy implementations based on our model results and highlight several aspects for policy making in the power sector reforms currently being undertaken.","[Jaunky, Vishal Chandr] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm Technol & Social Sci, Lulea, Sweden; [Jaunky, Vishal Chandr] Univ Mauritius, Dept Finance & Accounting, Fac Law & Management, Moka, Mauritius; [Zhang, Lin] ETH, Ctr Econ Res, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Lulea University of Technology; University of Mauritius; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Zhang, L (通讯作者)，ETH, Ctr Econ Res, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",vishal.jaunky@ltu.se; linzhang@ethz.ch,"Zhang, Lin/O-5851-2017","Zhang, Lin/0000-0002-5945-5451",,,,,49,15,15,1,13,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2016,37.0,,,,1,,3,27,,10.5547/01956574.37.SI1.vjau,0.0,,,25,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DH5TQ,,"hybrid, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372855300002,0

In our paper we study the impact of Chinese exports on the exports of EU15 countries in the period 2010-2014. However, the literature about gravity models is wide and different authors recommend different estimation techniques in their papers. The aim of this paper is to offer different specifications of trade gravity models and compare the results for our research topic. We find out those different specifications indeed deliver different results; however, the differences are not substantial. We can conclude that the use of different methodological approaches does not differ the answer for our research question.

However, when using a simple bathtub, people come to realize that bath water gets cool after a short time. But keeping hot water flowing is a great waste of water and energy. So it is interesting to find a strategy to make a bath comfortable with water wasted as little as possible. To begin with, we construct a three dimensional space model of transient heat transfer process to find the tub water temperature in space and time. By ANSYS Fluent CFD, we analyzed the simulation of water temperature. Due to the analysis, we found a fact that water temperature seldom differs at the same horizontal plane under the situation that the water of bathtub is static without the impact of person, and the model could be simplified to a one dimensional space model of transient heat transfer process. By the model, we obtained water temperature distribution in the bathtub. Consider that a bubble bath changes coefficient of heat transfer and evaporation. We obtained a new function of water temperature with time, finding that the water temperature drops slower. At last, we made a strategy chart aiming at the personal preference.","[Mou, Ya] North China Elect Power Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University,"Mou, Y (通讯作者)，North China Elect Power Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7914-0,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,58.0,,,,,,518,522,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7QX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391643800098,0

Techniques developed by Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux (2007) are used to decompose the gap into a compositional effect (the part of the earnings gap that can be explained by observable factors) and a structural effect (the part of the gap that can be explained by returns to those factors, suggestive of discrimination) at various quantiles of the income distribution. While, in all countries and all points of the wage distribution, compositional effects help explain gender gaps in self-employment earnings, the majority of the wage gap is due to structural effects (with the exception of low-income earners in the Republic of Congo). Still, the relative importance of specific compositional factors and the specific contribution of structural factors varies across countries and at different points of the income distribution within countries. There is some evidence of a glass-ceiling effect in the Republic of Congo and Tanzania but not in Ghana and Rwanda. These results suggest that discrimination is influenced by local conditions and that there is no single model of earnings gaps that can explain gender gaps in earning in sub-Saharan Africa.","[Gamberoni, Elisa] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Nix, Emily] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Heath, Rachel] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",The World Bank; Yale University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Gamberoni, E (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",emily.nix@yale.edu; egamberoni@worldbank.org; rmheath@uw.edu,,,UN Foundation-ExxonMobil Foundation; Bank of Netherlands Partnership Program,UN Foundation-ExxonMobil Foundation; Bank of Netherlands Partnership Program,"This work was supported by the UN Foundation-ExxonMobil Foundation research collaboration on women's economic empowerment (http://www.unfoundation.org/features/building-a-roadmap.html) and the Bank of Netherlands Partnership Program.

Financial equilibrium criteria are a special case of comparison the profit index and the limit value. The following criteria are generalized: the Sharpe's Ratio, the Jensen's Alpha and the Treynor's Ratio. Moreover, the safety-first criteria are generalized here for the fuzzy case. The Roy Criterion, the Kataoka Criterion and the Telser Criterion are generalized. Obtained here results show that proposed theory is useful for the investment applications.

The paper deals with a modification of Ramsey model that uses the neoclassical dynamical model and determines the optimal consumption as a result of optimal intertemporal choices of individual households. For simplicity the model considers only a tax on income of firms. This leads to a different selecting of optimal prices of labor and capital services. Euler equation of optimal consumption path of household is then introduced as well as its particular interpretation. We also study longterm effects of taxation of the given model. Hence the steady state of the dynamical model is introduced and then a formula for steady state Laffer curve is derived. Having this formula we further study the properties of optimization of tax revenue. First, it is shown that the optimal tax rate is dependent on the magnitude of elasticity of capital which is an exogenous parameter of the neoclassical production function. Then methods of comparative statics are used to find a sensitivity of tax revenue at steady state of the economic unit on some parameters.","[Prazak, Pavel] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Informat & Quantitat Methods, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Prazak, P (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Informat & Quantitat Methods, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",pavel.prazak@uhk.cz,"Prazak, Pavel/F-8299-2013","Prazak, Pavel/0000-0001-9160-5758",,,,,13,1,1,0,1,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,705,710,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500121,0

The paper focuses on estimating the impact of the workforce over 55 years on the economy of the Czech Republic. With respect to available data sources, we used a total productivity model. The key issue lies in the influence of the age composition of the workforce on real output. The increase of productivity is considered as an important factor of future economic growth.

The mixture distribution is given by the weighted sum over all components and, in the end, an individual regression models, one for each component, can be estimated simultaneously. The estimation of parameters is done via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, a widely applicable algorithm for computing maximum likelihood estimates from incomplete data. Recently, mixture models are used more and more in various fields, including biology, medicine, genetics and the economics. In this paper, income of residents of EU countries is explored, in further detail we analyse the relationship between an annual old age pension and income of people over 65 years. While the data show evident heterogeneity, the mixture regression approach is required.","[Vankatova, Kristyna; Fiserova, Eva] Palacky Univ Olomouc, Fac Sci, Dept Math Anal & Applicat Math, 17 Listopadu 12, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic",Palacky University Olomouc,"Vankátová, K (通讯作者)，Palacky Univ Olomouc, Fac Sci, Dept Math Anal & Applicat Math, 17 Listopadu 12, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic.",kristyna.vankatova@upol.cz; eva.fiserova@upol.cz,"FIŠEROVÁ, Eva/G-1754-2019","FIŠEROVÁ, Eva/0000-0001-9147-3118",,,,,11,1,1,1,2,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,875,880,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500150,0

Consequently, since enterprises represent a principal component in creating a job-rich recovery, the European Commission, within the Europe 2020 Strategy and Entrepreneurship 2020 action plan, stressed the importance of entrepreneurial spirit in Europe. In that context, private sector development is recognized as a crucial determinant for long-term economic success. On the other side, countries` regulatory and administrative frameworks often hinder entrepreneurial initiatives. The main goal of this paper is to empirically analyse whether relaxing the constraints imposed by regulations increases the entrepreneurial activity in European Union countries. The special emphasis will be put on the effects of change in regulations on both opportunity-based and necessity-based entrepreneurship, using the GEM (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor) data. In this line of research, following the analysis of van Stel et al. (2007) and Stenholm, Acs and Wuebeker (2013), the paper will encompass the quality of entrepreneurship activity in countries, not only their number. In performing the analysis, a system GMM approach will be used for the 2001-2015 period. As an indicator of business regulation, we will use the Index of Business Freedom which is part of the Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom that measures barriers faced by business sector from starting to closing the business, whereas the data for the quality of entrepreneurship will be obtained from the GEM database.","[Vuckovic, Valentina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 41000, Croatia; [Sertic, Martina Basarac] Croatian Acad Sci & Arts, Econ Res Div, Zagreb, Croatia; [Banovic, Ruzica Simic] Univ Zagreb, Fac Law, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Croatian Academy of Sciences & Arts; University of Zagreb,"Vuckovic, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",vvuckovic@efzg.hr; mbasarac@hazu.hr; ruzica.simic@pravo.hr,"Vučković, Valentina/AAM-7141-2021; Sertić, Martina Basarac/AAH-4377-2019; Šimić Banović, Ružica/AFO-2138-2022","Vučković, Valentina/0000-0002-5438-0665; Sertić, Martina Basarac/0000-0003-4182-8405; Šimić Banović, Ružica/0000-0001-6527-2726",,,,,21,0,0,0,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,642,652,,,,,,11,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400066,0

Huangshi, a city with its resources dying out, during the course of transformation into a tourist attraction, should plan and utilize it with the awareness of the local natural geographical features; construct eco-friendly tourist city, respect the original wetland and make full use of it and preserve it properly. The article is largely focused on the way the Ci Lake in Huangshi is being developed in the aspect of ecology and culture, etc. for the purpose of being promoted. Wetlands, compared to the kidney of the earth, together with forests and oceans are known to us as the three global ecology systems and playing an essential role around us. The value of its existence, however, is being ignored. Since the 21st century, the area of our national wetlands has been shrinking at an amazing rate due to the changing climate, industrialization and urbanization. According to a recent report given by the Forestry Bureau in 2014, approximately 3.4 million hectares of wetlands have decreased in China in the past decade, accounting for 8.82% of the totality, and among them, urban wetlands are rapidly diminishing. Profound reflection and reconsideration should be given to this phenomenon. Huangshi, with an area of 56,000 hectares of wetland, about 12% of its total size, is also facing big challenge. She has abundant water resources with rivers and lakes crossed and reservoirs scattered here and there. Of all the lakes the most typical are the Ci Lake, the Daye Lake, the Xiandao Lake and the Qingshan Lake and so on, with the rain area up to 25 square kilometers. Meanwhile reservoirs total to 266,and their total storage capacity adds up to 2.505 billion cubic meters, with two large in size, 6 medium-sized, 51 small (one) -typed, and 207 small (two) -typed. The total capacity of water resource is 4.243 billion cubic meters in the city, with the underground one up to 805,000,000, which is titled with half land, half water.

In the paper, exchange rate risk management in international investment portfolio is discussed from the perspective of Chinese investors. Stock and bond index of financial markets in several representative countries are selected in the paper for establishing a diversified investment model containing exchange rate risk hedge. Risk composition in international investment portfolio under RMEB pricing is investigated. A game model containing retailer, manufacturer and supplier is constructed through utilizing wholesale price contract in a trial mode aiming at defects in existing literature. The conduction of demand risk and exchange rate risk in supply chain is studied through model equilibrium. Their influence on expected performance and performance variance of supply chain depot enterprises, and risk sharing problem among supply chain depot enterprises are respectively discussed. Expected performance of supply chain depot enterprises is increased with increase of market demand fluctuation and exchange rate movement degree. The performance variance of supply chain depot enterprises is increased with increase of market demand fluctuation and exchange rate movement degree. Relative risk sharing between retailers and manufacturers is measured according to the ratio between retailer profit variance and manufacturer profit variance, which is increased with increase of market demand function slope and reduction of retailer reaction flexibility on market price change.","[Wang, Juan] Bohai Univ, Coll Econ & Law, Jinzhou, Peoples R China",Bohai University,"Wang, J (通讯作者)，Bohai Univ, Coll Econ & Law, Jinzhou, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,1,3,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7914-0,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,58.0,,,,,,78,82,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7QX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391643800015,0

Such analysis downplays the importance of the banking crisis in Germany in explaining the decision-making of the German government around the euro-zone debt crisis. Giving German interests in relation to the German banking crisis analytical weight can explain both the positions taken by the German government and their consequences for the underlying structural problems the euro-zone faces as a monetary union. Since the outcomes of German policy have advanced German interests, German handling of the euro-zone crisis cannot sustain a claim that Germany has demonstrated its commitment to the euro.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Cambridge CB2 1RX, England",University of Cambridge,"Thompson, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Polit & Int Studies, 17 Mill Lane, Cambridge CB2 1RX, England.",het20@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,22,22,1,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In general, we find that REITs that have higher levels of liquidity and that are larger in size tend to impound information more quickly and reverse more speedily after an extreme event. Also, we find that Equity REITs have stronger liquidity effects and Mortgage REITs have stronger size effects. Exante beta is also useful in explaining price behavior. For example, pre-betas are significantly positively related to turnover ratios; while pre-event betas are negatively associated with quoted bid-ask spreads. This implies a high-beta, high-liquidity relation for REIT stocks. Additionally, we find that large REIT stocks have high pre-event betas. Overall, the stronger explanatory variables are liquidity and size in determining price movements around extreme market events for REIT stocks.","[Glascock, John L.; Lu-Andrews, Ran] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Ctr Real Estate & Urban Econ Studies, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut,"Lu-Andrews, R (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Ctr Real Estate & Urban Econ Studies, 2100 Hillside Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",john.glascock@business.uconn.edu; ran.lu-andrews@business.uconn.edu,,,,,,,32,8,9,1,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We estimate the incentive and selection effects of having prescription drug coverage on total drug expenditures using a sample from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). A Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model is used to model the heterogeneity in treatment effects. Rather than estimating a finite mixture model with a fixed number of components, we specify a DP prior on the parameters, thus allowing the data and prior knowledge to determine the number of components. Endogeneity is modeled by the covariance of the error terms of the selection and the outcome equations in a two-equation selection model. We find that there are strong incentive and advantageous selection effects, with the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect for the treated estimated at $1132 and $858, respectively. Substantial heterogeneity is found to exist in the selection effects, particularly for those having lower drug expenditures.

According to a theoretical framework of heterogeneous agents' behavior, we estimate a complete multi-stage system weakly separable using individual demand bid data in the Italian Power Exchange. The novel contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we model hourly demand of heterogeneous groups of agents acting in the Italian electricity market with a simultaneous system for all 24 hours. Secondly, we empirically measure the entire structure of expenditure elasticities and cross price elasticities for all 24 hours of the day, ascertaining whether hourly electricity demands can be considered normal or luxury goods and substitutes or complements in an organized electricity market. Econometric estimation shows that price elasticity tends to be higher when hourly price peak. Moreover, electricity exhibits both substitutability and complementarity characteristic in different hours of the day, the former during the day and the latter during the night. Electricity appears to be a normal good during nighttime and a luxury good during daytime. The demand structure has welfare improving policy implications, because appropriate regulation can favor consumer behavior adjustment to shave consumption away from peak prices, thus yielding lower aggregate equilibrium expenditures. To this end, we advocate reforming the actual administered two-price tariff structure to introduce real time pricing options for Italian final users.","[Bigerna, Simona; Bollino, Carlo Andrea] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, I-06123 Perugia, PG, Italy",University of Perugia,"Bollino, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via A Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, PG, Italy.",carloandrea.bollino@unipg.it,,"Bigerna, Simona/0000-0003-4880-6305; Bollino, Carlo Andrea/0000-0002-7751-7089",,,,,32,11,11,0,7,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,OCT,2015,36.0,4,,,,,129,147,,10.5547/01956574.36.4.sbig,0.0,,,19,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CS5XP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362151900007,0

Recent improvements for accessing transaction data have stimulated interest in commercial property hedonic pricing models, the structures of which follow traditions in single-family real estate in that the implicit prices of property characteristics and site-specific variables represent city and national market conditions. Adding present value variables has become increasingly common to account for general market conditions. We test two hedonic pricing models; one that follows the residential tradition and another that departs by incorporating city-specific net operating incomes and the discount rates. Modeling prices in these alternative ways allows for recognition of the relative contributions of property, city, and capital market determinants. Empirical testing relies on a sample of hotel transactions from 2005-2010. The responsiveness of hotel cash flows to market changes is an important consideration. We find that models with property characteristics perform about the same as models that also include present value variables. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that implicit prices corresponding to property characteristics and site-specific variables appear to reflect income streams associated with city and nationwide economic conditions.","[Corgel, Jack B.; Liu, Crocker] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [White, Robert M.] Real Capital Analyt, New York, NY USA",Cornell University,"Corgel, JB (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",jc81@cornell.edu,,,,,,,47,18,18,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Overlapping firm interactions yield agglomeration clusters that are much larger than the underlying agglomerative forces themselves.

Evidence from an OECD Cross-section,ENERGY JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Principal-Agent Problem; Split Incentives; Energy Efficiency,SPLIT INCENTIVES,"When the agent making an investment decision is different from the one bearing the costs of the decision, the outcome (energy usage, here) is socially sub-optimal, a scenario known in the energy efficient technology case as split incentive effect. Using a sample of households (from a survey conducted in 2011) from 11 OECD countries, this paper investigates the magnitude of the split incentive effect between home occupants who are owners and those who are renters. A wide variety of energy-related technologies are considered: appliances, energy efficient bulbs, insulation, heat thermostat, solar panels, ground source heat pumps and wind turbines. Mean difference in patterns of access to these technologies are consistent with the split incentives hypothesis. Regression results suggest that, even after controlling for the sizeable differences in observed characteristics, owners are substantially more likely to have access to energy efficient appliances and to better insulation as well as to heat thermostats. For relatively immobile investments such as wind turbines and ground source heat pumps, we find no differences between owners and renters.","[Krishnamurthy, Chandra Kiran B.] Umea Univ, Ctr Environm & Resource Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Krishnamurthy, Chandra Kiran B.] Umea Univ, Umea Sch Business & Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Kristrom, Bengt] SLU, Ctr Environm & Resource Econ, Umea, Sweden; [Kristrom, Bengt] SLU, Dept Forest Econ, Umea, Sweden",Umea University; Umea University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Krishnamurthy, CKB (通讯作者)，Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, Box 50005, SE-10405 Stockholm, Sweden.",chandra.kiran@econ.umu.se; bengt.kristrom@slu.se,,"Krishnamurthy, Chandra Kiran/0000-0002-9494-6467",,,,,11,32,34,1,17,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,OCT,2015,36.0,4,,,,,85,104,,10.5547/01956574.36.4.ckri,0.0,,,20,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CS5XP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362151900005,0

The slowed growth of air cargo traffic at California's airports, however, has raised pressing questions about the determinants of air cargo traffic. Specifically, it would be useful to know how California's air cargo traffic is affected by urban economic characteristics. Accordingly, this study estimates the socioeconomic determinants of air cargo traffic across cities in California. We construct a 7-year panel (2003-2009) using quarterly employment, wage, population, and traffic data for metro areas in the state. Our results reveal that the concentrations of both service and manufacturing employment impact the volume of outbound air cargo. Total air cargo traffic is found to grow faster than population, while the corresponding domestic traffic grows less than proportionally to city size. Wages play a significant role in determining both total and domestic air cargo movement. We provide point estimates for traffic diversion between cities, showing that 80% of air cargo traffic is diverted away from a small city located within 100 miles of a large one. Using socioeconomic and demographic forecasts prepared for California's Department of Transportation, we also forecast metro-level total and domestic air cargo tonnage for the years 2010-2040. Our forecasts for this period indicate that California's total (domestic) air cargo traffic will increase at an average rate of 5.9% (4.4%) per year. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Little has been done, however, to estimate the effect Frequent Flyer Programs (FFPs) have on itinerary choice. The goal of this paper is to quantify the impact of FFP membership on itinerary choice and identify discrete patterns of unobserved preference heterogeneity. For this purpose, we apply two modeling techniques using a set of stated preference data collected on 830 individuals. A Multinomial Logit Model (MNL) is first estimated and Willingness-To-Pay (WFP) values are calculated for the choice of flying an airline with which the individual has FFP membership compared with another airline where the individual has no FFP membership. These WTP estimates vary across different trip purposes and levels of FFP status. Our results indicate that FFP membership plays a strong role in airline choice, particularly for individuals with elite membership. We then capture random heterogeneity through the use of latent class models, using sociodemographic variables as class-membership covariates. The latent class model results indicate three groups of individuals with very different sets of preferences, particularly for FFP membership. The discrete segmentation indicates one class with very low WTP, one class with average WFP, and one class with extremely large WTP values. These results provide evidence that latent class models capture preference heterogeneity much better than the MNL model for air itinerary choice, particularly when considering the effects of FFP membership.

This paper aims to evaluate the farmers' intention to modify their behaviour in response to the CAP reform using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). A questionnaire was submitted to 211 Italian durum wheat producers. Two behaviours were analysed: 1) the change in the durum wheat acreage, and 2) the maintenance of at least 7% of the arable land as an EFA. A structural equation model (SEM) technique was employed. The TPB model explains, respectively, 52% and 55% of the intention variance. Subjective norms affect the intention to change the durum wheat acreage, while attitude drives the intention to maintain at least 7% of the arable land as an EFA. Implications for policy makers and producers are discussed.","[Donati, Michele; Fioravanzi, Martina] Univ Parma, Dept Biosci, I-43100 Parma, Italy; [Menozzi, Davide] Univ Parma, Dept Food Sci, I-43100 Parma, Italy",University of Parma; University of Parma,"Menozzi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Parma, Dept Biosci, I-43100 Parma, Italy.",davide.menozzi@unipr.it,"Donati, Michele/L-4171-2019; Menozzi, Davide/ABH-4514-2020","Donati, Michele/0000-0002-3957-842X; Menozzi, Davide/0000-0002-5241-1587",,,,,50,13,13,2,32,Bologna Univ Press,Bologna,"Via Saragozza 10, Bologna, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2015,14.0,3,,,,,29,39,,,,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,CX6SZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365833300004,0

Newly recovered evidence indicates that far more metal was turned into (traditional) hardware than into (modem) machines. Machine production grew rapidly from a very small base: metal consumption fails to capture this change in the product mix, and understates the growth of new production at constant prices. Moreover, maintenance activity was in general as significant as new production. Maintenance was labor-intensive rather than metal-intensive, trend-dominated rather than cyclical, and relatively larger, next to new production, in 1861 than in 1913: metal consumption overstates the growth rate of the industry's total product at constant prices, and much overstates its cyclical volatility. Technical progress was negligible in maintenance, but rapid in new production: constant-price-weighted physical measures fail to capture productivity growth, and even late-weighted series overstate the growth of the industry's real product.

This paper examines the labor market impacts of investment subsidized by the U.S. federal government's New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program, which provides tax incentives to promote business investment in low-income neighborhoods. To identify the program's effects, I exploit a discontinuity in the rule determining the eligibility of census tracts for NMTC-subsidized investment. Using rich administrative data on workers' residence and workplace locations, I find evidence that many of the new jobs created in areas that receive subsidized investment do not go to residents of targeted neighborhoods. The results suggest that the local economic benefits of place-based programs may be diluted when subsidized businesses have scope to hire from broader regional labor markets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Unemployed apprenticeship graduates constitute a large share of unemployed youth in Germany but unemployment incidence within this group is unequally distributed. Our paper extends previous research in three dimensions. It shows that (i) individual productivity assessment of the training firm, (ii) initial selection into high reputation training firms and occupations, and (iii) adverse selection of employer moving graduates are correlated with unemployment after apprenticeship graduation. The empirical evidence is obtained from the second longitudinal version of the linked employer-employee panel data from the JAB (LIAB). This large data set allows us to calculate the exact unemployment spell length of apprenticeship graduates. In addition, we can include individual, employer, occupation as well as industrial relation characteristics before and after apprenticeship graduation into our list of explanatory variables for unemployment risk. We show in several robustness checks that our results are remarkably stable when we vary the employees included in the sample, the definition of unemployment, and the list of explanatory variables.","[Mohrenweiser, Jens l] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [Zwick, Thomas] ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Zwick, Thomas] ROA Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Maastricht University,"Zwick, T (通讯作者)，Univ Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.",mohrenweiser@bournemouth.ac.uk; thomas.zwick@uni-wuerzburg.de,,,,,,,38,5,5,3,23,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

But the impact of actual immigration levels on immigration attitudes is still contested. As a result, the relationship between immigration levels and EU public support remains uncertain from a theoretical point of view. We offer an empirical study of the link between immigration from the new EU member states from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and EU support at the regional level in Spain, France, Ireland and The Netherlands. The results of the analyses suggest that in all four countries immigration from CEE had negative effects on support for European integration in the host societies. In short, immigration seems to undermine integration, although internal migration within the EU is necessary for the successful functioning of its economic union and the future of political integration.","[Toshkov, Dimiter; Kortenska, Elitsa] Leiden Univ, Inst Publ Adm, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Toshkov, D (通讯作者)，Inst Publ Adm, Schouwburgstr 2, NL-2511 VA The Hague, Netherlands.",d.d.toshkov@cdh.leidenuniv.nl,"Kortenska, Elitsa/AAS-5323-2020; Toshkov, Dimiter/K-3858-2013","Toshkov, Dimiter/0000-0002-7444-9340",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [451-11-023],Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"The authors would like to thank Lori Thorlakson, Nicole Lugosi, Theresa Kuhn, Anne Rasmussen, and the participants at the 'Ten Years On: Evaluating Eastern Enlargement' ECPR Joint Session (10-15 April 2014, Salamanca, Spain) and the Seventh Pan-European Conference on the EU (5-7 June 2014, The Hague, The Netherlands) for helpful comments and suggestions.

A GHGs household inventory is determined using link-level average speeds for a large and representative sample of households in three origin-destination surveys (1998, 2003 and 2008) in Montreal, Canada. For the emission inventories, different sources of data are combined including link-level average speeds in the network, vehicle occupancy levels and fuel consumption characteristics of the vehicle fleet. Urban form indicators over time such as population density, land use mix and transit accessibility are generated for each household in each of the three waves. A latent class (LC) regression modeling framework is then implemented to investigate the association of built environment and socio-demographics with GHGs and automobile distance traveled. Among other results, it is found that population density, transit accessibility and land-use mix have small but statistically significant negative impact on GHGs and car usage. Despite that this is in accordance with past studies, the estimated elasticities are greater than those reported in the literature for North American cities. Moreover, different household subpopulations are identified in which the effect of built environment varies significantly. Also, a reduction of the average GHGs at the household level is observed over time. According to our estimates, households produced 15% and 10% more GHGs in 1998 and 2003 respectively, compared to 2008. This reduction can be associated to the improvement of the fuel economy of vehicle fleet and the decrease of motor-vehicle usage - e.g., a decrease of 4% is observed for fuel efficiency rates and 12% for distance according to the raw average estimates from 1998 with respect to 2008. A strong link is also observed between socio-demographics and the two travel outcomes. While number of workers is positively associated with car distance and GHGs, low and medium income households pollute less than high-income households. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

If not, how do courts manage the tension between legal principles and political concerns? We address these questions through an analysis of one of the most independent international adjudication mechanisms - dispute settlement at the World Trade Organization (WTO). We find that the ad hoc nature of WTO panels, judicial hierarchy, and panelists' concern for compliance create a set of incentives that encourage panelists to moderate rulings against the most powerful WTO members. Our analysis shows that WTO dispute settlement panels limit the negative effects of judgements against the United States and the European Union by reducing the scope of such verdicts through the use of judicial economy. We argue that WTO panels use this practice to balance the demands of the law with the concerns of powerful members, which results in a level of judicial restraint on the part of panels and increased prospects for compliance by the US and EU.","[Brutger, Ryan; Morse, Julia C.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Brutger, R (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, 130 Corwin Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",rbrutger@princeton.edu; jcmorse@princeton.edu,,,,,,,52,20,24,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

First, to obtain inflation rates for the four regions of Spain analysed for the period 1501-1800 by modelling Hamilton's (American treasure and the price revolution in Spain, 1934; War and prices in Spain, 1947) price index series by means of an unobserved component model with a common cyclical factor. And second, to prove their long-term convergence process. Therefore, convergence concerns both the cyclical variation of inflation rates common to the four regions, and trend inflation. A complete convergence of the trend inflation occurred once the monetary reforms of Charles II of Spain were introduced in order to redress the previous monetary instability known as inflation of the vellon. The predominance of the vellon in small change and the concentration of the influx of silver when inflation was comparatively lower (second half of the sixteenth century and the seventeenth century) complicate to reach simple conclusions on the monetary origin of inflation exclusively based on precious metals, but, on the contrary, suggest a monetary origin based on copper coin and fiscal distortions. So, monetary stability proved to be a necessary condition for inflation convergence and the fulfilment of the purchasing power parity condition along the eighteen century.","[Cendejas Bueno, Jose Luis; Font de Villanueva, Cecilia] Univ Francisco de Vitoria, Inst Invest Econ & Sociales Francisco de Vitoria, Madrid 28223, Spain",Universidad Francisco de Vitoria,"Bueno, JLC (通讯作者)，Univ Francisco de Vitoria, Inst Invest Econ & Sociales Francisco de Vitoria, Carretera M-515,Km 1,800, Madrid 28223, Spain.",joseluis.cendejas@iies-fv.es,"Cendejas Bueno, José Luis/I-9879-2014","Cendejas Bueno, José Luis/0000-0001-8417-9455; Font, Cecilia/0000-0002-0761-2283",Instituto de Investigaciones Economicas y Sociales Francisco de Vitoria,Instituto de Investigaciones Economicas y Sociales Francisco de Vitoria,"The authors would like to thank the Instituto de Investigaciones Economicas y Sociales Francisco de Vitoria for the grant received for this project from the 2nd and 3rd call for proposals for research projects.

Since the WTO usually rules in favor of the complainant, countries should initiate disputes as quickly as possible to limit the time their domestic industries are subject to these duties. However, countries often wait years before initiating a dispute. I argue that government leaders time disputes around their elections to gain political support from large domestic industries, particularly in developing countries with fewer economic resources and countries with highly contested domestic politics, where even small electoral gains are crucial. Using data on all WTO disputes over antidumping duties, I run a discrete time hazard model and find evidence that countries are more likely to bring up a dispute the closer they get to elections.

Because sold properties are valued more closely to market values than unsold properties, we develop a hedonic pricing model that controls for sample selectivity. The resulting estimates of prices achievable in the market are then compared to appraised values. Our results show that the properties held by open-end real estate funds were likely to have been overvalued prior to the crisis. This supports the view that a fundamentally justified run was at the heart of the 2005/2006 crisis, and it challenges the effectiveness of current valuation practices.","[Weistroffer, Christian] European Cent Bank, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Sebastian, Steffen] Univ Regensburg, IREBS Int Real Estate Business Sch, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany",European Central Bank; University of Regensburg,"Sebastian, S (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, IREBS Int Real Estate Business Sch, Univ Str 31, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany.",christian.weistroffer@ecb.europa.eu; steffen.sebastian@irebs.de,,,,,,,33,14,14,0,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Inefficiency arises naturally in this setting and can be characterized by a simple condition on the reservation payoffs that is necessary and sufficient. I derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an implementable allocation that at least weakly dominates the reservation payoffs. Under a mild assumption on the distribution of types, I characterize the surplus maximizing mechanism in the second best setting. I argue that the model applies to an environment where property rights over the object are not well defined and are subject to costly enforcement. In such cases, type dependent reservation payoffs arise naturally as the uninformed player's expectation from the enforcement process. The model can explain why the best ways of avoiding costly dispute resolution, such as arbitration as a way of avoiding litigation, typically involve a degree of inefficiency.","Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Aney, MS (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",madhavsa@smu.edu.sg,,"Aney, Madhav/0000-0002-2659-0710",,,,,25,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,APR,2015,44.0,4,,,,,833,859,,10.1007/s00355-014-0863-2,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CF6YO,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352703100007,0

More specifically, we find posted rate quotes by lenders are directly related to measures of foreclosure process risk including the length of time required to complete foreclosure proceedings within a jurisdiction and the presence (and length) of statutory redemption periods. Mortgage rates are also found to be contingent upon differential underwriting fees and conditions, housing appreciation and volatility measures, and the competitive nature of the economic marketplace in which each lender operates. In contrast to the previous literature, we find the judicial foreclosure process requirements exert little to no impact on observable mortgage interest rate quotes after controlling for these additional dimensions of risk.","[Harrison, David M.] Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Seiler, Michael J.] Coll William & Mary, Mason Sch Business, Real Estate & Finance, Williamsburg, VA USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; William & Mary,"Harrison, DM (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",david.m.harrison@ttu.edu; Michael.Seiler@mason.wm.edu,,"Seiler, Michael/0000-0001-7071-2474",,,,,68,10,12,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

In countries where entrepreneurs have high social status, we may therefore expect that entrepreneurs are taller than wage workers. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (2002-2012), we find that a 1 cm increase in an individual's height raises the probability of being self-employed (the most common proxy for entrepreneurship) versus paid employed by 0.15 percentage points. Within the self-employed, the probability of being an employer is increased by 0.10 percentage points as a result of a 1 cm increase in height, whereas this increase is 0.05 percentage points for an own-account worker. This result corroborates the higher social status of employers compared to own-account workers. We find a height premium in earnings for self-employed and paid-employed individuals: an additional 1 cm in height is associated with a 0.39% increase in hourly earnings for paid employees and a 0.52% increase for self-employed individuals. Our analysis reveals that approximately one third of the height premium in earnings is explained by differences in educational attainment. We also establish the existence of a height premium in terms of work and life satisfaction, which is more pronounced for paid employees than for self-employed individuals. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Companies draw on branding techniques familiar to other contexts to evoke markets where none exist, and to link production practices with particular forms of identity. These branding strategies at the site of production attempt to simulate the paternalistic culture of a company town, in a themed environment that identifies the company with both locale and nation. These techniques allowed both companies in this article to extend temporary legitimacy in their practices, creating a sense of continuity despite the radical rearrangement and intensification of mining and timbering practices.","[Scott, Rebecca] Univ Missouri, Sociol, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Bennett, Elizabeth] Cent New Mexico Community Coll, Sociol, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Bennett, E (通讯作者)，Cent New Mexico Community Coll, Main Campus,525 Buena Vista SE, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA.",ebennett18@cnm.edu,"Bennett, Elizabeth/HHS-2336-2022",,,,,,51,10,14,0,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

From 2007 to 2012, elite politicians and intellectuals articulated the Chongqing and Guangdong models as contradictory visions for China. Drawing on a three-pronged conceptual framework developed by Bob Jessop, the article de- and reconstructs this dichotomy which has been embraced by some Western scholars. It is argued, first, that the two models involve complimentary accumulation strategies: as Guangdong moves up global value chains, Chongqing takes over many of its low-wage jobs in manufacturing sectors. Second, however, the two models do entail contrasting state projects. Guangdong's local government opened up more space for civil society organisations than normally allowed, whereas Chongqing's administrators reinforced China's state-led development path. Finally, it is highlighted how this difference between state projects is reflected in two antagonistic hegemonic visions for China's national development, illustrated by the populism of former Chongqing Party Chief Bo Xilai vs. the pro-business stance of his Guangdong counterpart Wang Yang. Future studies should expand upon the key theoretical insight of the paper: that the emergent variegated capitalism approach to political-economic analysis needs a stronger ideational component.","[Mulvad, Andreas] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, DK-1366 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Mulvad, A (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, Oster Farimagsgade 5,1366 Kbh K, DK-1366 Copenhagen, Denmark.",acmm@ifs.ku.dk,,,,,,,87,45,50,1,46,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This article applies the well-established literature on economic voting to the analysis of European Parliament elections. In theoretical terms, it focuses on a forward-looking selection model and probes the difficulties of signal extraction in the multilevel context of European Union politics. In methodological terms, hierarchical mixed logit models are used so as to explore the magnitude and the determinants of economic voting in the 2004 and the subsequent 2009 EP elections. Although the EU has acquired significant economic policy domains from the Member States, and therewith effectively blurring political responsibility for economic policies, this analysis demonstrates that voters are nevertheless able to extract competence signals and cast an economic vote. The article also focuses on the conditionality of the economic vote and vote abstention in EP elections.","[Bartkowska, Monika; Tiemann, Guido] Inst Adv Studies, A-1060 Vienna, Austria",,"Bartkowska, M (通讯作者)，Inst Adv Studies, Stumpergasse 56, A-1060 Vienna, Austria.",bartkowska@ihs.ac.at,,"Tiemann, Guido/0000-0003-1072-1189",,,,,28,10,10,3,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We aim at defining an egalitarian distribution of a constant stream of resources, relying on ordinal non-comparable information on individual preferences. We establish the impossibility of efficiently distributing resources while treating equally agents with same preferences that belong to possibly different generations. We thus propose an egalitarian criterion based on the equal-split guarantee: this requires all agents to find their assigned consumption bundle at least as desirable as the equal division of resources.","[Isaac, Tanguy] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Piacquadio, Paolo G.] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, N-0851 Oslo, Norway",Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Oslo,"Piacquadio, PG (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, N-0851 Oslo, Norway.",tanguy.isaac@uclouvain.be; p.g.piacquadio@econ.uio.no,,,Research Council of Norway through Centres of Excellence [179552],Research Council of Norway through Centres of Excellence,"The authors thank F.

It is argued that the Council let the EP become involved in this sensitive policy area because it accepted the legislature's argument for its right to access. In addition, the EP's bargaining strategy concretized the procedures and contributed to finalizing the deal after two years of negotiation. It is shown in this article that despite the EP's marginal powers in the area of security and defence and the traditional conception of this policy as an executive prerogative, it cannot be isolated from democratic principles. This article provides new evidence for previous claims that the EP's involvement in EU foreign policy is increasing due to legitimacy concerns.

These so-called implicit costs, which arise as a result of regulatory delay in the land development process, are hypothesized to be potentially large, but empirical evidence of their influence on development outcomes is limited. Using a unique micro-level data set on parcel-level subdivision development that includes data on the timing of subdivision approvals, we test the effects of implicit costs that arise as a result of increased subdivision approval times on the timing and pattern of residential subdivision development. Consistent with theory, we find that these regulation-induced implicit costs reduce the probability of subdivision development on any given parcel. In addition, we find that systematic variation in regulation-induced implicit costs across space has reduced development in more heavily regulated urbanized areas intended for development and intensified development in less regulated exurban areas located farther away. The results provide a new explanation of scattered, low-density urban development as the result of optimal land development with multiple development options and heterogeneous regulatory costs.

In that framework welfare stigma in form of a social norm against living off (net-)transfers is introduced, and the impact of welfare stigma on self-insurance and social insurance that works through redistributive taxation is analyzed. It turns out that introducing welfare stigma reduces the socially optimal self-insurance and raises the socially optimal social insurance. It may be efficient for the society to operate at a point on its opportunity frontier where an increase in risk taking decreases mean post-tax income and welfare stigma. In the presence of moral hazard self-insurance efforts are invariant with respect to welfare stigma whereas social insurance increases upon introducing welfare stigma. Furthermore, it is shown that self-insurance and social insurance are inefficiently low or high depending on the preference intensity of the social norm.","[Eichner, Thomas; Weinreich, Daniel] Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, D-58097 Hagen, Germany",Fern University Hagen,"Eichner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, Univ Str 41, D-58097 Hagen, Germany.",thomas.eichner@fernuni-hagen.de; daniel.weinreich@ifb-group.com,,,,,,,46,0,0,0,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2015,44.0,2,,,,,319,348,,10.1007/s00355-014-0836-5,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CA5YG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348984000006,0

By recourse to Marx's concept of fetishism we argue that these theorists often fetishise the very social changes in the global economy they are trying to describe. As a result, they articulate a 'flat ontology' of concrete and contingent relations that mistakenly claims to capture the most important dynamics of global capitalism. We reject this approach, preferring instead to see global capitalism as a dialectical flux between concrete and more abstract processes. These critical points are developed by drawing on Marxism to explore how these social theorists often reproduce unhelpful dualisms in social theory, how they fetishise technology, how some of their arguments run parallel to a management justification logic of the market world and finally how they present a limited explanation of global finance.","[Roberts, John Michael] Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Joseph, Jonathan] Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England",Brunel University; University of Sheffield,"Roberts, JM (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",John.Roberts@brunel.ac.uk; j.joseph@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Joseph, Jonathan/0000-0002-4578-211X",,,,,73,12,12,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Four categories of store were identified: (i) the major supermarkets; (ii) independent supermarkets; (iii) green grocers; and (iv) grower direct markets. Results reveal that for the major supermarkets, all three factors: quality, competitive price and convenience were rated equally, implying a one-stop shop. For the independent supermarkets, which are primarily located closer to the consumers' place of residence, convenience was the key determining variable. For the independent green grocers and grower direct markets, superior quality and a wide range of product was most important.

The acidic 'Cleopatra' mandarin (Citrus reshni Hort. ex Tan.) is considered to be the most salt stress tolerant rootstock since it is able to limit the absorption of chloride and sodium at root level. As a consequence, limited amount of toxic ions are translocated from root to leaves. If salt stress tolerance of 'Cleopatra' mandarin and its hybrids has been well documented, little data exist for sweet mandarins. We investigated 16 genotypes representing a large diversity in mandarins subjected to salt stress. Physiological parameters such as stomatal conductance and leaf chloride contents were analyzed. If most of the acidic varieties were tolerant, also some sweet varieties presented traits of tolerance.

This paper presents the first part of an ongoing comparative research project. The first case study (presented here) is based on Aberdeen City Council, the local government authority covering the City of Aberdeen in Scotland. The need for this research is driven by an acknowledgement of the relatively isolated positioning of 'culture' within public sector bodies and the potential impact of this position on the wider cultural sector. The research employed a comparative case study approach to highlight comparison between the case study organisations, and to develop an understanding of the impacts of those comparative factors. A review of the relevant literature was conducted to refine the research questions and identify gaps in the literature. A purposive sample of employees was invited to participate in a survey questionnaire. Secondary literature produced by employees for internal and external use was also consulted to enrich the primary data. Primary and secondary data was thematically analysed to generate relevant findings. The research shows that while there is the relevant expertise, a recognised need and genuine desire to exchange knowledge within the organisation in support of the development and implementation of cultural strategies, these are hampered by a range of factors including: the perceived value of the concept of culture; the value and support for cultural initiatives; and the development and maintenance of meaningful relationships. These factors impact on the production of innovative cultural strategies, and concomitantly on the effectiveness and sustainability of regional arts and cultural sector initiatives and organisations, as well as the individuals therein. It is anticipated that this research will be of interest to practitioners in cultural strategy development. In addition to highlighting barriers and enablers of knowledge exchange for cultural strategy development, the research also emphasises the need for a more rigorous attempts to define the culture of concept is contextually meaningful ways, to emphasise the value of culture at regional levels, and to develop a lexicon for cultural activities which can be used in multi-partner initiatives.","[Burnett, Simon] Robert Gordon Univ, Res Inst Management Governance & Soc IMaGeS, Aberdeen AB10 7QE, Scotland; [Cameron, Gary] Marischal Coll, Aberdeen City Council, Business Hub 13, Aberdeen AB10 1AB, Scotland",Robert Gordon University; University of Aberdeen,"Burnett, S (通讯作者)，Robert Gordon Univ, Res Inst Management Governance & Soc IMaGeS, Garthdee Rd, Aberdeen AB10 7QE, Scotland.",,,,,,,,23,0,0,1,7,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1419,1430,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200109,0

While many contributions are given on the effect of national culture on countries' innovation, the effects of culture on firms' innovation performances has not been explored so far. Our study aims at filling this gap, by investigating how culture affects both firms' innovation capability and innovation rapidity. Design/methodology/approach - The research employs a quantitative methodology based on non parametric correlations analysis between Hofstede's cultural dimensions and firm's innovative performances. We focus on technological innovation, and limit the analysis to the five Hofstede's dimensions, which are usually employed in similar studies, that is: power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, individualism, and long-term orientation. We measure the correlation between each dimension, and three main indicators of firms' innovation performances: the number of international patents (absolute, and relative), the distribution of patent, and the patents' growth ratio, so to consider both firms' innovation capability, and rapidity. Originality/value - Our paper gives an original contribution to the entrepreneurial culture approach. Most of the studies focus on the impact of national culture on innovative performance at a country level, and consider how cultural dimensions impact on national innovation, usually measured as the amount of national patents or as the R&D expenses per capita. Our paper focuses instead on firms, and investigates how cultural dimensions impact on firms' innovation performances, and more specifically on firms' capability to innovate, and on the rapidity of the innovation process. Practical implications - By evaluating how cultural dimensions impact on innovation, managers may decide in which countries to relocate their R & D activities or with which companies to cooperate to innovate. Policy makers can understand which cultural dimensions affect innovation in order to define their policy, and leverage the values, which have a positive impact on local firms' attitude towards innovation, and on their inclination to protect their innovations.","[Calza, Francesco; Cannavale, Chiara; Parmentola, Adele; Laurenza, Elena] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Managerial Studies & Quantitat Methods, I-80132 Naples, Italy",Parthenope University Naples,"Laurenza, E (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Managerial Studies & Quantitat Methods, Palazzo Pacanowski,Via Generale Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy.",,,,,,,,44,0,0,1,29,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1037,1050,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200079,0

This is still the case but pressure from export markets on quarantine pests and diseases has increased, together with further residue restrictions. Due to concerns about citrus black spot, Guignardia citricarpa, mancozeb applications have increased in the Eastern Cape province and are likely responsible for a decline in numbers of the phytoseiid mite Euseius addoensis. This has resulted in greater populations of citrus thrips, Scirtothrips aurantii, early in the season and led to the use of longer residual thripicides such as chlorfenapyr. This product is harmful to both phytoseiids and hymenopterous parasitoids of quarantine pests such as certain mealybug species and false codling moth (FCM), Thaumatotibia leucotreta. Attempts to redress these imbalances are sometimes made by releasing the FCM parasitoid Trichogrammatoidea cryptophlebiae and Coccidoxenoides perminutus for mealybug, but the latter is not very effective against other mealybug species. Although California red scale (CRS), Aonidiella aurantii, is not a quarantine pest for most export markets, it must be controlled preventively where biological control is compromised by disruptive thripicides. This requirement, coupled with the increased price of spray oil, has resulted in widespread use of generic imidacloprid formulations as soil drenches. Although spirotetramat was recently registered in South Africa for the control of CRS and it appears to be IPM-compatible, its cost is high relative to other scalicides. The only new citrus pest that has become established in the last four years is the woolly whitefly, Aleurothrixus floccosus. The fruit fly Bactrocera invadens has spread throughout the rest of Africa south of the Sahara but is not yet established in South Africa.","Citrus Res Int, Nelspruit, South Africa",,"Grout, TG (通讯作者)，Citrus Res Int, Nelspruit, South Africa.",tg@cri.co.za,"Grout, Tim/B-3420-2010",,,,,,17,4,4,0,15,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1091,1095,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.137,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600137,0

GWP of container system components in the Western U.S. has also been studied. The resulting carbon footprint (CF) of these trees at the farm gate and transplanted into the landscape can be used to increase production system efficiency and decrease the GWP impact of the product. Reported propagation-to-landscape CF for field-grown 5-cm caliper, spade-dug trees have ranged from 8.3 to 13.6 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent. Equipment use at harvest was a major component of CF. Transport distance of the finished tree was also important. Knowledge of the positive impact of trees in the landscape through carbon sequestration, as well as the CF at the farm gate and planted into the landscape, can be the basis for differentiating products in the marketplace relative to such environmental issues. Management practices that minimize CF were identified and such information could be critical to purchasing decisions based on environmental issues. In marketing, product differentiation is the process of distinguishing the differences of a product from others to make it more attractive to a particular target market. This is done to demonstrate the unique aspects of the product and create a sense of value. Industry participants can utilize these CF findings in developing marketing programs for plant material targeted specifically at the consumer segments identified as environmentally conscious. This research will benefit the green industry consumer by ensuring that environmentally friendly products marketed to them in the future truly meet their sustainability needs and/or expectations.","[Ingram, D.

While some capability emerged in aquaculture and export processing, there is little evidence of indigenous manufacturing activity that meets international standards.

The FDA enables us for conducting an effective statistical analysis when number of variables exceeds number of observations. Using FDA we can effectively analyse economic data streams i.e., e.g., perform an analysis of non-equally spaced observed time series and predict of a whole future trajectory of a stream rather than iteratively predict single observations. In this paper we present and carefully study several economic applications of recently proposed clustering algorithms for functional data.

However, signalling involved in stress perception and flowering induction remains obscure. To gain insight into the mechanism involved in stress signalling, the aim of this work was to study the physiological and biochemical changes triggered by water stress and their relationship with budbreak in 'Valencia' orange (C. sinensis (L.) Osb.) and 'Ellendale' tangor (C. reticulata Bl.). Water stress was promoted by subjecting plants to 70-days of water deficit (water potential:.w <-4.0 MPa) thereby increasing photoinhibition (decreasing F-v/F-m and increasing F-o). An increase in oxidative damage was achieved. Water stress raised proline content in both cultivars and was slightly higher in 'Ellendale'. After rewatering, plants of both cultivars increased sprouting and flowering. Under these conditions, 'Valencia' trees produced 55% more flowers (160 flowers/ 100 nodes) than 'Ellendale'. This was explained by an increase in multiflowered shoots. These results suggest that Citrus flowering in response to stress conditions is variety dependent and that the active compounds that increased in response to stress such as proline, are positively correlated with flowering intensity. Overall, the intensity of oxidative damage in Citrus leaves during stress could act as an indicator of flowering intensity in each variety.","[Manzi, Matias] Univ Jaume 1, Ciencias Agr & Medio Nat, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Borsani, Omar; Diaz, Pedro] Univ Republ FAgro UdelaR, Fac Agron, Biol Vegetal, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Rivas, Fernando] Inst Nacl Invest Agr, Programa Nacl Invest Prod Citricola, Paysandu, Uruguay",Universitat Jaume I; Instituto Nacional de Investigacion Agropecuaria Uruguay (INIA),"Rivas, F (通讯作者)，Inst Nacl Invest Agr, Programa Nacl Invest Prod Citricola, Paysandu, Uruguay.",cfrivas@inia.org.uy,"Borsani, Omar/JLL-5945-2023; Manzi, Matías/AFM-4304-2022","Borsani, Omar/0000-0002-9111-5801; Manzi, Matías/0000-0002-3541-4305",,,,,30,1,1,0,3,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1243,1249,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600158,0

Although the rural area is exposed to permanent depopulation due to favourable conditions of life in the cities, there is no development strategy of rural tourism at the national level, while strategic documents are rare at the regional and local levels. Although rural tourism represents an important opportunity for (self) employment due to the fact that family members and local population work in such economies, a number of Croatian counties have almost no registered rural households engaged in tourism, including even the counties that with more than 50% of the rural inhabitants in overall population belong to the predominantly rural regions. This study examines the key strategic documents regarding rural tourism at the national level due to examination of its current state and development perspectives. In addition to the secondary data analysis, the results of semi-structured interviews are presented. Interviews were conducted in January 2015 with five representatives (owners and managers) of legal entities active in rural tourism in the Split-Dalmatia County. The market-recognized forms of rural tourism were included, while the following business aspects are reviewed: work motivation, business development, impact on the environment and the local economy, business intentions and recommendations, etc. The theoretical framework of the study is the idea of indivisibility of the micro and macro levels of society. Its relevance is confirmed by the research results as strategic documents show a poor representation of rural tourism in tourist traffic at the national level, which also applies to Split-Dalmatia County. Such a situation is particularly conditioned by weak financial and human resources of the public sector at the local level, burdening bureaucracy, poor municipal infrastructure and lack of awareness among local population about the development opportunities of rural tourism. Interviewees face these disadvantages through practice, but their permanent influence slowly alters the public institutions' actions towards strategic planning with an aim of achieving the favourable economic effects and better life quality of rural residents. Given the complementarity of the findings at the micro and macro social levels, the interview results are applicable to other micro-locations in Croatia.","[Popovic, Toni; Relja, Renata] Univ Split, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Sinjska 2, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Split,"Popovic, T (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Sinjska 2, Split 21000, Croatia.",tonpop@ffst.hr; rrelja@ffst.hr,"Relja, Renata/L-5625-2019","Relja, Renata/0000-0002-5684-4558",,,,,26,0,0,1,8,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,439,453,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100043,0

Upon reviewing the historical facts related to the cultivation and use of hemp on the territory of Europe from the Neolithic to becoming the legal means of tax payment in America in the 18th century and honouring the fact that, in the 60s, Yugoslavia was the sixth largest producer and exporter of hemp in the world and that, in those years, about 9,000 hectares of the territory of the Republic of Croatia were in hemp, the idea about developing a model that has already been tried and tested throughout history crystallized. The fact that over 25,000 different products such as biodegradable plastics, lightweight building panels and insulation materials can be derived from hemp speak in favour of this idea, as well as the fact that its natural biomass could cover the entire energy demand that is presently met by oil and that its seeds are unparalleled in their nutritional value as well as being an impressive source of minerals and vitamins. With the proposed amendments to legislative regulations relating to the cultivation of Cannabis sativa hope is slowly restored to demotivated producers who, according to the present rules and a strict procedure, may only use the seed, while destroying the stem, but the uninformed public still remains a big issue. The presentation of the thesis of, the uninformed public, which is a reflection of a long negative campaign targeted at hemp, and the confirmation of this premise via a survey conducted among the senior students of the high school and Polytechnic of Pozega, naturally lead to the idea of a comprehensive campaign. The conclusion proposes a cardinal turn in the approach to hemp through the execution of a model introducing the public to its potentials and possibilities of use, utilizing the elements of a communication mix while implementing the results of the conducted survey.","[Radic, Ivana] Pozesko Slavonska Police Adm, Minist Interior, Pozega, Croatia; [Jakobovic, Maja] Tourist Board Pozega Slavonia Cty, Pozega, Croatia; [Vincer, Robert; Ostrun, Robert] HP Dd, Zagreb, Croatia",,"Radic, I (通讯作者)，Pozesko Slavonska Police Adm, Minist Interior, Pozega, Croatia.",iradic0@gmail.com; mjakobovic@gmail.com; robert.vincer@posta.hr; robert.ostrun@posta.hr,"Radić, Ivana/F-4201-2017",,,,,,7,0,0,2,15,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,463,471,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100045,0

However, many problems including abnormal weather, poor soil conditions and incorrect cultural practices, have decreased grape production and fruit quality. Farmers and government officials in the region have failed to solve these problems by employing various cultural techniques. To address such problems, the Foundation of Agricultural Technique Commercialization & Transfer (FACT) implemented a project in 2011 and 2012. This project was conducted jointly with J&A, Inc., an agricultural product delivery company that also trains farmers and runs an education center. In 2011, the project focused on ten farms growing grapevines in Songsan-myeon, Hwaseong City. Cultural practices and storage techniques were applied by eight experts. In 2012, twelve experts helped 50 farms in Songsan-myeon and Seosin-myeon apply appropriate cultural practices and storage techniques according to different vineyard conditions. A specially designed portable hard soil breaker was used to improve poor soil drainage. Several output channels, such as a special distribution for fruit and an online shopping mall, were added to expand sales. In 2011, the grapes were highly rated and won first class twice in wholesale market auctions in Seoul. The selling prices were set 20 to 30% higher compared to other farmers' grapes. In 2012, the quality of grapes was very low due to bad weather conditions, including a long period of substantial precipitation after high temperatures. Nonetheless, the expanding delivery outlets of a special dealing company for fruit and an online shopping mall were relevant to obtain higher income. The quality of grapes produced in this project was higher compared to other farmers' grapes. The higher quality was made possible through the J& A, Inc., a company designated to select, pack, and export fruit to New Zealand. This project has been implemented with a new grape cultivar in another region using the same business model.","[Song, G.

The analysis is based on data from the financial statements of companies (joint stock companies, limited liability companies, cooperatives) in the meat processing industry. The sample of the meat processors is divided into two equal sets according to the investment activity. The investment activity is measured as the change in the long-term assets allowing for the impact of amortization and depreciation. The two sets are compared through the two-sample statistical hypotheses test. Financial indicators of profitability, liquidity, capital structure and labor productivity quantify economic differences between the two sets. The paper verifies the hypotheses that meat processors with higher investment activity have higher debt ratio, use higher public investment support and have higher profitability and labor productivity than meat processors with lower investment activity. The results show significantly higher profitability, labor productivity, turnover and liquidity with higher investment activity. The obvious link between debt ratio, public investment subsidies and investment activity was not established.","[Spicka, Jindrich] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Strategy, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Spicka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Strategy, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",jindrich.spicka@vse.cz,"Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013","Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0001-5699-9544",,,,,10,1,1,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1570,1580,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000150,0

Bulbs subject observations were stored in two types of climate: one cold, at a temperature of 8-10 degrees C and a warm one, to a temperature of 20-22 degrees C. Atmospheric humidity was 55-60% for the cold climate and 80-85% for the warm climate. Macroscopic observations showed that, if the bulbs are stored in the hot climate, there is a slight increase in size small bulbs and even the emergence of new very small bulbs. This phenomenon is not observed if the bulbs are stored in cold climates. Microscopic observations showed that, if the bulbs stored in warm climates, central bud is out of the state of latency, with a more advanced development. Cell divisions existing in the central bud formation led 1-2 vaulting shaft and the edge of the leaf primordia. If bulbs are stored in the cold climate, the central bud is still in the latent phase, the development stage is less evaluated than the central bud of the bulbs stored in warm climates.

However, there are no rigorous studies nor methodological frameworks that bring together aspects of spatial design with organisational output. - Addressing this demand, the paper presents the methodology for the living lab experiment with the so-called Innovation Shed (iSheds) - a number of small work spaces that were purposefully implemented on TU Dresden campus to probe the influence of spatial environment on knowledge work performance in the field of scientific research. Referring to research in work psychology and environmental psychology, the article discusses the theoretical background for the ongoing experiment and introduces the factors of 'sense of belonging' and 'personal control' as key influences on worker's performance, satisfaction, and commitment. Hypothesis is that factors can be directly related and influenced by architectural and environmental qualities - thus opening up a methodical path how to impact knowledge work through appropriately designed work environments.","[Wiesenhuetter, Sebastian; Lu, Jing; Noennig, Juerg R.] Tech Univ Dresden, WISSENSARCHITEKTUR Lab Knowledge Architecture, D-01062 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Wiesenhütter, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, WISSENSARCHITEKTUR Lab Knowledge Architecture, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,21,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2094,2103,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200164,0

The main aim of this study is to examine the marketplace dimension of 37 Malaysian Islamic Financial institutions for the year 2012. A content analysis of the annual and sustainability reports was employed to examine their current marketplace practices. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted to confirm the results and to clarify arising issues. The results of the content analysis revealed that the focus of disclosure for the marketplace dimension was on the stakeholder engagement activities followed by the marketing activities. The disclosure of Islamic principles and values in market-related policies was given the least attention. This suggests that the Islamic financial institutions were not strategically incorporating the Islamic principles and values into the policies related to their marketplace dimension. To a certain extent, the results of the interviews provide support for the results of the content analysis. The interviews performed revealed that the motivation for stakeholder engagement for Islamic institutions was to resolve zakat distribution issues. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Mountains, in particular, are reckoned to be particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon; therefore, several,policy measures attempt to maintain agricultural activities in mountains. In addition to the role of targeted subsidies in reducing abandonment of mountainous areas, we contend that place attachment helps explain the permanence of economic activity in these areas. By using survey data and controlling for several variables likely to influence place attachment, we investigated the relationship between place attachment and living in high or lower altitude mountains in a sample of livestock farmers in the French Southern Alps. Applying an ordered probit model, we found high-mountain farmers to be relatively more attached to their place compared to medium-mountain ones. Our findings also suggest that social relations at the family and neighborhood levels, satisfaction at work, and the distinctiveness farmers assign to a place are important factors of attachment. However, we found no significant association between place attachment and farm profitability. Several policy implications regarding agricultural abandonment and support for mountain livelihoods are derived. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study tests whether vegetarians do indeed spend less on food. A large U.S. internet survey consisting of 24,537 respondents is used to determine whether the self-reported food expenditures for vegetarians are different from their meat eating counterparts. Compared to meat eaters, results show that true vegetarians do indeed report lower food expenditures. They spend less partly due to the foods they eat and partly due to different demographics. We also find that some individuals self-identify as vegetarians even though they sometimes eat or buy meat, and this category of consumer spends more money on food than meat eaters. This demonstrates that there are at least two different types of self-identified vegetarians. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Lusk, Jayson L.; Norwood, F.

A survey was conducted among recreational users of the bay of Saint-Brieuc, where an offshore wind farm is currently planned. The goal is to identify the preferences of the bay's users with respect to various compensation possibilities: monetary compensation, investment in publicly owned assets, or the ecological restoration. Two multinomial logit (MNL) models and a latent class (LC) model are used to explore the preferences and some sources of heterogeneity within the community. The results of this study show that form of compensation is an important determinant of preferences and has an effect on the acceptability towards the compensation principle. More precisely, results shows that compensation is better accepted if it obeys the principle of strong sustainability, which includes ecological restoration for the gain of the population as a whole and which excludes monetary transactions, associated with the bribe effect. The study also highlights the naturalists' specific attitude for who compensation should be determined within a regulatory framework, one which imposes compensatory measures related to objectively determined ecological impacts.

However, the risk of implementing unilateral policies is that distortive effects are generated at the global scale affecting world energy prices, international competitiveness and the geographical allocation of carbon intensive production processes. Using a dynamic CGE model, we assess the rate of carbon leakage and adverse impacts on competitiveness in a number of scenarios over the period 2010-2050. According to the model results, we highlight two major issues. First, in the case of a unilateral EU climate policy, carbon leakage and negative effects on competitiveness are quite serious. Anti-leakage measures can only mitigate leakage and adverse economic impacts on competitiveness in a limited way.

This article provides a framework as well as a decision support process and tool that could guide such an approach. In this process, identifying costs and benefits of mitigation is a first step in deciding on measures and enabling instruments, which has to be accompanied by analyses regarding distributional effects (i.e. who gains or loses) related to different targets and policy instruments. As there are risks of future irreversible regime shifts and even system collapses, the assessments have to be broadened to include scenarios on possible future developments as well as ethical considerations. In particular, a deeper sustainable management strategy may be needed to respond to possible future increases in the rate of environmental change, amongst growing evidence of external pressures, interactions and non-linear dynamics. This adaptive management strategy should focus on building the resilience required to cope with and adapt to change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The IMO rules related to reduction in greenhouse gas emissions can be divided into two types: technical and operational measures; and market-based measures. As to the former, important regulations have been adopted that are mandatory for ships irrespective of their flag. The latter are still in the drafting process, and in view of deep divisions between member states, it will be difficult to reach early agreement. In the development of rules for emissions reduction in IMO, the common but differentiated responsibility principle (CBDR) conflicts severely with the non-discrimination principle which has long been a traditional and basic principle of IMO regulation. Considering the peculiarities of the shipping industry, a fuller understanding of CBDR will be necessary in order to find a reasonable and feasible way to reconcile these two principles.","[Zhang, Hui] Wuhan Univ, Sch Law, Wuhan 430072, Hubei Province, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hui] Wuhan Univ, Inst Int Law, Wuhan 430072, Hubei Province, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Wuhan University,"Zhang, H (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Sch Law, Wuhan 430072, Hubei Province, Peoples R China.;Zhang, H (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Inst Int Law, Wuhan 430072, Hubei Province, Peoples R China.",fxyzh@whu.edu.cn,,,National Social Sciences Fund of China [12CFX095]; Key Research Institutes Project of China Ministry of Education [14JJD820003],National Social Sciences Fund of China; Key Research Institutes Project of China Ministry of Education,The article is part of research project sponsored by the National Social Sciences Fund of China (Project No. 12CFX095) and the Key Research Institutes Project of China Ministry of Education (Project No. 14JJD820003).,,42,11,12,1,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The matrix was projected to its 2050 counterpart using capital and labour growth projections. The forest-generated carbon offset sources considered were afforested set-asides, commercial forestry intensification and harvested wood products. A new dataset on regional afforestation carbon uptake rates and costs was used to include afforested set-asides as latent activities. For a carbon offset price of $20/MT CO2, 12% of U.S. annual emissions could be sequestered in 2050. More than half of the additional carbon sequestered (611 million MT CO2), compared to the 2050 baseline, would be attributed to set-asides and composed mainly of softwood forests. High carbon prices would increase land prices resulting in the diversion of 15% and 8% of pasture and cropland to carbon set-asides, respectively, mainly in the Central Plains. The high agricultural land diversion would force activities to intensify production systems driving the prices of beef up by 14% as well as oilseeds and grains by 3% and 4%, respectively.

In the past any diversion from unquestioned optimism was interpreted as a bad sign and attributed to the public's ignorance. Today it is often welcomed as a sign of an increasingly emancipated public. In the sustainability sciences, including Ecological Economics, attitudes towards technology also cover a wide spectrum, the formalisation and exploration of which are the goals of this paper. Drawing on social and philosophical studies of technology and insights from Ecological Economics and related fields, we develop a framework of attitudes towards technology consisting of four main categories: Enthusiasm, Determinism, Romanticism and Scepticism. We illustrate the empirical relevance of our framework with a qualitative content analysis of Ecological Economics lecture material. The analysis uncovered and mapped a diversity of views, which co-exist without an open debate. It suggests difficulties of scholars to consistently articulate their techno-attitudes, except for enthusiasm. Our framework could help to amplify underlying vocabularies and visions of research and teaching in Ecological Economics and beyond. It could be applied in both deeper qualitative and broader quantitative analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In Australia, farmers can gain carbon credits for sequestering carbon or reducing emissions. In addition to mitigation, these 'carbon farming' activities often generate ancillary (co-)benefits, such as creating native habitat or preventing erosion. This paper presents results of an Australia-wide choice experiment, conducted to estimate community values for climate change mitigation and the cobenefits of carbon farming. Values for carbon farming benefits are shown to depend on respondent's opinions about climate change. Respondents who do not believe that climate change is happening have a lower willingness to pay for reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions than people who believe climate change is (at least partly) caused by human actions. On average, respondents were willing to pay $1.13/Mt of CO2-e reduction. Respondents were willing to pay around $19/ha increase in the area of native vegetation on farmland. Value estimates for reducing soil erosion were not significant. Our results demonstrate that the community benefits from carbon farming extend beyond their effects on climate change mitigation. Future policies should take these positive values for cobenefits into account. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Kragt, M. E.; Gibson, F.

Previous attempts to answer this question have focused on static measures of the weight of trade in the aggregate economy at a given point in time, or on the comparison of the income of specific imperial nations just before and after the loss of their overseas empire. These static accounting approaches are inappropriate if dynamic and spillover effects are at work, as seems likely. In this paper, I use a panel dataset of 10 countries in a dynamic model that allows for spillover effects, multiple channels of causality, persistence, and country-specific fixed effects. Using this dynamic model, simulations suggest that in the counterfactual absence of intercontinental trade, rates of early modern economic growth and urbanization would have been moderately to substantially lower. For the four main long-distance traders, by 1800, the real wage was, depending on the country, 6.1-22.7 % higher, and urbanization was 4.0-11.7 percentage points higher, than they would have otherwise been. For some countries, the effect was quite pronounced: in The Netherlands between 1600 and 1750, for instance, intercontinental trade was responsible for most of the observed increase in real wages and for a large share of the observed increase in urbanization. At the same time, countries which did not engage in long-distance trade would have had real wage increases in the order of 5.4-17.8 % and urbanization increases of 2.2-3.2 percentage points, should they have done so at the same level as the four main traders.

We suggest and explore a conceptual framework in which economic gains can be maximized when production activities are specialized at increasingly broader scales (from the household to the village, region or above), particularly when markets for outputs and inputs function well. Conversely, more specialization likely reduces biodiversity and significantly limits ecosystem functions. When agricultural specialization increases and moves to broader scales as a result of improved infrastructure and markets or other drivers, ecosystem functions can also be endangered at broader spatial scales. Policies to improve agricultural incomes may influence the level of specialization at different scales and thus affect the severity of the trade-offs. This paper takes iambi province in Indonesia, a current hotspot of rubber and oil palm monoculture, as a case study to illustrate these issues. We empirically show that the level of specialization differs across scales with higher specialization at household and village levels and higher diversification towards the province level. We discuss ways to resolve trade-offs between economic gains and ecological costs, including landscape design, targeted policies, and adoption of long-term perspectives. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach - Specifically, both a quantitative and a qualitative review of the results were carried out. Findings - It was revealed that the biggest ratio of non-conformities was recorded within the frame of ELOT 1416 standard (Greek scheme for the certification of HACCP Management Systems), or ELOT 1416 and ISO 9001 where a combination of standards was used. The highest ratio of observations was recorded against ELOT 1416 when used in combination with ISO 9001. The highest average of non-conformities per audit was recorded in meat (red meat and poultry) companies. With regards to the observations recorded, the highest average per audit was recorded in companies processing eggs. Considering the number of workers, the highest average of non-conformities per audit was observed in small companies. Research limitations/implications - The limitations of the present study can be summarized into the fact that although a high number of audit reports were taken into account, an audit is an observation of the condition of a company on the day of the audit and the results can also be highly dependent on the skills of the auditors. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge this is the first paper that analyses a high number of audit reports from Greek food companies and its conclusions can be of significant value to both the auditors and the industry enabling a more focused approach in the conduction of audits and implementation of the standards.","[Arvanitoyannis, Ioannis S.; Samourelis, Konstantinos] Hellen Open Univ, Sch Technol Sci, Patras, Greece; [Arvanitoyannis, Ioannis S.; Kotsanopoulos, Konstantinos V.] Univ Thessaly, Dept Agr Ichthyol & Aquat Environm, Volos, Greece",Hellenic Open University; University of Thessaly,"Kotsanopoulos, KV (通讯作者)，Univ Thessaly, Dept Agr Ichthyol & Aquat Environm, Volos, Greece.",kostaskot@yahoo.gr,,,,,,,33,5,6,0,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

A methodology is proposed in which the supply as well as the demand for housing depends on the intangible. The methodology is applied to value access to the Trans-Israel Highway (TIH). Using spatial panel data (2002-2008) we show that TIH had two effects on the housing market. It increased house prices in locations with greater access to TIH, and it affected housing construction. Standard hedonic pricing would have underestimated the value of access because it ignores the effects of housing construction on the intangible to be priced.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors study how novel biotechnological inventions are utilized within Atlantic salmon aquaculture. The authors compare the findings with the historical development path of invention and innovation in the plant sector, and explore parallels and dissimilarities between the plant breeding sector and Atlantic salmon aquaculture. Findings - The innovation capacity within Atlantic salmon aquaculture is distinct from the plant sector, but nonetheless likely to become equifinal. Similar to plants, the female fecundity of salmon is high. Hybridization, which is an effective mechanism for protection of investments in high fecundity organisms, is less effective in salmon farming because the genetic variability is higher in salmon. Hybridization provides plant breeders with significant power over grow-out farmers. The development path in Atlantic salmon sector is distinctively dissimilar from plants, but salmon farmers nonetheless appear to move toward the structural configurations that are parallel to the plant sector. The significance of new breeding technologies in Atlantic salmon farming ascends, and will play an increasingly important role in the further development of this industry. Research limitations/implications - The study contributes to the prevailing knowledge of how inventions and innovations influence the future development of the Atlantic salmon industry. Originality/value - Biotechnological inventions are evolving within aquaculture. So far, the implications of novel biotechnological possibilities for the Atlantic salmon sector have been underanalyzed.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the main attributes of the coffee industry supply chain that deals with high-specification products. Coffee may be included in this category of consumption goods that has increasing importance at consumption level around the world. Several groups of high-quality food products such as wine, coffee, spirits and cheese seem to have a very similar supply chain. Design/methodology/approach - This study was based on multiple case studies. Three research techniques were used in the investigation: secondary data analysis, direct observations and interviews with coffee company's managers and experts. The within-case and the cross-case analyses made it possible to find the main attributes of a high-specification product supply chain. Findings - The cases studies pointed out differences between the two groups of coffee shops in relation to their supply chain strategies. The first group can be called Independent Coffee Shops, since they are focussed on the coffee preparation business. The second group can be called Integrated Coffee Shops, due to the fact that these organizations are responsible to manufacturing activities in addition to the coffee preparation activities. Despite this supply chain configuration difference, both groups have a similar perception about their role for the final consumer, to provide a premium experience with coffee. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation of this research comes from the fact it was possible to interview only one person in each organization. Only the commercialization of the supply chain was analyzed, if the agricultural production was also analyzed, this paper could have broader implications. Originality/value - The results of this research show the configuration of a supply chain that handles a high-specification product. They are set to transform the trade of a product that has a component of volatility in its quality attributes into a trade of a product that embodies all the desirable attributes preferred by a specific group of costumers. The logic of a supply chain that deals with commodities is different, since in most of the cases it will try to accommodate the variations on quality that comes from nature. This paper describes the market based strategy of 12 organizations and their supply chain configuration in order to offer a premium product.","[Carvalho, Jose Marcio] Univ Brasilia, FACE, Dept Adm, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Paiva, Ely Laureano] Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Escola Adm Empresas Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Vieira, Luciana Marques] Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Sch Business, Sao Leopoldo, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia; Escola de Pos-Graduacao em Economia (EPGE); Getulio Vargas Foundation; Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (Unisinos),"Carvalho, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, FACE, Dept Adm, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",jmcarvalho1708@gmail.com,"CARVALHO, JOSE MARCIO/AAI-6440-2020; Vieira, Luciana m/GQH-9657-2022; Vieira, Luciana Marques/ABA-2328-2021; Vieira, Luciana Marques/E-4342-2010; Paiva, Ely/G-9494-2012","Vieira, Luciana m/0000-0002-3996-0901; Vieira, Luciana Marques/0000-0002-3996-0901; Paiva, Ely/0000-0003-1203-0584",,,,,42,26,29,1,60,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In this paper, we qualify this view focusing on the role of speculation. Our research is based on a nonlinear heterogeneous agents model which posits the existence of two categories of speculators, feedback traders and fundamentalists, who react (differently) to deviations of market prices from their fundamental value. The analysis is based on original data drawn from the online archives of The Times and on an historical description of the working of a staple commodity market. The empirical findings allow us to conclude that whereas feedback traders tend to herd, fundamentalists are more affected by risk aversion and react but slowly to the underpricing/overpricing of the cotton contracts. As expected, the presence of fundamentalists stabilizes the market even if, at least in the time period under investigation, the behavior of feedback traders is the major driver of short-run price dynamics.","[Cifarelli, Giulio] Univ Florence, Florence, Italy; [Paesani, Paolo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy",University of Florence; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Paesani, P (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.",giulio.cifarelli@unifi.it; paolo.paesani@uniroma2.it,,"Cifarelli, Giulio/0000-0002-4981-1619",,,,,43,5,5,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2016,10.0,1,,,,,31,54,,10.1007/s11698-014-0121-y,0.0,,,24,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,DA1EJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367538800003,0

However, developing countries and/or transitioning economies do not have sufficient experience to apply GIs. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate ways to implement GI in domestic markets in countries in which there are no common logo and control/tracking systems to help GI holders manage the process. Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a qualitative case study to describe a process to implement GI registered food products in domestic markets. The system was developed by the author and applied by the Gemlik Commodity Exchange (GTB). Findings - A registration system that allows inspection of producers in GI limits should be established. For good practice and to ensure correct registration, an efficient, established control system, promotion, and conservancy of GI-holding organizations are essential. Practical implications - GTB implemented two projects, for which a GI logo and labels with quick-response (QR) codes were created. A regional, GI promotion project was conducted, and after one year, there was no increase in consumer demand, but entering markets became easier, and traders of PDO products began to experience increases in orders and/or shortening of intervals. Long-term implications of the system could not be measured since one year had passed.

The aim of the study is to compare approaches used both by the Northern and Southern Cyprus producers to market their traditional cheese on export markets. The results show that both parts of the island have agreed on the recipe of the hellim / halloumi cheese. Currently, the Southern Cyprus has double the capacity to produce, and the price on the export markets is 40% higher. The main export markets and marketing strategies used by the two parts of the divided island are very different, thus, the author concludes that the Southern and the Northern Cyprus are not direct competitors when it comes to exporting and marketing their traditional cheese and can obtain geographical indications together, as it would benefit both.","[Garanti, Zanete] Cyprus Int Univ, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Garanti, Zanete] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia",Cyprus International University; Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Garanti, Z (通讯作者)，Cyprus Int Univ, Nicosia, Cyprus.;Garanti, Z (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia.",,"Garanti, Zanete/AAD-7201-2021; Garanti, Zanete/JNS-9092-2023; Garanti, Zanete/D-7696-2018","Garanti, Zanete/0000-0001-9990-8788;",,,,,19,0,0,1,5,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-225-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,43.0,,,,,,134,142,,,,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG7FN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253200016,0

The case study approach allows analysis of innovation and cooperation within rural societies while considering their contextual conditions. Findings - The case study goes back to an initiative begun in 2011. Stakeholders from Nepal were connected to five Austrian distributors and nine German distributors selling their products in Austria and Germany. In total, about 600 Nepalese farmers are cultivating on average less than 1 ha of agricultural land each. A German entrepreneur founded the first Demeter farm in Nepal and founded an ethical business in Nepal to cooperate with the farmers there. The University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU) acted as a knowledge broker. The whole initiative followed the Triple Helix concept. Research limitations/implications - The study shows qualitative results out of an individual initiative. The findings are of a qualitative nature, they are not necessarily transferable to comparable cases. The outcome has to be interpreted as hypotheses, further research activities are required for broader application.

Design/methodology/approach - The study was conducted after the conception and experimentation of a model (called SObER), the fruit of detailed studies of experiential marketing (Schmitt, 1999a, b). The model was tested using the user-based focus group technique (Mich, 2007) and verified with reference to certain consortia brands considered to reflect best practices in communication of the brand-land connection. Findings - The analysis made it possible to identify the key elements for expressing both the experiential dimension and the brand-land relationship of traditional agrofood products, ensuring their effective online communication. Research limitations/implications - Although the research uses a benchmarking technique, it focuses on specific case studies; thus, the outcomes can be generalised by means of an extension of the analysis. Originality/value - The value of the analysis carried out lies in the creation of a model aimed at the assessment of agrofood products and, more generally, their link with the territory of origin in the online context. In addition, the marketing literature on the experiential dimension applied to website tools is still limited. For this reason, this work may stimulate future in-depth analysis with reference to the proposed model.","[Iaia, Lea; Maizza, Amedeo; Fait, Monica; Scorrano, Paola] Univ Salento, Dept Econ Sci, Lecce, Italy",University of Salento,"Iaia, L (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Econ Sci, Lecce, Italy.",lea.iaia@unisalento.it,"Iaia, Lea/R-4911-2019; Fait, Monica/AAA-4283-2020; scorrano, paola/N-6534-2015","Iaia, Lea/0000-0003-4650-1233; Fait, Monica/0000-0003-2448-3839; scorrano, paola/0000-0002-7964-9931",,,,,67,16,16,2,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A 2x3 between subjects factorial design was used to manipulate the type of GI, namely, protected designation of origin vs protected geographical indication, and the region of origin presentation in the advertisement (absent vs pictorial vs pictorial-textual), while measuring participant brand attitude and intention to buy (dependent variables). Findings - Results show a significant main effect of the region of origin presentation on brand attitude and purchase intention. Communicating the region of origin through pictorial cues leads to more favourable responses than when there is no reference to it in the advertisement. The presentation of the region of origin through pictorial-textual cues leads to more positive responses than communication based just on pictorial cues. No interaction effect between the type of GI and the region of origin presentation is found. Originality/value - The study makes a new contribution in the field of communication about typical food products, since the ability of the geographical area to increase consumers' purchase intention has not been systematically tested in an advertising context. To date, there is no strong evidence on how effective it is to convey the values of the geographical area through its picture and/or name. On a practical level, the study supports new communication strategies for typical food products in a context where messages tend to use intrinsic advertising cues that emphasize physical product attributes, rather than extrinsic advertising cues that leverage intangible product values.","[Luceri, Beatrice; Latusi, Sabrina; Zerbini, Cristina] Univ Parma, Dept Econ, Parma, Italy",University of Parma,"Zerbini, C (通讯作者)，Univ Parma, Dept Econ, Parma, Italy.",cristina.zerbini@nemo.unipr.it,"Zerbini, Cristina/AAX-5821-2021","Zerbini, Cristina/0000-0002-0685-6411; Latusi, Sabrina/0000-0002-3937-1883; Luceri, Beatrice/0000-0002-5549-2423",,,,,54,19,19,7,51,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In practice, however, it can be difficult for packaging developers to strike a balance between all the different environmental requirements on packaging, and trade-offs are common. Life cycle assessment (LCA) can provide this type of information, but many food companies lack the time and resources to conduct detailed assessments. The purpose of this paper is to provide prioritization guidelines for food GPD based on a systematic review of food LCAs. Design/methodology/approach - As basis for the suggested guidelines, 48 food LCAs covering eight types of food were reviewed following a standardized format. The review consisted of a quantitative analysis of the global warming potential results and a qualitative analysis of the LCAs' conclusions. Findings - The prioritization guidelines propose three priority areas for food GPD that companies can select from based on product characteristics. They also provide suggestions for improving packaging in the three priority areas.

Design/methodology/approach - Cross-sectional study analyzing the ingredients list, nutrition facts and nutrition claims on food labels. Subjects: all processed food products with added salt or additives containing sodium that were for sale in a large supermarket in Brazil from October to December 2011. Findings - All 3,449 products were analyzed and categorized into 66 groups according to Brazilian legislation. The median of sodium content in the AR was 42.7 percent higher than in the C (p = 0.007). In 33.3 percent of the groups there was difference in sodium content between AR and C (p<0.05) and in 68.2 percent of these the sodium content was higher in AR. The variation range of sodium in products from the same group reached 2,905.0 mg in C and 1,712.0 mg in AR. Even when the median of sodium was lower in the AR, the minimum sodium values were lower in the C. Originality/value - Comparisons of sodium content of conventional and AR processed food are scarce in the literature, especially covering all food for sale in a large supermarket.

The first stage is constrained by the level of non-performing loans produced in a preceding period. In the second stage, the bank managers use the first stage intermediate outputs to produce desirable outputs of loans and securities investments and an undesirable output of non-performing loans. The dynamic framework allows resources to be allocated over time to maximize the production of desirable outputs and simultaneously minimize the production of undesirable outputs.","[Fukuyama, Hirofumi] Fukuoka Univ, Fac Commerce, Jonan Ku, Fukuoka 8140180, Japan; [Weber, William L.] SE Missouri State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Cape Girardeau, MO 63701 USA",Fukuoka University,"Fukuyama, H (通讯作者)，Fukuoka Univ, Fac Commerce, Jonan Ku, 8-19-1 Nanakuma, Fukuoka 8140180, Japan.",fukuyama@fukuoka-u.ac.jp; wlweber@semo.edu,"Fukuyama, Hirofumi/J-3294-2012","Fukuyama, Hirofumi/0000-0002-8133-6299",[23510165]; [25282090],;,"We are grateful for the helpful and insightful suggestions of Rolf Fare, Robin Sickles and Kazuyuki Sekitani and two anonymous reviewers.

This paper studies the implications of employing such a democratic product design (DPD). A linear city model is used with random locations to capture uncertainty about consumer preferences and to study strategic forces in monopoly and duopoly settings. The results indicate that a monopolist will use market research to resolve the demand uncertainty, unless DPD provides a cost advantage. In a duopoly, an asymmetric equilibrium emerges with exactly one firm using DPD. Commitment to following consumer votes proves to be a strategic advantage, therefore at least one firm promises not to deviate from the product design consumers voted for. A subtle way to influence the outcome of the vote for firms is to generate product candidates instead of soliciting ideas from consumers. Employing such a tactic allows firms to differentiate and they will be more likely to use DPD. Finally, the paper studies the level of consumer engagement in DPD and shows that a monopolist always benefits from a higher positive engagement and is hurt by negative engagement, although to a lesser extent. The results are reversed for a duopolist as negative sentiments can serve as an additional differentiator.","[Katona, Zsolt] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Katona, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",zskatona@haas.berkeley.edu,,,,,,,46,5,6,1,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

Although economic valuations of biological pest control in agriculture show an impressive cost savings from this ecosystem service, no direct estimate of the value of biodiversity for biological control has been attempted. We apply a basic microeconomic model for estimating the value of changes in the richness of arthropod natural enemies or in functional diversity for biological pest control for two sample crops using experimental results reported in the ecological literature. Market-based outcomes were driven by changes in crop yields associated with experimental reductions in natural enemy species richness, and modified by supply shifts and price elasticities. We show how our simple model differs from common approaches used in the ecological literature, and explain why this alternative model more accurately estimates societal well-being for consumers and producers participating in these crop markets. We conclude by discussing the additional research and data needed to make economic valuation of ecosystem services in agricultural settings more feasible, rigorous, and realistic in the future.

I create an individual-level data set with exogenous variation in ad exposure and its spacing by running online field experiments. Using this data set, I first show that (1) ads significantly increase the likelihood of the consumers purchasing from the advertiser and (2) this increase carries over to future purchase occasions. Importantly, I also find evidence for the spacing effect: the likelihood of a product's purchase increases if it's ads are spread apart rather than bunched together, even if spreading apart involves shifting some ads away from the purchase occasion. Accounting for the spacing effect is important to detect the effects of repeated advertising. Because the traditional models of advertising do not explain the data patterns, I build a new memory-based model of how advertising influences consumer behavior. Using a nested test, I reject the restrictions imposed by the canonical goodwill stock model (Nerlove and Arrow, Economica, 29(114):129-142, 1962), in favor of the memory-based model I propose. Additionally, I use the estimated parameters to simulate counterfactual scenarios and show that the advertisers' profits might be lower if the features of the memory model are not accounted for.","Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Sahni, NS (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nsahni1@stanford.edu,,,,,,,58,49,68,7,62,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

We find that both capital and voting rights were diffuse by modern-day standards. However, this does not necessarily mean that there was a modern-style separation of ownership from control in Victorian Britain. One major implication of our findings is that diffuse ownership was present in the UK much earlier than previously thought, and given that it occurred in an era with weak shareholder protection law, it somewhat undermines the influential law and finance hypothesis. We also find that diffuse ownership is correlated with large boards, a London head office, non-linear voting rights, and shares traded on multiple markets.","[Acheson, Graeme G.] Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Campbell, Gareth; Turner, John D.] Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Univ Management Sch, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Vanteeva, Nadia] I Shou Univ, Dept Int Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",University of Stirling; Queens University Belfast; I Shou University,"Acheson, GG (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",,,"Acheson, Graeme/0000-0001-7531-2082",Leverhulme Trust [F/00203/Z],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"Thanks to the Leverhulme Trust (grant no.

Using a parametric input distance function we estimate and decompose the Malmquist productivity indexes in line with Fuentes et al. (J Product Anal 15:79-94, 2001) and Atkinson (J Bus Econ Stat 21:284-294, 2003). The adopted model is a mixed-effects model with department-specific fixed effects and random time trends. An autoregressive stochastic term is used to model inefficiency shocks with gradual dissipation by adaptation and learning. The results indicate a negative trend in Malmquist index starting from 2002, with an average rate of about 1 % per year. However, our analysis of scale effects indicates that this decline is more or less offset by universities' constant expansion and the resulting economies of scale. The results point to various patterns of overall productivity change across scientific fields that are closely related to potential productivity gains due to scale economies.

We empirically investigate how the amount of discretionary time that individuals have at their disposal influences both what type of sustainable consumption practices they adopt and the size of this value-action gap. We contend that discretionary time has a twofold effect. Given fixed preferences, time-poor individuals tend to satisfy their preferences by adopting sustainable consumption practices that require relatively less time. Moreover, a lack of discretionary time also inhibits agents from developing preferences that actually reflect their underlying environmental concerns. Our findings support both of these hypotheses and suggest that increasing discretionary time is associated with significant reductions in the value-action gap. This suggest that policies which increase discretionary time, such as measures to improve the work-life balance, may thus help in fostering the emergence of pro-environmental preferences among consumers in the long run.

Ecuador is a resource-rich periphery country that has moved after 2007 from a neoliberal to a post-neoliberal policy regime. By analyzing 64 socio-environmental resistance cases in the period 1980-2013, we focus on the continuities and changes in the relationship between environmental dispossession and resistance under the two regimes. We find that while resistance to agri-food projects has diminished, having enjoyed some success under during the post-neoliberal regime, resistance to infrastructure and mineral extraction projects has remained steady, with the impacts from environmental dispossession remaining much like those observed before 2007. At the same time, major social investments financed through natural resource extraction and export, combined with the introduction of constraints on the media and public assembly, have created a political climate in which the resistance observed during the neo-liberal period is now a socially deviant behavior.

Price-based MBIs are considered attractive to landholders, who are provided with financial payments for the delivery of defined ecological outcomes on their land, and for policy-making, where ecological return on investment can be measured quantitatively. Consequently, MBIs are commonly used to promote competitive, individualized approaches to improve ecological values, framed around the property-scale. We are concerned that there is a tension between the property-centric focus of price-based MBI programs and the need for environmental management policy and practice to reflect landscape-scale social-ecological processes. Targeting MBI programs at individual properties could risk generating insufficient public good conservation benefits, if those programs fail to reflect the relationship between landscape-scale processes and property-scale conservation efforts. To remedy the neglect of the landscape scale in private land conservation MBI policy, we develop a definition of stewardship that directly connects landscape-scale ecological function to the 'public good' dimension of stewardship. We apply this over-arching definition to demonstrate how MBI programs can deliver on the goal of landscape-scale conservation, and to suggest when MBIs might not be well suited to achieving private land conservation objectives.

These policy tools are often based on the insight that rational actors perfectly weigh the costs and benefits of adopting certain behaviors and well-crafted economic incentives and disincentives will lead to socially desirable development scenarios. This rationalist mode of thought has provided interesting insights and results, but it also misestimates the context by which 'real individuals' come to decisions, and the multitude of factors influencing development sequences. In this study, our goal is to examine how these policies can take advantage of some unintended behavioral reactions that might in return impact, either positively or negatively, general policy performances. We test the effect of income's origin ('Low effort' based money vs. 'High effort' based money) on spending decisions (Necessity vs. Superior goods) and subsequent pro social preferences (Future pro-environmental behavior) within Madagascar rural areas, using a natural field experiment. Our results show that money obtained under low effort leads to different consumption patterns than money obtained under high efforts: superior goods are more salient in the case of low effort money. In parallel, money obtained under low effort leads to subsequent higher pro social behavior. Compensation and rewards policies for ecosystem services may mobilize knowledge on behavioral biases to improve their design and foster positive spillovers on their development goals.

First, does clinic quality evolve over time? Second, does the quality of reporting clinics converge to a common standard? Third, how persistent are provider quality rankings across time? Since current methods of public reporting rely on historic data, measures of clinic quality are most informative if relative clinic performance is persistent across time. We use data from the Minnesota Community Measurement spanning 2007-2012. We employ seemingly- unrelated regression to measure quality improvement conditional upon cohort effects and changes in quality metrics. Basic autoregressive models are used to measure quality persistence. There were striking differences in initial quality across cohorts of clinics and early-reporting cohorts maintained higher quality in all years. This suggests that consumers can infer, on average, that non-reporting clinics have poorer quality than reporting clinics. Average quality, however, improves slowly in all cohorts and quality dispersion declines over time both within and across cohorts. Relative clinic quality is highly persistent year-to-year, suggesting that publicly-reported measures can inform consumers in choice of clinics, even though they represent measured quality for a previous time period. Finally, definition changes in measures can make it difficult to draw appropriate inferences from longitudinal public reports data.","[McCullough, Jeffrey S.; Crespin, Daniel J.; Abraham, Jean M.; Christianson, Jon B.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Policy & Management, 420 Delaware St SE,MMC 729, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Finch, Michael] Finch & King, Minneapolis, MN 55419 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"McCullough, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Policy & Management, 420 Delaware St SE,MMC 729, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",mccu0056@umn.edu,"Finch, Michael/AAN-7772-2021","Finch, Michael/0000-0001-7770-1102",Robert Wood Johnson Foundation through Aligning Forces for Quality Evaluation Project,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation through Aligning Forces for Quality Evaluation Project,We gratefully acknowledge the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for funding this research through the Aligning Forces for Quality Evaluation Project.

Indeed, the analysis focuses on the general trends in the energy, land, and water resource as well as material consumption. The cases of decoupling across the EU Member States are presented in the paper in order to disentangle the linkages between economic activity and resource use. The research relies on the WIOD data for 1995-2009. In general, it can be concluded that energy and land were those inputs (production factors) which have been used in the most sustainable way if opposed to the remaining inputs covered in this study.","[Balezentis, Tomas] Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Makuteniene, Daiva] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Ringaudai, Lithuania",Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics; Vytautas Magnus University,"Balezentis, T (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania.",tomas@laei.lt,"Balezentis, Tomas/D-8609-2015","Balezentis, Tomas/0000-0002-3906-1711",,,,,10,0,0,0,2,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-187-6,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2015,,37,,,,,45,53,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BD3PQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360011300004,0

One of the ways in which it can radically be improved is through the use of various rationalizations of business aspects (technical, economic, personnel). The key point in the overall organizational rationalization of work is constituted by the human resources realization of work which enables and facilitates overall rationalization of work in the organization. The human resources rationalization pertains to: a) technical solutions which include workplace design, calculation of optimal number and quality of employees, remediation of surpluses and deficits and similar technical solutions that are related to human resources, which is generally well-known in a discipline of human resources management and pertains to the so-called technical or hard human resources rationalization, b) human resources rationalization in the sense of rationalization of each separate work and people management (leadership) which is less known and applicable, and they pertain to the so-called psychosocial or soft human resources rationalization of work which is primarily the rationalization of personal work and management of people in an organization. This paper explicates soft human rationalization of work, namely, the rationalization in the part of personal efficiency at workplace and management of people in business organizations through its basic three forms: a) work rationalization at an individual level; b) work rationalization at a group/team level; c) work rationalization on the cultural level. Also, in this work, foundational possibilities are mentioned about how can and how should the soft rationalization of work be implemented based on the mentioned shapes of manifestation: individual, group/team and cultural level. By applying the mentioned soft human resources rationalizations one may revolutionize organizational effectiveness, which is a necessary supplement to hard technical rationalization of human resources management.","[Bogdanovic, Mario] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split, Croatia; [Cingula, Domagoj] Vadea Doo Varazdin, Varazhdin, Croatia; [Marijan, Matko] ABK Doo, Benkovac, Croatia",University of Split,"Bogdanovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split, Croatia.",mario.bogdanovic@efst.hr; dcingula@esd-conference.com; matkomarijan@yahoo.com,"Bogdanović, Mario/F-7984-2017; Cingula, Domagoj/GZL-5400-2022","Bogdanović, Mario/0000-0003-3049-5342;",,,,,13,1,1,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2015,,,,,,,281,290,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450589500030,0

Design/methodology/approach - Plantain (Musa paradisiaca L.) samples were peeled, sliced into 3 mm slices, blanched at 70 degrees C for 3 min and dried. The slices were deep fried at 180 degrees C for different times. Findings - There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the moisture loss rate and the crispiness of the crisps produced using PO and CO. Significant differences (p < 0.05) existed in the fat uptake and color properties of the crisps fried in the two oils. PO fried crisps absorbed 15 percent less oil in the unripe crisps samples and 21 percent less oil in the fully ripened crisps than CO. The browning index showed that the PO crisps had greater color changes than the crisps fried using CO. The difference between the crisps from 50:50 blends of PO: CO and CO was not statistically significant, while 70:30 blends improved the qualities of the crisps better than CO alone. Analysis of kinetics data showed that moisture loss, oil uptake and browning index followed a first-order kinetics model. Originality/value - Understanding the interactions between ripening and processing methods is enhanced and use of crude PO for industrial deep-fat frying is encouraged.","[Mba, Ogan I.; Dumont, Marie-Josee; Ngadi, Michael] McGill Univ, Bioresource Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University,"Ngadi, M (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Bioresource Engn, Macdonald Campus, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",michael.ngadi@mcgill.ca,,"Mba, Ogan I./0000-0002-8047-7196",,,,,45,8,9,1,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

To date most research has been confined to processed foods. This approach fails to include the foodservice industry and its impact on population health. The purpose of this paper is to understand perceptions of what responsibility, if any, these professionals felt they had within the public health agenda. International comparisons were made to assess whether previous reductions of salt intake among UK adults was attributable to groundswell attitudinal changes at the chef/manager level, which US counterparts may not have embraced. Design/methodology/approach - This study took the qualitative approach of phenomenology as the research strategy to explore prevailing perceptions of the role and responsibility of food service regarding salt intake. Chefs and managers who deal directly with consumers were given in-depth semi-structured interviews designed to reveal the underlying themes that inform the participant's perceptions of added salt. Findings - Major findings from both the USA and UK indicate that ground-level chef/managers do not feel a social responsibility to limit public salt consumption. Chef/managers of both countries exhibited little nutritional understanding of the health impacts of salt intake and strong reluctance to make any reductions in salt use in their daily operations. The participants cite a lack of consumer interest and the fear that any salt adjustment would change the food's sensory acceptability putting them at a competitive disadvantage. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge this is the first study to examine professional foodservice personnel's perceptions and knowledge of salt intake and the public health perspective.","[Murray, Douglas W.; Feldman, Charles H.; Mahadevan, Meena] Montclair State Univ, Dept Hlth & Nutr Sci, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA; [Hartwell, Heather] Bournemouth Univ, Dept Hospitality Management, Bournemouth, Dorset, England",Montclair State University; Bournemouth University,"Murray, DW (通讯作者)，Montclair State Univ, Dept Hlth & Nutr Sci, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA.",murraydo@mail.montclair.edu,,"feldman, charles/0000-0002-1742-7831",,,,,37,8,9,0,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze product, retailer, and individual factors from the private label brand that influence consumers' loyalty and purchase intention; along with the influence of the manufacturer identification on the product package on purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach - A structural equation model is run on a sample of 362 consumers, and a multi-group comparison is developed to study the role of manufacturer identification. Findings - Findings indicate that the influence of private label image and perceived quality on purchase intention are partially mediated by loyalty and moderated by manufacturer identification. Results also reveal that store image and corporate reputation enhance private label image and perceived quality. Originality/value - This study provides useful insights to advance the understanding of private label branding and guidance to retailers who should consider store image and company reputation when designing branding strategies.","[Porral, Cristina Calvo] Univ A Coruna, Dept Mkt, La Coruna, Spain; [Lang, Mark F.] St Josephs Univ, Dept Food Mkt, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA",Universidade da Coruna; Saint Joseph's University,"Porral, CC (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, Dept Mkt, La Coruna, Spain.",ccalvo@udc.es,"PORRAL, CRISTINA CALVO/A-9179-2012","PORRAL, CRISTINA CALVO/0000-0002-5470-0729",,,,,57,35,35,6,98,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However international carbon markets have not stimulated the demand for forestry offsets. Domestic market-mechanisms are emerging in many countries and forests could be highly valued through these policies as most of the benefits produced by forests are enjoyed locally. Here, a choice experiment explores drivers of valuation and willingness to pay for forest carbon services in voluntary markets in Mexico by comparing the valuation of citizens from four regions to test geographical preference for projects (n = 645). Findings from multinomial-logit models show valuation of forest carbon services is transferable and citizens would pay more for offsets from projects closer to their homes. Proximate forests provide a range of co-benefits to local users, including environmental services and opportunities for recreation. Factors related to valuation include sense of responsibility, previous knowledge of carbon emissions, previous visits to the sites, regional identification and the valuation of local environmental services (e.g. improvements in local air quality). Knowledge of spatial heterogeneity in valuation of the use of forest services can help to design market-based instruments by identifying highly valued areas for environmental services programs and carbon markets.

Its capital city, Beijing, experienced a 53 percent increase in population from 2001 to 2013. To address traffic congestion and air pollution, two of the most pressing urban challenges, Beijing has been investing heavily in transportation infrastructure. In particular, the subway system added 15 new subway lines with a total length of 410 km of over the 12-year period. We quantify the capitalization of large-scale subway construction into property values in a first-differenced hedonic price framework while controlling for confounding factors and reverse causality. Our analysis finds a positive and significant impact of subway proximity on property values: a reduction in the distance to a subway station by 1 km increases the value of properties within 3 km of the station by 15 percent, and by 3.4 percent for properties within 3-5 km. Our analysis shows that the increase in property values can more than cover the capital cost of subway construction.","[Li, Shanjun] Cornell Univ, Appl Econ & Management, 405 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Yang, Jun] Beijing Transportat Res Ctr, 9 Liu Li Qiao Nanli, Beijing 100073, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jun] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, 9 Liu Li Qiao Nanli, Beijing 100073, Peoples R China; [Qin, Ping] Renmin Univ, Sch Econ, Minde Bldg 947,Zhongguancun Village 59, Beijing 100000, Peoples R China; [Chonabayashi, Shun] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Cornell University; Beijing Jiaotong University; Renmin University of China; The World Bank,"Li, SJ (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Appl Econ & Management, 405 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",SL2448@cornell.edu; yangjun218@sina.com; pingqin2009@gmail.com; schonabayashi@worldbank.org,"Chonabayashi, Shun/AAG-3299-2020; Chonabayashi, Shun/AAP-5599-2021","Chonabayashi, Shun/0000-0003-2961-7234; Li, shanjun/0000-0002-6141-8940",,,,,35,14,18,1,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

This paper calculates electricity generation and emissions reduction of CO2, NOx, and SO2, and values these reductions to determine the impact of the siting location for a 300 MW offshore wind farm in Lake Michigan. The most important patterns for emissions reduction were the monthly trends, where January, March, and December consistently had the highest electricity generation and emissions reduction benefits. Summer months such as July and August had the lowest emissions reduction benefits. The intra-day trends showed higher emissions reduction benefits during off-peak hours, due to a higher likelihood of coal units being the marginal generator. These diurnal differences were smaller in magnitude than the seasonal differences. Two benefit valuation scenarios were analyzed for a 20-year time period, one using marginal damages of pollution and another using market prices for pollution allowances. The first scenario resulted in emissions reduction benefits ranging from $1827/kW to $2690/kW ($2508/kW averaged) throughout the Lake Michigan region for the 20-year period (applying a 3% discount rate). This equates to approximately $33/MWh in all lake locations since the emissions reduction benefits are primarily a function of electricity generation. The market price scenario resulted in a much lower range of $820/kW to $1060/kW ($987/kW average or 39% of the pollution damage costs). In scenario 1, the major component of emissions reduction benefits was CO2 reduction (86% of benefits), and 83% of these CO2 benefits were from offsetting coal plant emissions. A sensitivity analysis on size and region of emission reduction location showed that the NO and SO2 benefits vary significantly (unlike CO2 benefits), but this variation had minimal effects on the total emissions reduction benefits. In comparison with economic investment costs, the scenario 1 emissions reduction benefits equal 49% of the total investment cost (in 2014 $million) on average. Spatial maps and heat maps are generated to illustrate the spatial and temporal variations in the emissions reduction benefits. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

There is a considerable literature on the influence of environmental NGOs and business groups on state behaviour and in turn international environmental outcomes. However, much less empirical work has been done to examine the influence of these actors and the strategies they can use in prolonged international environmental negotiations that last for years or decades. This article takes up this task. Drawing on a rich empirical data set on the role of European-based actors in the international climate change negotiations, it considers the influence of non-state actors in prolonged negotiations and identifies four strategies that these actors can use to influence state actors and non-state actors alike.","[Downie, Christian] Univ New South Wales, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Downie, C (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",c.downie@unsw.edu.au,,"downie, Christian/0000-0002-1559-1814",,,,,43,5,5,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

A substantial part of the problem is consensus decision-making within the Convention. Majority voting is a potential alternative which is already being discussed within the UNFCCC. A comparative analysis of consensus and majority voting suggests that majority voting is superior in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness by allowing for quicker decision-making and semi-global approaches to a climate agreement (termed here as Critical Mass Governance). This paper aims to investigate how majority voting could be implemented in the UNFCCC and to consider politically feasible and effective approaches to voting arrangements for the Convention. There is a legal opportunity to introduce voting through adoption of the draft Rules of Procedure, but this faces political opposition. A type of Layered Majority Voting with larger majorities for financial and substantial matters is considered to be the optimal approach in balancing political feasibility and effectiveness. For now, voting is not politically feasible for the UNFCCC, but could be introduced into future bodies or treaties under the Convention.","[Kemp, Luke] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, 21 Cockle St, Canberra, ACT 2602, Australia",Australian National University,"Kemp, L (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, 21 Cockle St, Canberra, ACT 2602, Australia.",luke.kemp@anu.edu.au,,,German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"I would particularly like to thank Helge Jorgens for hosting me at the Free University of Berlin Environmental Policy Research Centre (FFU) during the course of this research and, along with Karen Hussey, Robert Dyball, Janette Lindesay, Olivia Liang and Tse Yang Lim, for providing helpful comments on the initial draft of this paper.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze these factors and their single as well as combined influence on cooperative behavior. The results show that rule enforcement changes the influence of past action as a determinant of cooperation: Past action retains relevance for decision-making but reveals a partly contrarian influence as long as rules are strong. Further, the introduction of explicit rules does not change the influence of personal relationships among participants, but renders the influence of leadership insignificant. Furthermore, the experiments show that context plays a decisive role, which suggests the possibility of tailoring experiments to specific uses: If the context-specific behavior of locals is relevant to policy decisions, then experiments can help capture these effects.

This potentially generates an incentive for firms to strategically delay the introduction of new versions (reformulations) of drugs until just before patent expiration of the original drug. This way the reformulated drug competes mainly with newly introduced generics of the original drug. If instead, the reformulated drug was to be introduced well before the original drug's patent expires, the reformulated drug would compete only with the original drug. While the pattern of strategic delay is well documented in the literature, its effects on consumers and firms are not. Reformulations may increase utility through improved efficacy and through fewer doses per day or a more even molecule decay rate. However, as suggested in the press and literature, it is also possible that the adoption of reformulated products is mostly the result of advertising rather than product-related benefits. Using detailed prescribing and pricing data from the prescription sleep aid market, I document significant adoption of the reformulation Ambien CR and show that it is not only driven by advertising. I use these estimates to evaluate two different policies designed to induce earlier entry of Ambien CR. I find that there are large potential gains in consumer surplus and in revenue.","[Shapiro, Bradley T.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Shapiro, BT (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",Bradley.Shapiro@chicagobooth.edu,,"Shapiro, Bradley/0000-0003-1938-6727",,,,,17,7,10,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

This study surveys the household carbon inequality in urban China and analyzes its sources and determinants using weighted household survey data. Different from existing literatures studying carbon inequality on the international or regional level, we focus on the household aspect and first survey its characteristics by some comparisons. By ascribing household carbon emissions calculated by the Consumer Lifestyle Approach to several consumption categories with the method of Gini coefficient decomposition, we find that residential consumption with high carbon intensity is the most important source of household carbon inequality in urban China. Food consumption and the consumption of educational, cultural and recreational services are the next largest sources because of the consumed quantities or carbon intensity. The application of Shapley decomposition shows the determinants of household carbon inequality in urban China and their contributions, which are household demographic characteristics (59.74%), household employment and income (24.31%), household burdens (8.00%), and household assets and financial plans (7.95%).

Design/methodology/approach - This study presents the result of analysis on financial performance of key actors in three table grape supply chains and the relationship among them using value chain analysis. The table grape supply chain was analyzed using data collected from a field survey in five regions of China. The key actors of these chains were interviewed. The costs, benefits, operational and financial performance of supply chain actors were analyzed. Findings - The results show that, despite receiving the highest proportion of total net profit and making the highest value creation, vinegrowers are facing fluctuant and uncertain commercial returns due to the production and market risks, fluctuation of farm -gate price and the buyer dominant relationship with wholesalers. Moreover, although it is profitable to all key actors, table grape supply chain still faces several challenges including unorganized and dispersed production systems, power asymmetry and lack of information sharing, all of which are the barriers to the improvement of the whole chain performance and the long-term sustainability of this important industry. Originality/value - This paper not only helps to understand the relationship among the key actors and the critical factors impacting on the whole chain performance, but also offer useful guidance for the policy makers and key actors to achieve further improvement of the table grape supply chain performance and provide valuable implications for the future studies on agriculture products.","[Deng, Lei; Wang, Ruimei; Dong, Tian; Feng, Jianying; Mu Weisong] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Mu, WS (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",wsmu@cau.edu.cn,"Feng, Jianying/AIC-0025-2022; dong, tian/JDW-6309-2023; DONG, Tianyu/O-1569-2015","Feng, Jianying/0000-0002-1048-7524;",China Agricultural Research System [CARS-30]; Ministry of Science and Technology [2014BAL07B05],China Agricultural Research System; Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),This study is supported by China Agricultural Research System (CARS-30) and National Key Technology R&D Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology (2014BAL07B05).,,43,13,15,6,66,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A whole farm multi-year farm optimization model that tracks changes in discounted net returns and methane emissions from the use of newer DNA-related technologies to breed for feed efficient cattle is developed. The analysis is situated within the context of whole beef cattle supply chain. This allows for the derivation of the entire value and environmental impact of the innovation, and the decomposition of value by different participants. The impact of different policies that can stimulate producer uptake and the diffusion of the innovation is also addressed. Findings - The results of the study showed that whilst the use of the breeding technology yielded positive economic and environmental benefits to all producers in the supply chain, primary adopters were unlikely to adopt. This paper finds evidence of the misalignment in incentives within the supply chain with a significant proportion of the additional value going to producers who do not incur any additional cost from the adoption of the innovation. The study also highlighted the role of both public and market-based mechanisms in the innovation diffusion process. Originality/value - This paper is unique as it is the first study that addresses producer incentive to adopt genomic selection for feed efficiency across the entire beef cattle supply chain, and incorporates both economic and environmental outcomes.","[Goddard, Ellen; Boaitey, Albert] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Hailu, Getu] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Poon, Kenneth] Univ Guelph, Inst Adv Study Food & Agr Policy, Guelph, ON, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Guelph; University of Guelph,"Boaitey, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",boaitey@ualberta.ca,"Boaitey, Albert/AAG-2015-2021","Boaitey, Albert/0000-0002-2054-609X; Goddard, Ellen/0000-0002-5638-0562; Hailu, Getu/0000-0003-1257-5939",,,,,39,8,8,2,44,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of the NHCR on both innovation and the sourcing of external knowledge in the European Union (EU) food sector. Design/methodology/approach - An online survey was conducted which resulted in a sample of 105 EU companies for the study. Structural equation modelling was used to examine the nature of relationships that existed among the challenges related to the implementation of the NHCR, external sources of knowledge and innovation. Findings - Challenges related to the NHCR are currently found to have a negative direct impact on product innovation. However, they have a positive indirect effect on product innovation, especially in the case of small and medium-sized enterprises. They also seem to positively affect external knowledge sourcing. Additionally, sources of external knowledge are found to have a positive effect on product and process innovations. Practical implications - This study provides insights to different stakeholders in the food industry who might wish to work jointly and address the various issues related to the requirements of the NHCR and facilitate compliance with the regulation. Originality/value - Understanding the impact of the NHCR on innovation seems pivotal because innovation plays an important role in the EU food sector.

Entrepreneurship including retail trade is based on the satisfaction of customers' needs and desires providing enterprises with a profit. Various relationships are formed between the enterprise and the customer during this process where each party has a definite aim that it strives to achieve. Enterprises primarily aim to increase their turnover and make a profit whereas customers could have several aims - to acquire the goods/services from a definite place, in the right quantity and/or receive the necessary information and relevant attitude. These customer benefits can shape the customer satisfaction with the chosen retail enterprise encouraging them to make repeat purchases. Repeat purchases are a very essential for retail enterprises as the process of attracting new customers always requires greater resources in terms of time, money and effort. To ensure customer satisfaction it is important to ascertain the main factors that shape customer satisfaction especially their distinctive features in retail trade.","[Linina, Iveta] Turiba Univ, Riga, Latvia",,"Linina, I (通讯作者)，Turiba Univ, Riga, Latvia.",iveta.linina@turiba.lv,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,3,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-225-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,43.0,,,,,,158,166,,,,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG7FN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253200019,0

In this paper, we selected the typical biomass power generation projects, analyzed the investment cost composition systematically from the aspects of construction cost, equipment purchase cost, installation cost and other cost, and constructed the learning curve model to forecast the trend of investment cost of biomass power generation projects. The forecast results showed that the learning rate of investment decline per kilowatt is 10.96%, and the learning rate of equipment price per kilowatt is 11.89%, which indicates that the investment cost of biomass power generation projects in China is gradually decreasing and the competitiveness of the biomass power generation industry is gradually enhanced.","[Liu, Zhibin; Li, Xiaoning] North China Elect Power Univ, Dept Econ & Management, Baoding, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University,"Liu, ZB (通讯作者)，North China Elect Power Univ, Dept Econ & Management, Baoding, Peoples R China.",liuzhibin771112@126.com,"Li, Xiaoning/JLM-5682-2023","Li, Xiaoning/0000-0001-5991-0955",Social Science Fund Projects in Hebei Province [HB14YJ031]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,Social Science Fund Projects in Hebei Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This paper was supported by the Social Science Fund Projects in Hebei Province (HB14YJ031) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.,,9,4,4,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-275-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,65.0,,,,,,255,258,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Law; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Government & Law,BH2BD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000398733800063,0

The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - Infrastructure conditions and documents related to hygiene procedures of 50 trading places were evaluated using checklists. The hygiene handling practices of 135 fish distributors were also observed by using notational analysis methods. This notational analysis method focused on actions related to microbiological contamination in terms of hand washing or glove changing and the cleaning and sanitising of tools and equipment. Additionally, microbiological quality of 135 samples of raw finfish at points along distribution chains was compared with national standards. Findings - The results indicated that all trading places could be classified as non-compliant or seriously non-compliant with the regulations. The practices of fish distributors were also assessed to be at high risk for contamination of raw fish. The findings showed that approximately 42 and 39 per cent of samples from fishing ports and fish markets, respectively were classified as unacceptable according to the microbiological standards of Vietnam. Research limitations/implications - The present study is limited to research only from fish landing at fishing ports to the distribution to consumers at retail markets. Originality/value - Recommendations for improving food safety in the DSDCs in Vietnam have been developed from the findings of this study and are provided. However, due to similarities with fish distribution chains in other countries, these recommendations may have broader application.","[Phuc Hong Luu] Nha Trang Univ, Dept Food Technol, Nha Trang, Vietnam; [Dunne, Michael P.; Pearse, Warwick; Davies, Belinda] Queensland Univ Technol, Dept Publ Hlth, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Nha Trang University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Luu, PH (通讯作者)，Nha Trang Univ, Dept Food Technol, Nha Trang, Vietnam.",phuchongluu@gmail.com,,,,,,,50,3,3,1,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The chief goal is to identify the main factors influencing the willingness to buy nanofoods (WTBN), distinguishing between factors related to the products, in terms of perceived risks and benefits and psychological factors. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire was administered to a sample of about 300 people to gather information about the willingness to buy six nanofoods (namely: creamier ice cream with the same fat content; salt and sugar that do not form lumps with moisture; fruit juices enriched with bioactive molecules; bread enriched with Omega-3; plastic bottles for beer; antimicrobial food packaging for meat) and psychological characteristics, measured by several attitudinal scales. In order to study the influence of the attitudinal factors on the WTBN a simultaneous equations model was estimated, defining both its structural and reduced form. Findings - Respondents show a certain reluctance to buy foods produced using nanotechnologies The estimates of the econometric model indicate that WTBN is affected by the risks and benefits perceived with respect to the six nanofoods under consideration; the level of neophobia, as captured through the food technology neophobia scale; and the level of trust in food industry. Originality/value - The study extends the literature on nanofood consumer acceptance by adding useful evidence from the Italian case, which has not yet been studied.","[Sodano, Valeria; Gorgitano, Maria Teresa; Verneau, Fabio] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr, Portici, Italy; [Vitale, Cosimo Damiano] Univ Salerno, I-84100 Salerno, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Salerno,"Gorgitano, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr, Portici, Italy.",gorgitan@unina.it,"Verneau, Fabio/AAU-1005-2021; Pineda, Diana/K-6241-2012","GORGITANO, Maria Teresa/0000-0003-4841-3659; Verneau, Fabio/0000-0003-0581-0582",,,,,61,37,37,2,59,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

To conclude, while greater management intensity was associated with higher disutility regardless of the model employed, we do not perceive a risk of conflict between forest management designed to protect biodiversity and management targeting recreational value. Consequently, there is a need for spatially differentiated forest management that discriminates among different functions. The state ownership of all larger Polish forest massifs makes this zoning approach feasible. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Can China achieve this carbon intensity while sustaining economic growth? To address this essential issue, the contributions of this study lie in three aspects. First, we quantitatively capture the relationship between China's economic growth and energy consumption using the cointegration theory, and predict China's energy consumption by 2020 according to different economic growth targets. Second, we forecast China's energy structure in 2020 using compositional data and ARIMA models under different scenarios. Third, we deduce China's CO2 emission and carbon intensity in 2020. Furthermore, we investigate whether (or not) China can realize the carbon intensity target in premise of ensuring economic growth, and evaluate the contribution of the energy structure's adjustment to meeting this target. Finally, we put forward some relevant policy implications for achieving China's carbon intensity target. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As well as being a major component of the economic livelihoods of most local households living at the edge of forests, tavy has been described by anthropologists as an important cultural practice. In this paper, we show that stopping tavy does not only entail an economic cost for local households. The loss of the cultural dimension of tavy would come at an additional cultural cost for some. Our results suggest that a viable cessation of deforestation in Madagascar would require going beyond simple compensation of the opportunity costs of avoiding deforestation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The findings suggest that post-tax fuel prices, environmental vehicle taxes, CO2 standards and European emission standards, introduced into the empirical model through an innovative methodology based on Self-Organising Maps (SOM) (Kohonen, 1990, 2001), positively influence the creation of environmental inventions. Most importantly, the paper highlights that assignees anticipate the introduction of regulatory instruments (i.e. European emission standards and CO2 targets) by filing patents before the effective implementation of regulations when legislation is announced. Furthermore, the paper provides evidence that in a technological space (which measures the applicants' technological proximity), closely located assignees enhance their patent output through the exploitation of technological knowledge produced by others. This means that the greater the proximity between assignees, the higher their likelihood of gaining advantage from this potential spillover pool. Finally, the paper observes that dynamic changes in assignees' patent portfolios spur inventive performances. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These studies commonly categorize households based on observed income in cross-section data, presenting a snap-shot reflecting both inter-household and inter-annual income variation. In this paper we introduce a new approach to categorize households based on a combination of the observed one-year income and predicted income by an augmented asset approach. Applying this approach on household data from Tanzania, we find forest reliance to be high among structurally poor households (low observed income and assets). The highest forest reliance is found among the stochastically non-poor households (high income and low assets), and this group also has the highest absolute forest income. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

When considering global social, economic and environmental challenges, resilience and innovation are valuable response strategies. The notion of a green economy has similarly inspired a number of ideological, geopolitical and institutional responses, yet a review of the dominant approach indicates the propensity to undervalue or ignore the informal economy. Within the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, connecting the informal economy with the green economy is imperative. This paper explores possible connections between the green economy and the informal economy in South Africa and argues that by engaging the informal economy in discussions on the green economy, a more informed policy and planning environment may ensue, resulting in more socially equitable and environmentally sustainable development.

Subjects who faced resource scarcity were less cooperative than those who faced more abundant commons condition. When initial condition of the commons was relatively abundant it seemed more likely that resource users established a norm of reciprocity. We further found that especially men overharvested under resource scarcity which is in line with studies that had found men to be more competitive. We also tested different policies. We found that gaining legitimacy through election increases cooperation independent of whether the resource is scarce or abundant. When sanctions were imposed we observed a crowding-out effect of intrinsic motivation to cooperate under resource abundance. With resource scarcity imposed sanctions did not lead to a crowding-out effect but democratic elections were by far more effective. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We first present a search for statistical evidence in the Far East of an Early Globalization comparable to the one ongoing in the West since the mid-eighteenth century. Moreover, we analyze the extent of the integration of rice markets in Central southeast China and Japan during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and its functioning in comparison with Western countries. Finally, the relevance of our findings for the debate on the great divergence is discussed. Our primary conclusions are as follows: (1) in contrast to the West, no international integration of the grain markets existed in the Far East during the Early Modern Era; (2) significant levels of domestic market integration were reached in some Far Eastern countries; (3) integration of the domestic grain markets may be reached through various combinations of agents and policies with dissimilar effects on long-run economic growth, which are better in the West and worse in the Far East. We suggest that the absence of an Early Globalization in the Far East reveals the existence of certain economic and institutional limitations in this part of the world that may have made contribution to its Great Divergence with the West from at least the eighteenth century.","[Dobado-Gonzalez, Rafael; Garcia-Hiernaux, Alfredo] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Guerrero, David E.] Ctr Univ Estudios Financieros CUNEF, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; CUNEF Universidad,"García-Hiernaux, A (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",rdobado@ccee.ucm.es; agarciah@ucm.es; d-guerrero@cunef.edu,"Guerrero, David/B-1170-2019; Garcia-Hiernaux, Alfredo/K-3934-2014; Garcia-Hiernaux, Alfredo/ABE-9079-2021","Guerrero, David/0000-0002-3518-7026; Garcia-Hiernaux, Alfredo/0000-0002-9905-111X; Garcia-Hiernaux, Alfredo/0000-0002-9905-111X; Guerrero, David E./0000-0003-0406-0257","Ministry of Education of Spain [ECO2011-26286, ECO2011-23972]; Ramon Areces Foundation",Ministry of Education of Spain(Spanish Government); Ramon Areces Foundation,"We appreciate criticisms and suggestions by the attendees of the Economics Seminar (The University of Arizona, Tucson, 2012), the session New Data and New Methods of Time Series Analysis in Cliometrics of the XVIth World Economic History Congress (Stellenbosch, 2012), the 9th Beta Workshop in Historical Economics (Strasbourg, 2013), the 7th World Congress of Cliometrics (Hawaii, 2013), the Annual Conference of the Economic History Society (Warwick, 2014), the Seminar of Economic History (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Getafe, 2013), and the Economic History Seminar (London School of Economics, London, 2014).

The empirical evidence on the impact of MHI on financial protection is limited in India. This paper elucidates the effect of Sampoorna Suraksha Programme (SSP), a MHI scheme in Karnataka on financial protection. Cross-sectional study was undertaken in Karnataka and the data was gathered from 416 insured, 366 newly insured and 364 uninsured households. The impact of SSP on out of pocket expenses (OOPE), catastrophic health expenditure (CHE), non-medical consumption expenditure, hardship financing and labour supply was analysed using linear and logistic regression methods. Results of the study demonstrate that insured members incurred lower OOPE, CHE and hardship finance. There was no effect on consumption expenditure and no direct impact on labour supply measured in terms of withdrawal from workforce and substitution of labour. We advocate a larger role of MHI in health financing in India since it curtails impoverishment of households in informal sector by reducing OOPE and hardship financing.","[Savitha, S.] Manipal Univ, Sch Management, Manipal, Karnataka, India; [Kiran, K.

Our dataset is based on official quotation lists of the stock exchange, and it takes into account all common stocks that were ever listed on the stock exchange during the period considered. This allows us to investigate the performance of the market as a whole in a consistent way over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We find that stock returns strongly depend on dividend income. While real capital appreciation tends to be negative, the dividend yield is remarkably stable over time. Stocks were less risky in the nineteenth century than in the twentieth century. While the equity premium is overall positive, the reward for equity risk is very volatile over time. Even in the long-run equity investors frequently earned a negative return. There are no consistent differences between returns on small stocks and large stocks.","[Annaert, Jan; Deloof, Marc] Antwerp Management Sch, Antwerp, Belgium; [Annaert, Jan; Buelens, Frans; Deloof, Marc] Univ Antwerp, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Deloof, Marc] Univ Antwerp, Dept Accounting & Finance, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp,"Deloof, M (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Dept Accounting & Finance, Prinsstr 13, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",marc.deloof@uantwerpen.be,,"Annaert, Jan/0000-0002-1680-3399; Deloof, Marc/0000-0002-6314-5528",,,,,41,10,11,0,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2015,9.0,1,,,,,77,95,,10.1007/s11698-014-0109-7,0.0,,,19,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,AX8GI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347147700004,0

However, no significant difference was found between consumers' WTP for tomatoes carrying the EU organic label and that for tomatoes carrying both Chinese and EU labels. The results of the MVP model analysis demonstrated that the consumers with different individual characteristics had heterogeneous preferences for organic labels. Food safety consciousness and organic knowledge both had positive effects on consumers' WTP, meanwhile, environmental awareness had no prominent effect on consumer preferences.

The importance of financial education and financial literacy has never been greater than nowadays, when many countries are faced with the ongoing recession. Financially educated and well informed individuals should make better financial decisions and show off better financial behavior. In this paper, we explore saving behavior and socio-demographic characteristics of financial consumers exhibiting low saving behavior. The purpose of this paper is to explore saving behavior of consumers living in Croatia and thus help the policymakers in developing better targeted and higher quality programs. Moreover, the objective is to investigate the relationship between financial education and saving behavior to see whether, and in what extent, financial education affects saving behavior. The previous research in this field points to twofold results, whereat some authors found the evidence of positive correlation of savings and financial education, while others show opposite results. There is still no consensus on the effect of financial education on consumer saving behavior. In order to investigate relationship between financial education and saving, linear regression analysis is used. The regression model diagnostics is conducted and the stated model is appropriate. The results of the conducted research indicate that financial education has the statistically significant impact on saving behavior of Croatian financial consumers. However, although significant, the impact is rather low, what is in line with previous research in this field. The policy implications of research findings are discussed.","[Cvrlje, Dajana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Zagreb, Croatia; [Bahovec, Vlasta; Palic, Irena] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb,"Cvrlje, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Finance, Zagreb, Croatia.",dcvrlje@efzg.hr; vbahovec@efzg.hr; ipalic@efzg.hr,"BARBIĆ, DAJANA/H-7988-2018",,Croatian Science Foundation under the project STRENGTHS [9402],Croatian Science Foundation under the project STRENGTHS,This work has been fully supported by Croatian Science Foundation under the project STRENGTHS (project no. 9402).,,26,4,4,0,7,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2015,,,,,,,241,250,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450589500026,0

These are price, taste, environmental friendliness and healthfulness, tested across hedonic and utilitarian food products (milk and ice-cream). The weighting of attributes involved in food choices is a complex phenomenon, as consumers must consider contradictory requirements when making their choices. Consumers' decision-making processes might also be influenced by food category. Some food products are mostly consumed for pleasure, whereas others are consumed because of their nutritional value. Design/methodology/approach - The study employs a choice-based conjoint technique, which addresses how consumers make trade-offs across a set of product attributes. Findings - The results indicate that price and taste attributes are rated as the most important for both hedonic and utilitarian food products. However, when the authors group consumers according to their product preferences, the relative importance of product attributes changes. Specifically, the importance of environmental friendliness and healthfulness is much higher among the health-conscious and environmentally conscious segments than for other segments. Originality/value - To the knowledge, this is the first study comparing the importance of this combination of product attributes (price, taste, calorie content and eco-label) across hedonic and utilitarian foods in a choice-based conjoint setting.

Developing tasteless lucerne products is meaningless. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to determine the descriptive sensory profile and consumers' acceptability of lucerne. Design/methodology/approach - Three lucerne cultivars and one spinach beet (Beta vulgaris var. cicla L.) cultivar were used: first, to determine sensory descriptive attributes by generic descriptive analysis; and second, to determine consumers' acceptance of lucerne, which were evaluated for degree of liking for aroma, taste, mouthfeel and overall acceptability with a nine-point hedonic scale. Principal component analysis of attributes for all the lucerne cultivars was applied to identify any factors differentiating between these cultivars. Findings - SA Standard showed the lowest value, of the lucerne samples, for fibrous appearance, chewy and fibrous mouthfeel, bitter taste and bitter and metallic aftertaste. SA Standard was the most acceptable lucerne cultivar, indicating its application in future studies to profile new emerging cultivars. Originality/value - No sensory analysis studies have been performed on South African lucerne cultivars to determine their sensory acceptability. These cultivars could have potential for food nutritionists, food scientists and food product developers and the commercial market.","[Mielmann, Annchen] North West Univ, Sch Physiol Nutr & Consumer Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Bothma, Carina; Hugo, A.; Hugo, Celia J.] Univ Orange Free State, Dept Microbial Biochem & Food Biotechnol, Bloemfontein, South Africa",North West University - South Africa; University of the Free State,"Mielmann, A (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Physiol Nutr & Consumer Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",Annchen.Mielmann@nwu.ac.za,"Hugo, Celia/AAF-1346-2020; Mielmann, Annchen/N-1201-2017","Hugo, Celia/0000-0002-8816-4186; Mielmann, Annchen/0000-0003-4276-4239",National Research Foundation (NRF); UFS Cluster - Technologies for Sustainable Crop Industries in Semi-arid Regions,National Research Foundation (NRF); UFS Cluster - Technologies for Sustainable Crop Industries in Semi-arid Regions,The authors wish to thank the National Research Foundation (NRF) and the UFS Cluster - Technologies for Sustainable Crop Industries in Semi-arid Regions for funding of the study.,,43,2,2,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The name is an acronym for an association comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The BRICS members are all developing or newly industrialised countries, they are however distinguished by their large, rapidly growing economies and their significant impact on regional and global affairs. Before the inclusion of South Africa, the organisation was known as BRIC. On 13 April 2011, when South Africa joined the group, BRIC gained the letter S. The name BRIC itself was used for the first time by Jim O'Neill, a British economist of Goldman Sachs. Published in November 2001 and then widespread, O'Neill's forecast predicted that by the half of the 21st century those countries would have become world powers. As of 2014, the BRICS countries represent almost 3 billion people - approximately 40% of the entire world population. The five nations have a combined nominal GDP of US$ 16.039 trillion, equivalent to approximately 20% of the gross world product, and an estimated US$ 4 trillion in combined foreign reserves. Since 2010, the representatives of the BRICS government have been meeting annually at formal summits. The nations within this group do not form a political alliance or an official trade association. The priorities of the members are as follows: 1. Development of a new currency system 2. Reforming the United Nations 3. Increasing the role of developing countries in the international monetary institutions. Having regard to the emerging political and economic changes on a global scale, the BRICS nations have been undertaking new ventures and initiatives aimed to make them key players on the international arena.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a theoretical extension to the health belief model (HBM) that integrates personal stress and environmental cues (visible health problems) with its constructs. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through a quantitative face-to-face survey of 384 health food consumers in Taiwan, and structural equation modelling was used to analyse the data. Findings - The results show that the perceived benefits and barriers of health foods are critical antecedents of continued-consumption intention. Personal stress and visible health problems substantially influence consumers' perceived susceptibility to and severity of health problems, and perceived susceptibility consequently leads to consumer continued consumption. However, the results indicate an irrelevant relationship between perceived severity of health problems and continued-consumption intentions. Originality/value - Based on the HBM, the authors integrated perceived stress and visible health problems into the health food consumer research. The findings can improve the understanding of managers in the health food market regarding the role that stress and visibility play in consumer decisions.","[Wang, Edward S. -T.; Li, Yeah-Luen] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Grad Inst Bioind Management, Taichung 40227, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University,"Wang, EST (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Grad Inst Bioind Management, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.",shihtse.wang@msa.hinet.net,"Wang, Edward/JTU-8458-2023; Wang, Edward Shih-Tse/E-5684-2015","Wang, Edward Shih-Tse/0000-0003-1302-9745",,,,,83,8,11,2,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Further, we find that financial reporting quality is more strongly associated with overinvestment for firms with large free cash flow, which suggests that financial reporting quality can reduce information asymmetry arising from agency conflicts between the managers and investors.

The fact that modern society prescribes by the law that organizations must identify dangers and hazards, risk level that may arise, as well as their management and implementation of consistent measures to reduce their impact, shows the importance that is attributed to this issue. For the effective implementation of laws in the field of health and safety at work and other necessary protective measures, there has been a need for a systematic approach to management in this area. Systematic approach to management in the field of health and safety at work ensures the implementation of all measures necessary for the safe operation thus protecting both employees and organization. This systematic approach is reflected in the current standard OHSAS 18001, which aims to establish control over the risks that carry harmful potentials, and thus ensuring the continuity of operation of the organization. The focus of the scientific community which is actively working on improving the existing standards in the field of safety and health of employees is focused on the upcoming standard that will replace OHSAS 18001. The upcoming standard places a greater emphasis on the risk management and the ongoing assessment of risks and opportunities to prevent or reduce side effects. The innovations in this standard are reflected in the strengthening of the role of top management and top management as well as in the context of the  organization itself. ISO 45001 provides for active participation of management in all processes of health and safety at work and tends to reduce the usage of process of delegated responsibility to one manager, while, on the other hand, the organization looks at the broader, i. e., the requirements of the wider community are taken into account.","[Zivkovic, Snezana; Petrovic, Dejan] Fac Occupat Safety Nis, Nish, Serbia",,"Zivkovic, S (通讯作者)，Fac Occupat Safety Nis, Nish, Serbia.",snezana.zivkvic@znrfak.ni.ac.rs; parkerzeleznica@gmail.com,"Živković, Snežana/L-8019-2016","Živković, Snežana/0000-0002-7931-9334",,,,,13,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2015,,,,,,,200,211,,,,,,12,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450589500022,0

This information has had both research and policy impact. The knowledge of the vast number and extent of basins has been used to bring attention to the overall issue of transboundary water management and understand how and why countries conflict and cooperate over water. Combining this information with ideas embedded in legal instruments such as the UN Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses has given us new ways to look at the adequacy, and inadequacy, of existing transboundary institutions and to suggest policy change and institution building. But do precise data and clearly codified definitions always improve our understanding and decision making? Might they even lead us to incorrect conclusions and poor priority setting? This paper examined how the combination of universalized basin scale principles for international water management and increased mapping precision has resulted in policy prescriptions that sometimes run counter to what negotiators and managers have consistently and thoughtfully done in practice. The conclusion is not a call to cease using new technology nor to end the search for principles to guide our resource management actions. Rather it is a call for caution and balance as we apply technology and logic to specific locations in a complex world.","[Giordano, Mark] Georgetown Univ, Intercultural Ctr, Sch Foreign Serv, Rm 514,37th & O St NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Suhardiman, Diana] Natl Agr & Forestry Res Inst NAFRI Ban Nongviengk, IWMI Laos, POB 4199, Viangchan, Laos; [Peterson-Perlman, Jacob] Oregon State Univ, Dept Geosci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Georgetown University; Oregon State University,"Giordano, M (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Intercultural Ctr, Sch Foreign Serv, Rm 514,37th & O St NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",mg1382@georgetown.edu; D.suhardiman@cgiar.org; jacobpp@gmail.com,,"Giordano, Mark/0000-0001-6379-0984",,,,,63,9,9,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

These changes provide measures of the opportunity cost of higher medical care spending, the majority of which is on labor. Using state data over the period 1990-2010, we find that, in years of high economy-wide unemployment, growth in medical employment in a state reduces the unemployment rate significantly; it does not appear to displace employment in other services or government employment. In periods of low economy wide-unemployment, the growth in the medical employment share does not reduce unemployment. We argue that the opportunity cost of higher medical care employment may sometimes not be so high in terms of real labor resources, nor in terms of employment for needed government services.","[Pauly, Mark] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Hlth Care Management Dept, 208 Colonial Penn Ctr 3641 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Nimgaonkar, Vivek] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Vagelos Life Sci & Management Program, 208 Colonial Penn Ctr 3641 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania,"Pauly, M (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Hlth Care Management Dept, 208 Colonial Penn Ctr 3641 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",pauly@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,7,0,1,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

Further, the article addresses two phenomena related to ecological modernization that have received much attention, namely, the Porter Hypothesis and the Jevons' Paradox. State led environmental regulation in terms of environmental legislation as well as initiatives to promote green technology can be understood as a twofold attempt, which ultimately leads to re-defining socially necessary labor time. First, state intervention would wish to remove surplus profit from polluting or resource depleting capitals through legislation, which would tend to increase socially necessary labor time in the branch of production under reference. State policy might then attempt to propel the adoption of green technology, which would tend to decrease socially necessary labor time in the sectors targeted. Through state initiatives, competition among rival capitals would be re-aligned so as to allow for conditions of production to be renewed. The Porter Hypothesis can be approached as a strategy followed by individual capitals to gain an early-mover advantage, while the Jevons' Paradox can be seen as the result of an imitation process, when rival capitals take up technological modifications launched by innovators.

Although several explicit environmental strategies were designed at the supranational level, the pursuit of environmental sustainability remains an aim driven by political concerns at the country level. This study aims to investigate the role of both internal (cognitive and motivational factors) and external (social forces and macro-economic conditions) contexts in influencing the propensity of political leaders regarding environmental matters. The findings indicate that cognitive and motivational factors tend to shape the environmental intentions of political leaders, whereas the external context does not have a significant impact. Our results suggest that the political leaders' propensity for addressing environmental matters is largely affected by the desire of leaders to establish or confirm an individual status (through political processes) or to conform to group norms. However, younger political leaders demonstrate a higher environmental propensity than do older leaders. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Althoughtheoretical limitations and shortcomings are widely acknowledged in the literature, the extent to which the alternative approaches to wealth accounting matter empirically is not well known. Comparing the alternative data in levels, 'shares, growth rates, and monetary sustainability indices derived from them, major differences emerge between OECD and non-OECD countries. For the former, the alternative wealth estimates seem complementary, but only if a key assumption made in the derivation of inclusive wealth is violated. For the latter, the data seem much less useful. For example, depending on which data source is used, for the group of low income countries the share of natural capital in total wealth is either 36.8% or 60.4%, suggesting that extreme care must be taken if the composition of wealth were to be used to inform policy-making. Neither wealth data set provides a 'definite guide' to economic sustainability, but a combination of indices derived from both might be useful in a holistic assessment of sustainability.

It examines the Company's trade to its German 'mart' town of Stade at the close of the sixteenth century through a detailed case study of the trade of one particular merchant, John Quarles. Using correspondence between Quarles and his factors overseas, it considers how membership of this regulated trading company impacted on the practice of its members, both through its formal regulatory regime and the informal pressures that came with corporate affiliation. However, corporate privileges also created 'shadow economies' inhabited by the excluded, those castigated by companies as 'interlopers'. The article considers the connections between interlopers and those 'disorderly brethren' of the company who were prepared to violate corporate regulations in pursuit of opportunities. It shows how the regulatory regimes of merchant companies were shaped by the changing practices of members and nonmembers as they responded to the structural changes facing European trade in the early modern period.","[Leng, Thomas] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Leng, T (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",,,,British Academy,British Academy,"The author would like to thank Oscar Gelderblom and Phil Withington for their comments, as well as the audience of the Economic and Social History of the Premodern World seminar at the Institute of Historical Research, London.

A detailed analysis of the legal acts, national strategies, and decrees using the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services codes, which embraces a full range of ES, shows that the ES concept is reflected in the investigated documents. However, it is mainly depicted in an indirect, latent form. We further explore the ES concept occurrence in the Polish legislation with in-depth interviews of experts. From the interviews we identify two general groups of barriers to the ES concept implementation in environmental policy: (a) a limited understanding and acknowledgement of the concept among individuals involved in policy making; and (b) sectoral divisions within environmental governance that hinder the spread of the concept. Analysis reveals that the concept of services for society provided by nature had already been perceived in Polish national environmental policies before the emergence of the ES concept and the implementation of the EU biodiversity policy. However, the concept is referred to mostly in a latent form, before and after its emergence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between residential segregation and self-reported happiness. Using panel data from the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH), we begin by estimating ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions of happiness on a measure of MSA-level segregation, controlling for a rich set of individual, neighborhood, regional, and state characteristics. The OLS results suggest that increased segregation is associated with a reduction in happiness among blacks. To deal more appropriately with the potential endogeneity of location choice, we extend the methodology to fully exploit the panel structure of the NSFH and incorporate individual fixed effects into the happiness equation. Contrary to the OLS results, our fixed effects estimates imply that blacks are happier in more segregated metropolitan areas. The paper discusses the implications of these results within the context of current integration policies.","[Herbst, Chris M.; Lucio, Joanna] Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411 N Cent Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix,"Herbst, CM (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411 N Cent Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.",chris.herbst@asu.edu; Joanna.lucio@asu.edu,,,,,,,80,16,17,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

I find that all banks suffered tremendous deposit withdrawals; however banks that failed earlier in the 1930s had invested more in mortgages in the 1920s. The main problem with mortgages was their lack of liquidity, not their quality. Banks heavily engaged in mortgages did not have enough liquid assets to face the withdrawals, and failed. This article thus reasserts the importance of pre-crisis liquidity risk management in preventing bank failures.","[Postel-Vinay, Natacha] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Postel-Vinay, N (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",n.postel-vinay@warwick.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I am very grateful to my PhD advisors Olivier Accominotti and Albrecht Ritschl for their continuous support and guidance.

Using models that control for vertical tax competition effects, we show how asymmetric leader-follower dynamics characterize horizontal tax competition over the three decades that follow. A placebo test further supports our main conclusions.

The medieval city is seen as having been strictly regulated, both in terms of markets, and in terms of space. The early modern city, by contrast, is associated not only with growth, but with the breakdown of rigid regulation by guilds and a new commercial outlook. However, empirical studies of the spatial organization of medieval cities have been limited, and quantitative surveys of urban economic geography have focused on the seventeenth century and later. This article analyses the spatial distribution of occupations in the City of London between the 1370s and the 1550s using a large probate dataset. It examines occupations that remained clustered or dispersed, but concentrates on the apparent breakdown in economic clustering among London's leading trades. Prosopographical analysis reveals that merchants and retailers became more specialized, but that this was accommodated within London's existing guild-based occupational identities, which had become ossified. Rather than the end of the middle ages having marked a dramatic change from guild-based spatial organisation, occupational clusters simply continued to evolve in line with the principles of locational economics throughout the period.","[Colson, Justin] Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Colson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England.",,"Colson, Justin/AAZ-8998-2021","Colson, Justin/0000-0002-4352-2154",Economic History Society,Economic History Society,"I am indebted to the many scholars who have contributed to discussion of earlier versions of this article at the Economic History Society Conference in 2012 and at pre-modern economic history seminars at the Institute of Historical Research in London and Selwyn College Cambridge, and especially Clive Burgess, Matthew Davies, Patrick Wallis, and the anonymous reviewers.

Countries' governance performance, particularly with respect to property rights security, exerts significant impacts on land-use patterns by affecting agricultural yield-related technological investment and cropland expansion. This study aims to incorporate governance factors into a recursive agro-economic dynamic model to simulate governance impacts on land use patterns at the global scale. Due to the difficulties of including governance indicators directly into numerical models, we use lending interest rates as discount rates to reflect risk-accounting factors associated with different governance scenarios. In addition to a reference scenario, three scenarios with high, low and mixed divergent discount rates are formed to represent weak, strong and fragmented governance. We find that weak governance leads to slower yield growth, increased cropland expansion and associated deforestation, mainly in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia. This is associated with increasing food prices, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. By contrast, strong governance performance-provides a stable political and economic situation which may bring down, deforestation rates, stimulate investment in agricultural technologies, and induce fairly strong decreases in food prices.

The main advantages and disadvantages that can be derived from the TTIP negotiation are pointed out. Findings - The analysis of the Italian food industry highlights a very fragmented production structure characterized by the coexistence on the market of a small number of big companies and a large number of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. Such bipolar structure constitutes a constraint to internationalization and limits the quantities of exportable products. The TTIP can represent an opportunity for the Italian food small businesses.

A thesis was formulated that farms which draw loans achieve a higher rate of return, estate and equity because they make investments. This thesis was not fully confirmed, and the decisive reason was the excessive equipping of such farms in fixed assets, which did not correspond with a higher increase of income. Investment expenditure and the paying off of debt had a negative influence on the amount of financial means transferred to the household and as a consequence, the rate of growth.","[Bereznicka, Joanna] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Bereznicka, J (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",joanna_bereznicka@sggw.pl,,"Bereznicka, Joanna/0000-0002-0316-6693",,,,,16,1,1,0,0,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-225-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,43.0,,,,,,240,247,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG7FN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253200029,0

First, it aims at understanding to what extent wine experts are influenced by specific quality clues. Second, it seeks at assessing the role and effectiveness of different quality clues in the creation of price. Design/methodology/approach - To meet these goals two independent equations are set. The first estimated via an ordered logit explaining the rating of a wine with a bunch of attributes of the wine and of its production process. The second equation is a hedonic price model estimated via an interval regression where price is a function of a large number of quality clues, The analysis covers 2,523 wines from three Italian regions as reviewed by Verouelli Guide, 2010 edition. Findings - The model estimation results indicates that: few attributes seems to systematically impact experts' judgments; many quality dues are associated with significant price premiums (PP); and in some cases consumers give value to quality clues along with Veronelli's experts while in other cases there is no such alignment. Originality/value - This study advances the literature in two different ways. First, modeling two distinct equations that describe the factors affecting, on the one side, experts' evaluations, and, on the other side, market prices. Second, as it assesses the PP associated to quality clues whose value has not been considered so far in hedonic price models.

Second, the authors are interested to understand to what extent these drivers are industry specific, and therefore, they are contrasted against those relevant for the pharmaceutical industry in Italy according to the increasing growth of cross-industry innovation between these two sectors. The paper aims, thus, to shed light on the differences between food and pharmaceutical industries in terms of innovation drivers to understand potential precursors of emerging industry convergence. Design/methodology/approach - Both probit and bivariate probit models are estimated, using data from the Italian Community Innovation Survey, in order to provide empirical evidence on drivers affecting innovation in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Findings - The innovation activity of Italian food and pharmaceutical companies strongly relies on the presence of in-house R&D activities. Whereas firms in the pharmaceutical industry combine both internal and external R&D activities and knowledge sources to produce innovation, the case of the food industry is strongly dependent on the acquisition of external technology. In particular, the increased need for absorptive capacity of both sectors emphasises the key role of university research for collaboration, knowledge transfer and product innovation. Research limitations/implications - The paper gives insights not only on drivers for innovation, but especially on the industry-specific differences which should be taken into account to have a contingent view. Limitations concern the impossibility to perform panel data analysis, due to the design of the database. Furthermore, both food and pharmaceutical sub-samples are not completely representative, since large companies tend to be overrepresented. P ractical implications - This paper provides managerial insights concerning the internal and external drivers affecting innovation. Moreover, it raises awareness as regards the possible differences between the food and pharmaceutical industries, which is crucial for establishing successful pathways for cross-industry innovation. Originality/value - This study represents one of the few attempts to compare the innovation drivers of two manufacturing sectors (food and pharmaceutical), increasingly involved in cross-industry collaborations, and to highlight the industry-specific differences in those drivers which can act as forerunners of this phenomenon.","[Ciliberti, Stefano] Univ Perugia, Dept Agr Environm & Food Sci, Perugia, Italy; [Carraresi, Laura; Broering, Stefanie] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany",University of Perugia; University of Bonn,"Ciliberti, S (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dept Agr Environm & Food Sci, Perugia, Italy.",steciliberti@gmail.com,"Caiazza, Rosa/C-6138-2015; Ciliberti, Stefano/AAF-9751-2020; Carraresi, Laura/AAG-1718-2019; Ciliberti, Stefano/N-1619-2015; Broering, Stefanie/AAC-9457-2020","Caiazza, Rosa/0000-0001-6067-9973; Carraresi, Laura/0000-0003-0081-6651; Broering, Stefanie/0000-0003-2014-2586; Ciliberti, Stefano/0000-0001-7833-9547",,,,,90,28,29,1,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Looking at agroecosystems as a set of energy loops between nature and society, and adopting a farm-operator standpoint at landscape level to set the system boundaries, enthalpy values of energy carriers are accounted for net Final Produce going outside as well as for Biomass Reused cycling inside, and External Inputs are accounted using embodied values. Human Labour is accounted for the fraction of the energy intake of labouring people devoted to perform farm work, considering the local or external origin of their food basket. In this approach the proportion of internal Biomass Reused becomes a hallmark of organic farm systems that tend to save External Inputs, whereas industrial farming and livestock breeding in feedlots tend to get rid of reuses replacing them with inputs coming from outside. Hence, decomposing the internal or external energy throughputs may bring to light their contrasting sociometabolic profiles. A Catalan case study in 1860 and 1990 is used as a test bench to show how revealing this decomposing analysis may be to plot the energy profiles of farm systems and their possible improvement pathways.

Much of what it has achieved as a field of academic enquiry can be linked back to issues of integrated assessment modelling. This paper shows that the standard approach is going through a major change in scope as of the last five years. The conventional focus on determining optimal mitigation paths based on modelling the social cost of carbon is being enlarged to embrace promising new waves of research. These are: (1) the economics of insurance against catastrophic risks; (2) the economics of trade and climate; and (3) the economics of climate change adaptation. The paper helps to bridge the gap between economics and climate policy by showing that the analytical toolkit of climate change economics has shifted towards more realistic representations of climatic policy.

The results show that for the sake of maintaining the security of the thoroughfare and laying a solid foundation for the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, we need to keep a good relationship with the U.S., crack down on terrorism existence, achieve a proper resolution of territorial disputes in the South China Sea and to actively build the nontraditional security cooperation mechanism.","[Yang Jiahao] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Coll Criminal Justice, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Yang, JH (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Coll Criminal Justice, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",youngpaper@126.com,,,Military science project of the National Social Science Fund of China [16GJ003-163],Military science project of the National Social Science Fund of China,This work was financially supported by Military science project of the National Social Science Fund of China (16GJ003-163).,,6,0,0,0,6,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-275-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,65.0,,,,,,220,223,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Law; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Government & Law,BH2BD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000398733800054,0

Many governments have assumed (legislated) the carbon flux from burning biomass to be neutral because biomass growth sequesters CO2. Yet, trees take decades to recover the CO2 released by burning, so assumed emissions neutrality (or near neutrality) implies that climate change is not considered an urgent matter. As biomass energy continues to be a significant strategy for transitioning away from fossil fuels, this paper asks the question: To what extent should we value future atmospheric carbon removals? To answer this, we examine the assumptions and pitfalls of biomass carbon sequestration in light of its increasing use as a fossil-fuel alternative. This study demonstrates that the assumed carbon neutrality of biomass for energy production hinges on the fact that we weakly discount future removals of carbon, and it is sensitive to tree species and the nature of the fuel for which biomass substitutes.

We develop a model of competing land uses that allows for governance to impact the risk of future versus current agricultural and forested land allocations. The resulting hypothesis on the relationship between governance and the likelihood of a forest transition is then tested using cross-country data. The empirical analysis offers strong support for the competing land use framework, and indicates that rule of law, forest policy and regulatory quality influence forest transitions. These findings inform not only the ongoing debate on forest transitions but also policy options for managing such transitions in developing economies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

After a growing disparity between these two indicators in the 1980s, when Brazil's per capita GPI featured a 35% decline, there was a relative catch-up in per capita GPI, but not one sufficiently strong enough to reduce the historical GPI-GDP gap. The recent trend of rapidly increasing environmental and social costs, along with the decline in unpaid labour and infrastructure services, poses concerns about the sustainability of an increasing GPI for Brazil into the future. Policies aimed at reducing environmental costs are necessary if Brazil is to enjoy a sustainable pattern of non-declining economic welfare. Brazil must pursue a higher rate of productivity in material and energy consumption in order to keep environmental pressures to a minimum level. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we propose a semi-automatic methodology to overcome this issue: we describe our multi-scalar model and its data-reconciliation component and apply it to cereal flows. Namely, using official databases (Insee, Agreste, FranceAgriMer, SitraM) as well as corporate sources, we reconstructed the supply chain flows of the 22 French regions as well as the flows of four nested territories: France, the Rhone-Alpes region, the Isere department and the territory of the SCoT of Grenoble. We display the results using Sankey diagrams and discuss the intervals of confidence of the model's outputs. We conclude on the perspectives of coupling this model with economic, social and environmental aspects that would provide key information to decision-makers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The present models are based on the multiplier-type frameworks and resource allocation variables (RAVs) in simple yet edifying network settings, such as multi-component and two-stage structures. Two issues associated with RAVs, however, are relevant to both the theory and practice. First, the existing models with RAVs are nonlinear in general. Second, a potential conflict of interest between a central evaluator (CE) and the managers of decision-making units (DMUs), due to the unknown allocation parameters, has not been addressed. The current study contributes to the resolution of these issues by presenting conflict free models (CFMs). Two striking features of the proposed models include their convenient transformation into linear programs and that they are conflict free. Thus, the manager of a DMU has no basis to argue against the evaluation results by simply claiming that faulty information regarding the split of shared resources has been used, as no such information relating to the CE's preference or pertaining to RAVs is included in the model formulation. Furthermore, we investigate the relations between CFMs and the existing models, strengthening the interpretations of the existing models.

We explore whether existing global data can be used to measure nature's contribution to development targets and explore limitations in these data. Using Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 1- eradicate extreme hunger and poverty. We develop two indicators to assess the contribution of nature to progress in this goal. The indicators (based on income and employment data from nature-based sectors (NBS) represented by agriculture, forestry and fisheries) show large but declining contributions of nature to MDG 1: NBS contributed to lifting 18% of people out of poverty and provided 37% of global employment between 1991 and 2010. For low income countries, the contributions were 20% and 55% respectively. In exploring data gaps the study highlighted low reporting rates especially in low income countries, as well as lack of other measures of poverty alleviation beyond income and employment. If we are to move beyond target setting to implementation of sustainable development goals at national scales, these shortcomings require as much attention as the elaboration and agreement on the post-2015 development goals.

Here we show that while such feedbacks may give rise to critical transitions in social-ecological systems, at the same time they can offer novel opportunities for anticipating them. We model a community that has joint access to the harvest grounds of a resource that is prone to collapse. Individuals are tempted to overexploit the resource, while a cooperative harvesting norm spreads through the community via interpersonal relations. Both social and ecological collapses can be induced by environmental or socio-economic driving forces. Regardless of the type and cause of collapse we find that upcoming transitions may be detected using simple socio-economic response variables, such as individual profits. Our findings suggest that such alternative sources of information can be used to detect upcoming critical transitions in social-ecological systems. However, we also find that robust detection of critical transitions may be confounded by recovery attempts undertaken by resource users in the vicinity of an upcoming collapse, which may be falsely interpreted as a stabilization of the social-ecological system.

However, these payments are financial burdens that lead to impoverishment when they become catastrophic. The purpose of this study is to cast light on the determinants of catastrophic household out-of-pocket health expenditures and to assess their implications on poverty. The 2011 poverty monitoring survey is used in this study. This survey aims to draw poverty profiles and to highlight the socio-economic characteristics of different social groups. In line with the concerns raised by the new Supplemental Poverty Measure, poverty statistics are adjusted to take into account household health expenditures and to estimate their impoverishing effects. To identify the determinants of the magnitude of catastrophic health expenditure, we implement a seemingly unrelated equations system of Tobit regressions to take into account censoring through a conditional mixed-process estimator procedure. We identify major causes of catastrophic expenditures, such as the level of overall health spending, the expensiveness of health goods and services, the characteristics of health facilities, the health stock shocks, the lack of insurance, etc. Results show evidence that catastrophic health expenditures jeopardize household welfare for some people that fall into poverty as a result of negative effects on disposable income and disruption of the material living standards of households. Our findings warrant further policy improvements to minimize the financial risks of out-of-pocket health expenditures and increase the efficiency of health care system for more effective poverty reduction strategies.","[Sene, Ligane Massamba] Int Food Policy Res Inst IFPRI, Lot 2 Titre 3396,BP 24063, Dakar Almadies, Senegal; [Cisse, Momath] Natl Agcy Stat & Demog ANSD, Dakar, Senegal",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Séne, LM (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst IFPRI, Lot 2 Titre 3396,BP 24063, Dakar Almadies, Senegal.",jalimase@yahoo.fr,,"Sene, Ing., Ph.D, Ligane Massamba/0000-0001-6009-190X",,,,,44,23,25,1,26,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

It considers the role of the following four plant characteristics: internal and external knowledge; foreign ownership; multi-plant economies of scale and competition; and spatial spillovers and 'place' effects. A wide range of results are obtained, most of which confirm earlier results in the literature, such as that undertaking R&D is positively associated with TFP and most foreign ownership groups have higher than average TFP. The results also confirm the very small number of studies in the literature that have shown that the age of the plant is negatively related to TFP and therefore that vintage effects outweigh any learning-by-doing effects. The inclusion of a wide range of determinants of TFP allows comment on the relative importance of different groups of TFP determinants; knowledge creation is found to be the most important determinant of TFP (especially in manufacturing), with spatial location impacts overall the next largest determinant. Foreign-ownership is founded to be (overall) the least important determinant of TFP although this is partly the consequence of the relatively small size of the foreign-owned sector.","[Harris, Richard; Moffat, John] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham DH1 3HP, England",Durham University,"Moffat, J (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham DH1 3HP, England.",john.moffat@durham.ac.uk,,"Harris, Richard/0000-0001-8066-3629; Moffat, John/0000-0002-9529-1749",ESRC [RES-591-28-0001],ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This work contains statistical data from ONS which is Crown copyright and reproduced with the permission of the controller of HMSO and Queen's Printer for Scotland.

Spatial modeling of the harvest of wild species has therefore emerged as an important research approach. The literature on such modeling is, however, fragmented between different resource types, and empirical validation of the models is often weak or absent. This paper presents a model that is intended to have validity for a wide variety of wild plant and animal resources. It combines a logistic model of resource growth with an economic model assuming that costs associated with harvest consist of three components, namely transport, search, and handling, and a one-dimensional spatial structure where resource harvesters are based at a central place surrounded by infinite extensions of habitat for the harvested resource. Model outcomes show that the spatial distribution of harvest heavily depends on the carrying capacity and the catchability coefficient, i.e. the ease of finding and harvesting a resource unit. An empirical study of wildlife hunting and palm leaf harvest in indigenous villages in Ecuadorian Amazonia confirmed the validity of model outcomes.

Although assessments take various forms, many utilize diverse sets of indicators numbering anywhere from two to over 2000. Indices, composite indicators, or aggregate values are used to simplify high dimensional and complex data sets and to clarify assessment results. Although the choice of aggregation function is a key component in the development of the assessment, there are few literature examples to guide appropriate aggregation function selection. This paper applies the mathematical study of aggregation functions to sustainability assessment in order to aid in providing criteria for aggregation function selection. Relevant mathematical properties of aggregation functions are presented and interpreted. Cases of these properties and their relation to previous sustainability assessment research are provided. Examples show that mathematical aggregation properties can be used to address the topics of compensatory behavior and weak versus strong sustainability, aggregation of data under varying units of measurements, multiple site multiple indicator aggregation, and the determination of error bounds in aggregate output for normalized and non-normalized indicator measures.

Recent advances have enabled exhibitors to satisfy consumers' long-standing desire for increasingly larger screens. On the other hand, digital technology has reduced the cost of playing the same movie on multiple screens, thereby creating an incentive for screen proliferation to increase the number of show times for a given movie. Increasing the screens also has the added benefit of allowing the exhibitor to expand the number of unique movies screened at a given time. This is fundamentally a tradeoff between quality (larger screen size) and variety (more movies or showings). The goal of this paper is to evaluate consumers' relative valuations of the large screens vs. more shows tradeoff. We use a new data set on movie showings in India at the movie-chain-market-week level to estimate an aggregate discrete-choice demand model providing measures of customer preferences for the number of movie showings and screen size. India provides a valuable setting to study this question because the densely populated cities face substantial space constraints and regional heterogeneity in tastes and languages suggest the option of more shows may be more important in some cities than others. Our findings suggest that regions which are more urban and have a greater share of people with higher education prefer larger screens (quality) while most other regions prefer more showings (variety).","[Rao, Anita] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Hartmann, Wesley R.] Stanford Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Chicago; Stanford University,"Rao, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",anita.rao@chicagobooth.edu; hartmann_wesley@gsb.stanford.edu,"Rao, Anita/GNH-4113-2022",,,,,,16,4,6,5,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

We modify this model by adding a parameter p which equals the probability that a firm is fully efficient. We can estimate this model by MLE and obtain estimates of the fraction of firms that are fully efficient and of the distribution of inefficiency for the inefficient firms. This model has also been considered by Kumbhakar et al. (J Econ 172:66-76, 2013). We extend their paper in several ways. We discuss some identification issues that arise if all firms are inefficient or no firms are inefficient. We show that results like those of Waldman (J Econ 18:275-279, 1982) hold for this model, that is, that the likelihood has a stationary point at parameters that indicate no inefficiency and that this point is a local maximum if the OLS residuals are positively skewed. Finally, we consider problems involved in testing the hypothesis that p = 0. We also provide some simulations and an empirical example.","[Rho, Seunghwa] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Econ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Schmidt, Peter] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Michigan State University,"Schmidt, P (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",srho@lsu.edu; schmidtp@msu.edu,,,,,,,33,26,28,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The authors claim, contrary to most existing research, that we must consider all links and connections that a regime creates among its members for determining whether and how it influences states toward 'greener' environmental behavior. To this extent, the paper advances two arguments. First, parties more central to the CLRTAP network can rely on and signal mutual interests, shared preferences, and decreased uncertainty with all actors involved. In turn, a central position embodies social capital, which facilitates that a well-connected state is ceteris paribus more likely to cooperate with the regime. Second, if other countries in the network do not cooperate, however, it is likely that the positive effect stemming from social capital disappears and that a state will defect even if it has a central position in the network. The authors' empirical analysis provides support for the theory and may have important implications for studies on regime effectiveness and on networks in general.","[Boehmelt, Tobias; Vollenweider, Juerg] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, IED, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies CIS, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Boehmelt, Tobias] Univ Essex, Dept Govt, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Essex,"Böhmelt, T (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, IED, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies CIS, Haldenggsteig 4, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",tobias.boehmelt@ir.gess.ethz.ch,"Böhmelt, Tobias/N-5347-2014","Bohmelt, Tobias/0000-0002-7661-8670","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1461495] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,70,3,3,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

A social table constructed for Tokugawa Japan in the 1840s is compared with two cases with high levels of inequality, Stuart England and Mughal India, and the subsequent changes in the three countries are traced to the modern era of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The Japanese pattern in the early modern period can be characterized by comparatively modest growth with a relatively egalitarian distribution of income between the social classes, but the pattern changed during the subsequent half-century to one with an increased tempo of growth and a substantial rise in the level of income inequality. The implications of this finding are discussed in terms of the concept of Smithian growth and are placed in the comparative context of the divergence debate.","Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Saito, O (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan.",,,,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26285075, 25285072, 25245047, 25245048] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,70,29,30,1,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Current methods linking production impacts to final consumption typically trace the origin of products back to the country level, lacking fine-scale spatial resolution. This hampers accurate calculation of trade and consumption footprints, masking and distorting the causal links between consumers' choices and their environmental impacts, especially in countries with large spatial variability in socio-environmental conditions and production impacts. Here we present the SEI-PCS model (Spatially Explicit Information on Production to Consumption Systems), which allows for fine-scale sub-national assessments of the origin of, and socio-environmental impacts embedded in, traded commodities. The method connects detailed production data at sub-national scales (e.g., municipalities or provinces), information on domestic flows of goods and in international trade. The model permits the downscaling of country-to-country trade analyses based on either physical allocation from bilateral trade matrices or MR10 models. The importance of producing more spatially-explicit trade analyses is illustrated by identifying the municipalities of Brazil from which different countries source the Brazilian soy they consume. Applications for improving consumption accounting and policy assessment are discussed, including quantification of externalities of consumption, consumer labeling, trade leakages, sustainable resource supply and traceability.

In this study, we test empirically the Porter hypothesis and the competing hypothesis that regulation undermines profitability (costly regulation hypothesis). In particular, we estimate the effect of clean water regulation, as reflected in the stringency of firm-specific effluent limits for two regulated pollutants, on the profitability of chemical manufacturing firms. As our primary contribution, we contrast the effect of clean water regulation on actual profitability outcomes and its effects on investors' expectations of profitability. Our results for actual profitability are consistent with the Porter hypothesis, while our results for expected profitability are consistent with the costly regulation hypothesis. Thus, our empirical results demonstrate that investors do not appear to value the positive effect of tighter clean water regulation on actual profitability.

While several hospitals are still reimbursed on a per diem basis for the treatment of patients, most face flat per-case rates-or mixed schemes, which combine both elements of reimbursement. Thus, unlike previous studies, we are able to simultaneously analyse and isolate the cost-efficiency effects of different payment schemes. By means of stochastic frontier analysis, we first estimate a hospital cost frontier. Using the two-stage approach proposed by Battese and Coelli (Empir Econ 20: 325-332, 1995), we then analyse the impact of these payment schemes on the cost efficiency of hospitals. Controlling for hospital characteristics, local market conditions in the 26 Swiss states (cantons), and a time trend, we show that, compared to per diem, hospitals which are reimbursed by flat payment schemes perform better in terms of cost efficiency. Our results suggest that mixed schemes create incentives for cost containment as well, although to a lesser extent. In addition, our findings indicate that cost-efficient hospitals are primarily located in cantons with competitive markets, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman index in inpatient care. Furthermore, our econometric model shows that we obtain biased estimates from frontier analysis if we do not account for heteroscedasticity in the inefficiency term.","[Meyer, Stefan] Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ WWZ, Dept Hlth Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Meyer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ WWZ, Dept Hlth Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",stefan.meyer@unibas.ch,,"Meyer, Stefan/0000-0003-1743-1096",,,,,69,5,6,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

AFCs are characterised by typical environmental problems such as changes in land use, CO2 emissions, energy and water consumption, and chemical pollution. Recent technological changes in the agri-food industry have influenced the economic and social development of AFCs towards progressive industrialization. Such changes have also been the source of new environmental problems, such as those related to the large-scale use and disposal of auxiliary materials. Industrial Ecology (IE) proposes approaches and applied solutions to reduce the environmental impacts and improve the competitiveness of production activities. Major applications of IE in AFCs currently involve the valorisation of animal and vegetable by-products and scraps. Further improvements can be achieved by adopting IE-based solutions focused on auxiliary material wastes. This article analyses the potential development of IE-based approaches in a representative Italian AFC. Empirical evidence shows that efficient solutions can be implemented through material substitution, repair, and recycling, and by exploiting collaborative strategies among the agri-food and industrial companies established in the area.

Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on primary structured questionnaire survey through personal interviews using multi-stage stratified sampling technique. This comprehensive survey covered 2,400 primary and upper primary students belonging to eight districts of Uttar Pradesh Allahabad, Balrampur, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Hathras, Kanpur Nagar, Mathura, Shahjahanpur and Varanasi. A total of 60 schools have been selected from each district, covering a total of 480 primary and upper primary schools. Simple statistical tools have been used to analyze the surveyed data such as cross-tabulation, percentage distribution and rank analysis. Further, six research hypotheses have been formulated to analyze the difference in school meal menu preferences among the students and chi(2)-statistics has been used to test the significance level of these hypotheses. Findings - Survey results indicate that more than 90 percent students eat MDM in the school as per the weekly menu. Result of chi(2)-test indicates that choices on school meal menu among the students differ significantly across weekdays. Rice-pulses or rice-sambar served on Tuesday is reported to be the first preferred food of children given first preference by around 30 percent, followed by kadi-rice or kheer which is served on Wednesday. The results of chi(2)-tests exhibited a significant difference on weekly menu choices by gender, kitchen types, rural and urban locations and geographical regions. About 27 percent of the students reported that they want to have a change in the menu. When further probed about the kind of changes desired in the menu, puri-vegetables was found to be the most preferred choice of the respondents, beside halwa/kheer and rice with pulses/vegetables/kadi being the next preferred choices. Practical implications - The present study provides managerial implications to the policy makers and scheme/program implementers for better understanding of the students' preferences on school MDM weekly menu. Originality/value - There are several evaluation studies undertaken by various agencies to assess the impact of MDM program on school attendance, retention and nutritional status of children. However, there are limited numbers of studies available, which have measured the students' preferences on school MDM menu.","[Ali, Jabir] Indian Inst Management, Ctr Food & Agribusiness Management, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Akbar, Mohammad] Indian Inst Management Lucknow, Strateg Management Grp, Noida, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Lucknow; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Lucknow,"Ali, J (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Ctr Food & Agribusiness Management, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.",jabirali@iiml.ac.in,"Ali, Jabir/I-1955-2019","Ali, Jabir/0000-0002-5891-568X","Mid-Day Meal Authority, Lucknow","Mid-Day Meal Authority, Lucknow","This study has been supported by the Mid-Day Meal Authority, Lucknow.",,46,4,5,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

One area which has received relatively little attention however relates to the resilience of an agro-food supply chain, that is its ability to face and, if needed, to recover after a major disruption. The purpose of this paper is to study what factors, including characteristics of vertical links between upstream and downstream sectors, may make farmer-processor relationships more or less resilient to adverse shocks. Design/methodology/approach - To do so, the author uses a unique region-level data set on disruptions to dairy supply chain in Poland during the transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy. More specifically, using between-region variation, the author investigates why in some regions supply chain disruptions, measured as the breakdown of relationships between farmers and processing industry, were smaller than in other regions. Findings - The findings suggest that the supply chain which the author analysed was less resilient to crisis, i.e. the author observed larger disruptions to supply relations, when the supply base was more fragmented and when farmers had better outside options to market their produce via direct sales to consumers. In addition, dairy supply chain in Poland seemed to be less resilient in regions with larger share of the state-owned land. Research limitations/implications - The results come with several caveats. First, the empirical evidence comes from Poland during the specific period and thus it may not be easily generalised. Second, the results are based on historical correlations. Therefore, although they are robust across various specifications which the author estimates, they may not establish causal relationship due to some omitted variables or potential endogeneity issue. Finally, what the author uses here are region-level data. One may argue therefore that farm-level data would give more fine-tuned focus for testing impacts and theories regarding supply chain resilience. Originality/value - To the best of the author's knowledge, this paper is the first to provide some evidence on agro-food supply chain from this perspective.","[Falkowski, Jan] Univ Warsaw, Dept Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Falkowski, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Dept Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",jfalkowski@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Fałkowski, Jan/ABE-9726-2020","Fałkowski, Jan/0000-0001-6921-6342",COMPETE project by the European Commission,COMPETE project by the European Commission,Financial support from the COMPETE project provided by the European Commission is gratefully acknowledged.,,60,16,17,3,45,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In order to retain on the global market, organizations integrate corporate social responsibility into their business performance with the objective to reinforce their competitiveness. In the knowledge economy, where knowledge is a significant resource and the demand for more highly skilled workers has increased, employees became the most important and in fact the only remaining realistic challenge of competitive ability. Workplace wellbeing refers to mental, psychological or emotional aspect of employee's life. The awareness of management on the employees' wellbeing which takes into consideration the employees satisfaction, health and professional development is an effective approach in strengthening of an organizational performance. The aim of this paper is to analyse and assess how socially responsible orientation also incorporated in strategic human resource management can contribute to the achievement of wellbeing of employees. Strategic management of human resources includes the necessary coordination between various employees' health and performance aspects.

Questions focussed on intentions to purchase fresh cut lamb's lettuce from environmental sustainable farms, simulating a fresh cut product with an Eco-label. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The SEM technique is used to develop propositions representing a theoretical approach in the context of the process for purchasing fresh cut products. With regard to distinguishing between the motives, the authors referred to the approach that sets out two different types of motive: health and green. Findings - The resulting managerial implications make it possible to assess how much the different types of motive influence the attitude and affect the choices and the behavior of the consumers.

Furthermore, these cities were able to rely on their net assets to engage in deficit spending. These findings indicate that cities are relying on traditional strengths of local governments, but are also able to engage in the deficit spending that is typically characteristic of national governments. It also seems to be the case that grants for capital projects were largely transferred into highly liquid and spendable assets.","[Ross, Justin; Johnson, Craig] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Yan, Wenli] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Wilder Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Virginia Commonwealth University,"Ross, J (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 E Tenth St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",justross@indiana.edu; mushbb@gmail.com; crljohns@indiana.edu,"Ross, Justin/AAJ-5926-2020","Ross, Justin/0000-0001-6875-3234",,,,,29,27,31,1,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Consumers' expectations towards organic An exploratory survey in mature and emerging European organic food markets,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Marketing strategy; Organic foods; Expectation gap; Food differentiation,QUALITY; CONSUMPTION; DETERMINANTS,"Purpose - While the European organic regulation exists since more than 20 years consumers still do not seem to know what to expect from European Union (EU) labelled organic food. The purpose of this paper is to examine consumer expectations towards organic food in mature and emerging EU organic food markets. Design/methodology/approach - Online consumer survey data (n = 1,180; 2011) from Germany, the UK, Spain, and the Czech Republic are used to analyse the question: Which criteria would you expect of an organic food product labelled with the EU-organic label?. In total, 23 items including organic production criteria according to EC 834/07 and unregulated food quality criteria are tested. Mean value analysis and exploratory factor analysis are performed. Findings - Consumers expect organic food to be free from chemical pesticides and mineral fertilisers. In total, two factors affect consumers' expectations: naturalness of organic food products; additional sustainability aspects like, e.g. resource saving. However, several differences between the analysed countries exist. Although there does not seem to be a big gap between what consumers expect from organic food and what EU organic labelled products fulfil, some attributes might not mean the same to each consumer which could be a source of consumer disappointment. Practical implications - Consequently policy makers as well as market actors should take this risk seriously and use terms like naturalness only with great caution when promoting organic food. Originality/value - Further cross-country studies focusing on consumer expectations towards organic food are still needed, because until today only few studies deal with consumer and marketing issues in EU countries with different organic market development.","[von Meyer-Hoefer, Marie; Nitzko, Sina; Spiller, Achim] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev Mkt Food & Agr Prod, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"von Meyer-Höfer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev Mkt Food & Agr Prod, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",marie.von-meyer@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Spiller, Achim/CAJ-5518-2022",,,,,,53,46,46,1,54,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

International boundaries have, however, been drawn for political rather than ecological reasons. Ecosystem components often occur in more than one nation and are consequently subject to conflicting management and land-use practices. This research integrates the legal, institutional and environmental management components of transboundary biodiversity conservation to propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating the potential effectiveness of transboundary conservation regimes. The paper presents twelve criteria for the effective transboundary conservation of terrestrial biodiversity. These criteria can assist in the evaluation of existing initiatives and the design of future ones. The criteria will be of increasing importance as decision-makers seek to adapt to climate change and conserve biodiversity at all scales of political organization.","[Lim, Michelle] Griffith Univ, Griffith Law Sch, Arts Educ & Law Grp, Bldg G36,Room 3-76,Gold Coast Campus,Parklands Dr, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus,"Lim, M (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Law Sch, Arts Educ & Law Grp, Bldg G36,Room 3-76,Gold Coast Campus,Parklands Dr, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia.",michelle.lim11@gmail.com,,"Lim, Michelle/0000-0002-0559-0113",GEF/UNEP/UNU project 'Sustainable Land Management in the High Pamir and Pamir-Alai Mountains (PALM)-An integrated and transboundary initiative in Central Asia' [IMIS: GFL-2328-2770-4984],GEF/UNEP/UNU project 'Sustainable Land Management in the High Pamir and Pamir-Alai Mountains (PALM)-An integrated and transboundary initiative in Central Asia',"Parts of this research were carried out in the context of the GEF/UNEP/UNU project 'Sustainable Land Management in the High Pamir and Pamir-Alai Mountains (PALM)-An integrated and transboundary initiative in Central Asia' (Project number: IMIS: GFL-2328-2770-4984).

Similarly, cost efficiency analyses of 757 development programs reveal that (i) high performance of donors and beneficiaries is positively related to the amount of implementers they interact with, and (ii) programs connected by common actors are more cost efficient.

In this paper we describe the Peruvian Amazon Rural Livelihoods and Poverty (PARLAP) Project which seeks to identify the factors that contribute to rural poverty among indigenous and folk peoples through the first large scale survey conducted in this data poor region. Our paper draws upon a community census undertaken in four major river sub-basins in eastern Peru (n = 919 communities) and asks the question, how do environmental and market factors influence the economic orientation of rain forest communities? Recognizing that standard approaches that explain activity choice by current conditions are problematic because of potential-endogeneity, we propose a new analytical framework that examines how historical (initial) conditions determine current conditions and thus current economic activities. Our approach produces a rich array of results that point to the importance of initial environmental endowments and market access of communities in shaping their economic orientation, interacting in different ways depending on the key natural resource upon which they rely.

Features across landscapes that are important for pollination delivery include: nesting habitats, floral resource availability at foraging distance, and climate. The conditions for presence/absence of pollinators are therefore complex and rely upon a combination of biotic and abiotic factors. To date there has been no easily available method for landowners to determine the potential of pollination delivery across the land effectively and rapidly. In this paper we develop a method that uses freely available datasets to remotely estimate the relative provision of pollination service delivery provided by bees across Europe at a 300 m-pixel resolution. We then identify the potential pollination delivery and efficiency across Europe at country and regional level. This study illustrates an approach that obtains a first approximation for land managers to identify potential areas across landscapes to protect in order to enhance pollination service delivery.

The key argument is that linking climate and energy concerns can help to explain how the EU managed to adopt an ambitious package of policies aimed at achieving 2020 goals. The combination of differently valued issues, side payments to overcome distributional obstacles and the creation of synergies contributed to a successfully negotiated outcome. The consequences for implementation and further policy development towards 2030 are explained by challenges in reproducing these joint EU-level gains at national level and by new circumstances.

In theory, standard setters not only benefit from the possibility to monitor and shape the development of standards but also access a wide range of knowledge sources in the standards committee. Therefore, we investigate how the participation within formal standardization is related to the performance of 1561 German companies. A Cobb-Douglas production function is estimated in order to use the Solow-residuals as indicator for the firm performance. Participation within formal standardization is measured by the number of committee seats at the German Institute for Standardization (DIN). Our results suggest that participation within formal standardization is positively related to firm performance in the manufacturing sector. In the service sector, no clear evidence for such a relationship is found. This finding also holds true when we test if a service providers' intellectual property is well protected through patents.","[Wakke, Paul; Blind, Knut; Ramel, Florian] Tech Univ Berlin, Chair Innovat Econ, MAR 2-5,Marchstr 23, D-10587 Berlin, Germany; [Blind, Knut] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Endowed Chair Standardizat, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Blind, Knut] Fraunhofer Inst Open Commun Syst FOKUS, Kaiserin Augusta Allee 31, D-10589 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Fraunhofer Institute Center Schloss Birlinghoven,"Blind, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Chair Innovat Econ, MAR 2-5,Marchstr 23, D-10587 Berlin, Germany.;Blind, K (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Endowed Chair Standardizat, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Blind, K (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer Inst Open Commun Syst FOKUS, Kaiserin Augusta Allee 31, D-10589 Berlin, Germany.",knut.blind@tu-berlin.de,,"Blind, Knut/0000-0002-6510-122X",German Standardization Institute DIN e.V.,German Standardization Institute DIN e.V.,"The authors appreciate the valuable comments of two reviewers, which helped to improve the quality of the paper substantially.

The compensation system, including liability rules, insurance and government involvement, does not only concern to what extent the victims can be sufficiently compensated, but is also relevant to create incentives for the nuclear industry to enhance safety. International compensation regimes for nuclear damage started to emerge since 1960s, but still fail to engage some (potentially) big nuclear power ones. The Japanese and Chinese systems are such ones which received less attention until recently.

Therefore, it is difficult to determine precisely what are the causes of an increase or decrease in prices. The aim of this study is to analyse the spatial relationship among prices of agricultural land on the voivodeship level in years 2004-2014. The paper also presents the dynamics of change of average land price in this period. Before the accession to the European Union, the price of farmland in Poland was moderately increasing. Poland's accession to the European Union in 2004 caused a significant increase in the price of farmland in Poland. It increased fivefold over the analysed period. In the fourth quarter of 2004 the average price of farmland was PLN 6,810 per hectare, while in the first quarter of 2015 it was PLN 3 6,20 3. The average prices of farmland were also significantly diversified regionally. Analysing the local spatial relationships (with the local Moran's statistic), it can be noticed that from 2009 the farmland prices in Kujawsko-Pomorskie and Wielkopolskie voivodeships were significantly higher than in neighbouring regions. In years 2005-2008 and 2011-2014 the only voivodeship characterised by statistically significant local Moran's statistic value was Podkarpackie. In its surrounding regions (Malopolskie, Swietokrzyskie and Lubelskie) farmland prices were similar. Analysing the farmland prices, it can be noticed that in Podkarpackie voivodeship they were the lowest in Poland.","[Chrzanowska, Mariola] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Chrzanowska, M (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",mariola_chrzanowska@sggw.pl,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-224-8,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,,42,,,,,22,29,,,,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG6CQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389983700002,0

The growing export of agricultural and food products, among other indicators, characterizes rural vitality. Structural economic development changes cause employment transformations, both in rural and urban areas. The object of this study: agriculture and the transformation of Lithuanian youth labour force market in rural areas. The aim of the study: to analyze the economic transformations of agriculture and youth labour force changes in rural areas. Tasks of the study: to characterize the changes of agriculture and the human capital as a main agricultural resource; to characterize the main problems of youth labour force market in rural areas. The analysis shows that agricultural development causes the transformation in Lithuanian labour force market and is related with productivity growth of agricultural products. It is determined that human capital, including youth labour force, faces inside migration-rural region-urban region and emigration. The comparison of agricultural production by type of farming in the period of 2005-2014 showed not only the importance of farmer's and family farms but also the growing role of agricultural enterprises. The youth labour force market is compared with the youth labour force market in Latvia and other European Union Member States (EU). The youth labour force participation rate in Lithuania in all the analysed period is significantly lower than in Latvia or the EU but the unemployment level of youth labour force is more positive in Latvia and Lithuania in comparison with the EU.","[Ciburiene, Jadvyga] Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Ciburiene, J (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania.",jadvyga.ciburiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,18,2,2,1,10,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-224-8,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,,42,,,,,38,44,,,,,,7,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG6CQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389983700004,0

This is hampering their ability to adopt or co-develop innovation, and to participate in value chain exchanges. This calls for using intermediary organizations. The purpose of this paper is to understand how innovation intermediaries engage with smallholder farmers and provoke value chain reconfigurations. Design/methodology/approach - The authors systematically review literature to draw cases on intermediaries operating in the agri-food sector in several geographical and socio-economic contexts. The authors then adopt a theory building from cases approach to identify relationships between smallholder farmers and innovation intermediaries, and their effects in the reconfiguration of value chains. Findings - Consultants, knowledge transfer organizations (KTOs) and broker organizations (BOs) are the three typologies of intermediaries identified. While consultants facilitate change by modifying the way smallholders engage in transactions with their buyers and input providers, KTOs focus on farmers engagement in the value chain by stimulating the formation of knowledge platform or partnership. BOs operate in a similar way as compared to KTOs but mainly by forming and facilitating access to informal networks. Practical implications - The authors build a framework in which relationships between typologies of intermediary organizations and types of innovation processes are connected with changes at value chain level. Originality/value - The authors highlight how diverse forms of intermediations may stimulate not only smallholder farmers' participation in innovation networks but also value chain reconfigurations.","[Dicecca, Raffaele; Conto, Francesco] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Foggia, Italy; [Pascucci, Stefano] Wageningen Univ, Dept Management Studies, Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Foggia; Wageningen University & Research,"Dicecca, R (通讯作者)，Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, Foggia, Italy.",raffaele.dicecca@gmail.com,,,,,,,75,12,15,0,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Yet the ISEW/GPI approach to measuring the social costs of inequality has been criticized as ad hoc. The present paper reviews the literature on this topic and efforts to resolve it based on the construction of indicators grounded in: (a) a classical utilitarian ethical framework; and (b) empirical evidence on the relationship between income and well-being. In the United States, after-tax income per capita grew at an annual rate of 1.7% between 1979 and 2011. A growth rate of 1.2% per year arises when income is adjusted to account for the social costs of inequality. The most common adjustment used in ISEW/GPI studies yields a similar growth rate despite much smaller subtractions from baseline income.

However, there is currently little understanding of what these values are in relation to food waste. The purpose of this paper is to identify the values underpinning the specific behaviour of plate waste created in a residential foodservice setting. Design/methodology/approach - In semi-structured interviews (n = 50) laddering techniques were used to identify links from behaviours through individual's rationalisation for that behaviour to their personal values. The aim of the questioning was to uncover underlying drivers that lead to plate waste as well as those barriers to reducing it. Findings - The values identified as being most important are hedonism and self-direction. The specific aspects of these values for plate waste reduction interventions are not compromising on the individual's enjoyment of the meal and meeting their health goals. Effective interventions include pre-ordering meals, reducing food options provided, reducing plate size, removing food tray and finally, information campaigns to raise awareness. Originality/value - The study provides insights into the personal values that influence behaviours resulting in plate waste. The study is the first to determine the links between this behaviour, rationalisations for that behaviour and personal values.","[Mirosa, Miranda; Munro, Harriet; Mangan-Walker, Ella] Univ Otago, Dept Food Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Pearson, David] Univ Canberra, Fac Arts & Design, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Otago; University of Canberra,"Mirosa, M (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Food Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand.",miranda.mirosa@otago.ac.nz,"Mirosa, Miranda/L-2743-2015","Mirosa, Miranda/0000-0002-4476-3793",,,,,54,50,54,6,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Organic food consumers' price knowledge, willingness-to-pay and real purchase decision were examined in a comprehensive field study with 642 respondents. An innovative method was used to collect data for products that were truly relevant to the respondents: before entering the shop, respondents were asked about the items on their shopping list, the prices they expected to find and the maximum prices they were willing to pay. If respondents stated a willingness-to-pay value below the actual store price, they were approached again after shopping to verify their purchase decision. Findings - The great majority of respondents failed to estimate the correct store price. The deviation between the estimated price and the actual store price was on average 19.9 per cent. The respondents were willing to pay on average 52.7 per cent above store prices. It was revealed that in 67.0 per cent of the cases, respondents bought a product even though the store price was higher than the willingness-to-pay they stated upon entering the store. Practical implications - Category-specific insights into price knowledge and willingness-to-pay of organic consumers might be used for price differentiation strategies. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate organic consumers' item-and store-specific price knowledge, willingness-to-pay and real purchase decision in a single-source approach.","[Roediger, Manika; Plassmann, Sabine; Hamm, Ulrich] Univ Kassel, Dept Agr & Food Mkt, Witzenhausen, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Rödiger, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Dept Agr & Food Mkt, Witzenhausen, Germany.",m.roediger@uni-kassel.de,"Hamm, Ulrich/AAI-6552-2020; Hamm, Ulrich/F-7886-2013","Hamm, Ulrich/0000-0001-7444-3451",,,,,42,21,22,6,68,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Uluguru water catchment in Tanzania presents a compelling case for analysis. The catchment is currently under downstream-upstream conservation subsidy arrangement. However, lack of information on the long-term impacts of the approach on the functioning and distribution of benefits threatens its sustainability. Based on system dynamics framework, this study developed an integrated ecological-economic model to evaluate the long-term impacts of this arrangement on the functioning and distribution of benefits. The model was also used to compare the arrangement with other economic instruments in the same respect. Simulation results indicate that the scheme has a potential of securing conservation goals without compromising upstream well-being. Taxing crop inputs and outputs also has a potential securing conservation goal, but at the expense of upstream well-being. Tax cuts on inputs to tree fruit and basic domestic goods also secure conservation goals without compromising upstream well-being. These results show that a downstream-upstream subsidy scheme is better for achieving upstream land use externalities internalization without compromising distribution of benefits among beneficiaries and well-being of upstream land holders than taxing crop inputs and outputs.

Design/methodology/approach - Data were obtained from a survey conducted in Erzurum in 2014. A conjoint analysis was used to determine the utilities of each level along with the relative importance of Erzurum Civil cheese attributes for measuring the consumption satisfaction as an indicator of the purchase decision and priorities of Turkish consumers. Findings - The results of the study clearly highlighted that Erzurum Civil cheese consumption satisfaction was maximized with the augmented and actual product images redesigned by a private-labelled and local-branded simple product with the highest and medium prices based on organic production techniques for heavy and light consumers, respectively. However, medium consumers appreciated the core benefit obtained from the credence quality attributes supported by the generic branded simple cheese with the lowest price purchased directly from the farmstead villages. Eventually, these marketing tactics and strategies could increase demand, maximizing the cheese consumption and satisfaction of Turkish consumers in each cluster. They could also provide greater consumption satisfaction to Turkish consumers as well as bigger marginal contributions to the market dynamics of the food supply chain.

Design/methodology/approach - An Agent-Based Model (ABM) was developed that could incorporate both individual and group behaviour and allowed to evaluate the effect of various intervention strategies. For this purpose, a case study on the compliance of pig farmers with antibiotics legislation in the Netherlands was used. Findings - The effect of social factors (acceptance of legislation and social influence) on compliance levels was tested as well as the number of inspectors. This showed that the model can help to choose the most optimal intervention strategy depending on the input parameters.

To successfully reduce corporate environmental impacts, management not only needs to develop environmental strategies, it also has to use effective sustainability management tools for their implementation. There are many studies reported in the literature on sustainability management tools such as life cycle assessments or sustainability reports. However, with few exceptions little is known about the efficacy of these tools. We address this research gap by analyzing survey data from the largest companies of five industrialized countries and empirically test the impact of implementing sustainability management tools on key dimensions of corporate environmental performance. The findings show that the implementation of sustainability management tools does reduce environmental impacts per unit of revenue. However, different groups of tools are found to be effective for different purposes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To improve on energy security, governments undertake regulatory measures for promoting renewable energy, increasing energy efficiency, or curbing carbon dioxide emissions. The impacts of such measures on energy security are typically monitored by means of so-called energy security indicators. In this paper, we show that the common use of wide-spread energy security indicators falls short of providing a meaningful metric. Regulatory measures to improve on energy security trigger ambiguous effects across energy security indicators. We conclude that a major pitfall of energy security indicators is the lack of a rigorous microeconomic foundation. (C) 2015 Elsevier BM.

The case of the revaluation of gold coins in the Habsburg Netherlands in 1539, about which the sovereign and the public possessed similar information, is used as the benchmark to judge how far the speed of adjustment was affected by information asymmetry. This article is also part of the recent literature that estimates the degree of financial market integration in late medieval and early modern Europe. In the framework of the threshold autoregressive model, the speed of adjustment and the transaction costs associated with arbitrage are estimated, and the results are judged using the speed of communication as a benchmark since the flow of information played a critical role in financial arbitrage. The results reveal that the sixteenth-century London-Antwerp exchange markets were already as integrated as that during the late nineteenth century, but information asymmetry severely disturbed the effectiveness of exchange arbitrage.","[Li, Ling-Fan] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Hsinchu, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University,"Li, LF (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,48,7,7,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Historical research has focussed on the nineteenth century and the interwar period, with less attention to the strategies of smaller countries in the final transition from sterling to the dollar in the post-1945 period. This article examines the evolution of reserve currency policy from the perspective of Australia and New Zealand in the 1960s and early 1970s. As in the 1930s, economic uncertainty and a shift in global economic power prompted changes in reserves strategy. Patterns of trade and debt and falling confidence in British economic policy prompted a move away from sterling, but the timing and extent of this transition were affected by the fragility of the sterling exchange rate, lack of alternative assets, and continued dependence on the London capital market. The choices for Australia and New Zealand were thus constrained, but they were able to leverage their position as holders of sterling to engage in agreements that provided an exchange rate guarantee for their sterling holdings and continued access to the London capital market. This mitigated the effect of the final global transition from sterling to the dollar while protecting their interests.","[Singleton, John] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Sheffield S1 1WB, S Yorkshire, England; [Schenk, Catherine R.] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",Sheffield Hallam University; University of Glasgow,"Singleton, J (通讯作者)，Sheffield Hallam Univ, Sheffield S1 1WB, S Yorkshire, England.",,,"Schenk, Catherine/0000-0003-4116-5883","ESRC [RES-165-25-0004, RES-062-23-2423]; ESRC [ES/H026029/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H026029/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful for the assistance of staff at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Knowledge Centre, the National Archives in London and Wellington, the Australian Treasury, the Australian Office of Financial Management, the Reserve Bank of Australia Archives, and the Bank of England Archive.

A deeper understanding of the value plurality of key stakeholders may be called for to develop acceptable policies. We use the Q method to analyse the perceived and actual trade-offs related to Norwegian wildlife management, a source of prominent conflict in Norway. We identify and classify distinct arguments in the wildlife management debate following the ES framework, and use the Q method to explore extant/prominent narratives characterising stakeholders' perceptions of the importance of arguments about biodiversity and ES. Finally, we reflect on whether and to what extent the Q method can contribute to our understanding of resource conflicts, underlying values, and ES trade-offs. Three clear narratives appeared: Pro-sheep grazing (cultural), pro-carnivore conservation (intrinsic) and a middle position emphasising recreational hunting (utilitarian). Despite considerable disagreement among narratives, the Q analysis also revealed areas of common ground useful for developing acceptable policies. Given the inherent complexity of socio-ecological systems, it is useful to draw from a diverse toolbox of methods, including the Q method for ES analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, this study compares the assessment of environmental dependence between poverty groupings based on income and asset measures. Using a composite asset index, we were able to distinguish the asset poor from the asset non-poor. We then combined income data with the asset index, enabling us to disentangle the stochastic and structural nature of poverty. The distribution of poor and non-poor households based on income measures was significantly different from that based on asset measures. The income poor are substantially more dependent on environmental resources than the income non-poor (about 15% difference) while strikingly minimal difference was observed in environmental dependence between the asset poor and non-poor (less than 2% difference). The level of environmental dependence between the poor and non-poor households differs with the choice of welfare measure and combining two of these measures to identify wealth groups provides policy makers with better insight on the variations in environmental dependence.

We explore how an Ecuadorian payment program is associated with the development of rules to manage shared grazing lands. In addition, we assess the communal characteristics that make it more likely that a participant community will change their land-use rules. Our analysis draws from an almost complete census of participant communities in the Ecuadorian highlands (n = 44), a survey of non-participant communities (n = 23) and a household questionnaire (n = 420). We find that the majority of participant communities have strengthened their land-use rules since program participation. Communities that craft new rules and apply their rules are more likely to be organized and have internal monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. Poorer communities are also more likely to have made a rule change in response to participation; wealthier communities are more likely to maintain existent land-use institutions. We find no association between rule change and level of payment. Our results highlight the need to dis-aggregate the role of payments and contract commitment and to further analyze how community characteristics may influence the effectiveness and equity of PES in communal contexts.

In contrast to former studies for the U.S. and other western countries, we focus on China due to its crucial role in international climate policy in conjunction with its vulnerability to global warming. The empirical analysis is based on unique data from a survey among more than 1000 adults in five Chinese cities. In line with former studies, our results reveal that the vast majority of almost 90% of the Chinese respondents believes in the existence of global warming. This seems to be a convenient and necessary basis for the support of costly public adaptation activities in China. Our econometric analysis reveals that already perceived experiences with extreme weather events (and particularly heatwaves) alone are strongly correlated with climate change beliefs and that physical or financial damages due to these events lead to even stronger relationships. Our estimation results additionally suggest females as well as people with a lower education, in medium ages, with higher household incomes, and from Chengdu or Shenyang to be more skeptical toward the existence of climate change.

The willingness to pay (WTP) for the conservation programme ( 48) was mainly driven by perceived taxpayer responsibility and existence and use motives, while the WTP for the product (price premium of 14%) was to a larger extent associated with perceived purchaser responsibility. We identified four respondent groups: those who emphasized citizens or consumers' roles, indifferent and negative, which differed in terms of their conservation motivations, responsibility perceptions and WTP. Furthermore, the results emphasize that citizen and consumer roles overlap, and individuals may act as either or both in the context of a purchasing decision and a taxpayers' decision of policy support. Although the conservation programme received more support, future conservation could partly be based on the consumption of specialty products. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Accordingly, measures such as the 'goods intensity of household activities' and the 'energy and carbon intensity of household activities' have been derived. In this paper, we build on this approach by using time use data to model the direct and indirect energy use of households. From this, we present a decomposition analysis of the changes in the embedded and direct energy consumption of Finnish households from 1987 to 2009. Relevant questions that arise include that of whether increases in total energy consumption are due to changes in activity patterns, changes in the energy intensity of activities, or due to demographic changes. Beyond the empirical work, we suggest that time use approaches require a more explicit theorization of time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Extensive supply chains can negatively affect recovery through higher vulnerability to network disruption and positively through support from trading partners, easier search for new partners, and general benefits of agglomeration. Our results indicate that networks with firms outside of the impacted area contributed to the earlier resumption of production, whereas networks within the region contributed to sales recovery in the medium term.

Design/methodology/approach - A systematic online library search gathered 50 recent journal articles between the years 2004 and 2014. After common motivation and limitation factors were identified and reviewed, a Pareto analysis was performed. This is done to prioritise the motivation and limitation factors and ultimately revealed the major factors that influence the implementation of Halal food certification. Findings - A total of 36 motivation and 37 limitation factors were identified. Through Pareto analysis, 15 motivation factors accounted for 80.07 per cent and 20 limitation factors are responsible for 79.65 per cent. These factors are considered the major factors in implementing Halal food certification. Practical implications - For academicians, this study provides the most recent review of food safety and quality certification literature and the highlighted factors could assist in designing research instruments and set the foundation for future research endeavours. For industrialists, factors drawn from this study highlight the information critical for effective and efficient decision making. Originality/value - This paper is unique as it is the first study to review and analyse the relevant literature from which the authors synthesised the major factors in implementing Halal food certification. The result of this study will provide greater insights to researchers, food companies, and other stakeholders in an effort to encourage greater implementation of Halal food certification.","[Ab Talib, Mohamed Syazwan; Chin, Thoo Ai] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Johor Baharu, Malaysia; [Hamid, Abu Bakar Abdul] Univ Teknol Malaysia, UTM Int Business Sch, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Ab Talib, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Johor Baharu, Malaysia.",msyazwan79@live.utm.my,"Ab Talib, Mohamed Syazwan/U-8627-2018","Ab Talib, Mohamed Syazwan/0000-0001-8190-9096",,,,,87,38,39,2,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - First, a theoretical framework was developed using the reasoned action approach, innovation diffusion research, identity research, and the theory of structuration. Second, the framework was refined based on insights gained through semi-structured interviews with seven pork farmers and six pork farming experts on innovation decisions in general and added-value market adoption in particular. Findings - The farmer decision-making framework distinguishes personal characteristics, social influence related to reference groups, and the institutional context that determines the space for manoeuvre. The interviews reveal the importance of context specific factors, such as trust in policy and market requirements, and point at general mechanisms of path dependency as a result of previous decision making and social influence related to identity reference groups. Originality/value - The authors include feedback mechanisms between on the one hand social structure and institutional context, and on the other, farmer decision making. The framework is designed to explore the combined influence of factors of decision making on sector behaviour and study the relation between individual and collective behaviour.","[Ambrosius, Floor H.

Design/methodology/approach - An online survey was employed to collect data from consumers located in Chile (n = 283) and Australia (n = 300). A proposed model is tested with structural equation modelling. Findings - Attitude towards consuming local food is a strong and direct driver of intentions to purchase local food in both countries. Attitude towards supporting local agri-businesses and consumer ethnocentrism are found to positively impact attitude towards consuming local food in both countries. Attitude towards local agri-businesses also has a direct effect on intentions to purchase local food in Australia, but not in Chile. Interestingly, subjective norms are not found to affect intentions to consume local food in either country. Research limitations/implications - The paper examines factors affecting the attitude towards and behavioural intention regarding local food consumption and develops an extended model of local food consumption. An outcome of this new model is the inclusion of personal variables, which influence local food purchasing behaviour. Practical implications - Producers and retailers need to develop campaigns explaining how consuming local food supports local businesses and farmers, which will reinforce personal values associated with local consumption. Originality/value - This is the first study to demonstrate that positive attitudes towards local foods are important drivers of local food purchase behaviour, independent of the cultural characteristics or level of economic development within a country.","[Bianchi, Constanza] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Business, Santiago, Chile; [Mortimer, Gary] Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Mortimer, G (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",gary.mortimer@qut.edu.au,"Mortimer, Gary/AAW-5022-2021","Mortimer, Gary/0000-0001-5805-0551; Bianchi, Constanza/0000-0002-9056-4699",Conicyt [SOC 1105],Conicyt(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)),"The authors acknowledge the support of Conicyt for the Research Centre for International Competitiveness, project SOC 1105.",,85,87,93,3,79,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This paper reviews the impact and development of statutory and non-statutory cooking skills interventions in the UK and considers limitations in relation to life skills training. Currently practical cooking skills are mainly derived from two sources namely the non-statutory sector (community cooking interventions) and the statutory sector (Home Economics teaching). Design/methodology/approach - The paper compares the two interventions in terms of effective long-term outcomes. Non-statutory cooking interventions are generally lottery funded and therefore tend to be single teaching blocks of, on average, six to eight weeks targeting mostly low-income adults and the literature emphasises a deficit of empirical measurement of the long-term impact. In contrast Home Economics classes offer a structured learning environment across genders and socio-economic groups. In addition it is taught over a substantial time frame to facilitate a process of practical skills development (with relevant theoretical teaching), reflection, group communication and consolidation, where according to current educational theory (Kolb, 1984) learning is more thoroughly embedded with the increased potential for longer term impact. Findings - The review identifies the limitations of too many community initiatives or project-itis (Caraher, 2012, p. 10) and instead supports the use of the school curriculum to best maximise the learning of practical cooking skills. Originality/value - This review will be of particular value to educationalists and health policy decision makers.","[McDowell, Dawn; McMahon-Beattie, Una; Burns, Amy] Univ Ulster, Dept Hospitality & Tourism, Coleraine BT52 1SA, Londonderry, North Ireland",Ulster University,"McDowell, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ulster, Dept Hospitality & Tourism, Coleraine BT52 1SA, Londonderry, North Ireland.",dawnmcdowell68@gmail.com,,,,,,,51,5,5,0,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The paper also examines possible sociocultural differences between different tourist segments according to how they rate gastronomy in their motivations for travel. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected by means of 392 questionnaires distributed in Ljubjlana (Slovenia) and Cordoba (Spain). Various bivariate and multivariate statistical techniques are used to perform a comprehensive econometric study. Findings - Tourists exhibit greater interest in gastronomy as a travel motivation in the Spanish city, where they value aspects related to this activity more positively. However, the willingness to pay more to try traditional food is similar in both cities. No sociodemographic differences were found between the segments regarding the importance of gastronomy as a travel motivation. Research limitations/implications - Restaurateurs, hospitality associations, and other public or private stakeholders engaged in culinary tourism can benefit from this type of analysis. The study reveals the need to improve language skills, human capital formation, and the innovation of traditional dishes in the Spanish sample. It also shows that the future of culinary tourism in Slovenia will depend on enhancing the international visibility of this emerging tourism sector. Originality/value - Successful strategies to promote culinary tourism must take into account the views of its main target group, tourists. Many studies analyzing tourist profiles are mainly qualitative, with few providing a cross-country comparison. This analysis provides a comprehensive, quantitative econometric approach to tourists' opinions, and compares two different countries that differ in terms of their international visibility regarding this type of activity; specifically, Spain, which is a consolidated and world-renowned culinary tourism destination, and Slovenia, which is in the process of developing a culinary tourism project. Segmenting tourists based on their interest in culinary tourism also allows designing promotional strategies specifically tailored to each segment.","[Sanchez-Canizares, Sandra] Univ Cordoba, Business Adm, Cordoba, Spain; [Castillo-Canalejo, Ana M.] Univ Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain",Universidad de Cordoba; Universidad de Cordoba,"Sanchez-Cañizares, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cordoba, Business Adm, Cordoba, Spain.",sandra.sanchez@uco.es,"Castillo Canalejo, Ana María/AAF-6492-2020; Sanchez Canizares, Sandra M/H-4884-2019","Castillo Canalejo, Ana María/0000-0002-5193-2989; Sanchez Canizares, Sandra M/0000-0003-0705-3327",,,,,86,41,43,4,69,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The inter-industry effects are calculated using input-output tables; the technological change is estimated as the growth of total factor productivity. The calculated simple employment multipliers show that the textile and garment industry has the highest capacity to generate employment in all manufacturing industries via intra-and inter-industry linkages. The study suggests that there is a labor substitution on the production employees whereas the forward linkages induced by technological change in other industries have positive effects. However, there is no evidence regarding the backward linkages. The technological change has a positive effect on the administrative employees but a negative effect on the production labor in the skilled labor intensive industries.","[Lenger, Aykut] Ege Univ, Dept Econ, TR-35040 Bornova, Turkey",Ege University,"Lenger, A (通讯作者)，Ege Univ, Dept Econ, TR-35040 Bornova, Turkey.",aykut.lenger@ege.edu.tr,"Lenger, Aykut/AGI-2422-2022",", Aykut/0000-0002-5537-4419",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) [107K384],Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"I am grateful to Erol Taymaz and Anil Duman for their valuable comments and advices, and to Ebru Voyvoda, who generously shared her work on the harmonization of industries between the input-output tables and the international standard classification (ISIC).

The international community determined the meeting a success. This was a substantial change compared to the previous year's Copenhagen climate conference, which failed to reach consensus at the official level and thus having come under severe criticism as diplomatic failure. This article aims to explain the stark contrast between the two consecutive COP meetings and argues that the leadership style of the president of the conference is one important factor propelling negotiations forward. While the current literature scarcely addresses the role of the president, this article explores multiple variables that condition the president's effectiveness in moving negotiations forward. This article concludes that the Mexican government successfully chaired the negotiations with excellent agenda management and process management capability, which the Danish government lacked. In particular, its transparent and embracing manner in handling subgroup meetings and the production of a single negotiation text facilitated trust among negotiators, which in turn made the parties tend to cooperate better. More importantly, the case study reveals that the Mexican government had a significant influence on given conditions of the negotiation process, such as the international environment surrounding the negotiation and the decision-making rules.","[Park, Siwon] Kangwon Natl Univ, Sch Law, Chunchon, South Korea",Kangwon National University,"Park, S (通讯作者)，Kangwon Natl Univ, Sch Law, Chunchon, South Korea.",swpark@kangwon.ac.kr,,,,,,,36,9,9,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This requires investors to select and monitor entrepreneurs who would balance these triple concerns. At the same time, there has been considerable attention to small is beautiful and micro-investors have stepped in to look for such eco-entrepreneurs. To the classical institutional logic of economic returns, they add the logic of social returns as well as the logic of environmental and local safeguards. This study looks at investment clubs in France which have been coping with this balance of people, planet and profitability for the last three decades. We study their preferences in the selection process for investment projects, in the entrepreneurs' monitoring process as well as their exit strategies. Using Principal Components Analysis, we find that a large number of selection criteria can be regrouped into underlying factors that take into account two out of the three major dimensions of sustainable development at a time. We find that four factors lie beneath the criteria used by the micro-angels in the monitoring process.

We focus more specifically on China, a key player in climate negotiations. This is done by adopting the Imaclim-R model to assess the economic effect of carbon pricing on the Chinese economy in different climate architectures which, despite aiming at the same stabilization target, differ in terms of the temporal profile of emission reductions and the regional distribution of efforts (different quota allocation schemes). Model outcomes prove that neither temporal nor regional flexibilities provides a satisfactory answer since the Chinese economy remains significantly hurt at certain time periods. This suggests the recourse to complementary measures to carbon pricing in order to help smoothing the necessary shift toward a low-carbon society. This means in particular that, to build a climate policy architecture that could be compatible with the common but differentiated responsibility principle, climate negotiations must go beyond global top-down systems relying on cap-and-trade to include bottom-up measures likely to complement the carbon price and make carbon mitigation acceptable in countries like China.","[Hamdi-Cherif, Meriem; Waisman, Henri] ParisTech ENPC, CIRED, 45Bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Hamdi-Cherif, Meriem; Waisman, Henri] EHESS, CNRS, 45Bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France",AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Hamdi-Cherif, M (通讯作者)，ParisTech ENPC, CIRED, 45Bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.;Hamdi-Cherif, M (通讯作者)，EHESS, CNRS, 45Bis Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",hcmeriem@centre-cired.fr,,,EUFP7 Milesecure; ADEME; EDF; SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC; GRTgaz,EUFP7 Milesecure; ADEME; EDF(Electricite de France (EDF)); SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC; GRTgaz,"For their very helpful comments which contributed to improve the paper a lot, we thank the two anonymous referees.

Based on a survey of environmental ethics, we develop four concepts that are fundamentally important to fostering agreement in debates over Earth measurement frameworks among stakeholders with diverging belief systems. The four concepts can thus be used as criteria to evaluate the completeness and defensibility of existing measurement frameworks. The first two concepts, the consideration of broad human values and long time frames follow the landmark work by Bryan Norton. We further propose the adoption of the capital approach and precaution as the third and fourth concept, respectively.

We divide the factors influencing the rankings into three groups: physician characteristics, EMR characteristics and practice characteristics (type of practice, size, and location). The data are from approximately 1800 practicing physicians in Arizona. Physician's characteristics influence perceived ease of use and physicians' productivity, but not staff productivity, reliability or vendors' promised performance. Practice type and EMR characteristics affect perceived productivity, reliability and performance versus vendors' promises. Vendor-specific effects are highly correlated across all five attributes and are always jointly significant. EMR characteristics are the most significant influence on physicians' perceptions of the EMRs effect on their productivity and that of their staff.

The first is a spatially explicit measure of the impact of human consumption or 'demand' on ecosystem services as measured by the human appropriation of net primary productivity (HANPP) derived from population distributions and aggregate national statistics. The second is an actual measure of loss of productivity or a proxy measure of 'supply' of ecosystem services derived from biophysical models, agricultural census data, and other empirical measures. This proxy measure of land degradation is the ratio of actual NPP to potential NPP. The HANPP dataset suggests that current 'demand' for NPP exceeds 'supply' at a corresponding ecosystem service value of $10.5 trillion.per year. The land degradation measure suggests that we have lost $6.3 trillion per year of ecosystem service value to impaired ecosystem function. Agriculture amounts to 2.8% of global GDP. With global GDP standing at $63 trillion in 2010, all of agriculture represents $1.7 Trillion of the world's GDP. Our estimate of lost ecosystem services represent a significantly larger fraction (similar to 10%) of global GDP. This is one reason the economics of land degradation is about a lot more than the market value of agricultural products alone. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We combined psychographic analysis and economic valuation to: i) identify different psychographic profiles based on attitudes towards the economy and environment, rural development and agricultural intensification, food quality and consumption, and agri-environmental policy; and ii) measure the economic value that the psychographic profiles assign to key ecosystem services in different agricultural policy scenarios. We analysed two populations in Spain (the general population and the local residents of the study area). We identified two psychographic profiles in each population focusing on productivist and conservationist attitudes. Respondents in all profiles were highly concerned about forest wildfires, followed by the availability of quality products for those with productivist profiles, the biodiversity maintenance for the general conservationists and a more human-intervened landscape for the local conservationists. The willingness to pay for ecosystem services altogether differed between the psychographic profiles, from 88 of general productivists to 334 of local conservationists. We demonstrated that attitudes concerning ecosystem services have a strong influence on their willingness to pay. We argued that psychographic differences should be considered when designing and legitimising EU agri-environmental and conservation policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, I evaluate the utility of crowdsourcing as a tool for participatory agenda-setting in the realm of post-2015 sustainable development policy. In particular, I analyze the descriptive representativeness (e.g., the degree to which participation mirrors the demographic attributes of non-state actors comprising global civil society) of participants in two United Nations orchestrated crowdsourcing processes-the MY World survey and e-discussions regarding environmental sustainability. I find that there exists a perceptible demographic imbalance among contributors to the MY World survey and considerable dissonance between the characteristics of participants in the e-discussions and those whose voices were included in the resulting summary report. The results suggest that although crowdsourcing may present an attractive technological approach to expand participation in global governance, ultimately the representativeness of that participation and the legitimacy of policy outputs depend on the manner in which contributions are solicited and filtered by international institutions.","[Gellers, Joshua C.] Univ N Florida, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA",State University System of Florida; University of North Florida,"Gellers, JC (通讯作者)，Univ N Florida, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA.",josh.gellers@unf.edu,"Gellers, Joshua Chad/X-8967-2019","Gellers, Joshua Chad/0000-0002-8690-8030",,,,,65,42,43,2,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Given that both countries are expected to have similar incentives when managing the distribution of technology transfer within the country, why do sub-national patterns in the allocation of projects with technology transfer differ? Using comparable political-economic data compiled for China and India, we offer an explanation for these differences. In China, where the government regards the CDM as a tool for achieving sustainable development, technology transfer is concentrated in provinces that need it the most and that are most conducive to receiving transfers (i.e., economically less developed, yet heavily industrialized provinces). In India, where the government takes on a laissez-faire approach to the CDM, neither level of economic development nor that of industrialization affects clean technology transfer. In this regard, although the incentives are similar, the capacity to pursue them is not comparable. We test these hypotheses using data on CDM technology transfer across Chinese provinces and Indian states during the 6-year period from 2004 to 2010.","[Bayer, Patrick] Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Program Int & Area Studies, One Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Urpelainen, Johannes] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 420 W 118th St,712 IAB, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Xu, Alice] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Columbia University; Harvard University,"Bayer, P (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Program Int & Area Studies, One Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",patrickbayer@wustl.edu; ju2178@columbia.edu; alicexu@g.harvard.edu,,"Bayer, Patrick/0000-0003-1731-1270",Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes; Columbia University; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes; Columbia University; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),This article was written during a research stay funded by an ERP fellowship of the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes.

Treaties provide a means for states to coordinate their actions in managing international river disputes to minimize these losses. However, there is little knowledge about treaty content and the factors influencing treaty design. We test whether a relationship exists between the challenges of negotiating, complying, and distributing the gains in bilateral, multilateral, and basin-wide negotiation contexts and the depth of cooperation along with the degree of institutionalization. While the great challenges confronting multilateral or basin-wide negotiations can produce treaties that focus on joint gains and shallow cooperation to secure the signature of riparians, we find that they can also provide opportunities for deeper, more behavior-altering, cooperation. To manage the difficulties of maintaining multilateral cooperation, we find a higher degree of institutionalization. We also find that bilateral negotiations provide states with opportunities for deeper cooperation, but a lower degree of institutionalization.","[Zawahri, Neda A.] Cleveland State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 2121 Euclid Ave RT 1757, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA; [Dinar, Ariel] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Nigatu, Getachew] USDA, Market & Trade Econ Div, Econ Res Serv, Economist, 335 E St, Washington, DC 20024 USA",University System of Ohio; Cleveland State University; University of California System; University of California Riverside; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Zawahri, NA (通讯作者)，Cleveland State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 2121 Euclid Ave RT 1757, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",N.zawahri@csuohio.edu; Ariel.dinar@ucr.edu,,,,,,,72,14,14,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Thus, we defend that the conditions of hunger, underweight, overweight, and obesity are seen as anomalies resulting from nutritional and dietary food insecurity related to the concept of malnutrition. Design/methodology/approach - This investigation was conducted through an ecological study, using indicators related to undernourishment, underweight, and overweight. Data, obtained through the WHO and United Nations, were analyzed through scatter plots and angular coefficient from linear regression. Findings - Evidence suggests that some nations have high levels of undernourished and overweight populations at the same time. Results showed a significant reduction in the prevalence of underweight children and a significant increase in the prevalence of overweight children worldwide. Western Pacific has shown declining trends in both overweight and underweight children. Southern Africa has shown a strong increase in its child overweight population and no downward trend in its underweight child population. Practical implications - The authors defend that programs and actions better aligned to diagnoses of some countries that face problems related to both underweight and overweight/obesity conditions are needed. This investigation can help public and private efforts to combat underweight and overweight diagnoses worldwide. Originality/value - The authors present evidence of the co-occurrence of underweight and overweight in child populations worldwide. Thus, the authors show alarming trends regarding to these diagnoses.","[Abbade, Eduardo Botti; Dewes, Homero] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Ctr Agribusiness Studies CEPAN, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Abbade, Eduardo Botti] Franciscan Univ Ctr, Business Adm, Dept Social Sci, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Dewes, Homero] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Biophys, Biosci Inst, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Abbade, EB (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Ctr Agribusiness Studies CEPAN, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.;Abbade, EB (通讯作者)，Franciscan Univ Ctr, Business Adm, Dept Social Sci, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.",edabbade@hotmail.com,"Dewes, Homero/I-6202-2013; Abbade, Eduardo/J-1642-2015","Abbade, Eduardo/0000-0002-0552-0051",,,,,74,1,1,2,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is theoretical and empirical in nature. In the theoretical part, the cognitive-critical analysis of the world's literature on marketing and marketing management was applied. In the empirical part the following research methods were used: questionnaire survey for gathering primary data and statistical analysis (factor analysis and the Kruskal-Wallis independence test) for the analysis of the primary data and for statistical reasoning, which formed the basis for the final conclusions. Findings - On the basis of the research, one can conclude that the analysed demographic characteristics of the respondents (age, gender, level of education) influence the structure of their expectations towards dairy product packaging, thereby determining their purchase decisions. The dependence does not exist only between the growth of pro-environmental expectations and the increase of the respondents' level of education. However, this does not change the fact that level of education correlates with expectations related to other features of dairy product packaging, thus determining their structure. Originality/value - The original contribution of this paper to theory is the identification of Polish customers' expectations towards elements of dairy product packaging and the description of their structural diversity, depending on the recipients' demographic characteristics in terms of their purchase decisions taken thanks to the fact that their expectations concerning the features of packaging are fulfilled. This knowledge can make it easier to effectively manage dairy product packaging as a tool of influencing on customers and properly shape their marketing potential by offerors. It determines the applicability of the research results and the conclusions drawn from them.","[Baruk, Agnieszka Izabela] Lodz Univ Technol, Org & Management Fac, Syst Management & Innovat Dept, Lodz, Poland; [Baruk, Agnieszka Izabela; Iwanicka, Anna] Univ Life Sci, Agrobioengn Fac, Management & Mkt Dept, Lublin, Poland",Lodz University of Technology,"Baruk, AI (通讯作者)，Lodz Univ Technol, Org & Management Fac, Syst Management & Innovat Dept, Lodz, Poland.",agnieszka.baruk@poczta.onet.pl,"Baruk, Agnieszka/M-4470-2018","Baruk, Agnieszka/0000-0003-2864-509X",,,,,50,11,13,3,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 17 community-dwelling older adults used cards with names of food preparation methods and cooking equipment items to do one open sort and three closed sorts about: food preparation method classifications; food preparation method use frequency; kitchen equipment use frequency; and essential vs non-essential kitchen equipment. Descriptive statistics, cluster analysis, and qualitative thematic analysis were performed. Findings - Participants classified food preparation methods using multiple dimensions: ways to alter food, inputs, location, timing, and personal behavior. They used a wide range of food preparation methods and kitchen equipment items in routine cooking. The mean number of the 38 preparation methods sorted as used often was 16.5 +/- 5.0. In total, 15 of the 17 participants reported using more than 20 of the 40 equipment items often. The mean number of equipment items identified as essential was 21.5 +/- 9.3. Practical implications - Food professionals should consider access to equipment and food preparation skills and preferences when designing products and working with consumers. Addressing gaps in human and material capital may support adoption of food preparation practices. Originality/value - Food preparation method and equipment use frequency has rarely been examined from the household cook's perspective. Using card sorts is a novel approach to examining consumer classification of an extensive list of preparation methods and kitchen equipment.","[Bostic, Stephanie M.; Bisogni, Carole A.; Sobal, Jeffery] Cornell Univ, Div Nutr Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Bostic, SM (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Div Nutr Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",stephanie.bostic@gmail.com,,,Division of Nutrition Sciences at Cornell University,Division of Nutrition Sciences at Cornell University,"The authors thank the Tompkins and Schuyler County Offices for the Aging for their support for recruitment.

J,"Charlebois, S; McCormick, M; Juhasz, M",,,,"Charlebois, Sylvain; McCormick, Maggie; Juhasz, Mark",,,Meat consumption and higher prices Discrete determinants affecting meat reduction or avoidance amidst retail price volatility,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Beef; Proteins; Food price,FOOD RECALLS; DEMAND; CONSUMERS; HEALTH; IMPACT; PERFORMANCE; RED; PERCEPTIONS; NETWORK; GENDER,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate if sudden retail price increases for beef products have affected consumers purchasing behaviors. Little research has been conducted that integrates retail price volatility with subdued food consumption motivations. Prior research about consumers' meat-purchasing habits and systemic concerns linked to sustainability and animal welfare is limited or de-contextualized. This study also attempts to assess if retail price increases have triggered a change in perception of the meat industry, by looking at specific values related to animal protein production and consumption. Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on an inductive, quantitative analysis of primary data obtained from a survey on beef consumption. For convenience and validity, all respondents had to be living in Canada for 12 months, and were at least 18 years old. The choice of country is not trivial. First, access to data were convenient for this study. Second, and most importantly, Canada has supply managed commodities that include poultry and chicken. In effect, Canada produces the amount of chicken it needs. Beef production is vulnerable to market volatility. As a result, demand-focussed market conditions for one often influence conditions for the other. Findings - Findings indicate that higher prices have compelled 37.9 percent of the sample to reduce or to stop beef consumption altogether in the last 12 months. Beyond the issue of price, sustainability, food safety and health appear to be significant factors, more so than ethics (animal welfare). Results also show that education can be considered as a determinant for sustainable aspects of beef production when prices increase. Age and gender had no statistical significance on survey results. Some limitations are presented and future research paths are suggested. Research limitations/implications - Since the sample in this study was mainly composed of consumers based in Canada, the generalizations of the findings should be approached with some caution. The same research should be conducted with consumers from other parts of the Western world to verify if the results can be generalized. Practical implications - This survey help the authors to understand some aspects of beef consumption at retail. Findings of this empirical study have implications for future communications to consumers, in that greater emphasis should be given to the connection consumers have with other nutritional alternatives. Since meat consumption in the Western world is intrinsically linked to culinary traditions, behaviors can be challenging to change. Social implications - The economic implications of a rapid adoption of a plant-based diet for the agricultural economy would be significant. However, the reality is that according to many studies of consumer behavior, customers still place a higher value on buying and eating meat than on any other food group. Canada's relationship with animal proteins has deep cultural roots, particularly during holidays and summertime. Originality/value - The present study has given important insights into the determinants of meat consumption reduction, a behavior which could both have long-term economic implications for the cattle and beef industries. This paper provides a deeper insight into some socio-economic factors that contribute to slow erosion of meat consumption reduction, and the effects of higher prices at retail. This is, as far as the authors know, likely the first study of its kind.","[Charlebois, Sylvain] Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Guelph, ON, Canada; [McCormick, Maggie] Univ Guelph, Ontario Coll Agr, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Juhasz, Mark] Univ Guelph, Coll Business & Econ, Guelph, ON, Canada",University of Guelph; University of Guelph; University of Guelph,"Charlebois, S (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Guelph, ON, Canada.",sylvain.charlebois@dal.ca,,"Charlebois, Sylvain/0000-0002-9400-0153",,,,,61,21,23,4,90,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The analysis focuses on: assessing methodological differences between studies; highlighting the variation of monetary values across different ecosystem service types; and identifying and discussing future research needs. Based on a systematic search, our data set consists of 12 studies published in peer-reviewed journals in English, dealing with 72 forest ecosystem services. Our results suggest that domestic literature is affected by elusive categorization of ecosystem services and methodological inconsistencies. The wide variation in monetary values of Chinese forest ecosystem services, a phenomenon also observed in global level reviews, can be partially explained by the methodological heterogeneity of the studies, Future research could benefit from a strengthened and more standardized methodological approach, drawing from relevant methods and indicators employed in the reviewed domestic articles, as well as from insights and solutions proposed in the international empirical and conceptual literature. The exceptional forest restoration policy landscape coupled with the increasing establishment of commercial plantations offer important research opportunities for monetary valuation in China. Efforts should be directed towards assessing marginal values of ecosystem services in land-use changes over time, and benefit flows among different stakeholders. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Retailers are not interested in new technologies per se, but whether new technologies and the products made using them provide clearly identifiable benefits to consumers. These products must carry minimum risk for the retailer and there is a clear need for benefits to be communicated in commercial rather than technological terms to both retailers and consumers. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation is that the study is based on interviews with retailers and suppliers in three countries. Practical implications - Food suppliers developing new products based on novel technologies need to identity and communicate clear benefits to consumers if their products are to be adopted by grocery retailers.

The study used the method of document analysis and diagnostic survey with an interview questionnaire addressed to the heads of municipalities. LAGs' local development strategies as well as the official websites of associations and projects of cooperation were the source of information about the LAGs. As shown, the investigated LAGs constitute an important but under-used instrument for creating local development, basing on the innovative use of local resources in supra-local projects.

Design/methodology/approach - A check was done for associations between the compliance of reported serving sizes, energy values per serving and energy density for regular foods and foods advertised at diet/light (with reduced fat and calories). Findings - The data included information from 451 dairy product labels. Most of the products had serving sizes smaller than the reference set by Brazilian law. A high variability of serving sizes was found for similar products. Diet/light foods tend to report serving sizes that are even smaller and more inadequate. Moreover, the energy density of these products was similar to that of the regular foods. Smaller serving sizes may be being presented on diet/light foods in order to report lower energy values and on similar foods to show non-existent differences in energy values. These results point to the importance of standardizing serving size information on food labels so that consumers have access to clear and accurate information about food products. Originality/value - This was the first census-type study to analyse the serving size information of dairy products at a supermarket of one of the ten largest supermarket chains in Brazil.

Contemporary animal husbandry systems are being increasingly critically addressed by media; however, there is no information about peoples' perceptions and attitudes concentrating precisely on specific animal husbandry systems. The purpose of this paper is to explore citizens' perceptions, expectations and main points of criticism in regard to intensive pig production in Germany, and to identify and describe distinct population groups reflecting different attitudes. Design/methodology/approach - A mixed method approach combining qualitative focus groups with a quantitative online survey has been employed. Focus groups capture a wide variety of opinions and concerns in an exploratory manner. Based on these findings, the quantitative survey (n = 1,500 citizens) allowed the identification and characterisation of population groups with identical attitudes regarding pig husbandry. Findings - Qualitative research uncovered a huge range of criticism on pig husbandry, e.g. lack of space, frequency and prophylactic use of medications as well as a lack of care. A relationship was seen between the lack of space, widespread use of medications and behavioural disorders. Consumer preferences for buying cheap meat were believed to be part of the problem since this behaviour fosters the development of larger farms. Quantitative research confirmed the generally critical perception and identified three population groups. Only one third of the population was really concerned about animal husbandry. Younger people and people with better knowledge of agriculture were stronger opponents of intensive pig husbandry. Practical implications - Results indicate that increasing people's knowledge may have an adverse effect on their acceptance of modern farming systems. More communication and better information strategies will probably not improve societal acceptance by itself. Instead, agricultural production systems need to be improved to meet better consumers' expectations whereas communicating these improvements to consumers and the general public in a well-targeted manner will be required as well. Originality/value - When considering options for enhancing public acceptance of modern animal husbandry, a combination of different strategies by different stakeholders is needed. The agricultural sector should improve its communication with the general public and rethink its production practices against the background of public expectations. The government and its agencies urgently need to improve monitoring of the compliance of actual production practices with existing laws and to enforce them. Additionally, adjustments of current regulations of animal husbandry in light of public expectations should be considered.","[Weible, Daniela; Christoph-Schulz, Inken; Salamon, Petra; Zander, Katrin] Thunen Inst Market Anal, Braunschweig, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute,"Weible, D (通讯作者)，Thunen Inst Market Anal, Braunschweig, Germany.",daniela.weible@thuenen.de,"Zander, Katrin/H-8803-2016","Weible, Daniela/0000-0002-2923-6020",Stiftung Westfalische Landschaft,Stiftung Westfalische Landschaft,The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for this research provided by the Stiftung Westfalische Landschaft.

A coupling model was established on the base of general Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) model to better understand the roles of economic growth and other factors to sandy desertification in an integrated framework. To avoid the bias owing to the data discordance and the autocorrelation in time series data, Unit Root Test was applied and an ARDL model was established to improve the EKC model. The results showed that there was a positive linear correlation between the extremely severe sandy desertification per capita and the real agricultural GDP per capita in the short run, while there was a Kuznets Curve in the long run, showing the effect of economic growth as both the pressure on land and the capability to alleviate the risk of sandy desertification in different phases. The effect of economic growth on sandy desertification was greatly influenced by exogenous factors, including strategy factors, climatic factors and the extent of sandy desertification itself.

Measuring economies of scope facilitates the assessment of the benefits from output diversification versus specialization for operators and provides a metric for explaining and predicting trends towards specialization or diversification. However, the current literature on economies of scope provides little insight into the potential trade-off between the benefits of diversification and the presence of inefficiency in production and decision making. To remedy this shortcoming, this paper develops a measure of an effective (or behavioral) measure of scope economies which measures the benefits of diversification accounting for the contributions of allocative, congestion and technical efficiency in scaling the perfectly efficient version of scope economies. The application focuses on measuring and explaining economies of scope on Dutch crop farms.","[Lansink, Alfons Oude; Stefanou, Spiro E.] Wageningen Univ, Business Econ Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Stefanou, Spiro E.] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Educ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Kapelko, Magdalena] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Inst Appl Math, Dept Logist, Wroclaw, Poland",Wageningen University & Research; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Lansink, AO (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Business Econ Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",alfons.oudelansink@wur.nl; SpiroS@psu.edu,"Stefanou, Spiro/V-5770-2017; Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/H-8840-2012; Kapelko, Magdalena/F-3788-2016","Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/0000-0002-9273-6044; Kapelko, Magdalena/0000-0003-2020-2374",,,,,38,6,6,1,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

We concentrate on the specific case of market-based or monetary valuation (MV) as an instance of 'commodification in discourse' and argue that it can have the same moral problems as real commodification. We aim to bring together insights from philosophy (pluralistic value theory), ethics (corruption), economics and psychology (crowding-out) to argue that there are good reasons to think about how and when to apply MV in environmental cases. On the basis of this interdisciplinary analysis and in order to promote further empirical research, we develop four empirically falsifiable hypotheses. (i) Commodification in discourse can bring about real commodification. (ii) MV can have framing and crowding effects on those who come into contact with it. (iii) Intrinsic motivation is more robust than extrinsic motivation and leads less to freeriding. (iv) MV's framing and crowding effects can decrease (demand and support for) environmental protection. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Until now, both communities have deployed unilateral, tactical methods to securitise the water discourse by linking it to high politics; yet, the situation remains deadlocked. Processes by which the water discourse in Cyprus acquired multiple meanings of securitisation over time and across different groups remains understudied, as does the concept of asecurity. We suggest moving water management in Cyprus into an asecuritisation realm, where decision-making processes are founded on a shared social identity with water acting as a unifying agent. Based on empirical findings from multiple methods employed dealing with social dilemmas involving scarce natural resources, we conclude that an alternative way of organizing political space with no a priori reference to the securitisation logic would create new opportunities for transforming the discourse beyond the political lock-in and incorporating bi-communal dynamics into natural resource management, laying the groundwork for future cooperation on other emblematic issues.","[Zikos, Dimitrios] Humboldt Univ, Inst Agr Econ, Div Resource Econ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Sorman, Alevgul H.] Autonomous Univ Barcelona UAB, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Lau, Marisa] Cyprus Inst, Sci & Technol Archaeol Res Ctr, Nicosia, Cyprus",Humboldt University of Berlin; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Zikos, D (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Inst Agr Econ, Div Resource Econ, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",dimitrios.zikos@agrar.hu-berlin.de,,"Sorman, Alevgul H./0000-0001-9935-5140; Zikos, Dimitrios/0000-0001-7066-5591",EU project ENTITLE (European Network of Political Ecology); EU project GoverNat (Multi-level Governance of Natural Resources: Tools and Processes for Water and Biodiversity Governance in Europe); EU project PRIO (The Peace Research Institute-Cyprus Center); EU project AGAUR (The Catalan Agency for the Management and Support of University Research under the International Catalan Institute for Peace),EU project ENTITLE (European Network of Political Ecology); EU project GoverNat (Multi-level Governance of Natural Resources: Tools and Processes for Water and Biodiversity Governance in Europe); EU project PRIO (The Peace Research Institute-Cyprus Center); EU project AGAUR (The Catalan Agency for the Management and Support of University Research under the International Catalan Institute for Peace),"We would like to acknowledge the support of the EU projects ENTITLE (European Network of Political Ecology) and GoverNat (Multi-level Governance of Natural Resources: Tools and Processes for Water and Biodiversity Governance in Europe), PRIO (The Peace Research Institute-Cyprus Center) and AGAUR (The Catalan Agency for the Management and Support of University Research under the International Catalan Institute for Peace) for their funding during the research; the people of Alakoy, Bellapais and Panagia for their enthusiasm and participation, Ayse Salkim, Sertac, Sonan, Gonul Sorman, Petros and Androulla Papasozomenou for the local support.

Most studies focus on short-term damage estimates, but evaluating exclusion or prevention measures requires estimates of total anticipated damages from the time of establishment onward. The magnitude of such damages critically depends on the timing of damages relative to a species arrival because costs are discounted back to the time of establishment. Using theoretical simulations, we illustrate how (ceteris paribus) total long-term damages, and hence the benefits of prevention efforts, are greater for species that a) have short lags between introduction and spread or between arrival at a location and initiation of damages, b) cause larger, short-lived damages (as opposed to smaller, persistent damages), and c) spread faster or earlier. We empirically estimate total long-term discounted impacts for three forest pests currently invading North America gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), and etherald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) - and discuss how damage persistence, lags between introduction and spread, and spread rates affect damages. Many temporal characteristics can be predicted for new invaders and should be considered in species risk analyses and economic evaluations of quarantine and eradication programs.

Such conflicts are evident in Australia's utilisation,of the iconic kangaroo (Macropus) species for their meat and hides. Like many wild animal industries, kangaroos are an open access resource, although restrictions built into the management regime ensure that rents are, approximately, maximised. However, resource allocation decisions and the distribution of rents reflect the values and objectives of the economically powerful stakeholders and particularly commercial processors. Thus, rents are not distributed equitably and the management regime excludes animal protection advocates from adequate participation. Thus, an external cost occurs when kangaroos are harvested that must be internalised for economic efficiency to be achieved. We propose a tradeable permit system where landholders, shooters and processors compete with ordinary citizens for the right to harvest kangaroos. This increases the private cost of harvest and internalises the external cost. It also improves the equity of rent distribution with landholders able to earn a return from kangaroos on their land. As similar issues arise in the utilisation of other wild animals, the research provides an important contribution to the literature on the economics of animal welfare. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The organization and structure of this sector has become an important political question. We use panel data from the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate to address this issue. Specifically, we use input distance functions to examine scale economies, technical change and technical efficiency in the distribution companies. In modeling technically inefficiency, we separate company-specific effects from inefficiency. Our results show that the potential for scale economies is generally highest among small companies. To some extent, this finding is related to the structure of small companies and is likely to have future policy implications.","[Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY USA; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] Norwegian Agr Econ Res Inst, Oslo, Norway; [Amundsveen, Roar; Kvile, Hilde Marit] Norwegian Water Resources & Energy Directorate, Oslo, Norway; [Amundsveen, Roar] Univ Nordland, Bodo, Norway; [Lien, Gudbrand] Lillehammer Univ Coll, Fac Econ & Org Sci, N-2604 Lillehammer, Norway",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Norwegian Water Resources & Energy Directorate; Nord University; Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences,"Lien, G (通讯作者)，Lillehammer Univ Coll, Fac Econ & Org Sci, N-2604 Lillehammer, Norway.",gudbrand.lien@hil.no,,"Lien, Gudbrand/0000-0003-3424-4401",,,,,28,23,24,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The aim of this paper is to show that composite indicators can be safely used, provided that rankings are built via uncertainty analysis rather than using a single composite. For this purpose, the approach we follow first combines different normalisation, aggregation rules, and weighting systems to calculate many different composites, and then derives the rankings from the frequency distribution of the rankings of each competitor according to each composite. Such an approach appears to be a good compromise between the need for a more concise overview when looking at many variables and the loss of relevant information occurring when indicators are aggregated into a single composite indicator. To illustrate the approach, we rank EU Countries in terms of their sustainability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Since 2009, a growing literature has shared a common language based on a similar, though not identical, methodology. As never before, this new generation of studies is built upon long series of quantitative data and international comparisons of nominal wages and prices which, in some cases, cover the whole Early Modern Era. Part of this literature also complements the examination of economic welfare using height as an indicator of biological welfare. Inequality is also quantitatively approached in one of the works discussed. In spite of significant similarities, some methodological differences lead to contrasting results. For the sake of simplicity, the relevant literature is divided into two views: pessimism and optimism. It is my contention that the latter is more consistent with the available evidence.","Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Hist & Inst Econ 2, Pozuelo De Alarcon, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Dobado-González, R (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Hist & Inst Econ 2, Pozuelo De Alarcon, Spain.",rdobado@ccee.ucm.es,,,"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECON2008-01989/ECON, ECO2011-26286]; Tinker Professorship",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Tinker Professorship,"The research from which this paper draws has been financed by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (ECON2008-01989/ECON and ECO2011-26286) and a Tinker Professorship held by the author at the Columbia University in 2010.

Design/methodology/approach - The green claims of Starbucks were chosen as the research target for this study not only because the coffee chain store is working on the Starbucks Shared Planet' program, which makes a commitment to do business in ways that are good for people and the planet, but also because such a program can be categorized into three major green message elements on the basis of the product lifecycle. A total of 920 valid self-reported questionnaires collected in Taiwan were used for this empirical analysis. Findings - One-way ANOVA results reveal that all of the three green claims of Starbucks can lead to consumers building up the same level of green brand image of this company, with ethical sourcing significantly possessing more impacts on the other green psychological variables (i.e. green trust, green satisfaction, green brand equity, and green purchase intention). Practical implications - The empirical results and findings from this study are helpful to the coffee industry marketers if they, in formulating various promotion campaigns, can communicate with the consumers with an eye to increasing their green brand image and other green psychological variables, including green purchase intention. Originality/value - This study is among the first to introduce different types of green claims on a basis of the product lifecycle to examine whether or not consumers' green psychological variables will be different.","[Chen, Mei-Fang] Tatung Univ, Dept Business Management, Taipei 104, Taiwan; [Lee, Chia-Lin] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Business & Management, Taipei, Taiwan",Tatung University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Chen, MF (通讯作者)，Tatung Univ, Dept Business Management, Taipei 104, Taiwan.",mfchen@ttu.edu.tw,,,,,,,70,36,41,8,99,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors adopt the perspectives of retail service to develop a model to address how food quality, relational benefit, and personnel service affect consumers' satisfaction. A sample of 250 consumers was surveyed in a major wet market at Taiwan. Findings - The results obtained from the partial least square (PLS) method reveal that food quality and relational benefit positively affect consumers' satisfaction, and the effects of these increase with time; employee service has a positive effect on consumers' satisfaction, but the effect decreases with time; and the ambience does affect consumer satisfaction, but the store design does not. Originality/value - This paper provides empirical answers to the question about why wet markets still play a critical role in the food retailing industry in a newly industrial economy where consumer' tastes are supposed to be more westernized or so-called 'supermarketized' four decades after the introduction of supermarkets.","[Huang, Chi-tsun] Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mkt & Distribut Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Tsai, Kuen-Hung] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chen, Yu-Chih] Innopro Hitech Inc, Dept Mkt, Taipei, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; National Taipei University,"Huang, CT (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung First Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mkt & Distribut Management, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",yoshi@nkfust.edu.tw,,,,,,,104,21,22,0,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Researchers have used structural path analysis (SPA) to capture not only the linkages within the production system but also the propagation of the effects into different channels of impacts. However, the SPA literature has restricted itself to showing the relations among sectors of production, while the connections between these sectors and final consumption have attracted little attention. In order to consider the complete set of channels involved, in this paper we propose a structural path method that endogenously incorporates not only sectors of production but also the final consumption of the economy. The empirical application comprises water usages, and analyses the dissemination of exogenous impacts into various channels of water consumption. The results show that the responsibility for water stress is imputed to different sectors and depends on the hypothesis used for the role played by final consumption in the model. This highlights the importance of consumers' decisions in the determination of ecological impacts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, studies on this consumer segment are scarce. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the food behaviours of Italian female consumers, distinguishing similarities and differences due to age and level of income. Design/methodology/approach - The investigation adopted an inductive approach in order to analyse and confirm the determinants of food behaviours. Data were collected through four focus groups. Data elaboration included content analyses with term frequency - inverse document frequency index and multidimensional scaling technique. Findings - The food behaviours of Italian female consumers are based on a common set of semantic categories and theoretical dimensions that are coherent with those applied by previous studies. The age of consumers impacts the relevance attributed to the categories and income contributes to the explanation of the conceptual relations among the categories that determine food behaviours. The approach to food of younger and mature consumers AROP is strongly driven by constraints such as price and time. The study did not confirm a link between a poor health attitude and low socio-economic status. Research limitations/implications - The outcomes achieved can be strengthened by quantitative analyses to characterise the relations occurring among the factors and dimensions that influence the food behaviours of consumers AROP. Originality/value - The study increases knowledge about Italian female consumers and provides an initial contribution to the analysis of the food behaviour of the population AROP.","[Ruggeri, Arianna; Samoggia, Antonella] Univ Bologna, Alma Mater Studiorum, Agr Sci, Bologna, Italy; [Arvola, Anne] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Espoo, Finland; [Hendrixson, Vaiva] Vilnius State Univ, Physiol Biochem Microbiol & Lab Med, Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Bologna; VTT Technical Research Center Finland; Vilnius University,"Ruggeri, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Alma Mater Studiorum, Agr Sci, Bologna, Italy.",arianna.ruggeri3@unibo.it,"Samoggia, Antonella/AAU-1052-2020; ruggeri, arianna/Q-5101-2018; ruggeri, arianna/U-3285-2019","Samoggia, Antonella/0000-0003-3930-6173; ruggeri, arianna/0000-0002-2078-2703",European Union,European Union(European Union (EU)),"This investigation was carried out within the project CHANCE - Low cost technologies and traditional ingredients for the production of affordable, nutritionally correct foods improving health in population groups at risk of poverty, co-financed by the European Union 7th Framework Programme.

Design/methodology/approach - A survey was carried out among 400 people in southern Chile. The questionnaire measured willingness to buy FFs with 18 different benefits, knowledge about FFs, socio-demographic characteristics and satisfaction with life and with food-related life. Findings - Two dimensions were found for benefits sought in FFs: disease prevention and improvement of bodily functions. Cluster analysis was used to distinguish three types of consumers. The majority (59.8 per cent) showed a significant disposition to buy FFs that prevent diseases or improve bodily functions. Others (25.8 per cent) were less inclined to buy either type of FF. A minority (14.5 per cent) showed greater disposition to buy FFs which improve bodily functions. The types differ according to the size of family, presence and age of children at home, ethnic origin, education, socio-economic status, knowledge about FFs and satisfaction with life and food-related life. Research limitations/implications - This study was conducted in the context of only one country in South America. The results reveal a high interest to buy FFs in order to improve bodily functions, and this preference may be associated to lifestyle changes in the population in Latin American countries. Originality/value - This study provides information on the willingness to buy FFs and relates it to ethnic origin and satisfaction with food-related life. People from ethnic minorities are less inclined to buy FFs. People who are more inclined to buy FFs are more satisfied with their life and their food-related life.","[Schnettler, Berta; Miranda, Horacio] Univ La Frontera, Dept Farming & Livestock Prod, Temuco, Chile; [Lobos, German] Univ Talca, Sch Commercial Engn, Talca, Chile; [Sepulveda, Jose; Orellana, Ligia] Univ La Frontera, Res Ctr Econ Psychol & Consumer Behav, Temuco, Chile; [Mora, Marcos] Univ Chile, Dept Agr Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Grunert, Klaus] Aarhus Univ, MAPP Ctr Res Customer Relat Food Sect, Aarhus, Denmark",Universidad de La Frontera; Universidad de Talca; Universidad de La Frontera; Universidad de Chile; Aarhus University,"Schnettler, B (通讯作者)，Univ La Frontera, Dept Farming & Livestock Prod, Temuco, Chile.",berta.schnettler@ufrontera.cl,"Miranda, Horacio/AAQ-5589-2020; Marcos, Mora/B-9063-2015; Orellana, Ligia/AAH-7037-2019; Sepulveda, Jose A./F-3492-2012; LOBOS, GERMAN/V-8128-2019","Orellana, Ligia/0000-0002-2575-3047; LOBOS, GERMAN/0000-0002-6155-4870; Sepulveda, Jose/0000-0002-5328-0304",Fondecyt [1100611],Fondecyt(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),This research was funded by Fondecyt Project 1100611.,,75,23,23,1,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A consumer survey consisting of 23 questions has been prepared. Totally 1,315 people participated in the survey. Awareness of the consumers about genetically modified organisms, willingness to purchase GM foods, acceptability of GM foods by consumers and legislations and information sources were assessed in the questionnaire. Nonparametric test were applied in order to unravel demographic differences. Findings - The results of the survey showed that consumers generally know what genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are, but they do not have enough information about the genetic modification process. The main concerns of consumers about GMFs are their carcinogenic effects to human. In addition, corn was found to be the most concerned GMF. The usage of GMOs in health sector and in preventing environmental pollution were the most approved areas by the consumers, whereas the majority of consumers disapproved the use of genetic modifications in food applications. Research limitations/implications - A limitation of this study is the sample including high percentage of educated young consumers. Hence, the survey can be improved and applied to higher number of participants living in different regions in Turkey for being more representative for all Turkish consumers. Practical implications - Some suggestions for food producers and food policy makers are also provided in this study. Originality/value - There has been little research concerning Turkish consumers' attitude and knowledge towards gene technology and GMFs.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper provides a discussion of the dietary and food system principles from a Judaism, Christianity and Islamic perspective for the design of a more sustainable and healthy food system. Findings - The commercialisation of the natural resources, industrial food production approach and consumerism is endangering the food security, health and environment. Current industry practices are not sustainable and do not comply with Jewish, Christian and Islamic scriptures. Kosher, Christian and halal food laws share common principles in prohibition of certain animals (like pig), prohibition of blood, role of fasting and animal welfare. As a change in the diet is the solution, there is a key role for the food industry to comply and for religious leaders to radically reduce meat consumption and food waste of its followers. Research limitations/implications - This viewpoint paper shows that religious food laws provide answers to current problems with the industrialised food production approach and consumerism. Practical implications - New food industry directives should convert meat-based to plant-based ingredients and additives; replace porcine by bovine sources; and emphasise on animal welfare to better serve the Jewish, Christian and Muslim consumer. Religious logos (kosher and halal) should incorporate nutrient profiling through a traffic light system to promote healthy food choice. Originality/value - Religious food laws are important for a big part of the world population (Jews, Christians and Muslims), which share many common principles. This study contributes to a better understanding of the commonalities and differences in these religious food laws.","[Tieman, Marco] Univ Tun Abdul Razak, Grad Sch Business, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Hassan, Faridah Hj] Univ Teknol MARA, IHalal Management & Sci, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Tieman, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tun Abdul Razak, Grad Sch Business, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",marcotieman@yahoo.com,"hj hassan, faridah/HNQ-4811-2023","hj hassan, faridah/0000-0003-4242-7443; Tieman, Marco/0000-0002-7191-6556",,,,,102,38,38,4,91,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

With continuing growth of atmospheric CO2 concentrations and increasing interest in behaviour change agendas PCAs are worthy of fresh development. Wide variation in energy usage between households of similar incomes implies that under the 'standard' model of PCAs significant numbers of low-income high-emitters would have to purchase top-up allowances. If PCAs penalise some of the worst off in society it creates a major political obstacle to their introduction. Solving this distributional problem by allocating additional allowances to certain groups or offering compensatory state benefits has been investigated and appears costly and only partially effective. This paper proposes a new 'Mean & Max' PCA model whereby higher usage is necessary before purchase of top-up allowances is required; potentially highly effective but consequently the volumes and values of surplus and top-up allowances become significantly different, This difference renders free market carbon allowance trading unworkable, potentially eliminating a hallmark (but publicly unpopular) PCA feature. The new model potentially offers the first solution to the distributional problem since it was highlighted in 2008. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To deal with this problem, we apply a procedure developed by [67]; for estimating the efficiency in Italian higher education through a multi-output parametric distance function. We show that models which do not consider unobservable heterogeneity tend to estimate divergent efficiency scores. We also study the determinants of efficiency; the findings provide a clue towards the expansion of pro-competitive policies in the Italian higher education sector, consistently with the interpretation that when market forces operate, there are benefits for university efficiency. When exploring differences in the performance of universities, by geographical areas, we claim that maintaining State-level policies can be detrimental for overall efficiency, and instead special interventions for universities in the South should be designed.

Thus, little attention has been paid to the importance of policy processes as potentially influential drivers of WTP. Using a statewide web-based survey in Florida US and a relatively novel valuation approach (i.e., Best-Worst Choice), we examine public preferences for clean water benefits (e.g., recreation, drinking water resources) as well as common conservation policy processes, such as land acquisition and financial assistance for landowners. We found forest/water protection programs provide an annual average of $154-230 million in clean water benefits, and a significant portion of that value was associated with the policy process. Attitudes and beliefs about whom forests should be managed for, and who should manage forests, were also found to influence WTP behaviors. We conclude that including policy process information in the valuation survey allows respondents to better determine changes in utility among realistic policy alternatives. Our findings have important implications for WTP estimation techniques and public participation in environmental policy design.

We implement an information experiment in Beijing. We select two pairs of residential complexes each pair has two complexes located in the same housing submarket, and one is green while the other is not. We ask the respondents' willingness to buy a new green housing unit, and, if yes, the price premium they are willing to pay. Then we show them an information card that documents that green apartments outperform their non-green counterparts in terms of several indoor environmental indicators, and then ask them the same two questions. We find that dwellers living in green complexes present a significantly higher initial willingness-to-pay for greenness, but this difference narrows significantly after our information treatment, as the non-green-complex dwellers' willingness-to-pay for greenness increases dramatically. This inspiring result suggests that Chinese urban households will be encouraged to purchase green housing if they are provided more reliable and concrete information. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It lacks analyses on actual materialization and the nature of the change required. There have been calls for research that pay attention to institutional constraints and possibilities of implementing a democratic process of sustainable degrowth. This paper introduces a practice approach to institutional agency as a fruitful tool for future studies and politics of degrowth. The potential of this approach is demonstrated through a struggle between Finnish Timebanking activists and the tax authorities. The cultural and institutional transition promoted by radical bottom-up initiatives requires a disruption of existing institutional arrangements some of which may be very persistent and supported by defenders who want to maintain the present institutional order. In the case example, the authorities and politicians managed to preserve the mechanisms through which certain sanctions are associated with the non-compliance of Timebanking with the income tax law.

J,"Mbatu, RS",,,,"Mbatu, Richard S.",,,Linking the global to the national: an application of the international pathways model to examine the influence of international environmental agreements on Cameroon's forest policy,INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,International environmental agreements/regimes; Forest policy; Forest governance; Cameroon,MANAGEMENT; CAPACITY; CHINESE,"Cameroon's tropical forest cover is one of the largest in the world. It is home to some of the world's rarest plant and animal species. However, the country has suffered extensive forest loss for many decades as a result of socioeconomic and political factors. The growing global concern for the health of the world's forests and related global issues has placed pressure on Cameroon to sustainably manage its forests. The intricacies of domestic and international pressures on Cameroon's forest sector means that policy makers have to take into consideration the dynamics of the domestic-international nexus in developing the country's forest policies. The increasingly integrated global governance of the world's forests-international agreements, protocols and treaties, international program, international institutions, international actors, and international norms-together constitute international policy regimes that have influenced the direction of Cameroon's forest policy. Employing the international pathways framework model, an analytic model which describes how transnational actors and international institutions affect domestic policies and policy making, this paper examines the extent to which international environmental agreements have influenced the direction of Cameroon's forest policy and policy making. The application of the international pathways model facilitated analytic review and allowed for a better understanding of how Cameroon has utilized the complex global forest governance arrangements to enhance its domestic forest policy.","[Mbatu, Richard S.] Univ South Florida St Petersburg, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Geog, 140 Seventh Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Mbatu, RS (通讯作者)，Univ South Florida St Petersburg, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Geog, 140 Seventh Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.",mbatu@mail.usf.edu,,,,,,,100,2,3,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

This was a period of rapidly rising illegitimacy as well as national, and metropolitan, poor law expenditure. The affiliation system offered parish officials a parallel system by which poor rates could be deflated, but analysis of the 1834 Town Queries reveals that metropolitan parishes could be particularly poor at recovering the costs of chargeable bastards from putative fathers. The article interrogates in detail the workings of the affiliation system in Southwark and Lambeth in terms of the proportion of fathers (and mothers) who paid maintenance for their children, either in lump sums or in weekly allowances, plus the associated costs of childbirth and legal fees, the range of weekly sums, which could be higher than previously thought, and the duration for which they were paid, which could be surprisingly long. The article reveals a complex system, variable at the parochial and regional level, as was the wider old poor law.","[Williams, Samantha] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Williams, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,Roger Schofield Local Population Studies Research Fund; Ellen McArthur Fund; British Academy Small Grant [RG50929],Roger Schofield Local Population Studies Research Fund; Ellen McArthur Fund; British Academy Small Grant,"Research for this article was funded by the Roger Schofield Local Population Studies Research Fund and the Ellen McArthur Fund, and the initial archival survey was funded by a British Academy Small Grant RG50929.

This study aims at analyzing the effects of basic capabilities, among other factors, on households' decisions to participate in collective management of pastoral resources in Narok County, Kenya. A zero inflated beta model, in addition to alternative econometric model specifications, is applied on cross-sectional data collected through a household survey. The results confirm the key role of the capability concept in explaining the management of natural resources. Increased basic capabilities, that is, the ability to achieve some minimally acceptable levels of functioning reduce cooperation levels in collective management of pastoral resources. Social capital, neighborhood social influences, resource system characteristics, socioeconomic factors and institutional factors also emerge as key determinants of collective management of pastoral resources. Policy implications drawn by this study encourage strategies to build social capital and facilitate adoption of improved range management technologies where communal management of land is likely to be abandoned for exclusive property rights.

Most conservation studies employ a theory which focuses on one feature (e.g., profits, attitudes, information, norms, or technology). We propose an integrated, three-component framework to model conservation comprising: 1) motives (including stewardship) and meta-utility, 2) firm practices and technology choice, and 3) impacts. We justify this model and compare its use with others in an empirical setting. We build two empirical conservation measures and apply them to a sparse primary data set.

Previous studies have identified the need for states to close negotiations when the issues under discussion are sensitive. This paper argues that sensitivity alone cannot adequately explain the dynamic of closing down negotiations to observers. Questions that have received little attention in the literature include which issues are considered sensitive and how the decision is made to move the negotiations behind closed doors. This paper examines the practices of NSA involvement in climate diplomacy from three analytical perspectives: functional efficiency, political dynamics, and historical institutionalism. Based on interviews and UNFCCC documents, this paper suggests that to understand the issue of openness in negotiations, institutional factors and the politics of NSA involvement need to be better scrutinized. The paper shows that each perspective has particular advantages when analyzing different dimensions of the negotiations, with implications of how we understand the role of NSAs in global environmental governance.","[Nasiritousi, Naghmeh; Linner, Bjorn-Ola] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Water & Environm Studies, S-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Nasiritousi, Naghmeh; Linner, Bjorn-Ola] Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, S-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University; Linkoping University,"Nasiritousi, N (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Water & Environm Studies, S-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden.;Nasiritousi, N (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Ctr Climate Sci & Policy Res, S-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden.",naghmeh.nasiritousi@liu.se; bjorn-ola.linner@liu.se,"Linnér, Björn-Ola/AAL-2040-2020","Nasiritousi, Naghmeh/0000-0003-2727-491X",Swedish Research Council [421-2011-1862]; Formas [2011-779],Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),"This research was made possible through generous grants from the Swedish Research Council (Project No. 421-2011-1862) and Formas (Project No. 2011-779) for the research project Nonstate actors in the new landscape of international climate cooperation.

The Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) is the newest addition to this cluster and serves to guide efforts to meet the 2020 goal to use and produce chemicals in a way that minimizes significant adverse effects on human health and the environment. SAICM differs from other chemical and waste agreements on several key points: It is a policy framework that is legally non-binding; it comprises a broad scope of activities; and it allows for active participation of non-governmental stakeholders. A central aim of SAICM is to decrease the gap between developed and developing countries in terms of capacities to manage chemicals safely. This article examines the early implementation of SAICM, based on a national-level case study in Cambodia and interviews with SAICM stakeholders. The results show that SAICM has generated a clear momentum in Cambodia and has led to several implementation projects. Based on the interviews, the overall conclusion is that design features of the SAICM-its broad scope, multi-stakeholder participation and voluntary status-are appropriate for the purpose of improving chemicals management in a developing country like Cambodia. However, these features also bring about difficulties in measuring progress on implementation. The future development of SAICM therefore needs to balance the benefits of its key design features with the need to more effectively and precisely monitor progress toward the 2020 goal.","[Persson, Linn; Persson, Asa] Stockholm Environm Inst, Linnegatan 87D,Box 24218, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden; [Sam, Chanthy] Chulalongkorn Univ, Stockholm Environm Inst, 15th Floor,Witthyakit Bldg, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",Stockholm Environment Institute; Chulalongkorn University,"Persson, L (通讯作者)，Stockholm Environm Inst, Linnegatan 87D,Box 24218, S-10451 Stockholm, Sweden.",linn.persson@sei-international.org,"Persson, Åsa/ABD-8096-2021","Persson, Asa/0000-0002-8886-5046; Persson, Linn/0000-0002-7110-7089",Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida),Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida)(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),The authors wish to express their gratitude to all interviewees who set aside time to be interviewed and who generously shared their knowledge and insights.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the moderating role of trust on food private label brands' purchase intention and loyalty. Design/methodology/approach - For this purpose, the authors propose and empirically test a conceptual model comprising variables such as price, familiarity and store image. A sample of 445 respondents was gathered, and the hypotheses were tested performing structural equation modelling. Findings - The findings highlight the moderating influence of trust on consumers' loyalty to food private label brands. In addition, the results obtained reveal the substantially great influence of private label brand familiarity on purchase intention and loyalty. So, it seems that consumer trust and loyalty are strongly associated regarding food private label brands. Research limitations/implications - The authors suggest that trust of food private label brands allows retailers to increase consumer loyalty. Practical implications - Consequently retail managers should consider the enhancement of trust in the context of a marketing strategy formulation for food private label brands. Originality/value - The present study provides insights into the moderating effect of trust on loyalty to food private label brands, as well as evidence of the strong influence of familiarity on private label brands' proneness, related to food products.","[Calvo Porral, Cristina] Univ A Coruna, Dept Econ Anal & Business Adm, La Coruna, Spain; [Levy-Mangin, Jean-Pierre] Univ Outaouais, Dept Mkt, Fac Sci Adm, Gatineau, ON, Canada",Universidade da Coruna,"Porral, CC (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, Dept Econ Anal & Business Adm, La Coruna, Spain.",ccalvo@udc.es,"PORRAL, CRISTINA CALVO/A-9179-2012","PORRAL, CRISTINA CALVO/0000-0002-5470-0729",,,,,54,49,51,5,81,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In particular, the authors used a health-related claim (the nutritional claim indicating a reduced fat content: light), a regional claim (designation of origin - PDO) and an organic claim (the European organic logo). Moreover, the authors investigated whether consumers' personal characteristics could influence their WTP for those types of cheese. Design/methodology/approach - A home-grown experimental auction was applied in Spain during Spring 2012. The authors opted to use the nth random price with repeated rounds and without price feedback. Findings - The results show that consumers were willing to pay more for PDO cheese, followed by organic and light cheese. Moreover, respondents who were female, older and with a university-level education showed some environmental concerns, influencing their WTP for different cheeses. Originality/value - Empirical evidence on consumers' preferences for PDO, organic and nutritional claims, evaluated jointly, is lacking in Spain. Moreover, the home-grown auction has several merits in terms of real market simulation and consumer preference application.","[de-Magistris, Tiziana] Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon CITA, Unidad Econ Agroalimentaria, Zaragoza, Spain; Univ Zaragoza, CITA, IA2, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"De-Magistris, T (通讯作者)，Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon CITA, Unidad Econ Agroalimentaria, Zaragoza, Spain.",tmagistris@aragon.es,", Azucena/N-6263-2019","de Magistris, Tiziana/0000-0001-5480-183X",EU [FOODLABELS_PIOF-GA-2009-253323],EU(European Union (EU)),"This study has been funded by the EU Marie Curie Project, FOODLABELS_PIOF-GA-2009-253323.",,46,44,48,1,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The area cropped with starch potatoes totalled 494 ha in Latvia in 2014, which accounted for only 1.8% of the total potato area in the country. The organic starch potato area considerably increased, reaching almost 50% of the total starch potato area in 2014.

The study cover a gap in agro-food economics and analyses the economic benefits of sea transport mode compared to road transport in the food trade between Spain and Italy for a specific product: olive oils. Design/methodology/approach - Three different transportation scenarios are considered (road only, road combined with accompanied SSS and road combined with unaccompanied SSS) linking the main olive oil production and consumption areas in Spain and Italy. In each scenario the cost per unit shipped have been calculated. Findings - The results show the road option is about 30 and 34 per cent more costly than the best SSS option available for the exportations from Jaen and Southern Catalonia, respectively. Research limitations/implications - The need of further research is identified, mainly focused in two directions: first, the need for inclusion of new variables to the model (e.g. value of time, seasonality, complexity of the transport chain, potential demand, etc.) to better assess the competitiveness of the sea connection and, second, a study of the environmental impact and socio-economic benefits of SSS implementation for the agri-food sector. Originality/value - The research enriches the current literature on this field and provides a basis for future studies.

It explores whether there is any evidence for a latent dimension that represents consumers' attitudes towards naturalness and which aspects can be assigned to this dimension. However, the main scope is to investigate whether attitudes towards naturalness are able to predict the liking of natural food. Design/methodology/approach - Sensory tests of strawberry yoghurt are combined with consumer information obtained by means of a standardised questionnaire. About 1,800 organic consumers from France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland were asked to blindly test two strawberry yoghurt samples that differed only in their absence/presence of an aroma additive. Findings - On average, the consumers revealed a positive attitude towards natural food, but a negative sensory preference for the more natural yoghurt sample. Correlations between these two variables indicate that for most countries one cannot conclude that more naturalness-oriented consumers actually prefer the taste of more naturally flavoured yoghurts. This finding is interpreted as an attitude-liking gap. Research limitations/implications - More research is necessary in order to clarify the reasons for the attitude-liking gap, since the authors can only speculate about these. Also, suitable data are needed to confirm the assumption made here that the naturalness of strawberry yoghurt can be determined by the degree of flavour intensity, especially against the background that the sensory skills of consumers are usually weak. Originality/value - No attempt has been undertaken so far to test the claim that natural food products taste better and whether consumers with a positive attitude towards naturalness actually prefer the taste of a natural product over the taste of a more processed one. The present study attempts to fill this gap by exploring the preference for naturalness in a cross-national context.","[Hemmerling, Sarah; Spiller, Achim] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany; [Canavari, Maurizio] Alma Mater Studiorum Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Sci Agr Econ & Appraisal, Bologna, Italy",University of Gottingen; University of Bologna,"Hemmerling, S (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",shemmer@gwdg.de,"Canavari, Maurizio/A-7247-2008; Spiller, Achim/CAJ-5518-2022","Canavari, Maurizio/0000-0003-0573-7880;",Commission of the European Community in the 7th Framework Programme [218477-2],Commission of the European Community in the 7th Framework Programme,this work was supported by the Commission of the European Community in the 7th Framework Programme (Grant Number 218477-2).,,88,35,36,3,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This was followed by four focus groups with consumers (n=34) in two areas (East and West). Findings - The consumers perceived Norwegian food as having two main dimensions: foods grown and produced in Norway and dishes belonging to traditional cuisine. These two dimensions could coexist and foods that embodied both aspects were higher on a scale of national identity. Perceptions of Norwegian food reflected context, food category and consumer group. The findings support the use of the concept of belonging. Emotional belonging was mainly expressed by the consumers when talking about traditional dishes and Norwegian cuisine, whereas politics of belonging had to do with supporting domestic agriculture and especially produce that has been traditionally grown in Norway.

Afterwards the authors have conducted the survey were companies were asked to evaluate different aspects of internet marketing. The European Commission data (The European Commission, 2015) have indicated that internet marketing usage trends could differ based on the company size. Therefore, the analysis of the survey was done by grouping results by company size taking into account turnover of the company in 2013. To ensure additional and deeper analysis, companies were divided in two groups according to the changes in turnover (comparing results of 2012 and 2013). Methods used in research: analysis of scientific literature, survey of entrepreneurs on internet marketing. The analysis of the survey data was done by using the descriptive statistic methods - indicators of central tendency or location, indicators of variability; cross tabulations; non - parametric statistics - Kruskal - Wallis test, Mann - Whitney U test. It was found that companies more often are making their decision on advertising efficiency based on company's specialist's experience rather than followed advices of advertising companies.

In order to solve the problem of special car service in Chinese car market, the special carindustry needs to take measures. Meanwhile the government should take measures to promote the prosperity of the special car service and taxi service. It is found that fuzzy legal nature, ambiguous legal responsibility and greater risk lead to a series of special car prohibitions eventually. Four suggestions are put forward in this paper. Firstly, special car can temporarily qualitative as car rental, seeking new development opportunities after a foothold in automobile industry to solve the problem of fuzzy legal nature. Secondly, Passengers should not be requested by the lessee but taxi passengers. Thirdly, special car should improve the access threshold to protect the safety of passengers. Finally the government should take corresponding measures to regulate the car development, improve laws and regulations to coordinate the competition between taxi and special car to reach the objective of ordered car market.","[Wang, Ling; He, Qingsong] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Wei Hai, Shandong, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Wang, L; He, QS (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Wei Hai, Shandong, Peoples R China.",516517189@qq.com; 1903329844@qq.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7913-3,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,56.0,,,,,,61,66,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7QZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391644000010,0

In this paper, we reassess the empirical evidence on the best-fitting distribution in relation to the truncation point issue. Specifically, we provide a comparison among four recently proposed approaches and alternative definitions of U.S. cities.

Two types of agents are considered: forest owners who exploit the forest and draw economic revenues in the form of timber and agricultural use of deforested land; and a non-forest-owner group who pollutes and suffers the negative externality of having a decreasing forest stock. We retrieve the cooperative solution for this game and show the cases in which cooperation enables a partial reduction in the negative externality. We analyze when it is jointly profitable to abate emissions, when it is profitable to reduce net deforestation, and when it is optimal to do both (abate and reduce net deforestation). Assuming that the players adopt the Nash bargaining solution to share the total dividend of cooperation, we determine the total amount that the non-forest owners have to transfer to forest owners. Next, we define a time-consistent payment schedule that allocates over time the total transfer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

I analyze the effect that pharmaceutical innovation had on premature cancer mortality in Canada during the period 2000-2011, by investigating whether the cancer sites that experienced more pharmaceutical innovation had larger declines in the premature mortality rate, controlling for changes in the incidence rate. Premature mortality before age 75 is significantly inversely related to the cumulative number of drugs registered at least 10 years earlier. Since mean utilization of drugs that have been marketed for less than 10 years is only one-sixth as great as mean utilization of drugs that have been marketed for at least a decade, it is not surprising that premature mortality is strongly inversely related only to the cumulative number of drugs that had been registered at least ten years earlier. Premature mortality before age 65 and 55 is also strongly inversely related to the cumulative number of drugs that had been registered at least ten years earlier. None of the estimates of the effect of incidence on mortality are statistically significant. Controlling for the cumulative number of drugs, the cumulative number of chemical subgroups does not have a statistically significant effect on premature mortality. This suggests that drugs (chemical substances) within the same class (chemical subgroup) are not therapeutically equivalent. During the period 2000-2011, the premature (before age 75) cancer mortality rate declined by about 9%. The estimates imply that, in the absence of pharmaceutical innovation during the period 1985-1996, the premature cancer mortality rate would have increased about 12% during the period 2000-2011. A substantial decline in the competing risk of death from cardiovascular disease could account for this. The estimates imply that pharmaceutical innovation during the period 1985-1996 reduced the number of years of potential life lost to cancer before age 75 in 2011 by 105,366. The cost per life-year before age 75 gained from previous pharmaceutical innovation is estimated to have been 2730 USD. Most of the previously-registered drugs were off-patent by 2011, but evidence suggests that, even if these drugs had been sold at branded rather than generic prices, the cost per life-year gained would have been below 11,000 USD, a figure well below even the lowest estimates of the value of a life-year gained. The largest reductions in premature mortality occur at least a decade after drugs are registered, when their utilization increases significantly. This suggests that, if Canada is to obtain substantial additional reductions in premature cancer mortality in the future (a decade or more from now) at a modest cost, pharmaceutical innovation (registration of new drugs) is needed today.","[Lichtenberg, Frank R.] Columbia Univ, 504 Uris Hall,3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lichtenberg, Frank R.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Lichtenberg, FR (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, 504 Uris Hall,3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA.",frank.lichtenberg@columbia.edu,,,Canada's Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies (RxD),Canada's Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies (RxD),"This research was supported by Canada's Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies (Rx&D), the national association that represents 50 research-based pharmaceutical companies in Canada.

However international carbon markets have not stimulated the demand for forestry offsets. Domestic market-mechanisms are emerging in many countries and forests could be highly valued through these policies as most of the benefits produced by forests are enjoyed locally. Here, a choice experiment explores drivers of valuation and willingness to pay for forest carbon services in voluntary markets in Mexico by comparing the valuation of citizens from four regions to test geographical preference for projects (n = 645). Findings from multinomial-logit models show valuation of forest carbon services is transferable and citizens would pay more for offsets from projects closer to their homes. Proximate forests provide a range of co-benefits to local users, including environmental services and opportunities for recreation. Factors related to valuation include sense of responsibility, previous knowledge of carbon emissions, previous visits to the sites, regional identification and the valuation of local environmental services (e.g. improvements in local air quality). Knowledge of spatial heterogeneity in valuation of the use of forest services can help to design market-based instruments by identifying highly valued areas for environmental services programs and carbon markets.

Returns and volatility were typically highest in emerging regions and the raw materials sector. Dividend yields were similar across regions and differences in total returns were due largely to disparities in capital gains. Contingent liability was most extensively employed where leverage was high and the physical assets were either meagre or inaccessible to creditors.","[Grossman, Richard S.] Wesleyan Univ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA; [Grossman, Richard S.] Harvard Univ, Inst Quantitat Social Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Wesleyan University; Harvard University,"Grossman, RS (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",,,,National Science Foundation [SBR 9408619]; John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation,"I am grateful to Michael Edelstein, Abigail Hornstein, Masami Imai, participants at the Workshop on Monetary and Financial History at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, anonymous referees, and the editor of this journal for helpful comments; to Ronan Lyons and John Turner for responding to technical questions about the London Stock Market; and to Kosin Chantikul, Jinny Jang, Janyawat Jirayut, Justin Kagin, Jennifer Kim, Chi Le, Serkan Parlak, and Umay Suanda for valuable research assistance.

A comparison between the Dutch Republic, England, and France shows that the Dutch had developed institutions to deal with this efficiently. State patents for drainage granted compensation to all parties involved and precluded long drawn-out lawsuits. When large-scale drainage began in England and France from c. 1600 onwards, these states had no experience with drainage regulation. They had to find their way by trial and error. In England this led to lawsuits and riots by commoners that ruined several drainage schemes. The decentralized nature of the Dutch state turned out to be an advantage. Dutch politicians and entrepreneurs were used to compromises, and solutions could be adapted to local circumstances. In more centralized England and France this was more difficult to achieve. The Dutch also profited from the fact that territorial lords had already abolished common rights of usage in the coastal provinces in the late middle ages, thus removing an important source of conflict.","[van Cruyningen, Piet] Huygens Inst Hist Netherlands, The Hague, Netherlands; [van Cruyningen, Piet] Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands (KNAW); Wageningen University & Research,"van Cruyningen, P (通讯作者)，Huygens Inst Hist Netherlands, The Hague, Netherlands.",,,"van Cruyningen, Piet/0000-0002-0392-743X",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO),Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"The research for this article was financed by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).

Despite this popularity, and its being selected as one of the organizing themes of the United Nations Rio+20 Conference in Brazil, June 2012, its prospects as an effective mobilization tool for global environmental sustainability scholarship and practice remain unclear. A major reason for this is that much like its precursor concepts such as environmental sustainability and sustainable development, green economy is a woolly concept, which lends itself to many interpretations. Hence, rather than resolve long-standing controversies, green economy merely reinvigorates existing debates over the visions, actors and policies best suited to secure a more sustainable future for all. In this review article, we aim to fill an important gap in scholarship by suggesting various ways in which green economy may be organized and synthesized as a concept, and especially in terms of its relationship with the idea of social and environmental justice. Accordingly, we offer a systemization of possible interpretations of green economy mapped onto a synthesis of existing typologies of environmental justice. This classification provides the context for future analysis of which, and how, various notions of green economy link with various conceptions of justice.","[Ehresman, Timothy G.] Univ South Sewanee, Dept Polit, Sewanee, TN 37383 USA; [Okereke, Chukwumerije] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading RG6 6AB, Berks, England",Sewanee: University of the South; University of Reading,"Ehresman, TG (通讯作者)，Univ South Sewanee, Dept Polit, Sewanee, TN 37383 USA.",tgehresm@sewanee.edu; c.okereke@reading.ac.uk,,,,,,,102,49,56,5,107,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Specifically, scholars have engaged with the justice implications of non-market valuation and the emergence of new policy instruments paying for or trading ecosystem services and biodiversity. I hereby contribute to these debates by responding to a published commentary in this journal and I shed light on what I believe should be a new agenda for critical scholarship of market-based conservation. I argue for more precision in our claims, distinguishing across market-based instruments and across types of outcomes, and for a more nuanced account of the ethical connotations of such instruments, which should involve analyzing both unequal socio-economic relations and culturally bounded conceptions of justice. Overall, I advocate for the development of a more robust empirical basis to derive generalizations on the procedural, distributive and livelihood implications of market-based instruments for conservation.

Design/methodology/approach - This research employed a qualitative research method. A total of 16 in-depth interviews were carried out to identify key product design attributes. These attributes were used to design health promoting foods for the ageing population. Findings - Age-related conditions affect and alter the design of health promoting foods targeted at the ageing population. Providing the ageing consumer segment with access to health promoting foods facilitates positive ageing intervention. The integration of affordability and convenience elements into ageing food design attributes is important for product acceptance. The multi-level demands and heterogeneity of ageing consumers result in the need for a variety of nutritionally tailored food formats. A dairy-based beverage was considered to be the optimal product concept for the ageing population. Research limitations/implications - The inclusion of stakeholders from the food industry could result in levels of food industry bias. The sample size of stakeholders was limited to 16 participants. One interview guide was used throughout all interviews to ensure consistency levels. A more flexible instrument may have captured more specific stakeholder information. Practical implications - During the early stages of the new product development process, a market-oriented research methodology can help to optimise product design in terms of product attributes that drive consumer acceptance. Originality/value - This paper provides important insights into the significance of stakeholder tacit knowledge generation throughout the need identification stage of the NPD process. Specifically this paper provides stakeholder tacit knowledge on the optimal design of health promoting foods for the ageing population. This knowledge has the ability to provide market-oriented information on health promoting food concepts which can be valuable for food manufacturers to maximise NPD performance, create value and develop competitive advantage within their marketplace. Finally, design templates of health promoting foods for the ageing population are of high strategic importance to food manufacturers, governments, health professionals and medical professionals.","[Collins, Orla; Bogue, Joe] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Food Business & Dev, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork,"Bogue, J (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Cork, Dept Food Business & Dev, Cork, Ireland.",j.bogue@ucc.ie,,"Bogue, Joe/0000-0002-2359-3377; Collins, Orla/0000-0001-9265-9133",,,,,50,13,14,4,38,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique (ZMET) in standard and modified form was used to develop consumers' mental models for food safety. Findings - The cognitive content and structure of aggregated consumers' mental models were identified and mapped. The maps included negative and positive meanings, indicating a need to tackle the hygiene problems prevailing in most traditional markets. ZMET generated a more differentiated map when people were empowered with a camera to collect stimuli. Research limitations/implications - Using ZMET to understand food safety perceptions avoids consumers being led in their responses, views and feelings about food safety. Practical implications - Policy, regulatory frameworks and marketing actions by value chain actors in the fresh vegetable subsector should give priority to tackling the hygiene problem prevalent in most traditional markets in developing countries. Originality/value - This paper provides novel needs-driven theoretical and practical insights into the actual meaning representation of food safety, which actually drives consumer thoughts and behaviour.

The following responses such as brand loyalty, brand switching, purchase acceleration, stockpiling and product trial have been analyzed in this paper. The recesion in economy that has been present over the course of several years now has had a significant impact on the behavior of consumers in a way that consumers are buying more products at sales, thus according to the research results of certain authors, retailers have used price sales as the most popular and the most often stimulating instrument of short term demand, and it has seen an increase ever since. Following the analysis of scientific literature that has covered this particular subject matter, three hypothesis about the impact of socio-demographic characteristics of examinees onto their attitudes regarding the impact of price reduction onto behavioral responses of consumers, have been defined. An empirical research has been carried out aimed at testing hypotheses set over the sample of 100 consumers. Data and figures have been collected through a survey at a point of sale i. e. applying MALL-INTERCEPT concept. It has been determined that attitudes of examinees regarding the impact of price reduction onto behavioral responses of consumers - brand switching, brand loyalty, purchase acceleration, stockpiling and product trial - do not significantly depend on the gender of examinees. Attitudes of examinees regarding the impact of price reduction onto behavioral responses of consumers -brand loyalty, brand switching, purchase acceleration and stock piling -depend on the age of examinees, but that is not the case with product trial. Further, attitudes of examinees regarding the impact of price reduction onto behavioral responses of consumers -brand switching and brand loyalty - depend on the income of examinees, but at the same time mentioned attitudes of examinees regarding the impact of price reduction onto behavioral responses of consumers - purchase acceleration, stockpiling and product trial-do not depend on the income of examines.

Design/methodology/approach - The prevalence of different barriers for following a plant-based diet is addressed, as well as consumer profiles considering socio-demographics, values and meat consumption frequencies. The data were collected in 2010 by a survey questionnaire, sent to 4,000 randomly selected Finns (response rate = 47.3, n = 1,890). Findings - Different types of barriers are perceived to hinder the adoption of a plant-based diet, including meat enjoyment, eating routines, health conceptions and difficulties in preparing vegetarian foods. These barriers are strongly correlated, indicating that consumers may not make qualitative difference between different barriers. Furthermore, there are distinct socio-demographic, value and especially meat consumption frequency elements that strengthen the barrier perception, these being male gender, young age, rural residence, household type of families with children, low education, absence of a vegetarian family member or friend, valuation of traditions and wealth and high meat consumption frequency. Social implications - High meat consumption is related to many environmental and public health problems. The results call for multifaceted policy implications that should concentrate on different barriers and certain socio-demographic, value and meat eating groups. Importantly, focus should be not only on the group with the strongest barrier perception but also on those particularly willing to make changes in their meat consumption patterns. One practical implication could be to increase the availability of vegetarian foods in public cafeterias or school canteens, as a decrease in meat consumption frequency is strongly correlated with the alleviation of the barrier perception. Originality/value - Information about differences in socio-demographics, values and meat consumption frequencies between consumers provide opportunities for focussing policy actions to aid the adoption of a plant-based diet.","[Pohjolainen, Pasi] Univ Turku, Finland Futures Res Ctr, Helsinki, Finland; [Vinnari, Markus; Jokinen, Pekka] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Geog & Hist Studies, Joensuu, Finland",University of Turku; University of Eastern Finland,"Pohjolainen, P (通讯作者)，Univ Turku, Finland Futures Res Ctr, Helsinki, Finland.",pasi.j.pohjolainen@utu.fi,,"Vinnari, Markus/0000-0003-2258-8282; Jokinen, Pekka/0000-0002-0745-0691; Pohjolainen, Pasi/0000-0002-2401-7486",Maj and Tor Nessling foundation [2013055]; Academy of Finland [128122]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [128122] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Maj and Tor Nessling foundation; Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),"This work was mainly funded by Maj and Tor Nessling foundation, research grant 2013055.

The purpose of this paper is to present incentives, opportunities and requirements for implementing GTSs in a fresh FSC. Design/methodology/approach - The research was developed in two stages: a literature review was conducted to establish a theoretical framework; and then an in-depth case study of a Swedish fresh fish supply chain was conducted. The Kano methodology was used to evaluate opportunities based on implementation requirements in each enterprise. Findings - FSC enterprises implement a GTS to meet legal food traceability requirements. This incentive is stronger among enterprises upstream in the FSC than among downstream enterprises. Downstream enterprises emphasize communication with the end consumer as an incentive to implement a GTS. Implementing a GTS increases the opportunity to preserve end consumer confidence, efficiency in information sharing, reduces time in inventory management and the risk of theft. Research limitations/implications - The paper contributes to the field of food traceability by providing knowledge regarding incentives, opportunities and requirements for implementing standards to meet food traceability requirements at FSC enterprises. Practical implications - Regulatory requirements on traceability preservation of food safety, quality and sustainability stipulate the implementation of a GTS. The research presented can support managers in understanding incentives and opportunities for implementing a GTS. Originality/value - This paper combines in-depth academic research with the involvement of Swedish fresh food enterprises. The study is of benefit to fresh food enterprises, authorities and organizations in the further implementation and development of GTSs.","Chalmers Univ Technol, Logist & Transportat, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology,"Ringsberg, HA (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Logist & Transportat, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",henrik.ringsberg@chalmers.se,,,Region Vastra Gotaland,Region Vastra Gotaland,"The author thanks the reviewers and the chief editor for valuable comments to improve the paper.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 58 great chain restaurants were assessed randomly by observation, interview and questionnaires. The main prerequisites for HACCP implementation in questionnaires were as follows: personal hygiene of employees, rinsing, disinfection and cleaning programs, area and location of the restaurant, design and layout of the tools, building facilities, interior environment of the building, environmental hygiene, storerooms, cold storage, refrigerators and documentation. Findings - Only 17 percent (10) of restaurants were generally assessed in a proper level of compliance and 95 percent (55) of them had not any documentation about hygienic practices. Also, the status of storerooms, cold storage and refrigerators was improper. Although, according to the area and location, the feasibility of HACCP program in the evaluated restaurants was in the highest level. Originality/value - All of evaluated chain restaurants provided large amounts of food for customers each day and they had relatively more facilities and money resources for the implementation of PRPs.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 1,381 individuals completed validated questionnaires on dietary habits and attitudes. Associations were analysed using analyses of covariance on attitudes, adjusted for age with gender and diet as factors. Findings - Of the respondents, 35 per cent reported eating mixed food (including meat and fish), 31 per cent vegetarian food (excluding meat and fish) and 34 per cent vegan food (excluding animal products entirely). Authoritarianism was more frequent in carnivores compared to vegetarians and vegans; this difference was more distinctive in men (mean 2.4 vs 1.9 vs 1.7) than in women (2.2 vs 1.9 vs 1.8). Women with a mixed diet were more inclined to social dominance than vegetarians and vegans (1.8 vs 1.6 vs 1.6). Men with a mixed diet had a stronger tendency to dominance (2.0 vs 1.7 vs 1.5) and prejudices (2.5 vs 2.3 vs 2.1); this difference was less distinct among women (2.2 vs 2.1 vs 2.1). Originality/value - This research is of academic value and of value to policy makers and practitioners in the food supply chain. The results show that individuals with vegetarian or vegan diets less frequently report having prejudices against minorities, supporting social dominance and accepting authoritarian structures than individuals with a mixed diet.","[Veser, Petra] Univ Wuppertal, Hlth Psychol, Wuppertal, Germany; [Taylor, Kathy; Singer, Susanne] Univ Med Ctr Mainz, Inst Med Biostat Epidemiol & Informat, Mainz, Germany",University of Wuppertal; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Singer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Med Ctr Mainz, Inst Med Biostat Epidemiol & Informat, Mainz, Germany.",singers@uni-mainz.de,"Singer, Susanne/GPT-4385-2022","Singer, Susanne/0000-0001-5784-7964",,,,,42,31,33,0,38,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

As little is known on consumer perceptions and attitudes toward organic food products, the purpose of this paper is to gain insight into the purchase of organic food products by consumers and to explore the main factors driving this process. Design/methodology/approach - Mixed (quantitative and qualitative) market survey approaches were used to provide a potentially deeper insight into consumer's perspective and could help get a better picture of the complex factors involved. Findings - The main trigger for purchasing organic food products is that consumers expect them to be healthier and safer. The respondents who have bought organic food products tend to have a higher education level and disposable incomes, be families with children and be older than those who have not bought them. The main barriers to increasing the market share of organic food products are the consumers' lack of knowledge, the relatively high price premium and the lack of availability of organic food products. Informing consumers about unique characteristics of organic production methods, the decline in the prices of and increasing the availability of organic food products to its customers might be a promising strategy to develop the market for organic food products. Originality/value - This paper provides a unique insight into buying behavior and attitudes of organic consumers in China. The results of the research could provide information for the organic food industry to expand its market and improve its profitability and reliability.","[Xie, Biao; Yang, Hao; Wang, Yanhua; Zhang, Mingli] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Liyuan] Nanjing Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Normal University; Nanjing University,"Xie, B (通讯作者)，Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",biaox@hotmail.com,"Wang, Yanhua/A-3808-2014","Wang, Yanhua/0000-0001-8193-3264","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41273103, 41030751, 41273102]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41273103, 41030751 and 41273102).

Using monthly bank balance sheets and other primary sources, I analyze the period and argue that one important explanation for the crisis was the growing relationship between banks and government through state loans to finance fiscal deficits and privileges to the issuing banks. I claim that the crisis emerged from a large bank loan in late 1877 which induced over-issuance and depreciation expectations leading, logically, to a bank run. The Chilean case provides valuable evidence of an element frequently neglected by the free-banking literature: the links between banks and government.","[Briones, Ignacio] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Govt, Ave Diagonal Torres 2640, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez,"Briones, I (通讯作者)，Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Govt, Ave Diagonal Torres 2640, Santiago, Chile.",ignacio.briones@uai.cl,,,,,,,64,1,1,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

Applying and adjusting veto players theory to a non-democracy,INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Russia; Veto players; Climate policy; Tsebelis,UKRAINE; STATE,"What is driving Russian climate policy? This article focuses on the veto player approach developed by George Tsebelis and its applicability for examining the power relations in climate change policy-making in Russia. It makes two original contributions: veto players analysis on Russian climate policy and proposals how to adjust to theory to be applied to non-democracies for comparison with democracies. After identifying the veto players and their preferences, and determining their equivalence in the decision-making process, two case studies are examined: the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and the establishment of one of the Kyoto flexible mechanisms, Joint Implementation, in Russia. Regarding the power play between actors, the latter emerges as far more accessible than the former, where scholars can generally observe only the domestic debate-which, due to the absorption of democratic decision-making institutions by the president, is detached from the actual decision-making process. Three proposals are made for adjusting the veto players approach to facilitate qualitative analysis of Russian decision-making: (1) select cases which involve also lower-level actors in charge of policy implementation; (2) due to implementation problems, changes in the status quo must be sought deeper than in statute-level changes; and (3) note that motivations of actors beyond the actual policy substance can facilitate explanations of puzzling outcomes in the process .","[Korppoo, Anna] Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, POB 326, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway; [Korppoo, Anna] Univ Turku, Turku 20014, Finland",University of Turku,"Korppoo, A (通讯作者)，Fridtjof Nansen Inst Polhogda, POB 326, N-1326 Lysaker, Norway.;Korppoo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Turku, Turku 20014, Finland.",anna.korppoo@fni.no,,"Korppoo, Anna/0000-0003-1060-5161",Academy of Finland [252853]; NORKLIMA Project of the Research Council of Norway [207810]; Research Council of Norway,Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); NORKLIMA Project of the Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"This work was funded by the post-doctoral research Project 252853 of the Academy of Finland and the NORKLIMA Project 207810 of the Research Council of Norway.

Increased levels of rhinoceros poaching in South Africa, and the imminent threat of extinction, have emphasized the need for improved management and conservation policies. This study employs a discrete choice experiment in order to value selected supply-side rhinoceros management and conservation strategies at private, ecotourism game reserves in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The valuation setting is couched in real-world management and conservation strategies presently under consideration at state-owned and privately-owned game reserves in South Africa. Results suggest that visitors to these reserves support the sale of stockpiled rhinoceros horn but are strongly opposed to the introduction of trophy hunting or the continuation of rhinoceros darting experiences. Based on the findings of this study, it appears that the choice experiment technique is a promising instrument, which can inform the design of rhinoceros management and conservation policies for privately-owned, ecotourism game reserves in South Africa, with the possibility of extending its use to state-owned nature reserves.

In this paper, we present a case study of pest management strategies in small-scale agriculture, focusing on the unsustainable technological lock-in of synthetic pesticides. Of the 196 smallholder farmers we surveyed in the coastal Mala and Omas Valleys of Perdu 22% of respondents experienced pesticide poisoning themselves or by an immediate family member. Additionally, the two most common pesticide categories reported in use are potent neurotoxins. We hypothesized that the farmers in the valleys were locked into synthetic pesticides due to uncertainty, coordination and learning associated with adopting an alternative strategy. Logistic regressions revealed gender (male), consulting an agro-chemical technician, quantity of cultivated land, and apple as a primary crop to be important predictors of synthetic pesticide use. Our findings suggest that these predictors represent the lock-in of synthetic pesticides through network externalities, learning economies and adaptive expectations. We conclude with opportunities to transition to sustainable pest management strategies at the local level in Latin American communities through interventions countering the lock-in of synthetic pesticides.

This mechanism is vulnerable to an ageing population, which puts pressure on the intergenerational contract implicit in these schemes and raises the question as to how they might be eroded. This is not a new problem, and to put it into historical perspective, this article studies the intergenerational contract that formed the core of the Prussian miners' invalidity insurance in the nineteenth and the early twentieth century (1861-1920). With the so-called Knappschaften, miners relied on what was probably the most comprehensive and advanced occupational pension system existing in Germany around the time when Bismarckian social insurance was established. Financed via the pay-as-you-go mechanism, the miners' pension funds faced stress from their ageing memberships early on, and this potentially undermined their ability to maintain intergenerationally fair pensions. In order to examine whether or not the intergenerational contract among German miners showed signs of erosion, we look at the Knappschaftens' profitability, as measured by actual and promised internal rates of return. This article shows that the intergenerational contract indeed weakened over time unless miners' funds were large and continued to grow, and that a pension reform in 1906 served to stabilize generosity.","[Jopp, Tobias A.] Univ Regensburg, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany",University of Regensburg,"Jopp, TA (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,63,2,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

A monopoly over the collection and trading of sand was formed in Hong Kong by legislation in 1935 in the wake of disputes between sandmen and villagers and imminent shortages of sand. Arguably, a monopoly at this stage of Hong Kong's development was a better alternative to merely defining rights over sand extraction in terms of the transaction costs of enforcement. During the 1950s and 1960s, when Hong Kong's economy and construction industry began to boom, the monopoly's existence was further justified due to the politics of China being the sole source of Hong Kong's sand supply. However, this case study of the sand monopoly and its post-war operation as a bilateral monopoly shows that it did not protect coastal villagers, as violations of the sand law were not infrequent. The local sand supply was huge, and the monopoly's abolition in 1981 was followed by a long period of falling, rather than rising, real wholesale prices of the resource. Nor was there any sign of scale economies, as claimed by the government. The policy implications of this are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Lai, Lawrence W. C.; Chau, K.

This article presents a study of income inequality in mid-eighteenth-century Old Castile (Spain) using the Ensenada Cadastre, a census conducted between 1749 and 1759. The article describes the information provided by this census and then discusses its advantages and disadvantages for reconstructing income profiles and calculating income inequality. This is followed by analysis of a dataset derived from the Cadastre that consists of more than 4,000 observations from Palencia (a province in northern Spain) and contains information on sources of household income, each household head's main occupation, residence location, and other household characteristics. Demographic data from this census is used to weight observations in the sample and thereby minimize selection bias. Findings show that inequality in eighteenth-century Spain was probably substantial despite its relative backwardness; that the relationship between inequality and per capita income was not clear-cut and was probably influenced by measurement of the higher incomes; and that although income inequality was largely driven by uneven land distribution, labour income also contributed to overall inequality-especially in urban centres.","[Nicolini, Esteban A.] Univ Norte Santo Tomas de Aquino, San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; [Nicolini, Esteban A.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Nicolini, Esteban A.] Univ Nacl Tucuman, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; [Palencia, Fernando Ramos] Univ Pablo de Olavide Sevilla, Seville, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Nicolini, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Norte Santo Tomas de Aquino, San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina.;Nicolini, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.;Nicolini, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Tucuman, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina.",,"Nicolini, Esteban A./H-5528-2015; Palencia, Fernando Ramos/N-5092-2019","Palencia, Fernando Ramos/0000-0002-4677-2730","Spanish Ministry of Education and Sciences [ECO2008-02089, ECO2012-38028]; UNSTA [414-12]; Junta de Andalucia [P09-HUM-5330]",Spanish Ministry of Education and Sciences(Spanish Government); UNSTA; Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia),"The authors are grateful for comments and previous discussions on the topic with Guido Alfani, Branko Milanovic, Leandro Prados de la Escosura, Jaime Reis, Joan Roses, Bartolome Yun Casalilla, and participants in the seminars at the University ofVigo and the Universidad de la Republica (Montevideo), as well as the extremely helpful comments and suggestions provided by three anonymous referees.

Based on a global input-output model, this paper estimates emissions transfers between the North and the South for eight types of air pollutants from a consumption perspective, with a focus on emissions transfers between the North and China. The results show that 14%-30% of air pollutant emissions in the South were caused by consumption in the North in 2007. There is a large 'pollution deficit' between the North and South, which significantly increased during the period 1995-2007, that favors the theory of ecologically unequal exchange. Although the emissions per capita of the North from production for most air pollutants decreased over this period, the emissions per capita from consumption increased or decreased more mildly. The decomposition of emissions transfers further shows that South-South trade in intermediates has played an increasingly important role in environmental load displacement from the North to the South. It is important to assess the sustainability of so-called 'weightless economies' in the North from a global perspective that takes environmental load displacement into account. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Despite an increased attention paid to RBOs in international relations and water scholarship, there has been little focus on defining and conceptualizing RBOs and, subsequently, on comprehensively identifying the RBOs that exist around the world. This has challenged research around RBOs in both methodological and theoretical ways. This paper aims to meet this challenge by offering a theoretically grounded definition of an international RBO and crafting a comprehensive list of international RBOs. We do so deductively, building from the larger neo-institutionalist research and international water resources governance literature. Our definition identifies three broad categories of constitutive elements: internationalization, institutionalization and governance. We apply this definition to potential cases to better identify the extent of RBOs around the world today and outline which cases qualify as RBOs and which cases fail to meet our constitutive criteria. This allows us to compile a comprehensive list of all existing international RBOs, including the identification of RBOs with specific characteristics. The article concludes by crafting an agenda for future research around RBOs that builds on this more complete understanding of RBOs.","[Schmeier, Susanne] GIZ, Dag Hammarskjold Weg 105, D-65760 Eschborn, Germany; [Gerlak, Andrea K.] Univ Arizona, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, Int Studies Assoc, Tucson, AZ USA; [Blumstein, Sabine] Univ Leipzig, Ctr Area Studies, Thomaskirchhof 20, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",University of Arizona; Leipzig University,"Schmeier, S (通讯作者)，GIZ, Dag Hammarskjold Weg 105, D-65760 Eschborn, Germany.",schmeier@transnationalstudies.eu,"Schmeier, Susanne/AAC-3565-2020","Schmeier, Susanne/0000-0001-5462-7499",,,,,86,33,36,2,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

They resolved to not repeat the closed process used to develop the Millennium Development Goals, but the OWG began work when failures to reach consensus and fatigue with multilateral environmental negotiations dominated delegates' minds, rather than examples of successfully negotiated outcomes. The OWG Co-Chairs were faced with the daunting task of guiding delegates' efforts to develop a proposed set of crisp SDGs and targets that all could agree to, and thus, had to accomplish the following goals: (1) reduce delegation rigidity, both of individual Member States and within coalitions; (2) maximize the sense of participation, transparency, and ownership to get the most buy-in at the end; and (3) develop a sense of trust that would change the relationship between Member States. To do this, the OWG Co-Chairs broke the mold of UN multilateral negotiations that Member States and observers had become familiar with and created a different approach. This article examines how the OWG accomplished these goals and overcame the shortcomings of other multilateral negotiating processes on sustainable development to produce a widely supported consensus outcome at a time when governments have struggled to achieve agreement in many multilateral negotiation tracks.","[Chasek, Pamela S.] Manhattan Coll, Bronx, NY 10471 USA; [Wagner, Lynn M.] Int Inst Sustainable Dev, 300 East 56th St Apt 11D, New York, NY USA",Manhattan College,"Chasek, PS (通讯作者)，Manhattan Coll, Bronx, NY 10471 USA.",pamela.chasek@manhattan.edu; lynn@iisd.org,,,,,,,31,28,29,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The analysis relies on a rich panel dataset collected on the Tsimane' communities in Bolivia to highlight how forest households combine sales and wage activities. Forest clearing is associated with all livelihood strategies, but the association with welfare differs depending on the strategy pursued. Households that clear more and that generate their earnings by combining agricultural sales and wage activities are better-off (judged in terms of assets) than those undertaking other strategies. By contrast, households in a subsistence strategy are not able to accumulate assets in the long run. Overall, households clear only small areas of forest, which has a positive effect on welfare and enables accumulation of assets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using unique data from a stratified, random, face-to-face survey with 1,035 households in 108 villages in 2014, we combine double bounded dichotomous choice with open-ended elicitation formats to assess the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for EFE conservation. We find that local households are willing to pay CFA 1,139.4 ((sic)1.74) per month to prevent EFE extinction. This totals CFA 753.9 million ((sic)1.15 million) per year for all inhabitants. Indigenousness positively influences the WTP for EFE conservation. Spatial data suggest that local communities prefer that elephants remain far from their crops. The existence of human-elephant conflicts has a neutral effect on preferences for EFE conservation. Therefore, our study suggests that local communities would engage in biodiversity preservation when the public benefits of conservation are accompanied by private benefits, such as human-elephant conflict avoidance.

A small number of players share access,to a common pool resource and sell their production in a common market where they are oligopolists. We depart from the mainstream literature on common pool resource oligopolies by considering that each player cares about her social status. We allow for two channels to impact a player's welfare: harvest and profits. Under the first channel, a player has a bump in her utility when her harvest is larger than the average harvest of the rest of the players. In this case we show that the presence of this channel exacerbates the tragedy of the commons. Under the second channel, a player enjoys a bump in her utility if she manages to earn more profits than the average profits of the other players. In this case we show that social status concern may temporarily alleviate the tragedy of the commons: it results in a decrease of extraction over an interval of stock sizes.

A growing body of research has helped improve our understanding of the decline's causes by examining the development of socioeconomic differences in fertility using historical micro-data, but these have largely only considered rural areas where fertility was generally slower to decline. This article contributes to the literature by utilizing individual-level data from the Roteman Database for Stockholm, Sweden between 1878 and 1926 to examine the association of socioeconomic status and fertility and the adoption of stopping behaviour during the city's transition. Using piecewise constant hazard models and logistic regression, we find that a clear class pattern arises in which the elite were early practitioners of fertility control, followed by the working classes. As the transition unfolded, socioeconomic differences in stopping behaviour disappeared and overall fertility differentials were also minimized, both of them being consistent with patterns observed in rural populations. The implications of these findings for major explanations of the decline are discussed in the concluding section.","[Molitoris, Joseph; Dribe, Martin] Lund Univ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Molitoris, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",,"Molitoris, Joseph/C-6973-2017; Molitoris, Joseph/P-6654-2019","Molitoris, Joseph/0000-0001-6038-8332; Molitoris, Joseph/0000-0001-6038-8332",Swedish Research Council; Crafoord Foundation,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Crafoord Foundation,"We would like to thank the Swedish Research Council and the Crafoord Foundation for their financial support of this work as a part of the project 'Towards the modern family.

This article draws on the papers of political leaders and contemporary financial information to argue that economic reasons were the trigger for the change in policy. Robert Peel and Charles Wood's macroeconomic policies of the 1840s, including the gold standard, the Bank Charter Act, and corn law repeal, left the Whigs unable to borrow to finance relief efforts in Ireland without panicking markets. The scaling back of public assistance programmes that resulted from thisand which increased mortality at the height of the Irish faminewas the unintended result of Peel and Wood's economic policies, in the context of the Whig government's parliamentary weakness.","[Read, Charles] Univ Cambridge Christs Coll, Cambridge CB2 3BU, England",University of Cambridge,"Read, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge Christs Coll, Cambridge CB2 3BU, England.",,,,Arts and Humanities Research Council of the United Kingdom; Arts and Humanities Research Council [1228043] Funding Source: researchfish,Arts and Humanities Research Council of the United Kingdom(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"I would like to thank Eugenio Biagini, Martin Daunton, Liam Kennedy, and the Economic History Review's anonymous referees for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this article.

This paper offers a conceptual model of UGS recreational service that follows the logical flow of ecosystem service generation, supplementing the knowledge gap and supporting the use of ecosystem base management in urban land use planning. The model includes four categories; UGS features, population characteristics, recreational use behavior, and recreational benefits while considering the use behavior as the service carrier. A process analysis shows the role of each model component in generating the services, and highlights the important role of regulating service potentials and their mobilization. Ways of informing interventions for improving efficiency or equity have been suggested. Efficiency can be assessed by applying the dose-response mechanism in the model. Equity on the other hand, can be measured by exploring which predictors of use are dominant, which advances UGS access assessment by shifting from the spatial-based to the use-based. Survey design techniques and indicators measuring various variables of the model have also been proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Individuals in infested areas may optimally reallocate how they spend their time in response to degradations in environmental quality, for example, by altering their outdoor interactions with nature or levels of community engagement. Limited qualitative evidence is suggestive that indirect impacts of invasive species on behavior and time use may be substantial, though causally-consistent empirical evidence on the sign and magnitude of such impacts is lacking. To address this gap, this study exploits a natural experiment provided by exogenous variation in ash tree (Fraxinus spp.) coverage produced by the invasive emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) to investigate changes in time use patterns across infested US counties over 2003-2013. Focusing on the labor-leisure decision, results indicate a negative and persistent relationship between emerald ash borer detection and daily outdoor leisure time as well as a positive and persistent relationship between detection and daily time spent on labor market activities. Results highlight a previously unexplored dimension of impacts created by invasive species induced ecological shocks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While the success of vaccination is unquestionable, it remains disputed to what extent the prophylactic precursor of vaccination, inoculation, reduced smallpox mortality in the eighteenth century. Smallpox was most lethal in urban populations, but most researchers have judged inoculation to have been unpopular in large towns. Recently, however, Razzell argued that inoculation significantly reduced smallpox mortality of adults and older children in London in the last third of the eighteenth century. This article uses demographic evidence from London and Manchester to confirm previous findings of a sudden fall in adult smallpox mortality and a rise in the importance of smallpox in early childhood c. 1770. The nature of these changes is consistent with an increase in smallpox transmission in London and Manchester after 1770 and indicates that smallpox inoculation was insufficient to reduce smallpox mortality in large towns. It remains unclear whether inoculation could have operated to enhance smallpox transmission or whether changes in the properties of the smallpox virus drove the intensification of smallpox mortality among young children post-1770.","[Davenport, Romola J.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Boulton, Jeremy] Univ Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Schwarz, Leonard] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Cambridge; University of Newcastle; University of Birmingham,"Davenport, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,,ESRC [RES-062-23-3221]; Leverhulme Trust [RPG-2012-803]; Wellcome Trust [081508]; Cambridge Isaac Newton Trust; ESRC [ES/I035400/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Cambridge Isaac Newton Trust; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This work was funded by the ESRC (award RES-062-23-3221), the Leverhulme Trust (award RPG-2012-803), the Wellcome Trust (award no. 081508), and the Cambridge Isaac Newton Trust.

J,"Gorlizki, Y",,,,"Gorlizki, Yoram",,,Theft under Stalin: a property rights analysis,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,STATE REPRESSION; SOVIET PROPERTY; LAW; DICTATORSHIP,"Recent work on dictatorship has focused on how repression is used by dictators to eradicate political opposition. This article examines evidence from one of the most important dictatorships of the twentieth century to suggest that this may tell only half the story. As Stalin's dictatorship progressed, repression was increasingly administered neither by the secret police nor the military-as in most dictatorships-but through the ordinary courts. The article proposes an explanation, one broadly consistent with Olson's hypothesis that Stalin was a 'proprietary dictator', an autocrat with a long time horizon who made major investments in public goods. Stalin's new form of property-'socialist property'-was one such public good. To legitimize the new form of ownership, Stalin ruled that it should be enforced through the ordinary justice system, albeit initially with high levels of repression. The article also makes two further contributions. It shows, first, how Stalin's theft campaigns are a striking historical example of what happens when an unpopular law clashes with social norms, and of how it might backfire. Second, it demonstrates how, as property rights theorists would predict, the main objects of theft legislation are generic or homogeneous goods with few property attributes.","[Gorlizki, Yoram] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Gorlizki, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",,,"Gorlizki, Yoram/0000-0003-3382-5853",,,,,98,10,10,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Based on documentation from Soviet Lithuania, the article considers the KGB (secret police) as a market regulator, commissioned to prevent the disclosure of secret government business and forestall the disruption of government plans. Where market regulation in open societies is commonly intended to improve market transparency, competition, and fair treatment of consumers and employees, KGB regulation was designed to enforce secrecy, monopoly, and discrimination. One consequence of KGB regulation of the labour market may have been adverse selection for talent. Here it is argued that the Soviet economy was designed to minimize costs.","[Harrison, Mark] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Harrison, Mark] Univ Warwick, CAGE, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Harrison, Mark] Univ Birmingham, Ctr Russian & E European Studies, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Harrison, Mark] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst onWar Revolut & Peace, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Zaksauskiene, Inga] Vilnius Univ, Fac Hist, Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Warwick; University of Warwick; University of Birmingham; Stanford University; Vilnius University,"Harrison, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.;Harrison, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, CAGE, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.;Harrison, M (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Ctr Russian & E European Studies, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.;Harrison, M (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst onWar Revolut & Peace, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,"Harrison, Mark/F-5749-2010",,University of Warwick's ESRC Centre on Competitive Advantage in the Global Economy; Vilnius University's Faculty of History; Hoover Institution; ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish,University of Warwick's ESRC Centre on Competitive Advantage in the Global Economy(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Vilnius University's Faculty of History; Hoover Institution; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Previous versions of this article were presented to the Warwick conference on the Economic History of Coercion and State Formation, University of Warwick, 31 March and 1 April 2014; the Yale Program in Economic History Conference on Russian, Soviet, and Post-Soviet Economic History: New Frontiers, Yale University, 1 and 2 Nov. 2013; the Hoover Institution Workshop on Totalitarian Regimes, 22 July to 2 Aug. 2013; the Berliner Forschungskolloquium zur Wirtschaftsgeschichte, 5 June 2013; and the Uppsala Centre for Russian and Eurasian Studies conference 'What Have We Learned from the Soviet Archives?', Uppsala, 10 and 11 May 2013.

The paper also tried to answer the following questions: first, are animal-friendly pork and organic-pork complements or substitutes (competing)? Second, what is the relationship between pork products with different animal welfare labels (i.e. freedom food pork vs specially selected pork)? Third, does the demand for animal-friendly and organic pork vary with the level of deprivation of the area where consumers are living? Design/methodology/approach - The dataset used in the analysis is the Kantar Worldpanel dataset for Scotland, which contains weekly data of food and drink purchases for consumption at home, covering the period 2006-2011. The panel is representative of the Scottish population and covers about 3,694 households. The linear version of the almost ideal demand system was estimated. Then, the own-and the cross-price elasticities as well as the expenditure elasticities for the 22 food categories and products were computed. Findings - The results indicate that when the price of animal-friendly pork increases, consumers decrease their consumption of this product and substitute it by organic pork or regular pork, especially in the case of fresh pork, bacon and sausages. It was found that products with different animal welfare accreditation are substitutes in the eyes of Scottish consumers and are, therefore, competing for the market share of animal-friendly foods. The results also show that the demand for animal-friendly pork is more elastic in the most deprived areas in Scotland. Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that estimates the demand for conventional, animal-friendly and organic pork using a scanner data in Scotland and controlling for the variation by area of deprivation.","[Akaichi, Faical; Revoredo-Giha, Cesar] Scotlands Rural Coll, Dept Land Econ Environm & Soc, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Scotland's Rural College,"Akaichi, F (通讯作者)，Scotlands Rural Coll, Dept Land Econ Environm & Soc, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",faical.akaichi@sruc.ac.uk,"Morscher, Sophie/AFU-6557-2022","Revoredo-Giha, Cesar/0000-0001-9890-4160; Akaichi, Faical/0000-0003-0395-2368",,,,,63,14,14,1,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A two-phase non-experimental, quantitative survey design with purposive sampling was used to explore the variety of foods consumed and the food security status of lower skilled (n = 63) and higher skilled (n = 81) income-earning households. During the second phase, recipe development and sensory acceptance of bread enriched with grain amaranth (n = 91) were determined. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. Findings - Food insecurity was evident among the majority of the lower skilled income households while nearly one in four households in both groups were at risk to become insecure. Daily consumption of chicken and maize meal was evident in lower income households while the frequency in higher income households were significantly less. Bread was found to be the most consumed food product among all households (p = 0.001; r = 0.455). Supplementation of wheat flour with amaranth flour, a nutritious traditionally familiar wild plant, to support households' food consumption was investigated. Results from sensory evaluation panels revealed that both bread samples with different percentage of amaranth flour (15 and 25 per cent) were acceptable. Originality/value - The most important contribution of this study is the re-introduction and incorporation of a traditional food, amaranth, into a modern frequently consumed food to support households' nutritional and monetary demands to ultimately contribute to general well-being and household food security.","[de Beer, Hanli; Mielmann, Annchen; Coetzee, Lizelle] North West Univ, Sch Physiol Nutr & Consumer Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Mielmann, A (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Sch Physiol Nutr & Consumer Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",Annchen.Mielmann@nwu.ac.za,"Mielmann, Annchen/N-1201-2017; de Beer, Hanli/O-2322-2017","Mielmann, Annchen/0000-0003-4276-4239; de Beer, Hanli/0000-0002-4806-5941",,,,,47,2,2,5,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

A dynamic ecological economic simulation model was created to assess net benefits of production (i.e., economic rent) from groundwater management while requiring a producer to maintain or restore native groundwater dependent vegetation in a well -field in Owens Valley, California. Historic groundwater withdrawal during dry conditions followed by recharge during wet conditions has reduced vegetation cover, soil stability and contributed to the drying of springs and seeps. Findings indicate adaptive management that pumps less water, but high volumes in wet years and low volumes in dry years, generates greater economic rent while supplying water, sustaining alkali meadow and maintaining dust suppression. Adaptive management generates economic rent of $82.6 million (in 2011 $) compared to status quo management of $30.5 million over 50 years pumping less annual groundwater than status quo at respective levels of 73% (6830 acre -ft; baseline conditions) and 56% (4952 acre -ft; climate change scenario). Under a climate change scenario and a 2.0 m root -zone or less, it would be cost effective to cease groundwater pumping rather than incur substantial restoration costs of the native plant community.

Design/methodology/approach - Analysis by gas chromatography was performed on 49 processed foods used as ingredients for culinary preparations (42 and seven samples before and after the implementation of the method, respectively) and 57 prepared foods (31 and 26 samples before and after the implementation of the method, respectively). In addition, the meal preparation process was monitored before the implementation of the MCTM method in order to identify the changes resulting from its application. Findings - As a result of the application of the method the processed foods whose labels reported the presence of ingredients potentially containing industrial trans fat acids (iTFA) were not purchased and used in food preparations; standard recipes prepared with processed foods free of iTFA were implemented; and also the restaurant's staff were trained to control the frying process for preparing fried foods. The average content of TFA per 100 g of prepared food was 0.21 g less (p = 0.038) after the implementation of the method. Practical implications - The MCTM method showed to be a viable and effective tool for reducing TFA levels in the studied restaurant. Originality/value - The developed method is original since no similar tool for controlling of TFA in food services has been found in the scientific literature. The fatty acid profile determination in the meals prepared after the MCTM implementation showed a reduction in TFA, indicating that the method was also viable and efficient.","[Hissanaga-Himelstein, Vanessa Martins; Da Costa Proenca, Rossana Pacheco; Block, Jane Mara] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),"Proença, RPD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",rossanacosta50@gmail.com,"DA COSTA PROENCA, ROSSANA PACHECO/U-4042-2019","DA COSTA PROENCA, ROSSANA PACHECO/0000-0001-6149-8752; Block, Jane Mara/0000-0003-3781-3366",,,,,39,1,1,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to study and compare the effects of knowledge and food technology neophobia on individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) for functionalized healthy food. Design/methodology/approach - In order to explore these effects in hypothetical vs real settings, an experiment defined by a within-subject design with two treatments (functionalized vs conventional food) on two auction payment conditions (hypothetical vs real) has been conducted. The products chosen for the experiment were two different types of crushed tomatoes: conventional crushed tomatoes (control product) and a crushed tomatoes enriched with lycopene (functionalized product). Findings - Results showed that participants stated, on average, a higher WTP for tomatoes enriched with lycopene than for conventional. This positive premium price was not affected by socio-demographic variables, political orientation and tomato-related preferences. As expected, the level of knowledge about lycopene exerted a significant positive effect on premium price in both auctions condition. Also the Healthy choice subscale of the Food Technology Neophobia Scale (FTNS) was a significant predictor of premium price, but only when the auction was hypothetical. Originality/value - This paper might shed some light upon the predictive power of the FTNS on individuals' behavior in a real market setting.","[La Barbera, Francesco] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Polit Sci, Naples, Italy; [Amato, Mario; Sannino, Giuliana] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, Portici, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II,"Amato, M (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, Portici, Italy.",mario.amato2@unina.it,"Amato, Mario/AAF-6290-2019; Amato, Mario/AAB-8409-2022","Amato, Mario/0000-0002-7557-5912;",,,,,53,38,38,2,48,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - FoodShare, a New Zealand urban-based social enterprise specialising in food redistribution, served as a case study for this research. Semi-structured interviews (n = 13) were conducted with FoodShare staff and key stakeholder groups (food donors, financial donors, recipient agencies and volunteers). In addition, an anonymous online survey (n = 40) was completed by the wider organisational volunteer network. The interview guides were structured around a new social value evaluation tool, Social Return on Investment, which is increasingly used to demonstrate the impact of such programmes. Deductive methods were used to code the resulting transcripts to identify key outcomes experienced by FoodShare's stakeholders. Findings - The outcomes of FoodShare's work differed for the various stakeholders. For food donors, outcomes included more involved relationships with community, and improved perceptions of corporate social responsibility. Identified key outcomes for the financial donors included key promotional opportunity and do something good. For recipient agencies, important outcomes were greater volume of food and increased reach. Volunteers reported meeting new people, a sense of accomplishment in helping others and learning new skills. There were also a number of nutritional and environmental outcomes for the wider community. Originality/value - Given the dearth of evidence on the societal value that is created in redistributing unsold food to people in need, this novel perspective makes a significant contribution to the literature in this area.","[Mirosa, Miranda; Mangan-Walker, Ella] Univ Otago, Dept Food Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Mainvil, Louise; Horne, Hayley] Univ Otago, Dept Human Nutr, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Otago; University of Otago,"Mirosa, M (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Food Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand.",miranda.mirosa@otago.ac.nz,"Mirosa, Miranda/L-2743-2015","Mirosa, Miranda/0000-0002-4476-3793",,,,,40,29,29,2,47,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This paper is intended to contribute to the development of an ecological macroeconomics that addresses these multiple crises in combination. Insights from different research communities will be included in this effort. Taking an ecological economic understanding of sustainability as the point Of departure, and inspired by systems thinking, it is discussed which economic sub-systems should be in focus for sustainability transitions, and whether relevant guides for sustainability can be formulated for these systems. In particular, the focus is on systems that are decisive for resource consumption and pollution although their influence on these is indirect. A simple typology of sub-systems is suggested and applied in relation to an example that highlights the importance of the interplay between macroeconomic, provision and distribution systems. The example concerns investments in sustainability transitions of provision systems and demonstrates the complexities of implementing such transformations during the economic crisis. It also addresses the need for ecological macroeconomics to develop a third position beyond austerity policies and Keynesian approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

By means of a cross-sectional analysis on OECD small regions (Territorial Level 3), the paper distinguishes spread effects-positive spillovers arising from urban growth-from the net effect of distance to nonrural places. The results show that spread effects outweigh backwash effects, so that rural regions benefit from growth in urban places. A rural region's distance from urban and intermediate regions has a negative effect on its population growth rate. Nevertheless, both the strength of this effect and the growth spillovers decline with distance, and this occurs relatively faster in Europe. The results further suggest that proximity to large urban areas has a higher positive influence than proximity to intermediate areas, but only outside Europe.","[Veneri, Paolo] OECD, Directorate Publ Governance & Terr Dev, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Ruiz, Vicente] OECD, Dev Ctr, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Veneri, P (通讯作者)，OECD, Directorate Publ Governance & Terr Dev, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",paolo.veneri@oecd.org; vicente.ruiz@oecd.org,"Veneri, Paolo/JCP-4773-2023","Veneri, Paolo/0000-0002-4640-5500",,,,,47,19,21,5,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

We challenge this 'trickle-down' assumption by explicitly investigating the factors that might impede ecosystem services yielding benefits to different stakeholder groups, based on a targeted literature review of First Nations' access to shellfish on Canada's Pacific Coast. Our review revealed four sets of barriers to realizing benefits from ecosystem services despite their abundance within many First Nation territories. The barriers highlight problems of access, particularly as driven by geographic location, technical capacity, markets and user conflicts, and management (of harvest and access), all of which limit First Nations' procuring of resources linked to key services. Our findings demonstrate that simply increasing ecosystem service supply does not necessarily increase benefits for individuals or groups. Realizing the promise that ecosystem services research will enhance human well-being through improved management depends on the explicit consideration of how access mediates the distribution of benefits.

We outline the development of a dedicated system dynamics macro-economic model for describing Financial Assets and Liabilities in a Stock-Flow consistent Framework (FALSTAFF) and use this model to explore the potential for stationary state outcomes in an economy with balanced trade, credit creation by banks, and private equity. Contrary to claims in the literature, we find that neither credit creation nor the charging of interest on debt creates a 'growth imperative' in and of themselves. This finding remains true even when capital adequacy and liquidity requirements are imposed on banks. We test the robustness of our results in the face of random variations and one-off shocks. We show further that it is possible to move from a growth path towards a stationary state without either crashing the economy or dismantling the system. Nonetheless, there remain several good reasons to support the reform of the monetary system. Our model also supports critiques of austerity and underlines the value of countercyclical spending by government. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The concomitant increase in the less rewarding online advertising has been unable to make up for this loss. As a result, for every $ 1 increase in online advertising between 2005 and 2011, newspapers lost $ 22 in print advertising. While it is conceivable that the overall change in the advertising landscape (such as the growth of targeted search advertising), contributed to the decline in print advertising, it is not clear whether the growth in online newspaper advertising aggravated or alleviated this global trend. We investigate this concern by studying how advertisers reallocate their media budgets over time between the online and print media within a newspaper. We perform our empirical analysis using unique panel data on account-level advertising expenditures in a Top 50 US newspaper from 2005 through 2011. After accounting for cross-sectional heterogeneity among advertisers and some factors that possibly drove both print and online newspaper advertising, we find a negative relationship between the ad spending in these two media options. Therefore, advertisers exhibit a higher propensity to decrease print spending when they increase their online spending compared to the scenario when online spending either remains unchanged or even decreases. Since we do not rely on exclusion restrictions, we cannot rule out residual factors that drove both print and online advertising and thus contaminated this relationship. However, such potentially confounding factors (e.g., change in total media budget) are likely to have induced a positive correlation between print and online advertising. Therefore, the negative relationship that we recover is suggestive of advertisers perceiving print and online newspaper advertising as substitutes. This, in turn, implies that the growth in online newspaper advertising exacerbated the overall decline in print advertising. Overall, we attribute 7-17 % of the decline in print newspaper advertising revenues between 2005 and 2011 to the growth of online newspaper advertising. We conclude that cannibalization should be a credible consideration in the marketing decisions of the newspaper. However, since a large portion of print advertising revenue decline also occured for advertisers who never purchased online advertising from the newspaper, cannibalization within the newspaper is not solely responsible for the downward trajectory of print advertising.","[Sridhar, Shrihari] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Sriram, S.] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Sriram, S (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",ssrira@umich.edu,,,Smeal College of Business; 3M Corporation,Smeal College of Business; 3M Corporation(3M),"The authors thank Dan Ackerberg, Anocha Aribarg, Pradeep Chintagunta, Fred Feinberg, Rajdeep Grewal, Wes Hartmann, Pranav Jindal, Aradhna Krishna, Gary Lilien, Puneet Manchanda, Murali Mantrala, Kanishka Misra, Yesim Orhun, Joseph Pancras, seminar participants at the Iowa State University, Syracuse University, University of Michigan, University of Virginia, University of Wisconsin, and the participants at the 2012 Marketing Science Conference, 2014 UTD FORMS conference and 2014 ISBM Academic Conference for their comments and suggestions.

European powers colonized some areas for military reasons: to keep those areas out of rivals' hands or to have geographically strategic outposts. In these cases, European settlement was low and there was nothing to extract. This article examines the extent to which living standards, as measured by real wages, among three such examples-Cyprus, Gibraltar, and Malta-can be explained by British rule. These highly comparable Mediterranean islands did not enjoy democratic governments nor did they endure authoritarian ones. Colonial institutions worked through ensuring an environment in which Mediterranean trade could flourish. This adds another layer to our understanding of the economic impact of colonization, extending the simple settler versus extractive dichotomy. It also contradicts the historiography's claims that living standards were low, and determined by British military expenditure. Living standards in these countries were in fact at the European average.","[Caruana-Galizia, Paul] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ Hist, London, England; [Caruana-Galizia, Paul] Humboldt Univ, Dept Econ, Berlin, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Caruana-Galizia, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ Hist, London, England.",,,,"EU-Maltese Government Steps Scholarship, London School of Economics","EU-Maltese Government Steps Scholarship, London School of Economics","Thanks are due to Jessica Magri for help with data collection and comments over the duration of this project; to the editor and three anonymous referees for extensive comments; and also to Rachel Rowe and Ann Leonard at the Commonwealth Room in the Cambridge University Library, and the staff at the National Archives of Malta.

To analyse this question, this article examines the introduction of two types of modern secondary education, the Gewerbeschule and its successor, the Realschule, in nineteenth-century Bavaria. Since the opening of these schools is arguably endogenous-as it was mainly the large, prosperous cities that opened one-the estimated treatment effect capturing the economic influence of the Gewerbeschule/Realschule will lead to biased results. To alleviate this bias, propensity score matching is adopted to compare relatively similar counties with and without these schools. Using historical county-level data on tax revenues, business formations, employment structure, and patent holdings, ordinary least squares regression analysis shows that the opening of a modern secondary school is in general positively associated with economic performance several years later.","[Semrad, Alexandra] Univ Munich, D-81377 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Semrad, A (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",,,,,,,,77,10,11,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

We focus solely on the impact of changes in consumption patterns caused by demographic change on the structures of the MFs from 2005 to 2035. As a result, the total MFs of neodymium, cobalt, and platinum in 2035 are estimated to be 11%, 6.6% and 4.7% lower than in 2005, respectively. In terms of commodity sectors, the MFs of the three metals induced by passenger motor cars are estimated to decrease most between 2005 and 2035. Finally, we carried out an assessment of the extent to which the products dealt with under current Japanese recycling laws cover the MFs calculated for 2035. This indicates that continued enforcement of the recycling laws can play an important role in alerting consumers to the MFs of critical metals, particularly neodymium. For improving the accuracy of the above estimates, further studies need to incorporate other future trends like technologies and trade. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The cultural attribute, specifically, was valued in mid-range between economic, recreational and environmental attributes. Estimated willingness-to-pay were $40/year by Maori, and $28/year by the general public, to enhance Maori cultural attributes, where Maori willingness-to-pay is indicative only due to a small number of respondents. Importantly, this demonstrates support for the management outcome for cultural attributes, which is valued not only by those who directly participate in this use. This suggests that non-market valuation practitioners should be aware of indigenous cultural values, the omission of which could have impacts on welfare estimates and subsequent decision making.

It has been extensively documented that the affluence of elites was built on the importation of slaves. However, the Dutch East India Company or Verengide Oost-indische Companje, which administrated the colony, expressed concerns that free settlers had invested too much capital in the trade, so that some indications exist that profitability was not certain for all farmers. In this paper, hedonic slave price indices and the value of their marginal productivity have been estimated, to construct annual returns, which are in turn compared with returns on other investments for the period 1700-1725. Hedonic price functions were estimated to remove the anticipated lifetime returns that slaves would yield and to isolate buyers' perceived depreciation of the slave for 1 year. Cobb-Douglas production functions were estimated for average farmers, as well as at various quintiles along the distribution, to evaluate scale effects. Large farmers enjoyed high returns to slavery over most of the period, confirming the assertions that the elite used slaves profitably. Small farmers, however, did not recoup slave costs from agricultural production: this suggests either that they overinvested in slavery relative to other capital goods (e.g. ploughs or wagons), or that they used slaves profitably outside of agriculture.","[Du Plessis, Sophia; Jansen, Ada; von Fintel, Dieter] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [von Fintel, Dieter] Inst Study Lab IZA, Bonn, Germany",Stellenbosch University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Du Plessis, S (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",sophia@sun.ac.za,,"von Fintel, Dieter/0000-0001-6771-1315; Jansen, Ada/0000-0003-1430-2221",Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA),Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA),"We thank participants of the ERSA/FRESH conference, the Economic History Society of Southern Africa session at the ESSA conference and the SANORD research workshop for their useful comments.

This study investigated the effect of the resolution of mrIO databases on consumption-based material footprints. The effect of aggregation was investigated by constructing input-output tables with different spatial, product and material category resolutions and comparing the calculated material footprints. Our results indicate that the material footprints of countries calculated using the different spatial and product aggregations are in general in the order of a few percent, with outliers in the order of 25% difference. The use of IO models with a low product category resolution (e.g. 60 product categories) to calculate the embodied material use of individual products will likely result in inaccurate estimations of the total embodied material for some product categories. Aggregating the original 46 material categories into 16 categories changes the calculated material footprint of countries by about 30%. This result strongly suggests that the material data used to create the extensions for the IO framework should be collected at the highest resolution that is practically feasible.

Despite having required financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund only 18 months earlier, the British government managed to secure triple-A' ratings from both Standard and Poor's and Moody's. Both assessments of creditworthiness reflected improving economic conditions but also British efforts to influence the sovereign ratings process. The Bank of England and the Treasury sought guidance from American investment banks to prepare for the ratings process and then controlled the flow of information available to the rating agencies accordingly, stressing the strengths of the national economy and downplaying the weaknesses. The British government subsequently launched its first bond issue in the New York market to high levels of investor demand. Consideration of these achievements complements the historiography concerning Britain's economic fortunes in the late 1970s. Scrutiny of events also offers a rare glimpse into the confidential sovereign ratings process. Both agencies relied on a combination of quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the UK. In addition, this article highlights the existence of a unique period in the history of sovereign credit ratings. From 1974 to 1985, the ratings industry enjoyed a cautious revival focused principally on triple-A' borrowers.","Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Gill, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",,"Gill, David/JJF-6136-2023","Gill, David/0000-0001-7486-6593",Economic History Society; Scouloudi Foundation,Economic History Society; Scouloudi Foundation,"I am grateful to the three anonymous reviewers for their many helpful comments.

We describe a systematic ex ante approach to support the strategic preparedness of risk management and apply it to a biosecurity case study. Our framework integrates a war-game model and a structured decision making approach. The model provides interactive maps that help stakeholders in visualizing the economic impacts of the extreme risk under different management scenarios, and it facilitates adaptive management by translating science-based results into stakeholder perspectives. The structured decision making approach not only offers an analytical structure to organize the multiple objectives of risk management, but also functions as a platform for group deliberation among alternative courses of management action with uncertain consequences. We found that this integration helped stakeholders develop a better understanding of the complexities and interconnectedness of the extreme risk management and reached a consensus regarding the most preferred management option.

This article uses a rich new micro-dataset to examine the occupational attainment of migrants, mostly internal migrants, in the city of Barcelona, a key destination from the late nineteenth century onwards, adding to the literature on internal migrations in Spain during the period of industrialization. The study shows that the occupational outcomes achieved by early migrants tended to match those of natives, the reference group. However, some groups of migrants who arrived at the end of the period covered by the study show poorer outcomes than natives. The relative underachievement of these groups is explained by changes in the type of migrants and in the characteristics of the labour market.

Existing theories hypothesize some sort of indivisibility or increasing returns to scale in wealth to overcome the testator's inclination toward equal sharing among heirs. Examining a micro-level data set of seventeenth-century English wills, we find that even after controlling for land and other presumed sources of increasing returns to scale and indivisibility, other variables such as financial wealth still correlate with the incidence of unigeniture. This leads us to propose a model where unigeniture is an efficient way to provide insurance against income shocks. An important implication of the theory is that observed unequal bequests are partially counteracted by ex post transfers. Therefore, inequality of bequests cannot be taken as evidence of inequality of consumption between heirs.","[Grieco, Paul L.

The firm chooses a set of consumers to whom to offer their product and a price across two stages of sales. When this publicly-observable localization is available, the cheapest way for the high quality seller to separate herself from a low quality seller is to initially offer the product to the smallest set of consumers who will saturate the network with word-of-mouth; targeting a set that generates less word-of-mouth will require more money-burning to successfully signal. The set is idiosyncratic and identifying it requires considering the connectivity of sets of nodes in the network collectively, rather than relying on individual measures of connectivity. Observable networks therefore enable credible signaling that is less socially wasteful than would otherwise be the case, and this benefit is greater the smaller is the set of consumers which will cover the network with word-of-mouth.","[Campbell, James D.] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Campbell, James D.] Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough; University of Toronto,"Campbell, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto Scarborough, Toronto, ON, Canada.",James.Campbell@rotman.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,45,6,6,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

After the 1860s, real wages recovered and eventually reached 18th-century levels in the early 20th century. Real wages of Mexico City's workers subsequently fell behind those of high-wage economies to converge with the lower fringes of middle-wage economies.

Design/methodology/approach - This ecological study was based on analyses of available data regarding populations of countries throughout the world. The study analyzed indicators related to food production, food supply, the anthropometric traits of malnutrition, and ecological impacts. Data were analyzed via scatter plots and Pearson's correlation. Findings - Food supply, when compared with food production, is more significantly associated with environmental impacts. Also, the supply of meats, when compared with the supply of cereals, has a stronger association with environmental impacts and obesogenic severity. Meat supply is strongly associated with the ecological footprint (r = 0.782, p < 0.001), with CO2 emissions (r = 0.602, p < 0.001), and with the water footprint (r = 0.503, p < 0.001). Thus, the average body mass index (BMI) of populations worldwide is strongly associated with environmental impacts considering the ecological footprint (r = 0.559, p < 0.001), and the CO2 emissions (r = 0.460, p < 0.001). Practical implications -Actions that are better aligned with worldwide urgencies related to obesogenic problems, food supply/consumption, and environmental issues are needed. This study provides a better understanding about environmental and obesogenic impacts associated with food supply. Originality/value - The originality is focussed on important evidence regarding environmental and obesogenic severity strongly associated with meat supply.","[Abbade, Eduardo Botti] Franciscan Univ Ctr, Business Adm Course, Dept Social Sci, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil",,"Abbade, EB (通讯作者)，Franciscan Univ Ctr, Business Adm Course, Dept Social Sci, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.",edabbade@hotmail.com,"Abbade, Eduardo/J-1642-2015","Abbade, Eduardo/0000-0002-0552-0051",,,,,71,8,8,1,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

It has been found that the potential for production of agricultural biogas is used to a small degree and by very large installations, which is not conducive to the development of prosumer energy. Two reasons have been identified for the aforementioned situation: the high start-up costs of such operations and inconsistent state policy aimed at supporting RES.

Design/methodology/approach - Through two phases of experimental studies on 30 hypothetical functional foods, this paper analyzed the relationship between perceived carrier-ingredient fit and purchase intention which were reported by participants with different nutrition knowledge levels and in conditions that differed in the content of health claim. Findings - Phase 1 (n = 62) found that the positive influence of perceived fit on purchase intention of functional products was moderated by one's prior nutrition knowledge; compared to those knowledgeable in food/nutrition fields, consumers with less knowledge relied more heavily on the perceived carrier-ingredient fit when making purchase decision. The results of study 2 Phase 2 (n = 93) revealed that the perceived fit was more important to predict purchase intention in the condition without health claim. A further analysis revealed that health claim increased the purchase intention particularly for functional foods receiving poor perceived carrier-ingredient fit. Practical implications - For innovative functional foods, the product development and market penetration may be benefit from fine-grained segmentation and positioning strategies that are based on the understanding of interaction between intuitive perception and cognitive knowledge. Originality/value - The present work highlights consumers' perception of the carrier-perception fit, interacting with nutrition knowledge and health claim, as a critical factor determining the acceptance of functional foods.","Dalhousie Univ, Fac Agr, Truro, NS, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Lu, J (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Fac Agr, Truro, NS, Canada.",ji.lu@dal.ca,"Lu, Ji/AAR-2726-2021","Lu, Ji/0000-0003-1048-235X","Department of Business and Social Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture in Dalhousie University","Department of Business and Social Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture in Dalhousie University","The author would like to acknowledge James Keddy for his contribution to data collection and analyses.

This paper investigates the impact of the differences in national cultural values on the extent to which the companies disclose their environmental performance information. This cross-cultural comparison based on the National cultural values (as suggested by Hofstede, 1980, Hofstede, 2001, and Hofstede et al., 2010), which include Individualism, Power distance, Uncertainty avoidance, Masclulinty, Long term Orientation, and Indulgence. The sample includes the annual reports of 655 large companies from 20 countries selected from 10 different cultural areas, based on the international classification of accounting systems proposed by Gray S. J., 1988. We utilized the content analysis technique to capture the environmental disclosures of financial year 2012 within six industries are Automobiles, Chemicals, Foods, Metals and Mining, Oil and Gas, and Pulp and Paper. Our results indicate that two of Hofstede's national cultural dimensions are linked to a higher degree of corporate environmental disclosure. In particular, a nation's high degree of individualism and indulgence were both related to high level of corporate environmental disclosure. While one of Hofstede's national cultural dimensions is linked to a low degree of corporate environmental disclosure. The nation's high degree of power distance was related to low degree of corporate environmental disclosure. Other dimensions such as Uncertainty Avoidance, Masculinity, and LTO are not related to Corporate Environmental Reporting. The control variables (regions, industries and firm size) were significantly related to corporate environmental disclosure. As a result, this study will support analysis of foreign markets by understanding the cultural variations throughout different countries within different cultural contexts. Furthermore, the results of the study can be considered as a guide for multinational corporations to evaluate the economic, legal, social situations in different countries when they wish to enter new markets.","[Once, Saime; Almagtome, Akeel] Anadolu Univ, Eskisehir, Turkey",Anadolu University,"Once, S (通讯作者)，Anadolu Univ, Eskisehir, Turkey.",sonce@anadolu.edu.tr; Akeel_habeeb@yahoo.com,"Önce, Saime/GWZ-7107-2022; Almagtome, Akeel/I-5713-2017","Önce, Saime/0000-0001-9828-1872; Almagtome, Akeel/0000-0001-8317-1646",,,,,20,1,1,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2015,,,,,,,251,260,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450589500027,0

Therefore, the aim of the paper is to define relative changes in economic policy incentives encouraging agricultural production being created by the structural support for agriculture under the Rural Development programme for Lithuania for 2014-2020. For that purpose measures aimed at support for business entities (producers) under the Rural Development programmes for 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 are compared. The results of the comparative analysis reveal that total support and its intensity is decreasing in the period 2014-2020 compared to that in the period 2007-2013. The decrease of support can induce lagging in structural changes or advancement in productivity as an option to overcome structural deficiencies.","[Stonkute, Egle; Vveinhardt, Jolita] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Stonkute, E (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania.",,"Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020","Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Stonkute, Egle/0000-0003-2112-7345",,,,,12,0,0,0,1,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-187-6,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2015,,37,,,,,64,75,,,,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BD3PQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360011300006,0

This in turn has implications for consumer nutrition outcomes and acceptance of expert advice regarding food and health. The research exploring consumer trust is found across a broad range of research streams, and is not cohesive in topic or approach. The purpose of this paper is to synthesise the disparate literature exploring the interaction between food labelling and consumer trust to determine what is known, and gaps in knowledge regarding food labelling and consumer trust. Design/methodology/approach - A systematic search of trust and food labelling literature was conducted, with study results synthesised and integrated. Studies were then critically analysed for the conceptualisation of the consumer, the label, and their interaction with a framework developed using social theories of trust. Findings - In total, 27 studies were identified. It was found that not only is the current literature predominantly atheoretical, but the conceptualisation of labelling has been limited. Research limitations/implications - Further empirical research is needed to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the role food labelling plays in influencing consumer trust in food systems. Originality/value - This research develops a conceptualisation of the dual roles food labelling may play in influencing consumer trust in food systems. It distinguishes between trust in food labelling itself, and the trust consumers develop in the food supply system through food labelling. The novel theoretical model and synthesis provide a foundation upon which future research may be conducted.","[Tonkin, Emma; Wilson, Annabelle M.; Coveney, John] Flinders Univ S Australia, Dept Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Webb, Trevor] Food Stand Australia New Zealand, Behav & Regulatory Anal Sect, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Meyer, Samantha B.] Univ Waterloo, Sch Publ Hlth & Hlth Syst, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",Flinders University South Australia; University of Waterloo,"Tonkin, E (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Dept Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",emma.tonkin@flinders.edu.au,"Wilson, Annabelle M/S-1482-2018","Tonkin, Emma/0000-0001-9941-4251",Australian Postgraduate Award,Australian Postgraduate Award(Australian Government),ET receives an Australian Postgraduate Award to complete her doctoral studies.

Furthermore, it contributes to the sparse literature about tea consumption. Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on data collected via an online consumer survey. First respondents took part in a choice experiment with tea varying in its price (four levels) and quality (conventional/organic/fairtrade/organic and fair trade). Then they had to complete a questionnaire about their attitudes towards food consumption. Respondents, who always chose sustainable tea, at no matter what price, were grouped and those that always chose the conventional tea. A bivariate logistic regression is used to analyse the influencing socio-demographic and attitudinal dimensions that characterise the two groups of convinced consumers. Findings - Convinced sustainable consumers are more often female than male and perceive that their personal purchase decision has an impact on overall sustainable development. They show a higher willingness to increase sustainability through their consumption behaviour. They are very much interested in high food quality and are not as much influenced by advertisements and offers in their purchase decision making as convinced conventional consumers. Originality/value - The main contribution of this study is to provide practical information for actors in the field of sustainable food marketing about how to target their most relevant segment, the convinced sustainable consumer with special regard to sustainable tea consumption.","[von Meyer-Hoefer, Marie; von der Wense, Vera; Spiller, Achim] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev Mkt Food & Agr Prod, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"von Meyer-Höfer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev Mkt Food & Agr Prod, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",marie.von-meyer@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Spiller, Achim/CAJ-5518-2022",,German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This research was financially supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG).,,90,25,27,6,77,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Demonstrated on the U.S. electricity markets, ABM is integrated with normative and subjective decision behavior recommended by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Furthermore, the modeling and solution methodology address shortcomings in previous ABM and Transactive Energy (TE) approaches and advances our ability to model and understand ECAS behaviors through computational intelligence.

In Central Asia, however, the Syr Darya Basin possesses an abundance of tributary-level cooperative agreements that guide and codify water sharing and management on the sub-basin scale. To understand the volume and nature of this cooperation, this paper compiled and analyzed a set of agreements that apply to small transboundary tributaries (STTs) in the Syr Darya Basin. The paper assembled the largest collection of STT water agreements-123 in total-and classified such documents according to a range of criteria including: purpose and objectives, water management issues, and operational mechanisms. Results of this work highlight a rise in sub-basin-scale cooperation in the first decade of the twenty-first century, a time when large-scale cooperation appeared tenuous; a practical orientation to transboundary water management at a small scale; and an abundance of treaties of short time duration. These findings present options related to scale, time duration and focus of transboundary water law that can help inform future treaty development.","[Holmatov, Bunyod; Kazbekov, Jusipbek] Int Water Management Inst, Apt 123,Bldg 6,Osiyo St, Tashkent 100000, Uzbekistan; [Lautze, Jonathan] Int Water Management Inst, Private Bag X813, ZA-0127 Pretoria, South Africa",CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI); CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI),"Holmatov, B (通讯作者)，Int Water Management Inst, Apt 123,Bldg 6,Osiyo St, Tashkent 100000, Uzbekistan.",b.holmatov@cgiar.org; j.lautze@cgiar.org; j.kazbekov@cgiar.org,"Holmatov, Bunyod/AAG-8973-2019","Holmatov, Bunyod/0000-0001-9267-7008",,,,,57,5,7,1,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

B. rubostriata is a non-native species that feeds on sugarcane and can be a carrier of sugarcane white leaf phytoplasma, a disease capable of causing up to 100% crop loss. The total economic impacts considered in the prediction include direct, indirect and induced economic impacts. These estimates are essential for policy-makers to formulate appropriate responses. Results show that the cumulative total impacts could be as high as $5.4 million from B. rubostriata only or $71.6 million from B. rubostriata and the phytoplasma after 5 years. State and local governments could lose a cumulative total of $438,450 in tax while federal revenues would be reduced by $4 million with B. rubostriata and phytoplasma after 5 years. Cumulative employment effects range from 184 lost jobs with just B. rubostriata to 2460 lost jobs with B. rubostriata and phytoplasma by year 5, about one-tenth percentage point increase in Louisiana's unemployment rate at current employment levels.

In our experience, managers want to be given many possible options to restore freshwater ecosystems that are workable within spatial, temporal, operational, and budgetary constraints of the system. Correspondingly, a new field for systematic river restoration planning has emerged through the use of well-established systems design concepts like multi-objective optimization and tradeoff analysis. In this article, we propose a decision framework for systematic river restoration planning where economic-environment systems design and tradeoff analyses are employed as a concurrent planning procedure before restoration interventions are implemented. Heuristic optimization and multi-criteria decision analysis methods are proposed to systematically design and objectively evaluate non-dominated economic-environment tradeoffs associated with restoration strategies within a watershed, and to provide a short-list of viable restoration alternatives to decision makers for negotiation and implementation. The proposed framework has the capacity to make science-based information and sophisticated decision support methods available for stakeholder deliberation. To illustrate the phases of the framework, we use a published case study of systematic restoration planning in South East Queensland, Australia.

This article presents a general dynamic model of renewable energy policy with long time horizons, endogenous electoral competition, and techno-political path dependence. We calibrate the model with data on the economics of contemporary renewable energy technologies. In doing so, we discover transition dynamics not present in economy-energy models, which ignore politics, or in formal political economy models, which ignore long-term technological dynamics. We show that the largest effects of partisan ideology on policy occur when the competing parties disagree on the importance of energy policy. In these cases, the less ideological party appeases the more ideological one, while the more ideological party attempts to appease the electorate. The results demonstrate that political dynamics could have large effects on the development of renewable energy and carbon dioxide emissions over time, influencing the ability of countries to reach various climate mitigation trajectories.

The methodology applied, Multi Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM), has been developed in the last decades to analyze societal metabolism from the perspective of complex systems. This study has allowed us to see that since the entry of Spain in the European Economic Community in 1986, the real-state/tourism business model has been reinforced giving place to a higher level of consumption of fossil fuels, an increase in work instability and a diminishing of labor productivity.

Successful biodiversity conservation often requires a landscape-scale approach and the spatial coordination of participation, for example in the creation of wildlife corridors. In this paper, we use a laboratory experiment to explore two features of procurement auctions in a forest landscape: the pricing mechanism (uniform vs. discriminatory) and availability of communication (chat) between potential sellers. We modify the experimental design developed by Reeson et al. (2011) by introducing uncertainty (and hence heterogeneity) in the production value of forest sites as well as an automated, endogenous stopping rule. We find that discriminatory pricing yields to greater environmental benefits per government dollar spent, chiefly because it is easier to construct long corridors. Chat also facilitates such coordination but also seems to encourage collusion in sustaining high prices for the most environmentally attractive plots. These two effects offset each other, making chat neutral from the viewpoint of maximizing environmental effect per dollar spent. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While the costs of adaptation might be observable and immediate, the benefits are often uncertain. The limitations of traditional decision-making processes in the context of adaptation decisions are recognised, and so-called robust approaches are increasingly explored in the literature. Robust approaches select projects that meet their purpose across a variety of futures by integrating a wide range of climate scenarios, and are thus particularly suited for deep uncertainty. We review real option analysis, portfolio analysis, robust-decision making and no/low regret options as well as reduced decision-making time horizons, describing the underlying concepts and highlighting a number of applications. We discuss the limitations of robust decision-making processes to identify which ones may prove most promising as adaptation planning becomes increasingly critical; namely those that provide a compromise between a meaningful analysis and simple implementation. We introduce a simple framework identifying which method is suited for which application. We conclude that the 'robust decision making' method offers the most potential in adaptation appraisal as it can be applied with various degrees of complexity and to a wide range of options.

Despite the extensive literature studying the relationship between innovation and productivity, there are far fewer studies in this particular area examining the importance of sectoral externalities, especially focused on Spain. One novelty of this study, conducted for the industrial and service sectors, is that we also consider the technology level of the sector in which the firm operates and firm size. The database used is the Technological Innovation Panel. It comprises 9985 firms over the period 2004-2009 and has been used infrequently for studies of this type. The Olley and Pakes (Econometrica 64: 1263-1297, 1996) estimator is adopted in order to account for both simultaneity and selection biases providing consistent estimates. The results suggest that, unlike previous studies, R&D expenditures do not have a direct impact on firm performance. By contrast, spillovers do. In particular, intra-industry externalities present a positive and significant effect in low-tech and large firms. Inter-industry externalities, however, present an ambiguous effect and there appears to be no specific pattern of behaviour associated with technology level or firm size.","[Goya, Esther; Vaya, Esther; Surinach, Jordi] Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Business, AQR IREA Res Grp, Ave Diagonal 690,Tower 4, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Goya, E (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Business, AQR IREA Res Grp, Ave Diagonal 690,Tower 4, Barcelona, Spain.",egoya@ub.edu,"Suriñach, Jordi/E-6801-2016","Surinach, Jordi/0000-0003-2622-3280; Vaya Valcarce, Esther/0000-0001-5661-5627","European Union [FP7-SSH-2010-2.2-1, 266834]; Ministry of Education and Science [ECO2009-12678/ECON, ECO2010-16006/ECON, ECO2013-41022-R]; CUR of the DIUE of the Generalitat de Catalunya; European Social Fund","European Union(European Union (EU)); Ministry of Education and Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); CUR of the DIUE of the Generalitat de Catalunya; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF))","This research has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7-SSH-2010-2.2-1 (2011-2014), under grant agreement no 266834.

The main focus in the questionnaire was on factors that influence tourists when considering buying food in general and food souvenirs in particular. Findings - The main finding was that food souvenirs should be adapted to the needs of tourists with high and low innovativeness to fulfil the needs of the whole target tourist population. Even though highly innovative tourists were more willing to buy food souvenirs that are characteristic of the country visited, tourists with low innovativeness may have been more comfortable with the purchase of food that is less innovative, within a different food-culture. The main factors influencing tourists in choosing and buying food and food souvenirs on holiday are quality, taste, local origin and the perceived authenticity of the food. Originality/value - This paper provides data that reveal similarities and most interestingly differences in food choice behaviour of consumers in the context of being tourists. It describes the relationship of choice with innovativeness, which may vary while being at home vs being a tourist and exposed to a distant food culture. It brings together perspectives on local food, authenticity, familiarity, innovativeness, budget management/price and their interaction during a real life situation that is rarely studied in the consumer research literature. This study adds a refreshing sample to the existing literature about food choice; tourists.","[Altintzoglou, Themistoklis; Heide, Morten] Nofima, Norwegian Inst Food Fisheries & Aquaculture Res, Consumer & Mkt Res, Tromso, Norway; [Borch, Trude] Nofima, Norwegian Inst Food Fisheries & Aquaculture Res, Ind Econ & Strateg Management, Tromso, Norway",Nofima; Nofima,"Altintzoglou, T (通讯作者)，Nofima, Norwegian Inst Food Fisheries & Aquaculture Res, Consumer & Mkt Res, Tromso, Norway.",themis.altintzoglou@nofima.no,"Altintzoglou, Themistoklis/AEO-3958-2022; Borch, Thomas/A-2288-2008","Altintzoglou, Themistoklis/0000-0002-9877-966X;",,,,,54,32,36,5,55,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative quality and food safety audit tool was developed to perform second party audits within the confectionery industry supply chain. Nine flourmills and four food packaging producers were included in the audit program. Initial audits were performed at the beginning of the program, with follow-up audits performed after one year. Findings - Level of implementation of food safety and quality requirements were presented as scores. Flourmills improved their scores from 38.6 to 64.4 percent during the period of two years. In contrast, at the end of the second year, food packaging producers showed a lower level of improvement from 34.0 to 45.6 percent. This research confirmed that certification status does not imply high performance of a quality/food safety system. Companies experienced problems in identifying processes, setting performance indicators and objectives and implementing problem solving tools. Quality control has been identified as a dimension where most companies do not document their control methods and have no method in place to verify consistency in their results. Control of risks in terms of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point implementation was identified as the main food safety constraint. Research limitations/implications - Limitations of the research stein from the use of results from one part of the confectionery supply chain, from auditing a limited number of companies and from excluding the technological level of the audited companies, Practical implications This study provides a valuable insight for quality and/or food safety assurance managers on benefits of using second party audits as a supply chain developing tool. Originality/value - The, findings of this study are worthy, as second party audits are identified as slow but effective tools in directing suppliers toward improvements.","[Djekic, Ilija] Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, Dept Food Safety & Qual Management, Belgrade, Serbia; [Dragojlovic, Sladjana; Miloradovic, Zoran; Miljkovic-Zivanovic, Snezana; Savic, Marija; Kekic, Vesna] Koncern Bambi Ad, Pozarevac, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Djekic, I (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, Dept Food Safety & Qual Management, Belgrade, Serbia.",idjekic@agrif.bg.ac.rs,"Đekić, Ilija/G-3649-2015","Đekić, Ilija/0000-0002-8132-8299",,,,,69,12,13,0,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The technique allows several proposed graphic designs for the same product to be compared, both with one another and with their immediate competitors up to a maximum of eight designs. Design/methodology/approach - The approach is based upon a fractionally replicated Latin square design with two sets of four package graphic designs and five consumer groups as the independent variables. The dependent variable is consumer choice. Findings - Three fully worked examples of the test are presented. The results show that graphic design has a massive and statistically significant impact on consumer choice, ceteris paribus. The test is able to discriminate strongly between package graphic designs that only apparently differ in detail. Research limitations/implications - The results show that graphic design has a significant impact upon consumer choice, but it also shows that this impact is highly product and situation specific. This may have considerable implications for any claimed wider empirical generalisations relating to the impact of graphic designs, or components thereof, on food consumer choice. Practical implications - The methodology presented allows graphic designs to be tested before they enter the marketplace. It replaces opinion with a reliable and quantifiable output that can be easily interfaced with econometric and market share models that have been developed within the choice modelling literature. Originality/value - This appears to be the first paper to appear within the literature that presents a reliable, simple and easily administered test that is capable of quantifying the performance of alternative graphic designs on food packaging.","[Hamlin, Robert P.] Univ Otago, Dept Mkt, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Hamlin, RP (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Mkt, Dunedin, New Zealand.",rob.hamlin@otago.ac.nz,,,New Zealand Honey Co.; Emerson's Brewing Co.,New Zealand Honey Co.; Emerson's Brewing Co.,"The author would like to acknowledge the financial support given by the New Zealand Honey Co. and the Emerson's Brewing Co. with regard to this research, and for their agreement to the release of these results to publication.",,43,12,12,4,42,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent of improvement in food safety knowledge and practices of food handlers in primary school canteens through food safety training. Design/methodology/approach - A list of 98 primary schools was randomized into intervention and control groups using a multistage sampling method. The training programme for the intervention group and questionnaires for evaluating knowledge and practices were developed. On-site observations were done to assess hygienic practices during the handling of raw food and cooking equipment. In total, 16 school canteens participated in this study. Findings - Knowledge about personal hygiene and related to rules for preparing safe food was significantly improved after the food safety intervention. Some of the improvement was sustained for up to 12 weeks after the intervention. The self-reported practice score of food safety and hygiene in the intervention group was significantly higher at post1 and post2 compared to baseline. A significant within-group and between-group improvement was demonstrated for the observed behaviour of raw food handling and equipment sanitation. Originality/value - The originality of this study is to provide a new framework for the design and implementation of food safety intervention in school canteens targeted towards a specific enabling factor for behavioural change. Provision of food safety training grounded by the theory of planned behaviour was associated with significantly improved food safety knowledge and behaviour amongst food handlers.","[Husain, Nik Rosmawati Nik; Muda, Wan Manan Wan; Jamil, Noor Izani Noor; Rahman, Razlina Abdul] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Med Sci, Kubang Kerian, Malaysia; [Hanafi, Nik Nurain Nik] Minist Hlth, Kelantan State Hlth Dept, Food Safety & Qual Div, Kelantan, Malaysia",Universiti Sains Malaysia; Kementerian Kesihatan Malaysia,"Husain, NRN (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Med Sci, Kubang Kerian, Malaysia.",rosmawati@usm.my,"Nik Husain, Nik Rosmawati/M-1588-2016; Rahman, Razlina Abdul/P-2575-2015; Wan Muda, Wan A Manan/H-5475-2016","Nik Husain, Nik Rosmawati/0000-0002-6798-0838; Rahman, Razlina Abdul/0000-0003-2593-1832; Wan Muda, Wan A Manan/0000-0003-4241-3869",,,,,34,40,53,4,32,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - This research surveyed 1,380 consumers in seven pilot cities that designated by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce for the construction of a meat and vegetable circulation traceability system. A choice-based conjoint analysis and multinomial logit model were used to study consumer preferences and demand for traceable pork attributes. Findings - The results demonstrated that certification of traceable information was the most important characteristic, followed by appearance and traceable information. Significant heterogeneity was obtained in consumer preferences for the attributes of traceable pork. Also, consumers' preferences for traceable attributes were memorably influenced by age, education level, and income level. Social implications - Based on these results, the government should encourage and support the production of traceable food with different certification types and different traceability levels. Meanwhile, the development of food traceability systems should be combined with a quality certification labeling system.

The model for identification of factors of variation in environmental tax revenues in percent of GDP was developed. The following factors influencing the variation have been identified by using the model: GDP per capita, energy saving, sulphur oxide emissions, municipality waste generated, renewable energy production, regulatory quality, environmental protection expenditure per capita. Assessment of influence of the activities in the EU countries has determined that in Lithuania, same in several other European countries, GDP per capita has the greatest influence on variation in environmental tax revenues. Considerable influence has also been demonstrated by the renewable energy production and SO2 emission. Regulatory quality, environmental protection expenditure and energy saving do not have any statistically significant influence.

Besides, the study was based on two categories that are considered major contributors in the chain of halal food sector in Malaysia which are the multinational, and small medium enterprise (SME). Design/methodology/approach - Two company's categories related to halal food and beverage industry which are the multinational, and SME were chosen in this research based on the similarities in terms of functions and needs in the implementation of halal in Malaysia. Furthermore, both categories are the main groups in the halal food sector that support the growth of other categories. The sample of the study was comprised of 241 companies from halal certification holders (MNCs = 69; SMEs = 172). Cross-sectional study through random sampling and purposive sampling was used where the internal halal committee who have been specifically appointed in the organization were asked to fill in the questionnaire. Personally hand-delivered questionnaires in workplaces was used as a method of data collection. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 21. Findings - Based on the analysis, it was found that the level of knowledge, halal quality assurance practices and commitment to be at a good level. Whereas the results of inference showed that there are significant differences for the three variables studied. Research limitations/implications - In the study there are some limitations, namely; first, the categories studied are focussed solely on halal food industry. Halal now been expanded to other products such as pharmaceutical, logistics, etc. Second, the standards used are the standard and guidelines on the handling of food. Finally, the limitations in obtaining more respondents as most industry in Malaysia is still concerned to provide feedback and view it as the secrecy of the company. Practical implications - First, the implication of the theory and literature studies in which the research prevalence is associated with the ISO quality and quality management, integration of multiple disciplines and concepts is essential as a combination of elements of human capital and strategic management. Second, on behalf of the government or specially-appointed halal certification body, it can give a clear picture of the exposure and promotion related to the deed, procedures, and guidelines have gone through several changes and amendments. In addition, it is also able to evaluate the effectiveness of a number of conditions that are required such as internal halal appointment committee. Third for industry practitioners, focussing in delivering halal standards is not dependent on the system, working patterns, and technologies alone, but should also take into account the element of human capital and organizational responsibility in maintaining halal integrity and enhancing the knowledge and halal dietary management in accordance with the requirements of Islamic law and fatwa. Social implications - On behalf of the users, the confidence is there and in order to produce a halal product, it involves a fairly strict chain and has always been regulated by a special committee whose role are meeting the needs outlined halal standards. Originality/value - The study is the starting point in discussing in detail about the halal knowledge, halal quality assurance, and commitment after the standardization and harmonization of halal certification in early 2012. Furthermore, there are a few revisions on the act, standards, and procedures by the halal certification body, which halal assurance should be implemented and considered still new.","[Othman, Baharudin] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Business Econ & Accountancy, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia; [Shaarani, Sharifudin Md] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Food Sci & Nutr, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia; [Bahron, Arsiah] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Business Econ & Accountancy, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",Universiti Malaysia Sabah; Universiti Malaysia Sabah; Universiti Malaysia Sabah,"Othman, B (通讯作者)，Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Business Econ & Accountancy, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia.",baharudinjakim@gmail.com,"Bahron, Arsiah/I-5917-2016",,,,,,56,16,18,2,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

One of the most popular modes of marketing communication - advertising, now has to find ways to be attention grabbing and persuading among the enormous amounts of advertisements. Therefore, creativity becomes crucially important. Using metaphors, which cause consumers to understand one or some elements of the advertisement in terms of another, is the possible technique to make an advertisement creative. Moreover, as visual elements of the advertisement are considered as more attention grabbing than the verbal ones, the assumption can be made that the usage of visual metaphors in advertising is the method leading into the effectiveness of advertising. Nevertheless, subtleties such as product category may have the impact on the consumers' associations with the brand developed through advertising with visual metaphors and perceived value of the product; and the question rises whether this impact is positive or negative. The aim of this research is to determine the impact of visual metaphors on the effectiveness of milk advertising. The analysis of the research results reveals the specific aspects of consumer response to milk advertising, which are influenced by the application of visual metaphors and whether that aspects of consumer response to milk advertising are influenced positively or negatively. As a research result, authors provide guidelines for creating effective milk advertising campaigns.","[Pileliene, Lina; Grigaliunaite, Viktorija] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Pileliene, L (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania.",l.pileliene@evf.vdu.lt,"Pileliene, Lina/B-3293-2014; Grigaliūnaitė, Viktorija/GXG-1429-2022; Pileliene, Lina/AAP-2315-2020","Pileliene, Lina/0000-0003-2704-8314; Grigaliūnaitė, Viktorija/0000-0001-8340-2993; Pileliene, Lina/0000-0003-2704-8314",,,,,11,0,0,0,8,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-225-5,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2016,43.0,,,,,,175,180,,,,,,6,Economics; Environmental Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration,BG7FN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253200021,0

The Western Honduras sugar market was studied, from the supply and demand side, in order to particularly understand consumer preference which is considered a key to increase smallholder farmers' income in rural areas. Design/methodology/approach - The research included a qualitative study by means of six visits for observation and data compilation to stores, four face-to-face open semi-structured interviews with store owners and a focus group with local producers to acquire a global picture of the main regional sugar market characteristics from the supply side. Moreover a quantitative analysis applying a Choice Experiment to study consumer preferences was performed acquiring higher knowledge from the demand side. Findings - First, it was found that Honduras sugar market could be experiencing monopolistic practices and white sugar to 9 lempiras per pound was the most popular product according to the qualitative study. Second, for consumers who knew dulce de panela, granulated brown sugar was preferred over refined white sugar. Consumers who had a high level of education, came from rural areas, considered brown sugar to be healthier and read nutritional information were more prone to consume granulated brown sugar. On the other hand, the estimated selling price was around 16 lempiras/pound, but consumers were willing to pay at the most 11.59 lempiras/pound. Nevertheless, market share simulation showed a market niche to comercialize granulated brown sugar - panela. Originality/value - This research is of academics, farmers and policy makers value. There are no studies analyzing consumer behavior regarding granulated brown sugar in Honduras. The results provide information about the previous steps which need to be given for smallholders in order to commercialize this novelty product; and it stressed the necessity of highlighting health claims on panela which would involve political actions.","[Rodriguez-Entrena, Macario] Inst Agr Res & Training IFAPA, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Studies, Cordoba, Spain; [Salazar-Ordonez, Melania] Univ Loyola Andalucia, Dept Econ, Cordoba, Spain; [Cordon-Pedregosa, Rosa; Cardenas, Jose L.] Univ Loyola Andalucia, ETEA Fdn, Cordoba, Spain",Universidad Loyola Andalucia; Universidad Loyola Andalucia,"Salazar-Ordóñez, M (通讯作者)，Univ Loyola Andalucia, Dept Econ, Cordoba, Spain.",msalazar@uloyola.es,"Rodriguez-Entrena, Macario/C-4959-2017; Salazar-Ordóñez, Melania/A-4715-2015","Rodriguez-Entrena, Macario/0000-0002-9339-439X; Salazar-Ordóñez, Melania/0000-0003-3349-8215",ETEA-Foundation for Development and Cooperation; AECID - Spanish Agency for Development Cooperation - through a cooperation project Promoting associativity of producers and the participation of organizes groups to ensure processes of food security in the department of Ocotepeque; IFAPA - Andalusian Institute of Agricultural Research and Training; European Social Fund (FSE) within the Operative Program of Andalusia,ETEA-Foundation for Development and Cooperation; AECID - Spanish Agency for Development Cooperation - through a cooperation project Promoting associativity of producers and the participation of organizes groups to ensure processes of food security in the department of Ocotepeque; IFAPA - Andalusian Institute of Agricultural Research and Training; European Social Fund (FSE) within the Operative Program of Andalusia,"The authors would like to thank two anonymous referees and the editor-in-chief for their comments which have contributed to a much improved manuscript, any remaining errors are however the sole responsibility of the authors.

Design/methodology/approach - In store face-to-face survey results from 402 wine consumers were elaborated with two-step cluster analysis. ANOVA confirmed differences among groups. Groups were profiled by a chi(2) significance analysis when adequate. A multivariate binary logistic regression estimated wine consumption influence on healthiness perceptions. Findings - Consumers converge into four groups: two health-oriented - optimistic and medical; two non-health-oriented - unintentional drinker and unconvinced. Groups are not significantly differentiated in socio-economic terms. Wine consumption behaviour influences health orientation, specifically for monthly and wine drinkers, vs weekly and other alcohol drinkers. Health-oriented consumers favourably welcome and are willing to pay more for health-enhancing wine. Consumers believe that wine consumption mainly benefits atherosclerosis and hypertension. Research limitations/implications - Since health-oriented wine is not common in the market, consumers provided answers based on their experience with other health-oriented food and beverages and on the common appreciation of the terroir perspective. Future research could extend the analysis on health claims and nutrition claims through blind wine tasting, price range acceptability and market potential dimensions. Practical implications - The high number of wine SKUs and consumer interest in wine healthiness suggest wine manufacturers should invest in health-oriented differentiation strategies, focused on atherosclerosis and hypertension claims and higher prices. Social implications - Given worldwide wine consumption, the research findings contribute to public health policy by addressing alcoholism and promoting healthy consumption behaviour. Originality/value - The findings provide insights for private and public sectors to support innovative approaches for the development of health-promoting food system.","[Samoggia, Antonella] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Sci, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Samoggia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Agr Sci, Bologna, Italy.",antonella.samoggia@unibo.it,"Samoggia, Antonella/AAU-1052-2020","Samoggia, Antonella/0000-0003-3930-6173",,,,,27,25,26,5,50,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Furthermore, as the recent literature suggests, values held by policy actors are centrally located in the debates linking adaptation to development. However, different values tend to give way to diverging adaptation policy preferences, which often appear as a dichotomy of adjustment (incremental change) versus transformation. This study enquires the assumptions and values in adaptation policy by using Q-methodology and advances value-based approach to adaptation policy with an empirical case from Turkey, a developing country with key vulnerabilities in its agricultural system. By exploring the narratives of 29 policy actors who participated in the making of Turkey's climate change adaptation strategy, the analysis suggests that assumptions regarding an economic growth-driven development agenda often shape adaptation concerns. Further analysis of the 4 emerging discourses (productivism, techno-managerialism, eco-localism, and authoritarianism) suggests that while discourses agree that the ultimate goal of adaptation is safeguarding a developmentalist vision in agriculture, they differ on the means and agents for reaching this goal. I argue that this divergence can enhance the transformative potential of adaptation by bringing how, for whom, and why questions back to policymaking. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The production of thermal and electric energy combined allows them to reach as much as 87% efficiency in processing the energy contained in biogas. The aim of this article is to determine the position of energy obtained from agricultural biogas in sustainable power industry. From the conducted analysis of the subject literature and reports concerning the acquisition of energy from agricultural biogas, it follows that in Poland, energy obtained from agricultural biogas makes up a tiny per cent of the whole sustainable power industry.

It combines Georgescu-Roegen's discussion of an economy's capacity to produce economic processes with Ostrom's concept of institutional performance, in order to address the implications and functioning of SSCB within a small-farmer economy. The local collective action situation of maintaining and making use of a SSCB system - a specific finance model - provides the studied community with access to a pooled capital fund that may play an important role in ensuring its capacity to produce and reproduce economic processes, according to its own specifications. The coordinated action among the villagers, which matches up well with Ostrom's criteria for effective institutional performance of common pool resource use governance, is found to include social and environmental dimensions, which we understand to be necessary for achieving transformations toward more sustainable economic activity. While we do not wish to suggest that the adoption of SSCB guarantees either improved ecological or social impacts, our results suggest that this finance model could play a supporting role in enhancing the potential of small-farming communities to improve both, should they wish to do so.

The objective of this paper is twofold:(1) to identify the macroeconomic determinants of ending deforestation; and (2) to explain cumulative deforestation and other land uses. To do this, we first study the probability of a turning point for deforestation (i.e., the switch from decreasing to expanding forest areas), based on the Forest Transition hypothesis. Second, we adapt a land-use model to explain the trade-off between forest and agriculture during development. To take the link between both phenomena into account, we estimate a dynamic panel seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model along with a switching regression model, applied to a dataset of 57 developing countries observed over four time periods. The estimation results reveal that economic development and institutions play a significant role in long-term deforestation. Our results also suggest that after the first development stage, agriculture and forest are not always competing land uses. These results provide new insights into public policies such as REDD+.

Because regulation of nutrients can be expensive, the Utah Division of Water Quality (DWQ) wanted an estimate of the benefits of nutrient reduction. Natural scientists provided social scientists with detailed current and future water quality outcomes under proposed nutrient management alternatives. Current and future water quality outcomes were used to develop a mail contingent valuation survey. Results show that Utah households who recreate on Utah's waters (Users) are willing to pay up to $13.63 monthly to prevent deterioration of water quality whereas nonusers are willing to pay up to $8.31 per month. Furthermore, Users are willing to pay up to $32 per month to improve water quality in areas that have already been or are expected to be degraded by excess nutrients.

It draws upon three strands of research: security, peacebuilding and transboundary water management. The article examines three core questions: (1) how is desecuritisation conceptualised and understood in theory as well as within the context of water development; (2) in what ways are water conflict addressed within the liberal peacebuilding paradigm; and (3) what are the roles and implications of technocracy in resolving conflict and building peace? The article conducts a conceptual scoping, which critically probes what desecuritisation and peacebuilding do politically in the water sector. It draws empirical illustrations from the Israeli-Palestinian water conflict where water is securitised while major peacebuilding efforts have been made to desecuritise the conflict. It concludes that technical blueprints may run the risk of depoliticising conflict dynamics, which contradicts the normative assumption about desecuritisation as a return to normal politics. Moreover, the technocratic turn in peacebuilding practices have empowered certain actors, who act as the new peacemakers while others are marginalised.","Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Aggestam, K (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Box 52, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",karin.aggestam@svet.lu.se,,"Aggestam, Karin/0000-0001-7209-6687",Middle East in the Contemporary World (MECW) programme of the Centre for Middle East Studies at Lund University; Swedish Research Council,Middle East in the Contemporary World (MECW) programme of the Centre for Middle East Studies at Lund University; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),The author is grateful to the two anonymous referees for constructive and helpful comments.

The demand for flood insurance on an extensive margin, based on take-up rates, is found to be relatively price inelastic. Aligned with the behavioral economics literature, recent flood events temporarily increase purchases, but this effect fades after 3 years. We also find that the proportion of developed area in floodplains has a significant positive impact on insurance take-up rates. Contrary to what is often assumed, we do not find evidence that insurance purchase and mitigation efforts are substitutes. Educated individuals, individuals over the age of 45, and African-Americans are, all else equal, more likely to purchase flood insurance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Many believe this pre-industrial stagnation was the result of political and cultural constraints, such as those on the operation of markets. Indeed medieval English law outlawed many arbitrage activities in markets. The paper shows using information of grain yields and prices at 227 different locations that the most important of all markets, that for grain, was nevertheless both extensive and relatively efficient as early as 1209. Whatever the rhetoric of medieval law and social thought the real effect of constraints on the operation the grain market seems to have been minimal. England had an elaborate market economy at least 500 years before it had sustained economic growth.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Clark, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",gclark@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,35,16,18,1,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,SEP,2015,9.0,3,,,,,265,287,,10.1007/s11698-014-0117-7,0.0,,,23,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,CP7AI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360039200001,0

It explains why agricultural labour productivity differences did not converge between 1950 and 2005 in Europe. We propose an econometric model, one combining both proximate and fundamental causes of economic growth. The results show that the continuous exit of labour power from the sector, coupled with the increased use of productive factors originating in other sectors of the economy, caused the efficiency of agricultural workers to rise. However, we offer a complete explanation of the role played by institutions and geographical factors. Thus, we detect a direct and inverse relation between membership of the EU and the Communist bloc and the productivity of agricultural labour. In addition, strong support for agriculture affected productivity negatively.","[Martin-Retortillo, Miguel; Pinilla, Vicente] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business Studies, Dept Appl Econ & Econ Hist, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Pinilla, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business Studies, Dept Appl Econ & Econ Hist, Gran Via 4, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",miguelmr@unizar.es; vpinilla@unizar.es,"Pinilla, Vicente/H-4331-2015","Pinilla, Vicente/0000-0003-2256-8898; Martin-Retortillo, Miguel/0000-0003-3431-0691",Ministry of Science and Innovation of Spain [ECO 2012-33286]; Ministry of Education's FPU Programme; Government of Aragon; European Social Fund,Ministry of Science and Innovation of Spain(Spanish Government); Ministry of Education's FPU Programme; Government of Aragon(Gobierno de Aragon); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),"This study has received financial support from the Ministry of Science and Innovation of Spain, project ECO 2012-33286 and the Ministry of Education's FPU Programme, and from the Government of Aragon and the European Social Fund, through the Research Group Agrifood Economic History (nineteenth and twentieth centuries)''.

While the different perspectives on PES provide valuable insights, each emphasizes different variables complicating comparisons across studies and contexts. We suggest that a more integrative conceptualization of PES-through synthesis with the SES framework-is necessary to take into account the broader social and ecological landscapes in which PES initiatives are embedded. The SES framework can provide insight into the multitude of factors that influence PES and facilitate the integration of knowledge from diverse disciplinary perspectives by providing a common language and consistency in the variables considered in analyses. This article also presents an initial effort in the development a taxonomy of key variables relevant to analyzing and understanding PES. With ongoing application of the SES framework, we expect the list of key variables to grow and be modified. We feel the SES framework will help scholars move beyond academic debates and towards a shared understanding of the potential and limitations of PES as a policy mechanism for addressing complex ecosystem service management problems in diverse SESs.

The aim is to establish cost-effective measures to attain good ecological status and assess whether the costs of these measures are justifiable in view of the benefits they provide. The complex nature of water problems requires flexible decision-making embracing a diversity of 'knowledges'. Here, natural and social scientist worked together in an integrated approach 'ground-tested' through local stakeholders' knowledge and views. The aims were to: (1) develop a set of steps for implementing this transdisciplinary approach, and (2) critically reflect on the challenges of integrating different strands of knowledge to the specific context of the economics of the WFD. This was tested at a sub-catchment in Scotland. Hydro-chemical models were used to simulate effectiveness of phosphorous pollution mitigation measures, which was then incorporated into a cost-optimization model. Costs were compared with benefits resulting from water quality improvements. This analysis was accompanied by an iterative local stakeholder consultation process. The research further analysed whether selected measures are 'future-proof' in view of climate and land-use changes. Results are used to help set the research agenda for more practical specification of economically sound and socially acceptable ways to deliver the WFD. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Most often, they have been promoted as tools to foster sustainable development albeit they differ in terms of specific objectives. While many case studies have tried to assess the actual impact of these systems, there has been no global analysis summarizing their global impact. This paper aims to fill the gap by exploring whether complementary currencies contribute to the three pillars of sustainable development. We use the systematic review methodology on an original dataset gathering most academic publications on the topic in English, French and Spanish. Our main findings suggest that community currencies mostly contribute to social sustainability, and that their economic benefits are somewhat limited due to their small scale and the lack of awareness on their scope. Moreover, very few studies explicitly identify environmental outcomes. Finally, this review reveals some limits regarding current methods for impact assessment in this field. Therefore it encourages more standardization to provide greater accuracy and strengthen the legitimacy of community currencies in order to foster their continued development. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the Philippines, many smallholder farmers have expressed their intent to participate in intensive production of biofuel crops and oil palm with state and private organizations; others have resisted or remained indifferent. This study looks into smallholders' social construction of the environment and how this may influence their decisions to participate in such production contracts. The study is based on a survey of 462 respondents in eight communities in the province of Palawan. Using regression analysis, it illustrates how smallholders' sense of place and environmental worldviews, together with demographic and socio-economic variables, play significant roles in their decisions to enter into new biofuels (jatropha) and oil palm production contracts. Environmental worldviews are significant when there are strong negative perceptions attached to a particular crop production contract, as in the case of oil palm. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using the reported ages of criminals in the Court of Justice records in the Cape Archives, this article documents for the first time numeracy levels and trends for inhabitants of the Cape Colony born between the late seventeenth and early nineteenth century: the native Khoesan, European settlers, and imported slaves from other African regions and Asia. This variety of origins allows us to compare contemporaneous levels of early modern development across three continents. By isolating those slaves born at the Cape, we also provide a glimpse into the dynamics of human capital transfer in a colonial setting. The Colony's relatively high level of human capital overall had implications for what was later to be the richest country on African soil, but the very unequal attainment of numeracy also foreshadowed extreme income inequality.","[Baten, Joerg] Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany; [Baten, Joerg] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Baten, Joerg] CEPR, London, England; [Fourie, Johan] Univ Stellenbosch, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Ifo Institut; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Stellenbosch University,"Baten, J (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.",,,", Joerg/0000-0001-5029-501X; Fourie, Johan/0000-0002-7341-017X",,,,,62,12,13,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Ecosystem accounting monitors ecosystem services and measures their monetary value using exchange values consistent with the System of National Accounts (SNA). We pilot monetary ecosystem accounting in a case study in Limburg province, the Netherlands. Seven ecosystem services are modelled and valued: crop production, fodder production, drinking water production, air quality regulation, carbon sequestration, nature tourism and hunting. We develop monetary ecosystem accounts that specify values generated by ecosystem services per hectare, per municipality and per land cover type. We analyse the relative importance of public and private ecosystem services. We found that the SNA-aligned monetary value of modelled ecosystem services for Limburg was around 112 million in 2010, with an average value of 508 per hectare. Ecosystem services with the highest values were crop production, nature tourism and fodder production. Due to the exclusion of consumer surplus in SNA valuation, calculated values are considerably lower than those typically found in welfare-based valuation approaches. We demonstrate the feasibility of valuing ecosystem services in a national accounting framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Associative entrepreneurship has been promoted as a way of accessing alternative techniques to address this concern. By associative entrepreneurship, in this paper we mean the creation of local associations between small-scale gold miners in order to acquire more environmentally-friendly technologies. We built a behavioral simulation model to assess the feasibility of associative entrepreneurship in the context of the public-good dilemma that gold mining communities face. The model construction is based on results from field economic experiments, and properly replicates the observed behavioral patterns; thus, it reveals that sustained collective action is possible when miners completely understand the social dilemma they face, but that self-organization is not possible. Features such as reciprocity and temptation to free ride partially explain why self-organization fails. In such a case, external intervention has a key role in promoting programs that improve the understanding of the social dilemma faced by artisanal and small-scale gold miners. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Once set up-at different times in different market-sinstitutions of monopoly brokerage sparked substantial and abrupt growth in state revenues.

This being the case, the adoption of adequate anti-sprawl policies should lead to a reduction in city blight. Availability of detailed blight measures at the city level enables us to undertake a novel empirical analysis to test this hypothesis. The empirical specification presented here identifies the specific impact of more stringent anti-sprawl policies adopted at the metro level, proxied by the adoption of urban containment policies, on city blight. Results indicate that the adoption of such policies has effectively contributed to the reduction of downtown deterioration.","Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Publ Finance & Tax Syst, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Hortas-Rico, M (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Publ Finance & Tax Syst, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",miriamhortas@ccee.ucm.es,"Rico, Miriam Hortas/AAU-3013-2021","Hortas Rico, Miriam/0000-0001-8112-3325",,,,,69,20,24,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

These plants were subsequently sold to consumers along the east coast of the Island, along with Little Fire Ant colonies living in the potting medium. LFA is now thriving and continues to spread. Fifteen years after the initial detection in 1999, LFA has spread to over 4000 locations on the island of Hawaii and has been found in isolated locations on Kauai, Maui, and Oahu Islands. Current efforts are expected to contain the infestations on the other islands but significant additional investment is needed to halt the rapid spread of LFA on the island of Hawaii. Increased management expenditures can suppress infestations; reduce spread between sectors; and decrease long-term management costs, damages, and stings. An immediate expenditure of $8 million in the next 2-3 years plus follow-up prevention, monitoring, and mitigation treatments will yield $1.210-billion in reduced control costs, $129 million in lowered economic damages, 315 million fewer human sting incidents, and 102 million less pet sting incidents over 10 years. Over 35 years, the benefits include $5.496 billion in reduced control costs, $538 million less economic damages, 2.161 billion fewer human sting incidents, and 762 million fewer pet sting incidents.

Creating the conditions for an inflow of FDI started in 2000 in Serbia primarily to increase the employment rate. Since 2000 most FDI has entered the sector of non-exchangeable goods which led towards increasing unemployment. That has had negative effects on Serbia from the development viewpoint, since the country needs FDI to the sector of exchangeable goods, as they encourage productivity, technological progress and employment. Foreign investors to Serbia were primarily interested in profiting from the privatization (Brownfield investments) of former state-owned companies which led to the rationalization of the privatized companies through redundancies. The benefits that Serbia has had from the inflow of FDI are significant transfer of technology, enhancement of competition on the local market. On the other hand, the negative effects are increase in the unemployment rate at the national level.","[Aleksandar, Stankovic; Strahinja, Kulic] Megatrend Univ, Belgrade, Serbia; [Primorac, Dinko] Univ North, Koprivnica, Croatia",University North - Croatia,"Aleksandar, S (通讯作者)，Megatrend Univ, Belgrade, Serbia.",aleksandarstankovic@yahoo.com; strahinja.kulic@yahoo.com; dinko.primorac@unin.hr,"Primorac, Dinko/AFQ-8288-2022; Primorac, Dinko/IVH-5297-2023",,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2015,,,,,,,261,269,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450589500028,0

Design/methodology/approach - This was a cross-sectional, descriptive pilot study in a Brazilian buffet-style restaurant. The study group was selected by systematic sampling and consisted of 678 individuals aged 16-81 years, who were regular diners at a selected restaurant during lunchtime. Photographs were used to assess food choices and a sociodemographic questionnaire was administered to the subjects. A healthy dietary diversity model was created following WHO recommendations and the Brazilian Food Guide. A consensus workshop was conducted with experts to discuss and classify certain dishes as more or less healthy (high/low energy density). The model attributed negative (-3.0-0.0) and positive (0.0-12.0) scores to different food groups. Higher scores meant greater diversity on the plate, and therefore a greater chance of a healthy meal (=9.0), while a lower score reflected a higher variety of energy-dense foods, such as fried dishes (=6.0). Findings - Most diner's plates (65.3 per cent) obtained low diversity score indexes (=6) and were considered inadequate, represented the dishes where intake should be controlled from a nutritional viewpoint (over caloric meal).

An exploration of African agrifood chains,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Africa; Innovation; Value chain,GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS; SYSTEMS-APPROACH; SOUTH-AFRICA; ETHIOPIA; PARTNERSHIPS; INSIGHTS; CREATION; FARMERS; QUALITY,"Purpose - Building on recent advances in innovation research on developing country agriculture, this paper explores the concept of co-innovation, i.e. innovations that combine technological, organisational and institutional changes and that encompass different actors in and around the value chain. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a further conceptualisation of co-innovation and show its usefulness for analysing innovation initiatives in agrifood chains. Design/methodology/approach - The paper combines two streams of literature (innovation systems and value chains) and is based on a review of the experiences with innovation in three different value chains in three African countries: potato in Ethiopia, pineapple in Benin and citrus in South Africa. Findings - Co-innovation is the combination of collaborative, complementary and coordinated innovation. Collaborative refers to the multi-actor character of the innovation process, where each actor brings in specific knowledge and resources. Complementary indicates the smart combination of technological, organisational and institutional innovation. Coordinated draws attention to the importance of chain-wide adjustments and changes to make innovation in one stage of the chain a success. Practical implications - The identified dimensions of co-innovation (the triple co-) provide a practical guide for the design of effective interventions aimed at promoting innovation in African agrifood chains. Originality/value - The paper is the first to provide a comprehensive conceptualisation of co-innovation. On the basis of both theoretical arguments and evidence from three illustrative case studies it is argued that successful innovation in agrifood chains requires the innovation process to be collaborative, coordinated and complementary.","[Bitzer, Verena] Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Bijman, Jos] Wageningen Univ, Management Studies Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Cape Town; Wageningen University & Research,"Bitzer, V (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",v.bitzer@gmail.com,"Bijman, Jos/C-2929-2015","Bijman, Jos/0000-0001-9143-7870",Interdisciplinary Research and Education Fund (INREF) of Wageningen University,Interdisciplinary Research and Education Fund (INREF) of Wageningen University,The authors would like to acknowledge the Interdisciplinary Research and Education Fund (INREF) of Wageningen University for its financial support through the Co-Innovation for Quality in African Food Chains (CoQA) programme.,,51,37,40,0,43,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

We describe how the system evolved and we analyze how it functioned by studying the clearing of notes among banks. Since by law banknotes had to be redeemed at par, we focus on the ability of banks to keep notes in circulation before redemption. We estimate adverse clearings of notes issued by the dominant bank [Banca Nazionale degli Stati Sardi (BNS)] in the provinces where this bank had branches and we find that the entry of a smaller issuer limited the BNS's capacity to keep its notes in circulation at the local level. We take this as evidence that competition in note issuance worked as an effective discipline device. Our results are consistent with the analysis of Pareto (Journal des ,conomistes 3-28, 1893) who maintained that the fall of the Italian system was not due to the failure of the competitive mechanism, but rather to the altering of the rules of the game by the government.","[Gianfreda, Giuseppina] Univ Tuscia, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Mattesini, Fabrizio] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, I-00133 Rome, Italy",Tuscia University; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Gianfreda, G (通讯作者)，Univ Tuscia, Via San Carlo 32, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy.",ggianfreda@unitus.it,,,,,,,18,4,4,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2015,9.0,1,,,,,1,25,,10.1007/s11698-014-0106-x,0.0,,,25,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,AX8GI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000347147700001,0

Economic literature highlights the essential role played by pension schemes in assuring a proper level of income after retirement, thus reducing poverty and increasing productivity, with significant positive implications upon overall economic activity. Our research is based on developing several double-log fixed and random effects models, as well as a dynamic and distributed lags model, using a panel structure over the 2005-2013 period and a complex set of indicators (national accounts - GDP total and per capita; labour market - employment, unemployment, productivity, earnings; secondary and tertiary education; pension specific data - general beneficiaries, old age and survivor pensioners, total and by gender, and pension expenses as percentage of GDP). The results show that pensions represent an incentive for employees leading to an increase in resource productivity. At the same time, old age pensions are positively shaping economic growth and employment for the two countries considered, significantly reducing the poverty rate for pensioners. Nevertheless, the two pensions systems are modelled by the economic activity, educational background of employees, as well as by the level of net earnings.","[Margareta, Caran; Georgiana, Noja Gratiela] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania",West University of Timisoara,"Margareta, C (通讯作者)，West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania.",margareta.maggie@yahoo.com; gratiela.noja@e-uvt.ro,"Noja, Gratiela/X-2471-2019","Noja, Gratiela/0000-0002-9201-3057",,,,,9,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2015,,,,,,,168,181,,,,,,14,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450589500019,0

Design/methodology/approach - Based on existing theoretical variety-seeking models analysing household panel data, the further expansion of the variety- seeking model Switch of Brands (SB) is presented. In the last contribution in the British Food Journal the authors presented this simple but powerful tool to approximate VSB. The further developed model Switch of Brands -Promotions (SBPR) integrates relevant variables into one theoretical variety- seeking model (number of purchased brands, number of purchases, price promotions, etc.). In particular, price promotions were integrated into the SB model in order to deliver even more realistic approximations of households' VSB. Findings - The explanatory power of the model in view of brand loyalty is tested. The empirical analysis is conducted with scanner household panel data from Austria in three different product categories. Research limitations/implications - The data analysis shows that the model has an excellent explanatory power concerning brand loyalty, however, not better than the original SB model. Practical implications - The SBPR model allows interpretations for marketing purposes and brand management including marketing variables (here: price promotions). The model may be applied in any business field where panel data are available. Originality/value - The model delivers a consistent theoretical framework for approximating VSB by means of purchase histories.","[Meixner, Oliver; Knoll, Viktoria] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Meixner, O (通讯作者)，Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Vienna, Austria.",oliver.meixner@boku.ac.at,"Meixner, Oliver/AAD-6219-2021","Meixner, Oliver/0000-0002-8505-3130",ONB Jubilaumsfonds,ONB Jubilaumsfonds,"The authors would like to thank the Austrian National Bank, which promoted this study with funds from the ONB Jubilaumsfonds.",,43,2,2,2,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Energy consumption of pre-packed salads,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Supply chain; Energy management; Retailing; Refrigeration; Food manufacturing processes; Food packaging,SHELF-LIFE; CONSUMER PERCEPTION; QUALITY; TEMPERATURE; VEGETABLES; SYSTEMS; IMPACT,"Purpose - Packed salads are popular in many countries of the world. The purpose of this paper is to assess the energy footprint of these products from farm gate to retail gate, compared with unpacked produces distributed by retailers and farmers' markets in Italy. Design/methodology/approach - Life cycle assessment served as methodological background, even if the analysis was focused on direct and indirect energy consumption. Three supply chains were analysed: packed (P-S) and unpacked (U-S) sold in supermarkets, and unpacked produce sold locally (U-L). Energy inputs were accounted for processing, packaging, refrigeration, transport, and distribution. Data were collected from available literature and from interviews with key experts in the transformation, packaging, and retail sectors. Energy inputs were computed for 1 kg of finished edible product (kg(p)). Findings - Packed salads require an elevated energy input ranging from 16 to 37 MJ kg(p)(-1). Input energy is mostly required for packaging and refrigeration. By comparison, the U-L chain requires about one tenth of the energy (1.8-2.6 MJ.kg(p)(-1)), but local sold produces attain the best performance with only 0.6-1.2 MJ.kg(p)(-1), since they do not need processing, refrigeration, and disposable packages. Packed products mainly rely on the availability of cheap fossil fuels and all the sector has significantly suffered after the oil shock of 2008. Increasing energy costs may lead the price of the commodity out of the market. Originality/value - The paper addresses the subject of energy consumption in a popular sector of processed food to which at present little attention has been paid in the domain of food research.","[Pagani, Marco; Vittuari, Matteo; Falasconi, Luca] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Pagani, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, Bologna, Italy.",markpagani@gmail.com,"Vittuari, Matteo/P-5274-2014","Vittuari, Matteo/0000-0003-4327-1575; Pagani, Marco/0000-0002-8187-4409",,,,,53,11,11,0,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Baumgartner and Quaas (2010a, b) have proposed as an alternative to ecological economics the new field of sustainability economics, which has triggered various replies. The purpose here is to order and to review these contributions. Building upon a literature review of sustainability economics, the paper argues that the concept currently has more of a fuzzy and declamatory character. The rhetoric (McCloskey, 1998) of sustainability economics contains general issues of sustainability economics, externalities and the capability approach. The article argues that it is currently not clear how the solutions for science and policy proposed by sustainability economics differ from those of ecological economics. Efforts should be directed towards further development of the theory and the operationalization of sustainability principles. The systemic view of co-evolutionary development, social learning and sustainability economics' normative underpinning merits more consideration in the debate about sustainability economics.

Design/methodology/approach - The panel of assessors determined the key sensory attributes. Subsequently, affective sensory consumer testing was conducted. The samples of potato snacks with labels suggesting valid and false shelf life or without dating information were presented to 110 students. They rated the degree of colour intensity, oxidised flavour and crispness liking with the use of hedonic scale and accepted or rejected the sample. The testing was carried out in a sensory laboratory. Findings - Shelf-life labelling affects the overall acceptability of potato snacks, perception of crispness and oxidative flavour. These attributes were rated less favourably when the label suggested post-expiration. The influence of shelf-life labelling decreased with storage time period. Consumers are more willing to trust their own perception than labelling. Practical implications - The product may be rejected not only because of quality depletion when the shelf life is overestimated, but also as a result of denigration when the shelf life is underestimated. Social implications - Date legislation is necessary but it may be not sufficient without consumer education on food labelling and safety. Originality/value - Research on the influence of shelf-life labelling on the sensory acceptability of food is scarce. Understanding how consumers are affected by shelf-life information has important implications for both public policy as well as food manufacturers.","Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Food Commod Sci, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Samotyja, U (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Food Commod Sci, Poznan, Poland.",u.samotyja@ue.poznan.pl,"Samotyja, Urszula/IVV-1763-2023","Samotyja, Urszula/0000-0001-7388-0852",,,,,42,12,12,4,46,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However, the link between infrastructure investment and economic performance remains unclear. This may be a consequence of overlooking the role of government institutions. This paper assesses the connection between regional quality of government and the returns of different types of road infrastructure in the regions of the European Union. The results unveil the influence of regional quality of government on the economic returns of transport infrastructure. In weak institutional contexts, investment in motorways-the preferred option by governments-yields significantly lower returns than the more humble secondary road. Government institutions also affect the returns of transport maintenance investment.","[Crescenzi, Riccardo; Di Cataldo, Marco; Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Crescenzi, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",r.crescenzi@lse.ac.uk; m.di-cataldo@lse.ac.uk; a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Di Cataldo, Marco/AAK-8373-2020; Crescenzi, Riccardo/F-9165-2014; Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856; Di Cataldo, Marco/0000-0002-2808-1776","European Research Council under the European Union [269868]; European Union [H2020/2014-2020, 639633-MASSIVE-ERC-2014-STG]",European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Union(European Union (EU)),"This is the revised version of the third annual Journal of Regional Science special session paper.

This article shows that the opposition does not work well as a framework for economic history. The differences between the two states lay elsewhere than in the drive to exploit Indian resources by a foreign power. The difference was that British colonial policy was framed with reference to global market integration, whereas post-colonial policy was framed with reference to nationalism. The article applies this lesson to reread the economic effects of the two types of state, and reflects on ongoing debates in the global history of European expansion.","[Roy, Tirthankar] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ Hist, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Roy, T (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ Hist, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",t.roy@lse.ac.uk,,"Roy, Tirthankar/0000-0002-4183-2781",,,,,45,4,4,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

It has been suggested that landscape-scale management (LSM) of habitat in a multi-farm setting results in higher provisioning of such ES compared to farm-scale management (FSM). However, to achieve the LSM solution, farmers' land-use decisions need to be coordinated. To this end, we develop rules based on novel landscape composition and configuration indices. We model farmers' interdependencies through ES in an agent-based model (ABM) and optimize land use at both the farm and landscape scales for comparison. Our analysis is based on a simple artificial landscape with homogeneous soil quality and uses crop pollination as an illustrative ecosystem service. We consider habitat configuration at the field scale. Our rules demonstrate that the coordinated solution is characterized by a higher degree of habitat availability and a configuration of habitat that is dispersed rather than agglomerated. We tested these rules over a range of assumptions about ecological parameter values and suggest that such rules could be used to improve governance of ES in agricultural landscapes.

Credits for reduced carbon emissions can potentially subsidize fuel-efficient cookstoves that reduce these harmful effects. Understanding the accuracy of different methods of monitoring stove usage is useful to measure the effects of cookstove programs and to target carbon credits. This paper compares four methods of measuring stove usage: hours cooked (derived from a predictive logistic regression of stove usage monitors and observations of stoves in use); number of people cooked for reported in household food diaries; fuel weight used gathered in a kitchen performance test; and household air pollution using mean 24-hour concentrations of particulate matter collected with particulate air monitors. We find statistically significant positive correlations between five out of six of these pairs of measures. While the correlations are positive, the explanatory power of each measure for another is weak. The weak correlations emphasize the importance of using multiple measures to track changes in stove use for both researchers and carbon auditors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Descriptions of cloth from a sample of over 1,000 wedding trousseaus reveal that common people were quite familiar with a wide selection of fabrics from manufacturing centres such as Bruges, Saint-Omer, Arras, and Chalons, and by the end of the thirteenth century Saint-Denis, Paris, Ypres, and Narbonne. Northern cloth had travelled over 1,000kilometres before it reached the market stalls of Vic, reflecting the efficiency of commercial networks in bringing commodities across Europe at a reasonable transportation cost. Marriage contracts from this period specify the identity of the most frequent purchasers of these fabrics, and the identity of the women that would wear them, tailored as capes or tunics. Northern cloth was purchased by all social groups, not just the wealthy elite: even peasant households used such fabrics for their daughters' dresses. All in all, wedding trousseaus provide exceptional evidence of how commercialized both the urban and rural populations had become by the end of the thirteenth century in a society eager to buy imported commodities.","[Figueras, Lluis To] Univ Girona, Girona, Spain",Universitat de Girona,"Figueras, LT (通讯作者)，Univ Girona, Girona, Spain.",,,,,,,,79,3,3,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

A new annual database of New England banks shows that mutual savings banks had a significant presence in the postbellum banking system. Mutual savings banks accounted for about 75 % of the region's total bank deposits and largely avoided financial panics. The banks seemed to have complemented rather than competed with national banks. Mutual savings bank growth was correlated with agriculture and urbanization, whereas national bank growth was correlated with manufacturing. Mutual savings banks also channeled significant funds to national banks through the interbank network.","[Jaremski, Matthew; Plastaras, Brady] Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, 13 Oak Dr, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA; [Jaremski, Matthew] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Colgate University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Jaremski, M (通讯作者)，Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, 13 Oak Dr, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.;Jaremski, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mjaremski@colgate.edu,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,MAY,2016,10.0,2,,,,,151,179,,10.1007/s11698-015-0127-0,0.0,,,29,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,DK1IY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374666900002,0

Power plants occasionally need to curtail production during heat waves, causing economic losses and putting power quality at risk. To avoid exacerbation of this problem due to climate change, the regulation of heat emissions from power plants may require adaptation. The analysis abstracts a mathematical model from a case study of the German Rhine catchment. The model compares three options for regulation with an analysis of transaction costs, and balances them with costs from environmental externalities. First, long-term and site-specific temperature caps lead to the comparatively lowest sum of social transaction and production costs if heat waves only increase in intensity. Second, a dynamic heat load plan performs better if heat waves only increase in frequency. Third, if both intensity and frequency of heat waves increase substantially, a specific contract between the environmental regulator and electricity producers (the minimum power plant concept) performs comparatively best. The article highlights economies of scale in transaction costs, and shows how institutional adaptation can depend on the speed of climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

New England was the poorest region, and the South was the richest. Colonial per capita incomes rose only very slowly if at all, for five reasons: productivity growth was slow; population in the low-income (but subsistence-plus) frontier grew much faster than that in the high-income coastal settlements; child dependency rates were high and probably even rising; the terms of trade were extremely volatile, presumably suppressing investment in export sectors; and the terms of trade rose very slowly, if at all, in the North, although faster in the South. All of this checked the growth of colony-wide per capita income after a seventeenth-century boom. The American colonies led Great Britain in purchasing power per capita from 1700, and possibly from 1650, until 1774, even counting slaves in the population. That is, average purchasing power in America led Britain early, when Americans were British. The common view that American per capita income did not overtake that of Britain until the start of the twentieth century appears to be off the mark by two centuries or more.","[Lindert, Peter H.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Williamson, Jeffrey G.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Lindert, PH (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,"National Science Foundation [SES 0922531, SES 1227237]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Our work on the colonial period has been aided by many scholars, most importantly by Samuel Bowles, Paul Clemens, Farley Grubb, Herbert Klein, Allan Kulikoff, Carole Shammas, Billy Gordon Smith, and especially Bob Allen, Gloria Main, and Tom Weiss.

The purpose is to understand the interlinkages between intra-firm group formation and the extent of wage dispersion within the firm. Given a set of heterogeneous workers, the manager faces the challenge of allocating workers into endogenous groups (or teams) to maximize total profits. The optimal allocation features locational proximity between workers with similar productivity levels. I discuss the implications of this allocation on intra-firm wage outcomes. The main idea is that the wage paid to a single worker is determined by the productivity levels of the teammates as well as the worker's own productivity. This means that team composition is critical to understanding the within-firm productivity and wage differentials. I show that intra-firm wage dispersion is more pronounced when workers are more alike within each team and more different across the teams. I provide numerical exercises designed to illustrate how the model's predictions change as the key parameters are varied. One striking result is that a rise in the correlation between education and productivity (this can be interpreted as hiring workers with vocational education) leads to a decline in wage inequality within the firm. I also show that changes in the dispersion of worker efficiency lead to non-monotonic effects on within-firm wage inequality.","[Tumen, Semih] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Istiklal Cad 10, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Tumen, S (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Istiklal Cad 10, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey.",semih.tumen@tcmb.gov.tr,"Tumen, Semih/S-3412-2019","Tumen, Semih/0000-0002-8841-2290",,,,,56,1,1,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Such frameworks have been asked for in previous research as supplements to prevailing supply chain conceptualizations. Design/methodology/approach - The framework builds on industrial network theory. According to this approach, business reality is analyzed in three inter-related dimensions: the activities undertaken, the resources used for this undertaking, and the actors controlling resources and activities. For each dimension, relevant concepts are derived for analysis of the features of food supply and food waste. Findings - The network framing was useful for analyzing the prerequisites and consequences for two approaches to reduce food waste: one based on extension of shelf-life, the other relying on enhanced responsiveness in the supply arrangement. The framework was then used for suggesting managerial actions to reduce food waste through increasing activity coordination, resource combining, and actor interaction with consideration of potential consequences of such actions. Practical implications - Managerial issues in food supply are discussed with regard to the role of activity coordination, the role of resource combining, and the role of actor interaction in efforts to prevent food waste. Originality/value - The paper suggests a novel approach for analyzing food supply networks with particular focus on food waste reduction. Such framings are applied in other supply systems, and requested by food supply researchers.","[Gadde, Lars-Erik] Chalmers Univ Technol, Technol Management & Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Amani, Pegah] SIK Inst Livsmedel & Biotekn AB, Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology,"Amani, P (通讯作者)，SIK Inst Livsmedel & Biotekn AB, Gothenburg, Sweden.",pegah.amani@sp.se,"Caiazza, Rosa/C-6138-2015","Caiazza, Rosa/0000-0001-6067-9973; Amani, Pegah/0009-0005-9890-1206",,,,,60,13,15,2,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The analysis shows that vertical integration in supply chains allows for strengthening the competitive position through improved quality, reduced costs and shortened delivery times. It is recommended that producers and processors of live pigs develop all forms of cooperation, especially under agricultural procurement contracts. The main constraint on this form of cooperation with meat processing companies is the instability of prices in the live pig market.

The average cost of wheat production was EUR 549.94 ha(-1). It was calculated that the average usage of pesticides was 1 10 3.50 g per hectare as an active ingredient in the wheat production. The average usages per hectare of active ingredient of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides were determined to be 48.00 g, 146.60 g and 908.90 g, respectively. Herbicides are the biggest pesticide group used in wheat production. They accounted for 82.37% of total weight of active ingredients, followed by fungicides (13.28 %) and insecticides (4.35 %). The study revealed that the farmers were using herbicides more than the recommended, fungicides and insecticides less than the recommended dosages. It was calculated that the average plant protection costs was EUR 50.25 ha(-1) which was 9.14 % of wheat production costs. The percentages of average plant protection costs were 85.0 3 %, 9.24 % and 5.73 % herbicides, insecticides and fungicides, respectively. The gain threshold was calculated to be 228.39 kg ha(-1). As a result, government should be promoting research into application technologies that mitigate risk and cost and maximize gain from pesticide used. Also, pest management and farmer training programmes in all crops should be developed to ensure sustainable food security, food safety, farmers' income, and rural development.","[Yilmaz, Hasan; Demircan, Vecdi] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Isparta, Turkey; [Kart, M.

This paper applies five principles of O'Hara's political economy (POPE): historical specificity; circular and cumulative causation; uneven development; heterogeneous agents; and contradiction. POPE provides a practical tool for scrutinising the interdependent aspects of a problem. The culture of conspicuous consumption for ivory is a key historical driver of demand. Yet a core, integrated factor that helps explain the current crisis relates to the principle of uneven development. The role of uneven development can be indirect, through lack of human development causing high crime and corruption rates, weak policy frameworks and conflicts in land ownership. Further, heterogeneity of agents adds to the complexity of the networks engaged in the decimation of elephants. Linked to the poaching-trafficking circuit of heterogeneous agents, this paper identifies two specific elephant contradictions between the market forces of durable fixed capital and environment-elephant capital.

This study identifies livelihood strategies of farm households in rural Cambodia and explores their determinants with a focus on environmental resource dependence. The data are derived from a survey of 580 households in 30 villages of Stung Treng province in Cambodia undertaken in 2013. An activity-based two-step cluster analysis is conducted to identify different livelihood clusters and regression models are performed to determine the major factors affecting the choice of livelihood strategies and the extraction of environmental resources. The results demonstrate how different levels of environmental and household capital influence livelihood strategies. Environmental resources contribute a significant portion of household income (27%) and act as a means to reduce income inequality (7%) among households. The absolute environmental income is positively correlated with the total income but the relative environmental income decreases with an increase in total income. Thus, it appears that low income households are not to be blamed for environmental degradation, because they are unable to undertake activities with high return. The findings of this study suggest that promoting off-farm employment, education and social networking reduces the extraction of environmental resources. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Recent investigations have found many levees around the country are in substandard condition, however, and some communities are moving to upgrade and repair their levee systems. Little empirical work has examined how increasing flood protection from levees is valued. We present estimates of the capitalization of upgraded levee protection into commercial property prices in St. Louis County, Missouri. By using controls for surrounding land cover and coarsened exact matching to ensure close distribution between treatment and control on surrounding land cover, we attempt to isolate the price effect of the levee from agglomeration effects that may also be operating. We find that commercial properties protected by a 500-year levee do not have a statistically significant price discount as compared with properties not in a floodplain. We find the selling price of properties with levee protection to be higher (although also insignificant in many specifications) than those in a floodplain without levee protection.

Yet, how did the pursuit of economic growth become a key priority taken for granted among social scientists, politicians, and the general public? Building on studies of the so-called Post-Development school and focusing on the OECD, one of the least understood international organizations, the article offers a source-based and transnational study to chart the history of growth discourses. After setting this analysis in the context of the current debate about the relationships between GDP, welfare, and environmental sustainability and after introducing a definition of the growth paradigm, the article sketches its historical (re)making in postwar history by focusing on four entangled discourses. These claimed that GDP, with all its inscribed reductions and exclusions correctly measures economic activity, that its growth serves as a magical ward to solve all kinds of often changing key societal challenges, that growth was practically the same some of the most essential societal ambitions such as progress, well-being, or national power, and that growth is essentially limitless.

We find that when consumers have the option to self-mend a product to assure a proper fit, an online retailer can devise its return policy to encourage or suppress consumer mending as a fit-uncertainty mitigating mechanism. First, our analysis shows that an online retailer benefits from easing the return policy and lowering the consumer return cost if the value of a good fit product is low, but benefits from tightening the return policy and maintaining a reasonable return cost for consumers if the value of a good fit product is high. Second, we find that in the parameter region where the value of a good fit product is high but not too high, a tightened return policy leads to a greater consumer surplus in addition to an increased retailer profit, suggesting a win-win situation and improved social efficiency. And even beyond this win-win region, the social welfare may still increase with tightened return policy when the gains in retailer profit or consumer surplus exceeds the loss of the other party. Finally, we show that when the value of a good fit product is sufficiently high, the capability of manipulating consumer mending as a fit-uncertainty mitigating mechanism allows a pure online retailer to earn a greater profit than a dual channel retailer that sells the product through both the online and the offline channels. Our theoretical insights provide explanations to many interesting practices in the online retailing industry.","[Gu, Zheyin (Jane)] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Tayi, Giri K.] SUNY Albany, Albany, NY 12222 USA",University of Connecticut; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Gu, ZY (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, 2100 Hillside Rd,Unit 1041, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",jane.gu@business.uconn.edu; gtayi@albany.edu,,,,,,,43,23,26,4,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

A dynamic cost frontier model using the shadow cost approach is formulated to decompose cost efficiency into allocative and technical efficiencies. The dynamic cost efficiency model is developed into a more general context with a multiple quasi-fixed factor case. The model is empirically implemented using a panel data set of 1,380 Polish farms over the period 2004-2007. Due to regional differences and a wide variety of farm specializations, farms are categorized into two regions and five types of farm production specializations. The estimation results confirm our observation that adjustment was rather sluggish, implying that adjustment costs were considerably high. According to this study, it will take up to 30 years for Polish farmers to reach their optimal level of capital and land input. Allocative and technical efficiency widely differ across regions. Moreover, efficiencies prove rather stable over time and among farm specializations, although the results indicate that the regions with larger farms performed slightly better.","[Rungsuriyawiboon, Supawat] Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok 10200, Thailand; [Hockmann, Heinrich] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Dept Agr Markets, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany",Thammasat University; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Rungsuriyawiboon, S (通讯作者)，Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok 10200, Thailand.",supawat@econ.tu.ac.th; hockmann@iamo.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012",,"Thailand Research Fund (TRF); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Central and Eastern Europe (IAMO); Commission on Higher Education (CHE), Ministry of Education (Thailand) [TRF-CHE Research Grant for Mid-Career University Faculty]","Thailand Research Fund (TRF)(Thailand Research Fund (TRF)); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Central and Eastern Europe (IAMO); Commission on Higher Education (CHE), Ministry of Education (Thailand) [TRF-CHE Research Grant for Mid-Career University Faculty]","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Thailand Research Fund (TRF), the Commission on Higher Education (CHE), Ministry of Education (Thailand) [TRF-CHE Research Grant for Mid-Career University Faculty], the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Central and Eastern Europe (IAMO).

We find a fairly steep gradient of nutritional attainment relative to economic class, with high levels of vitamin and mineral deficiency among the very poorest working households. However, we conclude that the average unskilled-headed working household was better fed and nourished than previously thought. When proper allowance is made for the likely consumption of alcohol, household energy intakes were significantly higher still. We investigate the likely impact of contemporary cultural food distribution norms and conclude on the basis of the very limited evidence available that women may have received, on average, about 80 per cent of a man's share of the available food. We adjust energy requirements for likely higher physical activity rates and smaller stature and find that except among the poorest households, early twentieth-century diets were sufficient to provide energy for reasonably physically demanding work. These results are consistent with recent attempts to relate the available anthropometric evidence to long-run trends in food consumption. We also find that the lower tail of the household nutrition distribution drops away very rapidly, so that few households are estimated to have suffered severe food shortages.","[Gazeley, Ian; Newell, Andrew] Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Gazeley, I (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",,,"Gazeley, Ian/0000-0002-4277-1001",ESRC [ES/H000666/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,41,13,14,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Services, with the exception of transport, are often considered intangible because of their low level of direct emissions. However, the provision of services requires inputs produced by other sectors, including several highly material-intensive sectors. Through input-output analysis we investigate the relationship between the service subsystem and the rest of the economy as regards carbon dioxide emissions. This approach allows us to study the importance of the set of services branches as a unit in the economic structure as well as to analyze in detail the relationship between the branches. The results depict that services' direct emissions are the main component, as a consequence of transport related sectors. However, the pollution that the service subsystem makes the rest of the economy produce is very significant, and it is almost all explained by non-transport related sectors. This analysis is useful for determining the sectors in which mitigation policies are more effective, and whether they would be better tackled through technical improvements and better practices or through demand policies.

In addition the dynamics of these prices are compared to a US farm gate price. Design/methodology/approach - These milk price time series are divided into two time periods, pre and post the CAP 2003 reform, and decomposed into their trend, seasonal and cyclical components. For the decomposition a state space model is used following the approach of Harvey (1989). Findings - The results show that the dynamics of the EU, German and Irish series converged after the CAP 2003 reform were implemented and that a three-year cycle is underlying the European milk prices which is comparable with the cycle length of the US milk price. In addition it is shown that most of the observed price variation in recent times is attributed to the cyclical component. Research limitations/implications - The division of the milk price time series into periods pre and post the CAP 2003 reform is somewhat subjective because not all measures were immediately applied after the reform. It is also possible that other factors may have contributed to the changed dynamics which have been observed. In addition this leads to a short data sample. Practical implications - The results show that policy makers should consider counter cyclical policy measures given the importance of the cyclical component. Also most models used to evaluate policies do not account for cycles which may lead to wrong conclusions. In addition farmer should be aware of the cyclical nature of milk prices as they budget and plan for the future. Originality/value - No previous decomposition studies of European milk prices exist.","[Bergmann, Dennis] Cork Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Cork, Ireland; [O'Connor, Declan] Cork Inst Technol, Dept Math, Cork, Ireland; [Thuemmel, Andreas] Univ Appl Sci Darmstadt, Dept Math & Sci, Darmstadt, Germany",Munster Technological University (MTU); Munster Technological University (MTU); Hochschule Darmstadt,"Bergmann, D (通讯作者)，Cork Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Cork, Ireland.",dpbergmann@t-online.de,"O Connor, Declan/X-8658-2018","O Connor, Declan/0000-0003-0697-7608",Irish Department of Agriculture and Food,Irish Department of Agriculture and Food,The authors are grateful to Charles Nicholson and two anonymous referees for comments on an early version of the paper.

Design/methodology/approach - The study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, regional foods were identified through interviews with key school meal and city agents. In the second stage, the inclusion of these foods in school menus from 2009 to 2013 was assessed. Findings - In total, 142 regional foods were identified and classified into four groups. This classification resulted in a decision tree model to identify regional foods. Approximately 45 percent of regional preparations and 82.5 percent of regional foods were offered totaling 455 preparations and 977 foods analyzed. However, 31 percent of the regional foods identified in Stage 1 were not offered in the menus analyzed. Various regional preparations lost their authenticity, possibly not being recognized because of a lack of traditional ingredients or because they contained non-regional foods that changed their character. Practical implications - The results mainly point to symbolic aspects of the production and consumption of regional foods and preparations that are important to promoting healthy diets. In addition, they can support public policies that promote the use of these foods in the school environment. Originality/value - This study analyzes the inclusion of regional foods in school meals-a topic rarely explored in the scientific literature - and proposes a decision tree model to identify regional foods with methodological rigor. This model can assist school food managers in including regional foods and developing studies related to this topic.","[Fabri, Rafaela Karen; da Costa Proenca, Rossana Pacheco; Martinelli, Suellen Secchi; Cavalli, Suzi Barletto] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Nutr Food Serv Res Ctr, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),"Fabri, RK (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Nutr Food Serv Res Ctr, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",rafa.kf@gmail.com,"DA COSTA PROENCA, ROSSANA PACHECO/U-4042-2019","DA COSTA PROENCA, ROSSANA PACHECO/0000-0001-6149-8752; Fabri, Rafaela Karen/0000-0001-5282-9951; Barletto Cavalli, Suzi/0000-0002-2835-9424","National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel/Support Program Plans Restructuring and Expansion of Federal Universities (Reuni)","National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel/Support Program Plans Restructuring and Expansion of Federal Universities (Reuni)","The National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel/Support Program Plans Restructuring and Expansion of Federal Universities (Reuni) with the aid scholarship and the Graduate Program in Nutrition for their assistance with data collection.",,48,11,13,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

We study 30 sites along two highly urbanised streams in Brisbane, Australia. Fieldwork generated a suite of primary stream health indicators. Geographic information system techniques generated spatially-explicit metrics of land cover and a lumped metric of nearby population that put stress on stream health. Stream health indicators were aggregated into a stream health index, and land-use stress indicators were aggregated into a land-use stress index, using data envelopment analysis (DEA). DEA was then applied to these indices to create an ecological performance index. Dominator analysis generated a set of practical role models for each ecologically underperforming site. A subsequent round of DEA was applied to the stream health index and multiple stress indicators to calculate response elasticities of stream health with respect to specific stress indicators. Empirical findings show widespread deviations beneath best practice, enlightening dominator relationships, and informative variation in response elasticities. Each of these findings can provide guidance to those responsible for allocating scarce resources in an effort to improve the health of Brisbane's urban streams. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 475 students from secondary schools and universities in Australia and the UK took part in a survey, which included a Food Safety Knowledge Instrument and demographic items. Findings - Food safety knowledge was generally very low. High school students had a mean score of only 38 per cent, while university students just reached a pass with a mean of 54 per cent. Demographics accounted for 41 per cent of variance in food knowledge scores. Female gender, being at university rather than high school, and living out of home rather than with parents were associated with greater food knowledge. Residing in Australia rather than the UK and being older were also associated with greater knowledge; however, these findings were subsumed by education group. Socio-economic status was not a significant predictor of food knowledge. Practical implications - Identifying demographic and cultural differences in food knowledge can help to identify at-risk populations to better target in theory and knowledge-based interventions. Originality/value - This study is the first to apply the knowledge instrument in an Australian population.

As tourism is an expanding branch in the world economy, it is crucial to focus on how climate change issues are addressed in this industry as well. This paper analyses a group of tourism firms in Norway that join together to promote growth and profitability in winter tourism. The span in how these firms deal with environmental issues ranges from ecotourism till not addressing the subject at all. Although the majority of the firms have environmental issues on the agenda, environmental issues are not included in the cooperation. We use critical discourse theory to explore how this stance on environmental issues within a cooperation has come about, and categorize the firms into three discourses: neoclassical economics, environmental economics and ecological economics. Our data indicate that the hegemonic power of neoclassical economics hampers an environmental focus in the network. This power is exerted through the position of being environmentally indifferent. The paper adds knowledge to economic discourses on firm level. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To tackle the problem regarding reducing the production cost of livestock products, a feeding experiment on broiler chickens was conducted using protein concentrate Baltiprot - an ethanol production by-product with high protein content - produced in Latvia. The hypothesis is as follows: using the ethanol industry by-product -protein concentrate - in diets of poultry could increase broiler chicken productivity and reduce feed cost. In this aspect, the aim was to identify the most economically efficient amount of protein feed in the diet of broiler chickens. The research results showed that a greater slaughter weight of poultry (+6.48%), a lower production cost per kg of poultry meat (-7.11%), a higher production efficiency (386.2) and a lower feed conversion ratio (1.77) could be achieved by using the protein additive in the diet of broiler chickens.","[Proskina, Liga] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia; [Cerina, Sallija] State Priekuli Plant Breeding Inst, Priekuli, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Proskina, L (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia.",liigaproskina@inbox.lv,"Cerina, Sallija/I-5123-2018; Proskina, Liga/I-5119-2018","Proskina, Liga/0000-0002-3337-7838; Cerina, Sallija/0000-0002-4029-4555",,,,,16,0,1,0,2,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-187-6,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2015,,37,,,,,152,159,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BD3PQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360011300015,0

Design/methodology/approach - As a theoretical basis, consumer theory of maximizing utility being an indicator of individual preference was examined through choice experiment (CE) method to measure the WTP for value of safety within the context of health reduced risk (pathogen reduction) of illness. WTP was tested empirically using survey data from 650 households in the two largest cities in Ghana (Accra and Kumasi) that are characterized by a number of well-established vegetable producers who use wastewater in their production and a large urban and peri-urban vegetable consumer market. Findings - Experience of vegetable borne diseases drives the need for safer vegetables and income and gender are key demographic factors influencing WTP. It was further found that consumers are willing to pay an average amount of GH is not an element of 4.7 ($2.40) per month for a technology change that would result in the production of safer vegetables. Research limitations/implications - Understanding WTP offers insight into consumer concerns, behaviour and their readiness to pay for safer vegetable options. However, a further consideration of the impact of the combinations of the various non- treatment options on pathogen reduction and the assessment of the financial viability of each option will collectively ensure an efficient and cost-effective implementation of the technologies. Practical implications - WTP insight gained has implications for vegetable production, marketing and public health policy. The understanding from the findings forms a solid basis to canvass for certification system for urban/peri-urban vegetables. The information provided also helps to formulate effective public education on the safety of vegetables. Originality/value - Measuring WTP for safer vegetables by Ghanaian urban/peri-urban consumers is novel.

Using anthropological data, it shows that villages and towns of ethnic groups with higher slave exports were more politically fragmented during the precolonial era. Instrumental variables are used to show that the relationship is causal. It is argued that this fragmentation is important for relative economic development because it still influences political institutions today. This argument is supported by the use of more contemporary data to show that in contemporary Nigeria and Tanzania, areas with higher levels of precolonial political fragmentation have a higher incidence of bribery.","[Obikili, Nonso] Econ Res Southern Africa, F0301,3rd Floor Mariendahl House, ZA-7700 Claremont, South Africa",,"Obikili, N (通讯作者)，Econ Res Southern Africa, F0301,3rd Floor Mariendahl House, ZA-7700 Claremont, South Africa.",Nonso.Obikili@Econrsa.org,"Obikili, Nonso/S-8226-2019",,Economic Research Southern Africa,Economic Research Southern Africa,"The author is grateful to Christopher Hanes, Susan Wolcott, and Daniel J.

This research examines the determinants of household adaptation choices and the barriers to adaptation. It also focuses on the influence of institutional access and social capital on adaptation choice as a way forward to support and sustain local adaptation process by using the survey data of 380 hazards-prone vulnerable households in Bangladesh. The results reveal that households are implementing adaptation strategies such as diversifying crops, tree plantation (adopted by large and medium farmers), and homestead gardening and migration (adopted by small and landless farmers). Barriers to adaptation are observed heterogeneously among the farming groups where access to credit and lack of information on appropriate adaptation strategies are among the important barriers to adaptation. The model results indicate that the choice of adaptation strategies is significantly influenced by social capital and access to institutions. To support adaptation locally and to enhance vulnerable households' resilience to better cope with riverbank erosion and other climatic change issues, interventions by the government through planned adaptation, such as access to institutions and credit facilities, and a package of technologies through agro-ecological based research are required.

By combining results from semi-structured interviews with small-scale fishers and a bioeconomic model, we found that the percentage of discards for small-scale fisheries is usually low, which is consistent with general empirical observations globally but can be high when quotas are exhausted. Our results also confirm that the landing obligation would generate negative impacts on fishers' activities by investing more time on-board to handle previously discarded fishes, and putting at risk the security of fishers at sea due to full use of allowable storage on-board coupled with often adverse sea conditions in Galician bays. The application of the landing obligation policy to small-scale fisheries would result in short-and long-term losses of fishing days and yields, with high negative impacts on sustainable fisheries such as the Galician multi species small-scale gillnet fishery. The expected number of fishing days under the landing obligation is estimated to be reduced by 50% during the five years following the implementation of the policy. The future yield (catches) under the landing obligation would be only 50% of catches expected in the absence of the landing obligation, regardless of the total volume of quotas allocated to the fleet.

We find that environmental awareness has a negative and economically significant effect on labor supply. The respective impact on the consumption of polluting goods is also negative, but less robust in terms of statistical significance. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the foundations of household behavior related to environmental quality. Indeed, environmentally aware households are willing to tradeoff work hours with improved environmental quality and less so to change their consumption habits.

The key message in this debate is that different domains-for instance, water, energy and food-are interconnected and can thus not be effectively resolved unless they are addressed as being fully interrelated and interdependent. Yet while this overall narrative is forcefully supported in the new UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals that are the main part of this agenda, many Goals still remain sectoral in their basic outlook. This now requires, we argue, a new focus in both policy and research on the nexus between different Sustainable Development Goals, especially with a view to reforms in the overall institutional setting that is required to sufficiently support such a nexus approach. This article thus examines the nexus approach in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals and identifies multiple avenues for its institutionalisation in global governance.","[Boas, Ingrid] Wageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Biermann, Frank] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Environm Governance Grp, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Kanie, Norichika] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Media & Governance, 5322 Endo, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 2520882, Japan",Wageningen University & Research; Utrecht University; Keio University,"Boas, I (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",ingrid.boas@wur.nl; f.biermann@uu.nl; kanie@sfc.keio.ac.jp,"Biermann, Frank/D-4175-2013","Biermann, Frank/0000-0002-0292-0703",,,,,55,109,119,5,70,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

With considerable investment by the public in education, effectiveness and mechanisms for delivery must continually be monitored and evaluated. Proposals to alter the school calendar year therefore merit serious consideration if this translates to better management of scarce resources. Among those facets of school level costs that offer an opportunity for significant savings are plant operations. Any savings that enable resources to be focused more centrally on delivery and support of the educational mission are clearly worthy of exploration. At issue is the variability of school beginning and ending dates across the United States. It is hypothesized that strategic planning of break periods can lead to decreases in energy costs, and usage. For example, in the southwest United States, hot summer conditions can lead to significant spikes in energy consumption at times of the year when energy prices are at their highest. An approach for evaluating energy usage patterns relative to school calendars is developed, where usage and climate conditions are sought to be better understood. An optimization model is structured, formulated and applied capable of identifying ideal school start/end dates with plant operation costs in mind. Application results for a school are presented, with findings discussed within the context of proposed state-level public policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysing property rents in medieval Gloucester",ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,LAND,"Although medieval rentals have been extensively studied, few scholars have used them to analyse variations in the rents paid on individual properties within a town. It has been claimed that medieval rents did not reflect economic values or market forces, but were set according to social and political rather than economic criteria, and remained ossified at customary levels. This article uses hedonic regression methods to test whether property rents in medieval Gloucester were influenced by classic economic factors such as the location and use of a property. It investigates both ordinary commercial rents and burgage rents (landgable), and explores the relationship between the two. It also examines spatial autocorrelation. It finds significant relationships between ordinary rents and property characteristics that are similar to those found in modern studies. The findings are consistent with the view that, in late medieval Gloucester at least, ordinary rents were strongly influenced by classical economic factors working through the urban property market. The findings also suggest that burgage rents reflected economic factors, even though they remained fixed over time.","[Casson, Catherine] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Casson, Mark] Univ Reading, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",University of Manchester; University of Reading,"Casson, C (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",,"casson, mark/HOF-1580-2023",,,,,,59,7,7,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Despite an increased scholarly and policy interest in the dynamics of these perceived tipping points, institutional and governance scholars have yet to make progress on how to analyze in which ways state and non-state actors attempt to anticipate, respond, and prevent the transgression of tipping points at large scales. In this article, we use three cases of global network responses to what we denote as global change-induced tipping pointsaEuroocean acidification, fisheries collapse, and infectious disease outbreaks. Based on the commonalities in several research streams, we develop four working propositions: information processing and early warning, multilevel and multinetwork responses, diversity in response capacity, and the balance between efficiency and legitimacy. We conclude by proposing a simple framework for the analysis of the interplay between perceived global change-induced tipping points, global networks, and international institutions.","[Galaz, Victor; Osterblom, Henrik; Bodin, Orjan; Crona, Beatrice] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Crona, Beatrice] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Global Econ Dynam & Biosphere, S-11418 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Global Economic Dynamics & Biosphere - The Erling-Persson Family Academy Program,"Galaz, V; Österblom, H (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",victor.galaz@stockholmresilience.su.se; henrik.osterblom@stockholmresilience.su.se,"Crona, Beatrice/HHZ-3183-2022; Osterblom, Henrik G/D-4249-2012; Bodin, Örjan/A-5098-2010","Crona, Beatrice/0000-0003-1617-4067; Bodin, Örjan/0000-0002-8218-1153; Osterblom, Henrik/0000-0002-1913-5197; Galaz, Victor/0000-0002-7303-8849",Mistra; Futura Foundation; Baltic Ecosystem Adaptive Management (BEAM); Nippon Foundation; strategic research program Ekoklim at Stockholm University; Erling-Persson Family Foundation,Mistra; Futura Foundation; Baltic Ecosystem Adaptive Management (BEAM); Nippon Foundation(Nippon Foundation); strategic research program Ekoklim at Stockholm University; Erling-Persson Family Foundation,"This research was supported by Mistra through a core grant to the Stockholm Resilience Centre, a cross-faculty research centre at Stockholm University, and through grants from the Futura Foundation.

We statistically analyze the relationship between both industrial and non-industrial greenhouse gas emissions and economic growth and other potential drivers for 129 countries over the period from 1971 to 2010. Our analysis combines the three main approaches in the literature into a single framework for investigating the evolution of emissions and income. We find that economic growth is a driver of both industrial and non-industrial emissions, though economic growth has twice the effect on industrial emissions. The time effect is negative for both sources of emissions, though this effect is larger for non-industrial emissions. There is also convergence in emissions intensity for both types of emissions but given these other effects there is no evidence for an environmental Kuznets curve. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We use recent nationally representative household level data and regression analysis to empirically assess the role of weight-for-height, formal education and age of adult household members active in agriculture, in smallholder production. Recognizing the endogeneity of weight-for-height and variable inputs, we use instrumental variables regression and model the coefficients in the production function as functions of human capital variables. Our results reveal that human capital indicators can indeed be considered as technology-changing affecting both the slope and the intercept of the production function. Weight-for-height enhances returns to land but negatively affects returns to female labor. Formal education enhances the productivity of male labor but negatively affects returns to land. Differentiating households by landholding quintiles reveals that the technology changing role of human capital variables is much more evident for households with larger landholdings.","[Wouterse, Fleur] IFPRI, Plot 15,East Naguru Rd,POB 28565, Kampala, Uganda",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Wouterse, F (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Plot 15,East Naguru Rd,POB 28565, Kampala, Uganda.",f.wouterse@cgiar.org,,,,,,,58,8,9,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The main goal is to compare the role and the effectiveness of the certification of origin in the creation of value in the two selected markets. Moreover, the authors investigate how different quality clues in the olive oil and wine sectors are related to prices. Design/methodology/approach - To meet the goal the authors estimate two separate hedonic price models where the price of the product is regressed over different quality clues some of which are sector specific and some are common to the two sectors. The models are estimated on data which come from two of the major Italian guides chosen for their well established reputation and for the richness of information. Findings - The results indicate that: product origin and the relative certification schemes play a relevant role in the formation of prices in both markets; while the olive oil price seems to be more sensitive to farm location than to the certification of origin, the opposite happens for the wines; the higher segments of the Italian olive oil market is increasingly sophisticated and follows the main tendencies established in the quality wine markets where many quality attributes are intensely active. Research limitations/implications - First, it should be kept in mind that results for higher market segment may not hold for different segments where relevant quality clues may be different. Second, reader should be aware that comparability of the two samples is constrained by limited data availability for the olive oil sector compared to the wine sector. Originality/value - This study represents one of the first attempts to compare the role of the certification of origin in the creation of value in the Italian agro-food markets.","[Cacchiarelli, Luca; Laureti, Tiziana; Sorrentino, Alessandro] Univ Tuscia, Dept Econ & Business, Viterbo, Italy; [Carbone, Anna] Univ Tuscia, Dept Innovat Biol Syst Food Agr & Forestry, Viterbo, Italy",Tuscia University; Tuscia University,"Cacchiarelli, L (通讯作者)，Univ Tuscia, Dept Econ & Business, Viterbo, Italy.",cacchiarelli@unitus.it,"Cacchiarelli, Luca/AAE-5241-2021","Cacchiarelli, Luca/0000-0002-0302-9621; Laureti, Tiziana/0000-0003-1124-6949; CARBONE, Anna/0000-0003-0522-4049",,,,,29,23,23,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

They are facing increasing competition from multinationals to serve the consumers of the rising middle class. It is assumed that co-creation or open-innovation can be a competitive innovation strategy for the Vietnamese firms. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to understand whether the agro-food firms have the mental space or an according mindset to innovate with their customers. Design/methodology/approach - A three dimensional model of mental innovation space (MIS) was developed, comprising of the: focus of innovation, level of innovation and degree of collaboration. A total of 14 Vietnamese agro-food companies agreed to embark on a process of problem definition for innovation according to these three dimensions. This process creates a deeper understanding of the firms' fuzzy front end of innovation and results in less hypothetical findings, compared with traditional interviews. Findings - The results show that the Vietnamese agro-food firms have a rather small MIS. They are inexperienced with innovation in new product development and are even more unfamiliar with co-creation. However, the firms recognise the need for innovation and are enthusiastic about the use of co-creation.

Children in the UK consume much food outside the home yet day-care food provision is unregulated, and informed by disparate and conflicting dietary guidelines. Factors affecting nursery food provision have been much studied, but less is known about food provision in the child-minder setting. The purpose of this paper is to examine factors influencing child-minders' food provision. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative methods were employed, combining participant observation with semi-structured interviews. Participants were selected via purposive and convenience sampling. Eight child-minders from an English borough were interviewed. Findings - The food provided by child-minders was not consistent with dietary guidelines for young children, following menu plans was reported to be difficult, and knowledge about healthy eating guidelines for young children was various. Child-minders reported limited time for food preparation, and problems catering for fussy children. Some child-minders obtained support through an informal peer network group. Only one child-minder reported availing of professional nutritional advice on healthy food provision. Communication with parents about food was considered important, although there was some evidence of discord between providers and parents in dietary objectives. Research limitations/implications - The study was small in size and regionally based. Due to the local nature of the study, it is not possible to make generalisations to the wider national context. Corroboration of the findings is necessary in a larger study. Practical implications - Child-minders have a pivotal role to play in the nutritional health and development of young children, and whilst their interest in provision of nutritious food was great, outside support was lacking. Support should include provision of one clear set of authoritative guidelines, practical guidance that accommodates the realities of providing food in the child-minder setting, investment to strengthen support structures at local level and the development of network groups. Originality/value - Whilst the factors underpinning food provision in nurseries have been examined in various regions of the UK, little attention has been given to child-minder settings. The current study addresses this gap.","[Goldsborough, Nicola; Barker, Margo E.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Oncol, Human Nutr Unit, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Homer, Catherine; Atchinson, Rebecca] Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council, Publ Hlth, Rotherham, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Barker, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Oncol, Human Nutr Unit, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",m.e.barker@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Barker, Margo/0000-0002-1016-5787; Homer, Catherine/0000-0003-2571-6008",,,,,33,7,7,0,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Some theoretical reflections and numerical simulations,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Social justice; Inequality; Macroeconomics; Stock flow consistent modelling; Savings; Investment,VARIABLE ELASTICITY; SUBSTITUTION; ECONOMICS; CRISIS; SIGMA; LONG,"This paper explores the hypothesis (most notably made by French economist Thomas Piketty) that slow growth rates lead to rising inequality. If true, this hypothesis would pose serious challenges to achieving 'prosperity without growth' or meeting the ambitions of those who call for an intentional slowing down of growth on ecological grounds. It would also create problems of social justice in the context of a 'secular stagnation'. The paper describes a closed, demand-driven, stock-flow consistent model of Savings, Inequality and Growth in a Macroeconomic framework (SIGMA) with exogenous growth and savings rates. SIGMA is used to examine the evolution of inequality in the context of declining economic growth. Contrary to the general hypothesis, we find that inequality does not necessarily increase as growth slows down. In fact, there are certain conditions under which inequality can be reduced significantly, or even eliminated entirely, as growth declines. The paper discusses the implications of this finding for questions of employment, government fiscal policy and the politics of de-growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - The study evaluated the banana industry in Zimbabwe focusing on postharvest losses along the VC. Findings - Total postharvest losses for 2011-2012 were estimated to be 24-27 per cent of total production with a minimum economic loss of USD69,983/annum/firm, and a total loss of more than USD500,000/annum between the VCs analysed. The bulk of the losses occurred at farm level during handling and transportation. The major factors contributing to banana postharvest losses were: unreliable transport, poor communication and coordination between producers and processors; lack of or inefficient temperature management and poor sanitation. Practical implications - The study identified production capacity, quality and branding as opportunities and challenges in the banana industry. Currently, there is a 40 per cent unmet local demand for bananas and hence there are no exports. If modern banana handling systems are employed and more research and development is carried out along the VC, postharvest losses can be reduced significantly, resulting in increased income and potential expansion of the industry. Originality/value - This is the first known attempt to analyse the banana VC in southern Africa and quantify postharvest losses.","[Mvumi, Brighton; Matsikira, Learnmore Tatenda] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Engn, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Mutambara, Jackqeline] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Harare, Zimbabwe",University of Zimbabwe; University of Zimbabwe,"Mvumi, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Engn, Harare, Zimbabwe.",mvumibm@agric.uz.ac.zw,,,,,,,20,11,12,2,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This paper provides an insight into the decision-making practice of modern food retail buyers behaviour in emerging modern food distribution systems, where the buying task involves balancing the retailer's commercial interests with more stringent government regulations that shape food business in the region. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative case study approach was used for the study. The researcher used semi-structured interviews with retailers for data collection and corroborated them with secondiut data. Data were thematically analysed. Findings - The study shows that the criteria used by modern food retailers in the selection of local food suppliers are reliability, quality, trade credit and legal certification. The task is further complicated by the overlapping food certification requirements of various government agencies, which impose limitations on the buyers' decision, Due to the exploratory nature of the study and its focus on the context of a particular geographical marketplace, the findings may not he generalizable to other countries.

Results indicate that fishery production shows a heavily uneven distribution and tends to cluster at the province level. Additionally, the barycenter of fishery is always located in southeastern China during the study periods and tends to follow the flow of the Yangtze River over time. Simultaneously, spatial patterns of fishery geographic agglomeration substantially present hot spots in coastal regions and cold spots in inland regions. But the total amount of both hot and sub hot spots has decreased by nearly half while that of both cold and sub cold spots, on the contrary, has increased relatively in the time periods. More importantly, the majority of type areas, including hot spots, sub hot spots, sub cold spots and cold spots haven't yet changed, and the changed ones also mainly showed the gradually weakened evolution characteristics. Moreover, we further found that both distribution trends of contiguity and change rules of gradient for various type areas were not obvious gradually for the period from 1988 to 2013. We attempt to take a fresh look at the fishery geographic agglomeration by the combination of multi methods and angles, and our empirical evidence has important implications for both theories and policy making. Certainly, this also is innovative points of this paper.","[Rui Yang; Li Julin; Liu Xiaoqiong; Zhang Jian; Zhao Xinzheng] Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710127, Peoples R China; [Zhang Jian] Northwest Univ, Coll Silk Rd Studies, Xian 710069, Peoples R China",Northwest University Xi'an; Northwest University Xi'an,"Zhao, XZ (通讯作者)，Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710127, Peoples R China.",xzzhao@nwu.edu.cn,"li, wei/IUQ-2973-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41401184, 41601174]; Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, China [2015D055]; Science Foundation of Northwest University [14NW03]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, China; Science Foundation of Northwest University","Sponsor: National Natural Science Foundation of China(No. 41401184, 41601174), Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, China (No. 2015D055), The Science Foundation of Northwest University(No. 14NW03)",,18,0,0,0,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-275-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,65.0,,,,,,102,106,,,,,,5,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Law; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Government & Law,BH2BD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000398733800024,0

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of firms economic incentives on the adoption of different traceability systems. In specific, the analysis aims at segmenting food firms on the basis of economic incentives for the adoption of voluntary traceability and the levels of the system complexity implemented. Design/methodology/approach - A survey based on an ad hoc questionnaire was conducted in 2014. on a sample of firms certified ISO 22005/2008. Cluster analysis was run for the analysis and one-way ANOVA was used to confirm differences among clusters. Findings - The analysis presents three different clusters in terms of economic incentives for voluntary traceability and the level of systems complexity implemented. All the clusters reveal that supply chain incentives play a key role. Moreover, fine traceability Ousters firms with high level of traceability. They consider food safety as an important incentive to adopt a voluntary standard. Medium traceability groups firms with an average level of traceability system complexity. The interviewed consider the firm reputation as strategic driver for voluntary standard implementation. The cluster coarse traceability groups firms which introduced traceability for quality differentiation of products on the market. The,se, firms implemented a low level of traceability system complexity. Research limitations/implications - The paper presents some limitations due to the sample dimension. Future research is oriented to test such results on an extended sample and to analyse the relationships between the traceability system implemented and the different kind of economic incentives for traceability standards. Originality/value - The present paper offers two main contributions. From a conceptual point of view it tries to deepen existing knowledge on the mechanisms regulating the existence of different traceability standards. From a managerial point of view, the analysis contributes in the understanding of firm strategies in relation to the adoption of different traceability systems. Such results could address firm management on the allocation of financial resources for the adoption of different traceability systems.","[Stranieri, Stefanella; Cavaliere, Alessia; Banterle, Alessandro] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods DEMM, Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Cavaliere, A (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods DEMM, Milan, Italy.",alessia.cavaliere@unimi.it,"Cavaliere, Alessia/AGZ-9326-2022; Banterle, Alessandro/ACT-7678-2022","Cavaliere, Alessia/0000-0001-7164-4549; Stranieri, Stefanella/0000-0002-9936-8942",,,,,48,18,18,0,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

A good understanding of why individuals undertake pro-environmental actions is important in order to construct policies that are aligned with preferences and actual behavioral patterns, such as concern for social esteem and reputation. In this paper, we present the results of a framed field experiment that explores reputation formation as a driver in support of household recycling practices. We use a shame and a pride treatment to test which is more effective, if at all, in increasing recycling effort. We find that reputational concerns indeed play a role in shaping individual pro-environmental behavior. Surprisingly, subjects cooperate more if the situation is framed as avoiding shame (bad reputation) rather than as acquiring pride and gratitude (good reputation). The actual experiment is based on a real recycling program, with participants who are heads of urban households in Costa Rica. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This is despite an average annual increase in energy efficiency of about 30% in ICT/electronics throughout the last 5 decades. Mainstream studies of energy-related rebound effects have yet to produce a conceptual framework that adequately encapsulates a unique feature of ICT/electronics: its tendency to induce changes in social practice and socio-technical structures. This study attempts to fill this gap. Surveying rebound effect literature, it builds on studies which explore 'transformational' change caused by energy efficiency increases. It identifies structural changes in business, education, the military and households caused by energy efficiency increases in ICT/electronics, which lead to a proliferation of ICT/electronic devices and consequently increased energy consumption. It shows the cause-and-effect logic between energy efficiency and energy consumption in ICT/electronics, and tentatively estimates rebound effects ranging between 115% and 161% in eight diverse empirical examples. The history of ICT/electronics shows that energy efficiency increases inevitably lead to increases in energy consumption, hence firm controls on CO(2)e emission allowances may offer the best hope of curbing energy consumption and CO(2)e emissions in this sector.

The allocation of funds for the best return from investment requires a careful assessment of expected return and uncertainty. In this paper, we applied a portfolio theory-based decision support tool that helps determine resource allocation in a way that maximizes expected return and minimizes uncertainty. Our framework offers three advancements to the literature. First, it helps in making resource allocation decisions across multiple pests that affect multiple environmental assets. Second, it incorporates multiple sources of uncertainty in the decision analysis including economic value uncertainty. Finally, it demonstrates a generic approach to design a choice experiment study to estimate monetary values of a broad group of environmental assets. We find that a portfolio-based framework applied in conjunction with a choice experiment study can be a useful tool to guide biosecurity resource allocation decisions. Our results show that disregarding value uncertainty may cause bias by underestimating true uncertainty in the opportunity set, The choice experiment study revealed substantial positive non-market values generated by environmental biosecurity in Australia. However, significant preference heterogeneity across respondents with regards to different biosecurity outcomes was observed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Time series tests of real wage integration show that the Maghreb and Eastern Mediterranean exported enough labourers to experience labour market integration, while the emigration rates of the northern Mediterranean, were not high enough. As the latter group comprised most of the region's economic weight, the Mediterranean as a whole was held back. The wage gap between the first two groups and the Atlantic economy was the highest, but journey costs relative to wage levels were roughly similar across the Mediterranean. The incentive-vs.-cost arithmetic favoured emigration from the Maghreb and Eastern Mediterranean.

Los test de series temporales de integracion de salarios reales muestran que los paises del Magreb y del Mediterraneo oriental exportaron trabajadores suficientes para experimentar integracion en los mercados de trabajo; sin embargo, las tasas de emigracion de los paises del Norte del Mediterraneo no fueron lo suficientemente elevadas. Como este segundo grupo representaba el mayor peso economico de la region, el conjunto del Mediterraneo se resintio.

The aim of this introductory article to the special section In markets we trust? Contrasting views on the performance and legitimacy of Market-Based Instruments in global environmental governance is to promote critical reflection about the nature, scope and limits of MBIs in ecosystem services governance and to provide guidance on where the boundaries for the application of markets ought to be set. First, we examine the role that methodological assumptions and implicit normative positions play in shaping academic perception of the effectiveness and legitimacy of MBIs. Second, we examine MBIs in the broader ideological context and socio-political processes that have favored their development and implementation. Third, we test claims of the literature on MBIs against insights and data from case studies presented in the special section. Fourth, we discuss the scope and limits of markets in ecosystem services governance in the light of biophysical, institutional, and normative boundaries.

Despite facing a number of problems households held predominantly positive attitudes towards the park and wildlife. Attitudes were influenced by the respondents' values towards conservation rather than incentives received. However, positive attitude and their general agreement with conservation efforts did not stop households' involvement in illegal resource extraction. We found that general factors, such as perception associated with the park and contextual variables, and behaviour-specific factors, such as perception of resource extraction, had an impact on behaviour. Behaviour-specific factors help to understand how individuals frame their behaviour and how this framing constrains or facilitates behavioural change. Similarly, general factor helps to understand why households engage in the behaviour. Therefore, it is important to consider both of these factors to understand actual behaviour. Our research shows that positive attitudes by themselves are not sufficient for changing behaviour. This indicates that interventions need to be directed to all parts of the causal chain from environmental awareness, to attitudes, to intention, and finally to actual behaviour; missing a link in the sequence will interrupt the whole process.

The analysis uses visitors' preference data to evaluate the potential impacts of various pricing strategies on revenues. Data come from choice experiment surveys conducted in 2009, regarding four characteristics of a tour to the Galapagos: length of stay, depth of experience in the islands' ecosystem, level of protective measures taken against invasive species, and price. We found that the typical tourist would be willing to pay 2.5 times more for a tour with high-level of protection against invasive species than for a tour with the current level of protection and otherwise similar characteristics. The mean marginal willingness to pay for a tour with an in-depth natural experience is 1.8 times more than for a similar tour providing only an overview of the Galapagos' ecosystem. Further, we determined that differences in elasticity of demand between long and short tours suggest that a pricing strategy may be used to encourage tourists to take longer tours without affecting total revenue. Such a pricing strategy would decrease the number of unique island visitor contacts per year, thereby reducing the threat to the islands' unique ecosystem. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

An intervention framework is defined by (i) an intervention, such as a publicly-funded program, and (ii) the intervention effect the difference in the provision of the ecosystem service with and without the intervention. The contention of this paper is that if the purpose of an experiment is to estimate the value of the intervention effect, rather than the intervention itself, consideration needs to be given to the saliency of the service to the respondent population, because for salient services respondents often have prior beliefs about the intervention effect, and if these prior beliefs are different on average than implicitly assumed or explicitly presented in the choice experiment, the estimate of the value of the improvement will be biased. We emphasize that in some cases a structural model can be used to identify the value of the intervention effect, whereas for others, only the value of the intervention can be identified. We illustrate the issue using two case studies concerning ecosystem service provision on freshwater lakes, prevention of aquatic species invasions, and fish habitat enhancement.

The role of stocks of buildings and infrastructure has remained underexplored, yet it is the physical stock that provides service to society. To fill this gap, this research investigates stock dynamics in Japan in relation to population and economic drivers using panel regression and IPAT analyses for the past five decades. We recognize characteristic changes in the strength and relative influence of the drivers throughout time, in different subnational regions, and on the dynamics of buildings compared to transportation infrastructure. We find that material stock accumulation mainly occurred due to growth in economic activity, specifically by tertiary sector demand. Apart from a period of government-driven stock accumulation in the 1990s to stimulate economic growth, as economic and population growth slowed stock accumulation dynamics also changed signaling a new stock saturation trend. Migration from rural to urban areas has recently become an influential driver, leaving behind underused buildings and roads. This analysis provides a case study on how socio-economic drivers and stock accumulation interacted and changed while the country matured, which may have implications for understanding stock dynamics in rapidly industrializing economies.

The material reveals that there was tension regarding how great burden Sweden should shoulder and to what extent emissions reductions should be made domestically. Despite this tension, Sweden decided to have a more ambitious national target (-4 %) than required by the EU burden sharing agreement (+4 %), which allocated the EU's Kyoto Protocol targets within EU-15. It was also decided that emissions reductions should not account for the flexible mechanisms or carbon sinks. Importantly, the national -4 % target was over-implemented (-16 % in 1990-2011). These decisions were institutionalized until the center-right government in 2009 formulated the 2020 targets. Using argumentative discourse analysis, I conclude that what made possible Sweden's comparatively ambitious climate policy was the discourse coalitions (although different in character) formed around primarily two story lines that were blended: Opportunity (in line with the discourse on ecological modernization) and Ecological Justice (in line with the discourse on civic environmentalism). However, the latter was de-emphasized by the center-right government that came to power in 2006, reflecting the influence of a Sacrifice story line and the increased importance of the norm of cost-efficiency. Convincing others about the truthfulness of the Opportunity story line would possibly be effective for making others willing to commit to obligations and actually implement them. However, the diminishing importance of the Ecological Justice story line may affect negatively how Sweden is viewed internationally. If the overarching aim is to get as many countries as possible to commit to and comply with quantitative commitments within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, then it might not only be of importance whether Sweden can deliver but possibly also how one delivers.","Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Zannakis, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Polit Sci, POB 711, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",mathias.zannakis@pol.gu.se,"Zannakis, Mathias/AAH-2360-2019","Zannakis, Mathias/0000-0003-0985-8655",,,,,64,13,13,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

In Tunisia, several reforms have been undertaken over the last two decades to attain UHC with the goals of ensuring financial protection in health and enhancing access to healthcare. The first of these goals has recently been addressed in a companion paper by Abu-Zaineh et al. (Int J Health Care Financ Econ 13(1): 73-93, 2013). The present paper seeks to assess whether these reforms have in fact enhanced access to healthcare. The average treatment effects of two insurance schemes, formal-mandatory (MHI) and state-subsidized (MAS) insurance, on the utilization of outpatient and inpatient healthcare are estimated using propensity score matching. Results support the hypothesis that both schemes (MHI and MAS) increase the utilization of healthcare. However, significant variations in the average effect of these schemes are observed across services and areas. For all the matching methods used and compared with those the excluded from cover, the increase in outpatient and inpatient services for the MHI enrollees was at least 19 and 26 %, respectively, in urban areas, while for MAS beneficiaries this increase was even more pronounced (28 and 75 % in the urban areas compared with 27 and 46% in the rural areas for outpatient and inpatient services, respectively). One important conclusion that emerges is that the current health insurance schemes, despite improving accessibility to healthcare services, are nevertheless incapable of achieving effective coverage of thewhole population for all services. Attaining the latter goal requires a strategy that targets the trees not the forest.","[Abu-Zaineh, Mohammad] Aix Marseille Univ, Fac Med, INSERM IRD UMR SESSTIM 912, F-13006 Marseille, France; [Abu-Zaineh, Mohammad] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ AMSE, F-13006 Marseille, France; [Makhloufi, Khaled] Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM IRD UMR SESSTIM 912, F-13006 Marseille, France; [Ventelou, Bruno] Aix Marseille Sch Econ AMSE, French Natl Ctr Sci Res, Res Grp Quantitat Econ Aix Marseille CNRS GREQAM, INSERM IRD UMR SESSTIM 912, F-13006 Marseille, France",Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm),"Abu-Zaineh, M (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Fac Med, INSERM IRD UMR SESSTIM 912, F-13006 Marseille, France.;Abu-Zaineh, M (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ AMSE, F-13006 Marseille, France.",khaled.makhloufi@inserm.fr; bruno.ventelou@inserm.fr; mohammad.abu-zaineh@inserm.fr,"Abu-Zaineh, Mohammad/G-7121-2018; ABU-ZAINEH, Mohammad/Y-4716-2019","Abu-Zaineh, Mohammad/0000-0001-8888-432X; MAKHLOUFI, KHALED/0000-0002-3476-2076",French National Research Agency (ANR); A*MIDEX project - Investissements d'Avenir French Government program [ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02],French National Research Agency (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); A*MIDEX project - Investissements d'Avenir French Government program(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We would like to thank The French National Research Agency (ANR) for its financial support to the research project (INEGSANTE-Les Suds-Aujourd'hui II-2010).

J,"Charlebois, S; Hughes, JC; Hielm, S",,,,"Charlebois, Sylvain; Hughes, Julia Christensen; Hielm, Sebastian",,,Corporate philanthropy and channel impact in food security The case Nourish by Campbell's Canada,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Canada; Food security; Channel relationships; Food manufacturing processes; Channel relations,SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; MARKETING CHANNELS; GOVERNANCE; INTEGRATION; SELECTION; ALTRUISM; BUSINESS; SUPPLIER; VALUES; CSR,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss how corporate philanthropy influences channel behaviour in the context of food security. Design/methodology/approach - The authors chose an exploratory case-study design to guide the investigation, based on Yin's (1994) argument that case studies are the preferred strategy when how or why questions are being posed, and when the focus is on a modern phenomenon within a real-life context. A survey study was focused on formal interviews onsite where product development and marketing occurred. Findings - It is known that the concepts of power and dependency are central to channel relationships. In food distribution, it has been argued that food distributors hold more power than food processors due to end-user proximity (Ruyter et al., 1996). For corporate altruism acts to have an impact when generated by functions other than distribution and retailing, one can only argue that channel members would require a significant number of antecedents to be successful. In Campbell's case, as shown in Table I, many became enabling to a successful outcome while others arguably made the project more challenging. Research limitations/implications - With food security, the authors would need to consider other relationships within the marketing channel. The macro-environment of the marketing channel could also be incorporated in a future study. This study also does not compare other campaigns related to a similar product. In fact, it is believed that Nourish is unique in that it is the first ready-to-eat, ready-to-ship food product which was developed with the intent to serve the greater good. Practical implications - Philanthropic acts by one company can influence other channel members when intent is driven by clear altruistic and politically strategic motives, and reflects individualistic and paternalistic attitudes. Campbell's was paternalistic but attempted to serve many causes at once. Committing to only one cause in the future may help consolidate resources and corporate energy around one single cause. Social implications - Corporate philanthropy describes the action when a corporation voluntarily donates a portion of its resources to a societal cause. Nourish's case is different in that it is not just a linear transactional gift between a corporation and an organization actively involved in the cause. The project relies on the active participation of other channel members, including consumers, to support the campaign led by Campbell's. It was a form of an extendable altruistic venture which allowed all channel members to contribute to the cause. Originality/value - Food processors that want to address the issue of food security or any other societal causes, domestically or abroad, will not cease. The challenge for food processors lies in the functional nature of their role within marketing channels. Since they do not transact with consumers directly, they depend on distributors and retailers to relay their philanthropic convictions to consumers. Based on the Nourish case, this study set out a series of antecedents which would support similar initiatives.","[Charlebois, Sylvain; Hughes, Julia Christensen] Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Hielm, Sebastian] Govt, Minist Agr & Forestry, Helsinki, Finland",University of Guelph,"Charlebois, S (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Coll Management & Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",sylvain.charlebois@uoguelph.ca,,"Charlebois, Sylvain/0000-0002-9400-0153",,,,,72,1,2,2,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

J,"Di Fonzo, A; Russo, C",,,,"Di Fonzo, Antonella; Russo, Carlo",,,Designing geographical indication institutions when stakeholders' incentives are not perfectly aligned,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rural development; Design; Endogenous quality; Frauds; Geographical indication,QUALITY CERTIFICATION,"Purpose - Geographical Indications (GI) are complex and multi-purpose institutions. Their objectives include encouraging diversification of agricultural production, improving farmers' income, countering depopulation of rural areas, satisfying consumer demand for high-quality good, and protecting consumers from food fraud. The authors argue that such objectives are not necessarily aligned as divergence may arise among stakeholders (such as farmers, consumers or rural communities) about the optimal design of the GI. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The authors developed a simple, static game-theory model describing the basic choices that a planner faces in designing a GI. Findings - The authors conclude that the optimal organization requires finding trade-offs among conflicting but equally desirable objectives. Perfect monitoring is not a sufficient condition to resolve such conflicts. Sub-consortia and flexible production agreements may increase the efficiency of a GI. Research limitations/implications - The authors described basic trade-offs in GI design using the simplest possible model. To this purpose the authors introduced limiting assumptions that may be relaxed in future research. The representation of the GI agreement focussed on the quality level only, abstracting from all other consideration. Using a static model prevented us from explicit modeling of (loss of) reputation effects. The simplifying assumptions about consumer behavior and cost functions have reduced the generality of the results. Extensions of the model may consider introducing additional elements in the GI agreement such as production areas or governance models, dynamic games and general functional forms. Practical implications - The authors found that in designing a GI: first, promotion approaches revolving around small groups of local leaders (i.e. efficient, high-quality producers) might overshoot quality, resulting in unsustainable production agreements; second, introducing degrees of flexibility in the production agreement may help achieving a sustainable GI; and finally, sub-consortia/optional labels may help dealing with producers' heterogeneity. Social implications - The authors found that setting a high standard in the production agreement is not sufficient condition for delivering quality food to consumers, as producers might have incentive to commit frauds. A simple command and control approach to quality in GI's is not always the most efficient strategy, because it may reduce participation. In designing the GI, the goals of identity preservation and food quality must be balanced with consideration of producers' incentives. The involvement of producers in the design of the GI is a critical success driver. Yet, this practice can be problematic because of producers' heterogeneity. Originality/value - The paper provides theoretical foundation for best practices in forming a GI, including: multi-stakeholder involvement, management of farmer heterogeneity and monitoring.","[Di Fonzo, Antonella; Russo, Carlo] Univ Cassino & Lazio Meridionale, Econ & Giurisprudenza, Cassino, Italy",University of Cassino,"Russo, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino & Lazio Meridionale, Econ & Giurisprudenza, Cassino, Italy.",russocar@unicas.it,,"Di Fonzo, Antonella/0000-0002-5258-4699; Di Fonzo, Alessio/0000-0001-6478-026X",,,,,27,8,8,4,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The main aim of this research was to forecast housing affordability in three selected post-transition economies: Croatia, Latvia and Serbia. Overall, five indicators of housing affordability are studied: Price to income ratio; Gross rental yield city centre; Gross rental yield outside of centre; Mortgage as a percentage of income and Affordability index. Due to data deficiency, the values of aforementioned indicators are analysed for the period from 2009 to 2015, based on yearly data, and only short-term forecasts are conducted. NUMBEO database was used as data source. In order to determine short-term future trends of change in these indicators, six forecasting models were applied, namely: naive model I, naive model II, naive model IIa, geometric mean forecasting model, simple average forecasting model and single exponential smoothing model. The best forecasting model for each indicator and for each country is selected according to the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) criterion. The forecasting model with the lowest MAPE value is used to determine the trend based forecast of housing affordability. According to the research results, housing affordability level, in general, is likely to rise in Croatia. Furthermore, there is high probability that housing affordability in Latvia is going to increase in the next years. In contrast, housing affordability in Serbia is most likely to decrease in the following period.","[Dumicic, Ksenija; Zmuk, Berislav; Casni, Anita Ceh] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Dumicic, K (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",kdumicic@efzg.hr; bzmuk@efzg.hr; aceh@efzg.hr,"Časni, Anita Čeh/H-9236-2018; Dumičić, Ksenija/H-9217-2018","Časni, Anita Čeh/0000-0002-2742-8619;",Croatian Science Foundation under the project STRENGTHS [9402],Croatian Science Foundation under the project STRENGTHS,"This work has been fully supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project STRENGTHS (project no. 9402, Project period: 2014-2018).",,17,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2015,,,,,,,134,143,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450589500015,0

Design/methodology/approach - Factor-cluster analysis is an alternative segmentation method to more traditionally used methods based on consumer demographics. Push and pullmotivators were analyzed through factor analysis to determine important groupings. Then, to identify homogenous subgroups, k-means cluster analysis was conducted to segment 559 survey respondents based on factor importance. Findings - Three diverse groups were identified: Fraternizing Kitchen Fearfuls, Functional Feasters, and Foodie Fanatics. The various push and pull factors appeared to affect segments differently, with each cluster ascribing various importance levels to each of the factors used in the clustering approach. Research limitations/implications - Limitations include the use of a convenience sample and on-campus sampling. Future research should use random sampling methods and obtain surveys from sites not associated with a college campus. Practical implications - Though not often used in hospitality research, factor-cluster analysis can be useful to segment diners based on behavioral intentions and attributes, allowing marketers to more accurately target these diverse consumer segments. Marketing implications for casual dining restaurants are suggested. Originality/value - Using the involvement construct with push/pull motivators, this study groups respondents though factor-cluster analysis. Though used in tourism studies, factor-cluster analysis has yet to be studied in the context of casual dining restaurant patrons.","[Duncan, Jennifer L.; Josiam, Bharath M.; Kim, Young Hoon; Kalldin, Alexandria C.] Univ N Texas, Coll Merchandising Hospitality & Tourism, Denton, TX 76203 USA",University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton,"Josiam, BM (通讯作者)，Univ N Texas, Coll Merchandising Hospitality & Tourism, Denton, TX 76203 USA.",josiamb@unt.edu,,"Josiam, Bharath/0000-0002-4846-861X",,,,,80,9,12,2,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Three focus group interviews were conducted. Thematic analysis based on theory was performed. The findings were categorised into nine themes. Findings - Consumer views on packaging aspects were revealed, covering: packaging material; pack size; protection and preservation; convenience; price; communication and information; ethical perspectives; novelty and innovation; and advantages and disadvantages of packaged and unpackaged products. Research limitations/implications - The study adds to present knowledge on the role of packaging in consumers' food choices. The qualitative analysis identified areas for further research through quantitative methods. Practical implications - Challenges in communicating the consumer benefits of packaging and ways to improve the attractiveness of items in the fresh produce category were identified. The results can potentially assist in improving food packaging design practice to the mutual benefit of consumers and suppliers. Originality/value - Fruit and vegetables is generally a category with weak branding and low levels of packaging.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 39 advertisements were collected from local food magazines in 2012-2013. Each copy was content-analyzed based on three dimensions of advertising style: advertising forms, appeals, and verbal communication style. Findings - The analysis of the copies shows a tendency for Greek advertisements to adopt a forceful style and to convey an abundance of factual information in direct forms, combined with emotional appeals emphasizing local origin, nostalgia, and long-standing cultural traditions. On the contrary, UK copies tend to emphasize the entertainment value of advertisements, while communicating rational appeals in an informal register. Research limitations/implications - The variations in advertising style for the promotion of food products in the UK and Greece reflect the different ways in which advertising works, and potential differences in consumers' decision making when it comes to the purchase of the products. The findings could have relevance for the design and transcreation of multinational food campaigns, and they could facilitate the development of research questions to be addressed in food marketing and advertising and consumer behaviour research. Originality/value - The study adopts an interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of the copies and the interpretation of findings, which draws on marketing and advertising and integrates a linguistic analysis of the text. By focusing on a particular product category and origin, it attempts to comprehensively account for their effect on advertising practices.","Univ Manchester, Sch Arts Languages & Cultures, Ctr Translat & Intercultural Studies, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Theocharous, A (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Arts Languages & Cultures, Ctr Translat & Intercultural Studies, Manchester, Lancs, England.",,"Theocharous, Antonis L/D-1245-2016",,Leventis Scholarship Foundation,Leventis Scholarship Foundation,Funded by Leventis Scholarship Foundation.,,35,6,7,2,54,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The stated variables tend to reveal how consumer attitudes and consumption of organic produces relate to life course factors across diet-related identities and age groups. Design/methodology/approach - This study takes adult consumers of Taichung City in Central Taiwan as the target population. A survey data by personal interviews collected through systematic sampling of four supermarkets and one farmer's market was employed to obtain a sample of 322 adult consumers in February, 2010. Findings - This study finds that the level of individual vegetarianism is significantly correlated with organic food attitude. Individuals who live with young children and possess healthful preference for agricultural produce demonstrate more positive attitudes toward organic food. In addition, being in poor health or taking care of acutely or chronically ill family members, living with a spouse, in favor of vegetarianism, and approval of healthful attributes in choosing agricultural produce all contribute to an individual's intake of organic food. Along with age, living with young children is found to have joint effects in influencing an individual's choice of organic food. Research limitations/implications - Since the stages of life is interwoven with various factors such as age, marriage, child-raising and other life events and spans a long period of time, the authors suggest that a longitudinal study may be carried out in future studies to reveal more detailed and valid information. The formation of life course indicators should be more specified to include all possible stages or conditions. Mixture of qualitative analysis with quantitative analysis, will be a better approach to obtain more detailed and meaningful information. Future studies should apply more complicated designs to obtain further theoretical implications. Practical implications - First, taking the family rather than individuals as the marketing unit is a more effective strategy for organic food marketers, producers and policy makers. Second, more educational activities or training events in food preparation that simultaneously target both parents and children at the same time should be held. Third, extension agencies of organic agriculture and organizations affiliated with vegetarianism should seek to establish more bilateral educational or commercial cooperation in order to strengthen the development of organic agriculture. Originality/value - Previous studies have rarely explored the issue of organic food choice and life course and its possible moderating effects with diet-related identity. In this survey of Taiwanese consumers, there are sufficient evidences to confirm the connection between life course factors and the consumption of organic produces, either by the figures of main effects or interaction effects.","[Tung, Shih-Jui; Lin, Meng-Chu] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Grad Inst Bioind Management, Taichung 40227, Taiwan; [Tsay, Jenner C.] Chaoyang Univ Technol, Dept Early Childhood Dev & Educ, Taichung, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University; Chaoyang University of Technology,"Tsay, JC (通讯作者)，Chaoyang Univ Technol, Dept Early Childhood Dev & Educ, Taichung, Taiwan.",jctsay@mail.cyut.edu.tw,,,,,,,50,11,11,2,50,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This article aims to reflect the preliminary results of the risk evaluation in hemp production and processing. The following tasks were set to reach this aim: to analyze the risk evaluation methodology and risk calculation methodology; to determine and systematize risks in hemp production and to carry out a preliminary evaluation for risks in hemp production using semi-quantitative evaluation. For the evaluation purposes the hemp production is divided in five stages - preparation of soil and sowing of hemp; growing of hemp; hemp harvesting; hemp processing; and selling of the produced output. The evaluation of risks was done within a system of 18 risks, divided in six main groups - agro-meteorological; technological and production; personnel; environment; legislative; economic, and market risks. The results indicate that the highest risk level in the entire hemp production and processing process was specific to the group of personnel risks, whereas the lowest - to the group of environmental risks.","[Zeverte-Rivza, Sandija] Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia; Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Agr, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies; Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Zeverte-Rivza, S (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia.",Sandija.Rivza@llu.lv,"Adamovics, Aleksandrs/I-5127-2018; Zeverte-Rivza, Sandija/GLV-3922-2022","Adamovics, Aleksandrs/0000-0003-1725-4421; Zeverte-Rivza, Sandija/0000-0002-1973-6128",,,,,21,1,1,0,19,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-187-6,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2015,,37,,,,,105,113,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BD3PQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360011300010,0

The SC approach (e.g., Chambers and Quiggin 2000) casts production decisions under uncertainty as the decision to select a portfolio of Arrow-Debreu SC outputs, scheduled to be delivered in the contingent states of nature. Under some stationarity assumptions on the SC decisions (i.e., no technical change, time-invariant states of nature, time-invariant SC portfolio decisions) and regularity assumptions on the data generating process (i.e., cross-sectionally homogeneous state realizations), SC technology can be estimated from balanced panel data that are framed as cross-sectional data of partially-revealed SC portfolio decisions. This allows one to simulate an optimal SC portfolio, determined by the interaction between the estimated SC technology and given risk preferences. In the application to Maryland dairy production data, the stochastic technologies of confinement and intensive-grazing dairy systems are compared. Of the two time intervals (years 2000-2004 and ye0ars 2006-2009) separately analyzed, the optimal production decision has generally become riskier for the confinement system and less risky for the grazing system. These contrasting trends appear directly related to the volatile milk prices, feed cost hikes, and increasing organic milk production during 2006-2009. The risk associated with the optimal portfolio is substantially lower under the SC analysis compared to a typical residual-as-uncertainty approach, suggesting that the typical approach may overstate the risk due to uncertainty.","[Minegishi, Kota] Univ Minnesota, Dept Anim Sci, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Minegishi, K (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Anim Sci, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",Kota@umn.edu,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

J,"Svensson, R",,,,"Svensson, Roger",,,Periodic recoinage as a monetary tax: conditions for the rise and fall of the bracteate economy,ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Scholars in the fields of archaeology and numismatics have long been familiar with the phenomenon of periodic recoinage (renovatio monetae), which dominated monetary taxation in medieval Europe for almost 200 years. However, this form of monetary taxation is seldom, if ever, discussed in the literature of economics or economic history. No economic theory has ever been proposed to explain periodic recoinage. The present study aims to make up for this absence. It examines the qualities that typically differentiate regions with periodic recoinage from those with other monetary systems and analyses how periodic recoinage was monitored and enforced. The principal example of frequently renewed coins is uni-faced bracteates, which were often subject to annual or even biannual recoinages. Although bracteates were not the cause of periodic recoinage, their features facilitated frequent renewals. The study discusses the economic consequences of periodic recoinage and links the breakdown of this monetary system with the end of bracteates' role as the principal coin in the fourteenth century.","[Svensson, Roger] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Svensson, R (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,"Svensson, Roger/0000-0003-3377-8460",Torsten Soderberg Foundation; Sven Svensson Foundation for Numismatics; Sven and Dagmar Salen Foundation,Torsten Soderberg Foundation; Sven Svensson Foundation for Numismatics; Sven and Dagmar Salen Foundation,"I would like to thank Per Hortlund, Andreas Westermark, the seminar participants at the Swedish Network for European Studies in Economics and Business (SNEE) conference in Molle and the numismatic conferences in Mikulov and Taormina, as well as two anonymous referees for their insightful comments.

In this article the effectiveness of investment in snowmaking systems is investigated (equipment, construction works) based on data for 109 French ski resorts covering eight winter seasons (2006/2007 to 2013/2014). Both static and dynamic panel data estimations show that ski areas with large investments in snowmaking systems have a higher number of skier visits. On average a 10% higher capital stock of snowmaking infrastructure leads to an increase in the number of skier visits by 8% over the winter seasons studied. However, positive effects of snowmaking can only be observed for ski areas located at high elevations, with a magnitude deceasing by higher cumulated investments in snowmaking, indicating diminishing returns to scale. Ski areas at lower elevations, benefit effectively from snowmaking to a lower degree and only in extremely dry or snow poor winter seasons. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It also delays the change in labor structure toward an increase in proportion of skilled labor, and hence, the economy may be overtaken in the development process by another with less geographical advantage for agriculture. This theoretical result is in accordance with recent empirical evidence and helps explain the reversals of national fortune, which are documented in economic history. Within its analytical framework, the article also enriches the existing literature by explaining the decline in fertility and the evolution of labor structure, along with technological progress, in the development process.","[Nguyen Thang Dao] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Nguyen Thang Dao] UCL, CORE, Voie Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Nguyen Thang Dao] Vietnam Inst Econ & Policy Res VEPR, 144 Xuan Thuy, Hanoi, Vietnam",Universite Catholique Louvain; Vietnam National University Hanoi,"Dao, NT (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany.;Dao, NT (通讯作者)，UCL, CORE, Voie Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.;Dao, NT (通讯作者)，Vietnam Inst Econ & Policy Res VEPR, 144 Xuan Thuy, Hanoi, Vietnam.",daonguyen@mcc-berlin.net,,"Dao, Thang/0000-0002-6097-4881",research grant Mobilite Ulysse F.R.S.-FNRS'' of the Belgian FNRS; CORE; Commission universitaire pour le development-CUD,research grant Mobilite Ulysse F.R.S.-FNRS'' of the Belgian FNRS; CORE(Luxembourg National Research Fund); Commission universitaire pour le development-CUD,"I would like to thank Claude Diebolt (the editor), two anonymous referees, David de la Croix, Jean Hindriks, Cuong Le Van, and particularly Julio Davila for helpful comments and suggestions.

We investigate the impact of payment conditionality types, i.e. different specifications when to pay and when not to pay, for PES on deforestation and agricultural production in a lab-in-the-field experiment Our experiment also tests variations in contract period and payment volatility. We designed a highly visual simulation game to characterize the decision situation of a cattle rancher in Brazil. The player can expand extensive pasture by deforestation or intensify existing pasture. The model includes both a land and a capital constraint We applied the game in an economic, framed lab-in-the field experiment in Tocantins, Brazil. Payments conditional on forest carbon stock lead to slow, but steady deforestation, while payments conditional on forest carbon stock-change suppressed deforestation more strongly. But payments conditional on stock increase cattle production while payments conditional on stock-change have no effect on production. Thus, depending on the level of leakage, either type of conditionality can be more cost-effective in reducing global carbon emissions. Contracts with limited periods lead to strong deforestation after the end of the payment period. Payment volatility had no significant effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Despite slow uptake in developing countries and high producer costs, a growing body of case study evidence suggests that producers benefit in varied ways from certification. A qualitative meta-synthesis approach is applied to this body of evidence in order to assess the type and extent of producer benefits reported in case studies of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification, in developing countries. While benefits from price premiums and market access appear to be limited, less tangible benefits were more common, including learning, governance, community empowerment, and reputational benefits.

The design of such programmes requires an understanding of how farmers perceive these features, their associated cost and benefits. Very little research has sought to do this. Employing unstructured interviews with 18 farmers and using ponds and two wetland types on their Nova Scotia farms as in situ visual prompts, we determine which wetland- and pond-related services are recognized by, and most important to, farmers. We see that wetlands and ponds are not valued equally, and that farmers consider 'farm ponds' most valuable in EGS terms. We also see seasonal variation in farmer perceptions and recommend multiple-visit elicitation accordingly to establish robust understanding. We analyse our results in the broader context of EGS literature and make comparisons to economic valuations of similar wetlands and ponds from the TEEB database. The implications of this study for effectively integrating extant EGS frameworks with agricultural extension programmes are discussed. Possibilities for improved wetland and waterbody conservation in the agricultural landscape are presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Economic liberty expanded over the last century-and-a-half, reaching more than two-thirds of its possible maximum. However, its evolution has been far from linear. After a substantial improvement from the mid-nineteenth century, the First World War brought a major setback. The postwar recovery up to 1929 was followed by a dramatic decline in the 1930s. Significant progress took place during the 1950s but fell short of the pre-First World War peak. After a period of stagnation, steady expansion since the early 1980s has resulted in the highest levels of economic liberty of the last two centuries. Each of the main dimensions of economic freedom exhibited a distinctive trend and its contribution to the aggregate index varied over time. Overall, improved property rights provided the main contribution to the long-run advancement of economic liberty.","[De La Escosura, Leandro Prados] Univ Carlos III, Dept Ciencias Sociales, Madrid, Spain; [De La Escosura, Leandro Prados] Univ Carlos III, Inst Figuerola, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"De La Escosura, LP (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III, Dept Ciencias Sociales, Madrid, Spain.;De La Escosura, LP (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III, Inst Figuerola, Madrid, Spain.",,"de la Escosura, Leandro Prados/H-9476-2015","de la Escosura, Leandro Prados/0000-0002-2362-4305",Fundacion Rafael del Pino; Leverhulme Trust [VP2-2012-050],Fundacion Rafael del Pino; Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"I thank Stefano Battilossi, Forrest Capie, Francisco Comin, Pedro Fraile Balbin, James Gwartney, Michael Huberman, Clemens Jobst, Joost Jonker, Robert Lawson, Pablo Martin-Acena, Branko Milanovic, Kevin O'Rourke, Nuno Palma, Albrecht Ritschl, Carlos Rodriguez Braun, Blanca Sanchez-Alonso, Isabel Sanz-Villarroya, Antonio Tena-Junguito, and participants at Cambridge, Geneva, LSE, and Venice seminars, the Economic History Society Annual Conference 2014, University of Warwick, and the CEPR Economic History Symposium, Osterreichische Nationalbank, Vienna, for their advice and comments.

However, over the last three decades a wide range of studies has found an increase in the importance of distance during the second half of the twentieth century. This paper tries to reframe this discussion by characterizing the effect of distance over a broader historical point of view. To make maximal use of the available data, we use a state-space model to construct a bilateral index of historical trade integration. Our index doubles to quadruples yearly data availability before 1950, allowing us to expand the period of analysis to 1880-2011. This implies that the importance of distance as a determinant of the changing trade pattern can be analyzed for both globalization waves. In line with O'Rourke (Politics and trade: lessons from past globalisations. Technical Report, Bruegel, 2009) and Jacks et al. (J Int Econ 83(2):185-201, 2011), we find that the first wave was marked by a strong, continuing decrease in the effect of distance. Initially, the second globalization wave started out similarly, but from the 1960s onward the importance of distance starts increasing. Nevertheless, this change is dwarfed by the strong decrease preceding it.","[Standaert, Samuel; Ronsse, Stijn] Univ Ghent, Dept Econ, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Vandermarliere, Benjamin] Univ Ghent, Dept Phys & Astron, Proeftuinstr 86, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University,"Standaert, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Econ, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Samuel.Standaert@UGent.be; Stijn.Ronsse@UGent.be; Benjamin.Vandermarliere@UGent.be,,"Standaert, Samuel/0000-0003-0903-8972",Research Foundation - Flanders; Belgian NationalBank,Research Foundation - Flanders(FWO); Belgian NationalBank,"We would like to thank Guillaume Daudin, Luca De Benedictis, Kevin O'Rourke and Eric Vanhaute for their feedback and suggestions, as well as the Flemish Supercomputer Center for allowing us access to its infrastructure.

Even though the United Nations Environment Programme reported 10 years ago that regional agreements make up two-thirds of all international treaties, regional cooperation has by comparison either received scant attention or been conceptually and empirically lumped together with global treaties. This lack of knowledge about the historical and current scope of regional governance is a serious obstacle to understanding the architecture of global environmental governance and to overcoming current bottlenecks in international environmental cooperation. In response, we report on the outcome of a descriptive analysis that complements the most comprehensive database on international environmental agreements (iea.uoregon.edu) with variables for analysis at the regional level. We introduce a multidimensional typology of regional agreements based on contiguous/noncontiguous agreement membership, contiguous/noncontiguous spatial ambit, and whether membership and ambit are adjoining and/or coextensive. We discuss the theoretical and empirical relevance of the different types of agreements and the nature and prevalence of special cases. Given the previous lack of research in this area, our primary purpose is to present a systematic account of regional environmental governance, leaving causal analysis to our own and others' future research. Our analysis, nevertheless, helps us to identify a number of knowledge gaps and analytical directions in the conclusion.","[Balsiger, Joerg] Univ Geneva, Dept Geog & Environm, Unimail, 40 Blvd Pont dArve, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Balsiger, Joerg] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Prys, Miriam] German Inst Global & Area Studies, Neuer Jungfernstieg 21, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany",University of Geneva; University of Geneva; German Institute of Global & Area Studies,"Balsiger, J (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Dept Geog & Environm, Unimail, 40 Blvd Pont dArve, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",joerg.balsiger@unige.ch; prys@giga-hamburg.de,"Balsiger, Jörg/B-6273-2009","Balsiger, Jörg/0000-0001-5401-1723; Prys-Hansen, Miriam/0000-0003-0077-368X","GIGA; Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation [IS 0802]","GIGA; Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation","The authors would like to thank Ron Mitchell for providing support with the underlying data for the present analysis, and Ron Mitchell, Stacy VanDeveer, and two anonymous reviewers for their comments on the manuscript.

This transition might not be sustainable, as climate and environmental change have unknown effects on the visitation patterns of outdoor recreationists and tourists. We address this uncertainty by estimating shifts in the demand for outdoor recreation destinations along Minnesota's North Shore region of Lake Superior under a range of projected climatic and environmental conditions. We also employ a finite-mixture modeling approach to capture the preference heterogeneity across North Shore visitors. Our findings indicate projected climate and environmental changes are not likely to significantly affect visitation patterns in the next 20 years. However, utilizing a finite-mixture modeling approach enabled us to identify distinct types of visitors with divergent visitation behaviors under altered climate and environmental conditions. Our findings suggest that the demand for outdoor recreation along the North Shore will be relatively stable in the near future, however different types of visitors will respond to warming winter conditions in divergent ways. Shifting visitation patterns under climate and environmental change may have more drastic alterations to the economic well-being of the region under a longer planning horizon. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To what extent did new entrants in the late nineteenth-century cotton-textile industry threaten the customary markets of the European core? Exploiting a newly constructed dataset on textile imports to Spain, we find that as trade costs fell, new rivals began to sell a greater variety of products. Along this dimension, competition can be said to have increased. In response, producers in Europe adjusted the type and number of goods exported. By 1914, specialization mapped onto endowments of skilled labour, capital, and access to raw materials. While firms in new industrializing countries exported low-end varieties, incumbents in the core shipped high-end goods, unit values increasing with levels of development.","[Betran, Concepcion] Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain; [Huberman, Michael] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",University of Valencia; Universite de Montreal,"Betrán, C (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",,"Betran, Concha/AAB-5233-2019","Betran, Concha/0000-0002-5640-1087","Spanish Ministry of Economy [ECO2009-08791, ECO2012-33337]; McConnell Chair, Universite de Montreal","Spanish Ministry of Economy(Spanish Government); McConnell Chair, Universite de Montreal","Earlier versions of this article benefited from discussion at the Conference on Trade, Poverty, and Growth (Madrid, 2012), World Congress of Cliometrics (Honolulu, 2013), and the Canadian Network in Economic History (Peterborough, Ontario, 2014), and from comments of participants in seminars at the University of Oxford (2013) and Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (2013).

While these models, most notably, the Government-Society-Science and the Hegemonic Politicians models, do provide more holistic pictures of the multiple actors at play and their interactions, the nature of these actor interactions is overly linear, and make them incapable of explaining the numerous processes within complex governance systems. They assume the dominance of a limited number of actors while ignoring various feedback loops. This paper therefore provides a critical review of the Government-Society-Science and the Hegemonic Politicians models. Our alternative perspective is derived from complexity theory as it pertains to water governance. Explaining water governance through the complexity lens highlights the myriad of actors that act within international river basins and the consequences of their actions; something that is lacking within the traditional models. This holds implications not only for decision-making in river basins and water resources management in particular, but also for theoretical developments that feed back into the policy arena. Complexity theory paints a more nuanced picture for the decision maker. We put forward this view using the proposed Epupa Dam on the Kunene River as a case study where various actors interact in the debate around the suggested dam.","[Meissner, Richard] CSIR, POB 395, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Jacobs, Inga] WRC, Private Bag X03, ZA-0031 Gezina, South Africa",Council for Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - South Africa,"Meissner, R (通讯作者)，CSIR, POB 395, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",RMeissner@csir.co.za,"Meissner, Richard/D-6830-2014","Meissner, Richard/0000-0002-6288-5735",South African National Research Foundation,South African National Research Foundation(National Research Foundation - South Africa),"The authors would like to thank Dr. Marius Claassen (CSIR) for the review of earlier drafts as well as two anonymous reviewers for their valuable inputs.

Ecocultures and the politics of knowledge production,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Resilience; Culture; Science-society relations; Ecocultural resilience; Ecocultures; Situating,VULNERABILITY; SCIENCE; CHALLENGES; WORLD; INDIA,"Culture, that for long had been a neglected concept in resilience thinking, has gained prominence in recent times, especially in the notion of ecocultures/ecocultural resilience to be achieved through transdisciplinary projects. In this paper, I conceptualize the relation of science with society and culture that resilience scholars propose as part of a larger agenda of the integration of science with different knowledge and epistemologies. In order to understand how resilience thinking relates to culture, I investigate the culture of resilience itself. Using the lens of cultural and science studies, I go back to the history and context of resilience and transdisciplinarity, examine some of the central tools and concepts in resilience thinking and its entanglements in the politics of the past and present. In light of the discussion, I argue that we need to 'situate' rather than 'integrate' our knowledge production. This entails not only recognizing our own culture but also being open to different ways of knowing and to be able to transgress resilience. Moving away from integration and embracing ambivalence and humility can open up to experimental practices and trading places' in order to engage with nature and others justly. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this paper is to detect some of bacterial contamination in domestic refrigerators. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 104 households were randomly selected from ten health centers in five areas of Tehran, Iran. Visual inspection and temperature evaluation of the households' refrigerators were done. In addition, the refrigerators were swabbed and analyzed for contaminants using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. DNA was isolated and purified by the proposed standard protocol. Findings - Screening of the domestic refrigerators by PCR method showed that 51.7 percent of the samples were positive for pathogens as follows: L. monocytogenes 41.6 percent, S. aureus 5.5 percent, Salmonella spp 4.6 percent, and E. coli O157:H7 0 percent; consequently, none of mentioned pathogens were detected in 48.3 percent of the refrigerators. Results of the visual inspection indicated that 57 percent of the refrigerators were on desirable, 36.5 percent were acceptable, and 7 percent were weak conditions. Most of the refrigerators about 44 percent had desirable temperatures. There were no significant correlations between the visual inspection scores, temperature and frequency of isolation of specific pathogens in the domestic refrigerators. A significant correlation was observed between contamination and education of parents (p < 0.05). Originality/value - Determination of the bacterial contamination and evaluating the temperature of domestic refrigerators in Iran can be considered as a novel approach of current study. These findings could be employed in designing and implementing appropriate educational interventions to promote food safety and diminish the risk of food-borne illnesses. Also, obtained results might be applied as introduction for further investigations.","[Esfarjani, Fatemeh; Alikhanian, Haleh; Khalaji, Niloofar] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Fac Nutr Sci & Food Technol, Natl Nutr & Food Technol Res Inst, Dept Food & Nutr Policy & Planning Res, Tehran, Iran; [Khaksar, Ramin; Khaneghah, Amin Mousavi; Hosseini, Hedayat] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Fac Nutr Sci & Food Technol, Natl Nutr & Food Technol Res Inst, Food Sci & Technol Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Khaneghah, Amin Mousavi] Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Fac Food Engn, Dept Food Sci, Campinas, SP, Brazil",Shahid Beheshti University Medical Sciences; Shahid Beheshti University Medical Sciences; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Hosseini, H (通讯作者)，Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Fac Nutr Sci & Food Technol, Natl Nutr & Food Technol Res Inst, Food Sci & Technol Dept, Tehran, Iran.",hedayat@sbmu.ac.ir,"Mousavi Khaneghah, Amin/A-5925-2012; Esfarjani, Fatemeh/AAG-9441-2022; Esfarjani, Fatemeh/AFL-8925-2022; Mohammadi-Nasrabadi, Fatemeh/AFT-5240-2022","Mousavi Khaneghah, Amin/0000-0001-5769-0004; Esfarjani, Fatemeh/0000-0002-6796-5566; Esfarjani, Fatemeh/0000-0002-6796-5566; Mohammadi-Nasrabadi, Fatemeh/0000-0001-5861-6420","Research Council of National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute; Faculty of Nutrition Science and Food Technology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Parto Sard Tavan (Himalia) company [450.1]; CNPq-TWAS Postgraduate Fellowship [3240274290]","Research Council of National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute; Faculty of Nutrition Science and Food Technology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Parto Sard Tavan (Himalia) company; CNPq-TWAS Postgraduate Fellowship","The authors would like to express thanks to the Research Council of National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute, Faculty of Nutrition Science and Food Technology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran and Parto Sard Tavan (Himalia) company for their financial support (Grant No. 450.1).

Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative approach was applied, based on 17 in-depth interviews with staff from four different institutions. The data collection and analysis were guided by constructivist grounded theory. zFindings - In summary, the authors find that: low differentiation lead to a high level of service variability at the satellite kitchens, high level of optimizing behavior lead to a high level of service variability, there is a positive relationship between food task involvement and access to the information being shared, there is a positive relationship between food task involvement and participation in cooperation activities and when the physical distance between stages in the chain increases, the information sharing will deteriorate. Research limitations/implications - To empirically generalize the findings, this first qualitative study should be followed up by a quantitative study. Practical implications - Based on the findings, the authors suggest that the chains would benefit from improving the interfaces between front line employees, and share information more extensively. The location of the central kitchen seems to influence information sharing across stages in the food chains. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge this is the first study that examines cooperation and information sharing practices within institutional food chains.","[Evensen, Kjersti Berge; Hansen, Havard] Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Evensen, KB (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, Stavanger, Norway.",kjersti.b.evensen@uis.no,,"Berge Evensen, Kjersti/0000-0002-2384-2265",,,,,36,3,4,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This analysis focuses on the expansion of crop and cattle activities, and other determinants of deforestation such as GDP per capita, conservation areas and property rights. We combine standard econometrics with spatial econometrics to capture the socioeconomic interactions among the agents in their interrelated economic system. The data used in this study correspond to a balanced panel of 732 municipalities from 2000 to 2010. The main findings suggest that as openness to trade in the Amazon increases, deforestation also increases. We also find that it is the production of soybeans and beef cattle that drives deforestation in the region. The property rights indicator also has a significant impact in deforestation. Moreover, as the GDP per capita goes up, deforestation increases. The conservation areas have a negative impact on deforestation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In Poland in the years 2012-2015 the balances of the farmers' projections of the general situation of farms and their profitability and the balances of evaluations of the real economic situation were negative. The values of projection balances were always greater compared with the values of the subsequent evaluations. The highest accuracy of projections of the general situation of farms and the production profitability pertained to the direction of the economic situation changes. The indicators of the compatibility of the economic situation balance sign almost always equalled to one. The worst projections concerned the similarity of the tendency of the analysed categories. In most cases, the correlation coefficients of projection and opinion were low or very low.

The reason for writing this paper is that applying single risk communication strategy for public often fails because food risks are systemic risks and public perceptions toward them consist of multiple dimensions. Launching an effective risk communication need to investigate the perception dimensions of the target audience. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 2,673 parents of 3-14-year-old children from the rural area of Sichuan province in China were chosen as target audience. Based on the survey conducted about parents' food risk perceptions, this study used factor-cluster analysis method to segment parents to sub-clusters with significantly different risk perception dimensions. Parents' representative demographic characteristics within each cluster were further identified through cross-tabs analysis with chi(2) tests. Findings - All the parents could be segmented into four sub-clusters, namely, sensitive parents, dependent parents, familiarity-oriented parents and institutional distrust parents, according to their risk perception difference on five dimensions. A series of risk communication strategies were specifically designed for each cluster based on their risk perception features as well as demographic characteristics.

The main hypothesis is that a collective brand has a positive influence on the advertising productivity of its member companies, as it is a collective reputation indicator in experience goods. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology is based on the application of regression models with panel data of companies in a Spanish experience goods industry between 2004 and 2012. The empirical analysis is made in the Spanish winery sector, given the proliferation in the wine market of public collective brands (i.e. protected designation of origin labels). ZFindings - The results show that a company associated with a collective brand has greater advertising productivity than a non-associated company. Advertising productivity is also higher for brands with better individual reputations associated with a collective brand. Moreover, the relative effect of a collective brand on advertising productivity is higher when the company competes in a market with a higher level of competition. Originality/value - The literature has paid little attention to the relationship between collective brand strategy and the advertising productivity of member companies. This study considers that the advertising productivity of companies in collective brands could be explained by the effects derived from the collective brand reputation.","[Mas-Ruiz, Francisco; Sancho-Esper, Franco M.; Sellers-Rubio, Ricardo] Univ Alicante, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant,"Sellers-Rubio, R (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt, Alicante, Spain.",Ricardo.Sellers@ua.es,"Sellers Rubio, Ricardo/H-1932-2015; MAS-RUIZ, FRANCISCO/H-4365-2015; Sancho-Esper, Franco/Q-7320-2017","Sellers Rubio, Ricardo/0000-0002-9108-1904; MAS-RUIZ, FRANCISCO/0000-0002-3342-012X; Sancho-Esper, Franco/0000-0002-6073-1935",,,,,65,1,2,3,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Selected psychographic constructs (i.e. category involvement, domain-specific innovativeness, subjective knowledge, suspicion of novelties and optimistic bias) are tested as segmentation basis with the objective of defining a number of cross-border consumer segments with distinctive and clear-cut profiles in terms of consumer perceptions towards farmed fish. Findings - Based on the consumer psychographic profiles, three distinct segments are found: involved traditional, involved innovators and ambiguous indifferent, of which the first two constitute especially interesting targets for market positioning strategies for aquaculture products. Practical implications - The results of the segmentation analysis opens new horizons in terms of positioning and differentiation of fish products from the aquaculture industry according to the most important potential market segments. Originality/value - The current research brings insights into different pan-European consumer segments and their characteristics that allow for a corresponding differentiation strategy within the aquaculture industry. The fact that the segments tend to be uniform across all countries suggests a relatively homogeneous or converging European fish-related culture.","[Reinders, Machiel J.] LEI Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, The Hague, Netherlands; [Banovic, Marija; Krystallis, Athanasios] Aarhus Univ, MAPP Ctr, Sch Business & Social Sci, Aarhus, Denmark; [Guerrero, Lluis] IRTA Tecnol Alimentos, Dept Food Technol, Monells, Spain",Wageningen University & Research; Aarhus University; IRTA,"Reinders, MJ (通讯作者)，LEI Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, The Hague, Netherlands.",machiel.reinders@wur.nl,"; Reinders, Machiel/F-7355-2015","Banovic, Marija/0000-0003-1452-0165; Reinders, Machiel/0000-0001-8785-2852","European Union [KBBE-2013-07, GA 603121]",European Union(European Union (EU)),"This project has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration (KBBE-2013-07 single stage, GA 603121, DIVERSIFY).",,46,21,21,0,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Results show that, at the margin, congestion effects dominate localized scale externalities in urban counties. A diverse industrial structure and rich human capital are the main factors that contribute to regional disparities in employment growth.

This research presents a hydro-economic model of the Middle-Guadiana basin, Spain, to assess potential effects of climate change on irrigated agriculture and options for adaptation. It combines a farm-based economic optimisation model with the hydrologic model WEAP, and represents the socio-economic, agronomic and hydrologic systems in a spatially-explicit manner covering all dimensions and scales relevant to climate change. Simulated scenarios include a severe A2 climate change scenario up to 2070, two policy-based adaptation scenarios, and autonomous adaptation. Results show that climate change may impact severely irrigation systems reducing water availability and crop yields, and increasing irrigation water requirements. The risk faced by farmers is determined by technology and water use efficiency but also by spatial location and decisions made in neighbouring irrigation areas. The analysis of adaptation strategies underscores the role of current EU water policy in facilitating adaptation. Overall, the applied framework proved to be a useful tool for supporting water and climate change policy-making. It contributes to improve understanding about potential impacts of climate change, multi-scale vulnerability and the scope for adaptation. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Applying this theory requires information on the covariance of uncertain returns between all combinations of the economic options and also assumes that returns are normally distributed. As it is usually difficult to fulfill all data requirements and assumptions, this paper proposes a variant of robust portfolio optimization as an alternative that needs less pre-information. The approach considers future uncertainties in a non-stochastic fashion through possible deviations from the nominal return of land-use alternatives. Maximizing the economic return of the land-use portfolio is conditional on meeting an inclusive set of constraints. These demand that a pre-defined return threshold is achieved by the robust solution for each uncertainty scenario considered. Based on data for eight agricultural crops common in the Ecuadorian lowlands, a comparison with portfolios generated by classical stochastic mean-variance optimization shows greater land-use diversification (through increased Shannon indices), but only moderate expected economic loss of non-stochastic robust land-use portfolios. We conclude that non-stochastic derivation of land-use portfolios is a good alternative to the classical stochastic model, in situations where information on economic input parameters is scarce.

After documenting the close relationship between real GDP per capita and competitiveness, we introduce a production approach to study competitiveness and develop various possible strategies facing a province. In particular, while coastal provinces should consider innovating new technologies and institutions to improve competitiveness, western provinces may adopt a proportional development strategy that simultaneously enhances every aspect of its competitiveness. Further, the proportional development strategy for competitiveness is found to reduce regional disparity. The policy implications from our framework could not have been achieved had the analysis been solely based on the conventional methods of studying the competitiveness index.","[Li, Sung Ko] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Long] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada",Hong Kong Baptist University; University of Alberta,"Li, SK (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",skli@hkbu.edu.hk; lzhao3@ualberta.ca,,"Zhao, Long/0000-0002-9358-7669",,,,,29,9,11,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Mexico was a serial defaulter that established a good reputation and issued bonds abroad at progressively better conditions. Based on new archival material, the article demonstrates that borrowing terms improved not only because of sounder fundamentals, but also due to the efforts of high officials to negotiate with debt underwriters. The Mexicans never accepted a patron bank and used the offers from American banks to bargain with European competitors. They acted according to the government's reputation, the underwriters' status, and the ideology of the Porfirian state.","[Weller, Leonardo] EESP FGV, Sao Paulo Sch Econ, BR-01332000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Weller, L (通讯作者)，EESP FGV, Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Rua Itapeva 474,Sala 1019, BR-01332000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",leonardo.weller@fgv.br,,"Weller, Leonardo/0000-0002-5579-3285",Council for Higher Education of the Brazilian Government (CAPES),Council for Higher Education of the Brazilian Government (CAPES),"I benefited from the thoughtful comments given by Colin Lewis, Stephen Haber, Rui Esteves, Carlos Brando, Joe Francis, Coskun Tuncer, the editor and referees of this JOURNAL, and the participants of the 2013 Economic History Society Conference and the 2014 Congreso Latinoamericano de Historia Economica.

(2013) find that high-income nations are mostly net exporters, not importers, of natural resources, which would seem to contradict the occurrence of ecologically unequal exchange. We take issue, however, with the theoretical conclusions as well as the empirical basis for their conclusions. Not only may a net export of embodied land be contingent on a net import of energy, but a renewed assessment of an updated database even contradicts their empirical findings by suggesting that high-income nations are indeed net importers of embodied land. We challenge the theoretical and methodological assumptions involved and raise the question whether environmentally-extended multi-regional input-output (EEMRIO) analyses are sophisticated and reliable enough to draw such conclusions and if they are able to prove or disprove the occurrence of ecologically unequal exchange. Current research on EEMRIO-based flows of embodied materials, energy, land, and labor in international trade confirms rather than questions the theory of ecologically unequal exchange.
