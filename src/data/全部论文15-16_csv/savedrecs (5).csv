Panel regressions based on the annual action-based datasets of Devries et al. (2011) and Alesina et al. (2014a) show that consolidations, and in particular their unanticipated components, affect confidence negatively. To obtain a more accurate picture of how consolidations affect confidence, we construct a monthly dataset of consolidation announcements, so that we can investigate the confidence effects in real time using an event study. The results suggest that consumer confidence falls around announcements of consolidation measures, an effect likely driven by revenue-based measures. Moreover, these effects are highly relevant for European countries with weak institutional arrangements, as measured by the tightness of fiscal rules or budgetary transparency. The effects on producer confidence are generally similar, but weaker than for consumer confidence. Long-term interest rates, as a measure of confidence in the sovereign, tend to fall around spending-based consolidation announcements. We have no evidence that the confidence effects of consolidation announcements are worse in slumps than in booms. Generally, strengthening institutional arrangements may help in mitigating adverse confidence effects of consolidations.","[Beetsma, Roel] Univ Amsterdam, MN Chair, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; CEPR, London, England; European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; European Central Bank; University of Amsterdam,"Beetsma, R (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, MN Chair, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,48,13,14,1,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

In our model, the real effects of an energy shock are amplified when the monetary authority responds to that shock by changing its inflation objective. Specifically, higher inflation raises households' nominal capital gains taxes since those taxes are not indexed to inflation. The increase in taxes behaves as a negative wealth effect and generates an immediate decline in output, investment, and hours worked. The large drop in investment then causes a gradual but very persistent decline in the capital stock. That protracted decline in the capital stock is associated with an extended period of low labor productivity and high inflation. The real effects from the increase in nominal capital gains taxes are magnified by the tax on nominal interest income, which is also not indexed to inflation. A prolonged period of higher inflation and lower labor productivity following a negative energy shock is consistent with the stagflation of the 1970s. The negative effects, however, subsided greatly after 1980 due to the Volcker disinflation policy which prevented the Fed from accommodating negative energy shocks with higher inflation.

Typical examples occur in the area of corporate governance: firms and investment companies exercise mutual control, in particular by owning each others' stocks. We represent such situations in two equivalent ways: by a function assigning to each coalition the set of controlled players, and by a simple game structure in which for each player a simple game describes who controls that player. These concepts are similar to authority distributions and command games in Hu and Shapley (2003a, 2003b). An mcs is invariant if it incorporates all indirect control relations. We axiomatically develop a class of power indices for invariant mcs. We impose four axioms with a plausible interpretation in this framework, which together characterize a broad class of power indices based on dividends resulting both from exercising and from undergoing control. Extra conditions can further refine this broad class. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We allow marginal tax revenue to be optimally allocated between productive subsidies to human capital and utility-enhancing government consumption and calculate Laffer Curves for the US. Productive government spending yields higher revenue-maximizing tax rates, steeper slopes at low tax rates and higher peaks.

Hansen's primary contribution to the cited work was the development of the generalised method of moments (GMM), a statistical method that has proved such a valuable tool for testing the validity of empirical asset pricing models. The public announcement of the award also acknowledges the wider impact of GMM on empirical analysis in economics and beyond, referring to the 1982 Econometrica paper in which Hansen introduced the method as one of the most influential in econometrics'. In this paper, we reflect on how the GMM-based inference framework has evolved since 1982, reviewing developments on four main issues: model diagnostic testing, moment selection, identification and inference in misspecified models. We also illustrate the broader influence of GMM on econometrics by briefly exploring the connections between GMM and three other estimation methods: indirect inference, moment inequality based techniques, and a group of techniques that can be presented equivalently within either the generalised empirical likelihood or info-metric frameworks.","[Hall, Alastair R.] Univ Manchester, Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Hall, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Econ, SoSS, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",alastair.hall@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,137,19,20,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

Editors choose what to report on based on consumer preferences and the coverage of their competitors. We build a continuous time model that predicts whether news providers invest in covering novel news stories or instead report on popular. We construct a dataset of cover stories to test the model and find that both novelty and popularity are associated with increased sales, but popular stories only have a lifespan of one to two weeks. We find that the impact of novelty has declined since 2006, and the lifespan of a story has shortened. While theory predicts that editors strategically alternate between reporting on novel stories and popular stories, we find evidence of positive serial correlation in the popularity of cover stories. Finally, news outlets often cover the same story. Theory predicts that competitive news outlets are more likely to pool on the stories they cover while news outlets with market power are more likely to separate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Its more ambitious goal, howeverof becoming not only a single trade area, but also a single production base by the year 2015appears elusive. The investment liberalization goals stipulated in the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint, a roadmap for regional economic integration, is meek, indicating unwillingness of member states to open up their cosseted and, at times, lucrative, service sectors. Moreover, current commitments of member states do not even match up with such goals. To be able to establish a regional production base, member states will have to stand up against local interest groups that benefit from the status quo, be they large domestic state and private companies operating in key service sectors such as telecommunications, energy and finance, or professional councils or professional associations that would like to reserve jobs exclusively for their members.

Each way has its own economic pros and cons. As the most crucial point, a counterparty risk and costs of funding are usually mentioned. Contracts traded on the power exchange bear less or no credit risk, as every deal is paired via central counterparty. On the other hand, the power exchange requires a margin deposit and daily profit and loss settlement which might increase funding costs. The fact that the counterparty risk is lower for exchange contracts with higher funding costs is well-known, but rarely quantified. We use the so-called Credit Value Adjustment concept in order to quantify the market value of the credit risk. We compare this value with potential funding costs. The aim of this paper is to compare both the OTC and exchange ways of trading using risk-adjusted economic characteristics.","Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Paholok, I (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic.",paholok@institutee.cz,,,"Czech Science Foundation Market Risk and Financial Derivatives [402/09/0732]; Chovani investicnich instrumentu v kontextu financnich krizi [IG102030, 8/2010]",Czech Science Foundation Market Risk and Financial Derivatives; Chovani investicnich instrumentu v kontextu financnich krizi,"The research has been supported by the Czech Science Foundation Grant No. 402/09/0732 Market Risk and Financial Derivatives.

We isolate common tasks that teams must complete - coordination and cooperation - and model each of them using a simple experimental game that is designed to avoid identification problems. By observing a team's efficiency before and after the firm-level event, we identify the behavioral spillovers of freeriding to team-level cooperation and coordination.

One is collusion in which duopolists of similar size agreed to reduce their supply to the market. The other is unilateral exit by an individual company, which resulted in the asymmetric duopoly with respect to firm size. The analysis demonstrates that even a dominant duopolist cannot maintain sufficient market power to manipulate prices as long as competitive forces are present, while cooperative adjustment in the capacity dimension is likely to lead to higher prices on a sustainable basis. The results confirm the importance of competitive forces for mitigating price hikes in the process of adjustment.","Doshisha Univ, Fac Policy Studies, Kamigyo Ku, Kyoto 6028580, Japan",Doshisha University,"Kawaura, A (通讯作者)，Doshisha Univ, Fac Policy Studies, Kamigyo Ku, Kyoto 6028580, Japan.",akawaura@mail.doshisha.ac.jp,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

While attractive in principle, the approach failed along with other theories to provide empirically convincing results. Over the years, the theory has been extended to a general equilibrium setting and modified to include central bank intervention and non-rational expectations. More recently, it has become a platform for the micro-structural approach emphasizing order flows, which shows increasing promise as an empirical explanation of exchange rate behavior.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Black, SW (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, CB 3305,Gardner Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",swblack@unc.edu,,,,,,,42,2,2,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We summarize the empirical results of a case study of electricity demand in South Korea with three key findings and their related implications. First, the price elasticities of electricity demand differ across usage categories. Specifically, electricity demands for manufacturing and retail uses are price inelastic and close to unit elastic, respectively, while those for agricultural and residential uses are not statistically significant. This information is important in designing energy policy, because higher electricity prices could reduce electricity demands for manufacturing and retail uses, resulting in slower growth in those sectors. Second, spatial spillovers in electricity demand vary across uses. Understanding the spatial structure of electricity demand provides useful information to energy policy makers for anticipating changes in demand across regions via regionally-varying electricity pricing for different uses. Third, simulation results suggest that spatial variations among electricity demands by usage category under a regionally-varying electricity-pricing policy differ from those under a regionally-uniform electricity-pricing policy. Differences in spatial changes between the policies provide information for developing a realistic regionally-varying electricity-pricing policy according to usage category. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We show that organizations in which bosses can fire up to one third of their workforce produce twice as much as organizations for which firing is not possible. Firing threats sharply decrease on-the-job leisure. Nevertheless, organizations endowed with firing threats underperformed those using individual incentives. In the presence of firing threats, employees engage in impression management activities to be seen as hard-working individuals in line with our model.

The trajectories along these two dimensions were quite different across transition economies in the period under scrutiny - this diversity is well mirrored by available indicators, which I use to approach empirically the interaction between that pair of reforms. My estimates suggest that the negative short-run effect of privatisation may be counterweighted by the existence of a system of non-distorted price signals. These results seem to be in broad agreement with previous analyses, which I review briefly. Given the small size of my sample and other possible data issues, particular care is taken when examining the robustness of the findings. While not rejecting earlier explanations (e.g. based on the importance of initial conditions, namely the dimension of inherited distortions in production), this paper offers the suggestion of an additional view on why the so-called transformational recession was deeper in some countries than in others - countries which have privatised without fully liberalising prices may have experienced more economic harm.

Although the agent has a correct prior about events he is aware of and has a clear understanding of his available actions and payoffs, his unawareness may lead him to commit information processing errors and to behave suboptimally. As a result, the value of information can be negative, contrasting what is true in the standard model with partitional information and no unawareness. We show that the source of the agent's suboptimal behavior is that he misunderstands the information revealed by his varying awareness, treating it asymmetrically. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

By this, we mean that different capital structures can occur in equilibrium and that all of them are associated with the same allocation of commodities and the same welfare. We develop a general equilibrium model with two production sectors, risk-averse households, and financial intermediation by banks. Banks are funded by (safe) deposits and (outside) equity and monitor borrowers in lending. Two sets of equilibria emerge. These sets differ with regard to the debt-equity ratios of banks, investment in risky technologies, bank defaults, and whether first-best allocations are attained. Hence, the macroeconomic version of the Modigliani Miller theorem fails to hold. Imposing minimum equity capital requirements, however, eliminates all inefficient equilibria and guarantees the validity of the macroeconomic version of the Modigliani Miller theorem.

The first model emphasises the role of occupational choice in tax compliance, and explores the effect of non-compliance on risk-taking and income distribution. The modelling of the compliance decision is discussed with an emphasis on decision-making under uncertainty and social interaction. We then add to the model a social network which governs the transmission of information on attitudes and beliefs, and investigate alternative audit strategies. A strategy of auditing a fixed number of taxpayers from each occupation dominates alternative strategies (including random and focussed strategies) in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance.","[Hashimzade, Nigar; Myles, Gareth D.; Rablen, Matthew D.] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Hashimzade, Nigar] Univ Durham, Durham, England; [Myles, Gareth D.] Univ Exeter, Dept Econ, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England; [Page, Frank] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN USA; [Rablen, Matthew D.] Brunel Univ London, Uxbridge, Middx, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Durham University; University of Exeter; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Brunel University,"Myles, GD (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Dept Econ, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England.",gdmyles@ex.ac.uk,"Hashimzade, Nigar/AAB-6977-2021; Hashimzade, Nigar/AAC-2436-2019; Rablen, Matthew/Z-4674-2019; Myles, Gareth/R-2976-2019","Hashimzade, Nigar/0000-0003-2035-5020; Rablen, Matthew/0000-0002-3521-096X;",ESRC [ES/K005944/1]; ESRC [ES/K005944/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),Thanks are due to the ESRC for financial support under grant ES/K005944/1.

The first formal stock exchange, the Association of Stockbrokers in Hong Kong, was formed in 1891. However, the activities of the stock exchange are generally regarded as insignificant until the 1970s. Since the 1980s, there have been a number of major reforms and some significant developments. These include the unification of four stock exchanges; the establishment of the Securities and Futures Commission; the closer economic relations with Mainland China; the merger of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Futures Exchange to form the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEx); the launch of the second board (Growth Enterprise Market); and the demutualisation of the HKEx. The Exchange generally responded positively to these reforms and developments. As a result, the Hong Kong stock market experienced significant growth in terms of its market capitalisation ratio, turnover ratio, and the total value traded ratio. Despite the impressive growth in various stock market indicators, however, the Hong Kong stock market still faces some challenges, including regulatory challenges, as well as some concern over its future viability as a global equity hub.","[Ho, Sin-Yu; Odhiambo, Nicholas M.] Univ S Africa, Dept Econ, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Ho, SY (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Dept Econ, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Ho, Sin-Yu/AAH-1637-2021","Ho, Sin-Yu/0000-0003-0032-1616; Odhiambo, Nicholas .M./0000-0003-4988-0259",,,,,37,2,2,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

The network is weighted and directed, and it enables individuals to listen to others' opinions about some exogenous parameter of interest. Agents use Bayesian updating rules. The weight of each link is exogenously given, and it specifies the quality of the corresponding information flow. We explore the effects of the network on the agents' first-order beliefs about the parameter and investigate the aggregation of private information in large societies. We begin by characterizing an agent's limiting beliefs in terms of some entropy-based measures of the conditional distributions available to him from the network. Our results on consensus and correctness of limiting beliefs are in consonance with some of the literature on opinion influence under non-Bayesian updating rules. First, we show that the achievement of a consensus in the society is closely related to the presence of prominent agents who are able to crucially change the evolution of other agents' opinions over time. Secondly, we show that the correct aggregation of private information is facilitated when the influence of the prominent agents is not very high.","CIDE, Div Econ, Mexico City 01210, DF, Mexico",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

In this case, the opportunity cost of time equals the wage plus returns to work experience. This has several interesting consequences: First, the data appear consistent with larger labor supply elasticities than prior work suggests. Second, contrary to conventional wisdom, permanent tax changes can have larger effects on current labor supply than temporary changes. Third, human capital dampens responses of young workers to transitory tax changes. Fourth, labor supply elasticities increase with age. Fifth, human capital amplifies the effect of permanent tax changes in the long run.","[Keane, Michael P.] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Keane, Michael P.] CEPAR, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Keane, Michael P.] UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Oxford; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Keane, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,"Keane, Michael/R-6329-2019; Keane, Michael/O-2840-2013","Keane, Michael/0000-0002-3918-1377","Australian Research Council [FF0561843, FL110100247]; AFTS Secretariat of the Australian Treasury; Australian Research Council [FF0561843, FL110100247] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); AFTS Secretariat of the Australian Treasury; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This article was presented as the Cowles Lecture at the 2011 North American Summer Meetings of the Econometric Society.

The most frequently used error-correction model is examined in detail and we find that the prices return to their equilibrium value much more slowly than would be typical for the error-correction model. Such dynamics is usually referred to as the Joseph effect. The standard procedure is shown to be troublesome and we introduce two new tests to investigate possible asymmetry in the price adjustment to equilibrium under these complicated time series characteristics. On the dataset of seven national gasoline prices, we find no statistically significant asymmetry. The proposed methodology is not limited to the gasoline and crude oil case but it can be utilized for any asymmetric adjustment analysis. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines China's growth slowdown since 2008 up to 2013 using a growth accounting model in a systematic way. It is found that China's growth slowdown since 2008 almost completely comes from a sharp slowdown in total factor productivity growth. During this period, the positive effect on growth from expanding investment has been completely offset by the negative effect of the slowdown in total factor productivity growth. Currently, China's economy has slid into the Solow downward path. Under these circumstances, a soft landing is completely infeasible. Unless the Chinese Government implements substantial rebalancing and comprehensive and in-depth market-oriented reform, accompanied by large-scale de-investment (decreasing in the ratio of investment in GDP) and massive employment adjustment, China will be unable to avoid the Solow downward path, and a hard landing in investment will be inevitable in the near future.","Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Lai, PY (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",pi_lai@hotmai.com,,,,,,,20,9,10,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2015,23.0,3,,,,,42,58,,10.1111/cwe.12113,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CI1IY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354498400003,0

Following a hike in energy prices that started in 2004, the problem of energy affordability for low-income households entered the political debate with the Grenelle de l'environnement in 2007. According to the standard UK definition (more than 10% of income spent on domestic energy) 3.8 million households were subject to fuel poverty in France in 2006 however, this is according to one precise computation and other computations may offer differing conclusions. We question the way fuel poverty is currently measured and compare the impact of different existing measurement approaches on the extent and composition of fuel poverty in France. We then identify fuel vulnerable households as those households that are not ordinarily poor when considering income net of housing costs, but turn poor because of their domestic fuel expenses. A logit, a C log-log and a mixed effect logit model are used to analyse which factors influence the probability of being fuel vulnerable. Data analysis indicates that the proportion of fuel poor people and their characteristics differ significantly depending on the fuel poverty measure chosen. The econometric results show that the probability of being fuel vulnerable is higher for those who are retired, living alone, rent their home, use an individual boiler for heating, cook with butane or propane and have poor roof insulation.

One of the important features in this paper is that spillovers operate in the R&D stage and are tied to the degree of product substitutability as well as the extent of technological proximity/alienation of the research paths leading to cost reduction. Using this feature, the paper tries to explore and compare four separate organization setups (Full Competition, Semi-collusion in Production, Semi-collusion in R&D and Full Collusion). It is found that under technological proximity, competitions at the upstream stage depress R&D investment, and firms colluding in R&D regardless of their production strategy always yield more profit and generate higher social welfare than firms colluding in output; under technological alienation, R&D cooperation may reduce firms' interest to invest in R&D, and it is possible that firms in the Full Collusion regime produce most and generate the highest level of social welfare.","Huaqiao Univ, Res Ctr Appl Stat & Big Data, Inst Quantitat Econ, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China",Huaqiao University,"Zhao, K (通讯作者)，Huaqiao Univ, Res Ctr Appl Stat & Big Data, Inst Quantitat Econ, 668 Jimei Ave, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China.",kai.zhao@hotmail.fr,,,,,,,19,7,8,1,23,CENTRO INVESTIGACION & DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS-CIDE,CIUDAD DE MEXICO,"CARR MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, SANTA FE, ALTAVISTA, CIUDAD DE MEXICO, ALVARO OBREGON, MEXICO",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

We stress the role of favorable tax treatment of housing in matching these facts. We then use the model to account for the foreclosure crisis in terms of three shocks: overbuilding, financial frictions and foreclosure delays. The financial friction shock accounts for much of the house price decline while the foreclosure delays account for bulk of the rise in foreclosures. The scale of the foreclosure crisis might have been smaller if mortgage interest payments were not tax deductible. Temporarily higher inflation might have lowered the foreclosure rate as well.

We propose a unified theory of such institutional changes, where the dynamics of income distribution are the driving force. We characterize the marriage-market equilibrium in each of the three alternative regimes, and determine which one emerges as a political equilibrium, depending on the state of the economy. In a two-class society, a rise in the share of rich males drives the change from polygyny to monogamy. The introduction of serial monogamy follows from a further rise in the proportion of either rich females or rich males. Monogamy eases the transition to serial monogamy, since it promotes social mobility.","[De La Croix, David] IRES, London, England; [De La Croix, David] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium; [Mariani, Fabio] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Louvain, Belgium; [Mariani, Fabio] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"De La Croix, D (通讯作者)，IRES, London, England.",,"de la Croix, David/E-4677-2013",,Belgian French-speaking community (ARC) [09-14018],Belgian French-speaking community (ARC),"The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Belgian French-speaking community (ARC conventions 09-14018 on Sustainability).

To investigate this question, we employ an equilibrium asset-pricing approach, which suggests a non-arbitrage condition on the rent-to-price ratio. This ratio should be equal to the difference between the user cost of housing capital and the expected appreciation in house prices. Using a novel micro-level data set on pair-wise matched price-to-rent ratio collected in the fourth quarter of 2013, and forecasting the expected house price appreciation based on fundamental factors, our empirical exercises do not suggest the existence of a house price bubble at the national level.

In particular, it is generally viewed that the size distribution of the banking sector has changed where it is dominated by a small number of large institutions. In this paper, we develop a model of imperfectly competitive banks that differ in terms of the size of their deposit base. Such differences are important for aggregate credit market activity and the effects of monetary policy. Notably, we explain how the optimal size distribution of the banking system involves trade-offs from distortions in credit markets due to imperfect competition across banking markets. Second, the effects of monetary policy on credit market activity are weaker in an economy dominated by a small number of large banks. Empirical analysis examining the role of concentration among the current members of the European Monetary Union is consistent with the predictions of the model. (C) 2015 Elsevier BM.

This increase has implications for understanding global liquidity and monetary policy transmission. We analyse the links between US monetary policy, leverage and flows into bond funds, on the one hand, and dollar credit extended to non-US borrowers, on the other. Prior to the crisis, global banks drew on low US dollar funding rates and easy leveraging to extend dollar credit to non-US borrowers. After the Federal Reserve announced its large-scale bond purchases in 2008, however, investors responded to compressed long-term US Treasury rates by buying higher yielding dollar bonds from non-US issuers. Thus, US unconventional monetary policy contributed to shifting the balance of dollar credit transmission from global banks to global bond investors.","[McCauley, Robert N.; McGuire, Patrick; Sushko, Vladyslav] Bank Int Settlements, Basel, Switzerland",Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"McCauley, RN (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Basel, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,63,63,70,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

We explore the differences in competition over time and across regions to examine the relationship in an environment wherein the hospital industry is largely state owned, the price of medical care is partially regulated, and hospitals can compete on both quality and cost. Using provincial- and individual-level data, along with a set of outcome indicators, we find that hospital competition is significantly correlated with lower observation room mortality, shorter outpatient waiting time, and fewer outpatient costs, while we do not find evidence that would suggest negative influences of competition on the other measures of hospital performance. Our results offer new evidence in support of competition-based reforms in China's health care sector and provide implications for other developing countries facing similar health care challenges.

The analysis focuses on the impacts of IPRs on the growth gap between countries using a catch-up model and USPTO database. The empirical results show that the strengthening of IPRs has a positive impact on innovation in developed and developing countries in Asia, while we fail to find evidence in Latin America. Secondly, similar to assertions made by De Long and Summers (1991) and Dowrick and Nguyen (1989), investment in fixed capital plays a critical role in growth gap dynamics. What needs to be emphasized here is the cumulative causal relationship between investment and growth: investment in fixed capital improves productivity and encourages economic growth thereby triggering even more investment. This paper confirms that the strengthening of IPRs and investment in fixed capital contribute to the widening of the economic development gap for the 1980-2005 period.","[Seo, Hwan-Joo] Hanyang Univ, Div Business Adm, Ansan 426791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Kim, Han Sung] Ajou Univ, Dept Econ, Suwon 443749, South Korea; [Lee, Young Soo] Korea Aerosp Univ, Dept Business Adm, Koyang 412791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Hanyang University; Ajou University; Korea Aerospace University,"Seo, HJ (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Div Business Adm, 1271 Sa 1 Dong, Ansan 426791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",seohwan@hanyang.ac.kr,,,,,,,53,2,2,1,25,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The standard solution concept for such games is Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), but it is well known that MPE computation becomes intractable as the number of players increases. We instead consider the notion of stationary equilibrium (SE), where players optimize assuming the empirical distribution of others' states remains constant at its long run average. We make two main contributions. First, we provide a rigorous justification for using SE. In particular, we provide a parsimonious collection of exogenous conditions over model primitives that guarantee existence of SE, and ensure that an appropriate approximation property to MPE holds, in a general model with possibly unbounded state spaces. Second, we draw a significant connection between the validity of SE, and market structure: under the same conditions that imply SE exist and approximates MPE well, the market becomes fragmented in the limit of many firms. To illustrate this connection, we study in detail a series of dynamic oligopoly examples. These examples show that our conditions enforce a form of decreasing returns to larger states; this yields fragmented industries in the SE limit. By contrast, violation of these conditions suggests increasing returns to larger states and potential market concentration. In that sense, our work uses a fully dynamic framework to also contribute to a longstanding issue in industrial organization: understanding the determinants of market structure in different industries.

INEQUALITY; INCOME; OPPORTUNITIES; EQUALITY; HEALTH; INVESTMENT; EDUCATION,"This paper evaluates the impact of human capital endowments on measured inequality in Cameroon. We first estimate determinants of household economic well-being (HEW) in which human capital endowments are considered as endogenous effort-related regressors, while controlling for exogenous circumstance-related variables. Second, we simulate alternative counterfactual distributions of HEW: one in which human capital endowments are equalized; and the other in which variations are entirely attributable to the unobservable terms. Finally we compare inequality in the factual distribution of household well-being with inequality in each of the simulated distributions. Direct and indirect exogenous opportunity-inducing circumstances are inequality-augmenting, whereas human capital endowments are inequality-reducing in the actual distribution. Education and health interventions will ameliorate well-being and mitigate inequality. Thus, leveling the playing ground for individuals to have equitable exposure to education, health and labor market participation is required for a low-income country like Cameroon to enhance equity and sustainable household economic growth.","[Baye, Francis Menjo; Epo, Boniface Ngah] Univ Yaounde II, Yaounde, Cameroon",,"Epo, BN (通讯作者)，Univ Yaounde II, Fac Econ & Management, POB 1365, Yaounde, Cameroon.",epongahb@yahoo.fr,"Baye, Francis/AAH-3336-2021",,,,,,61,7,7,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Using the common correlated effects panel estimation techniques, we also systematically examine uncertain transmission channel of the world energy price volatility on the aggregate economic activity in each economy and obtain the most impressive negative effects in Turkey, PR China and India, respectively.","[Bilgin, Mehmet Huseyin] Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, TR-34700 Istanbul, Turkey; [Gozgor, Giray] Dogus Univ, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey; [Karabulut, Gokhan] Istanbul Univ, TR-34452 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Medeniyet University; Dogus University; Istanbul University,"Gozgor, G (通讯作者)，Dogus Univ, Zeamet Sk 21, TR-34722 Istanbul, Turkey.",mehmet.bilgin@medeniyet.edu.tr; ggozgor@dogus.edu.tr; gbulut@istanbul.edu.tr,"Bilgin, Mehmet Huseyin/K-6487-2017; Karabulut, gökhan/AAL-5666-2020; Gozgor, Giray/K-1372-2017","Karabulut, gökhan/0000-0002-8533-3554; Gozgor, Giray/0000-0003-1238-8105; Bilgin, Mehmet Huseyin/0000-0002-9897-9792",Research Fund of the Istanbul Medeniyet University [SUY-2013-405],Research Fund of the Istanbul Medeniyet University(Istanbul Medeniyet University),This work was supported by Research Fund of the Istanbul Medeniyet University.

Reading his Essay today, however, the reasons for his centrality are less clear. Looking forward from 1939, we see that the main stream of economic growth theory is built on neoclassical distribution theory rather than on the Keynesian principles Harrod deployed.

Product liability rules, used to promote quality of service throughout the economy, might seem to offer a solution to this problem in the utility context Strict liability rules avoid the need for determining whether utilities were appropriately careful but increase ratepayer costs because of moral hazard and, in effect, force ratepayers to buy outage insurance from the utility. By leaving customers exposed to damage, negligence rules can avoid these shortcomings but force upon regulators and courts the need to make difficult decisions regarding efficient care levels. Profit regulation, risk aversion, regulatory commitment failures, and distributional considerations add further complications. Still, the consideration of liability rules may provide worthwhile reminders that increased reliability is neither free nor guaranteed by public provision of service. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A large fraction - approximately 2/3 - of the reporting households indicated that they would not consider subscribing to broadband at any price. For the remaining households who indicated that they would consider subscribing, we find strong evidence in the data of over-reporting at high values of the willingness to pay for broadband. We correct for reporting bias using a semi-parametric procedure. Our estimate of the price elasticity of demand for broadband using the bias-corrected willingness to pay values is equal to -0.62, markedly different from the estimate of -0.95 obtained with the values reported by the survey respondents. Our estimates indicate that, on average, to achieve a 10% increase in subscribership, a price reduction of about 15% is needed.

We investigate the hypothesis that industries with high adaptive capacity (measured by their relative level of labour compensation) are able to mitigate the adverse effects of energy tax rises better than others. We identify the pro-adaptation effect by interacting wage levels (a proxy for human capital) with energy taxes. We find that the negative marginal effect of higher energy taxes on TFP and net trade is significantly reduced for industries with stronger human capital and even turns to an overall positive effect in at least two cases. Up to three low-wage sectors display an overall negative effect. This suggests that human capital is key to adaptation to higher energy costs and climate policy, in some cases making it a win-win.

We find some support for the Glode hypothesis in surviving Australian wholesale funds. High-fee surviving Australian wholesale funds perform relatively strongly in both weak economic conditions and unconditionally. High-fee funds in other types of Australian mutual funds generally do not perform strongly either in weak economic conditions or unconditionally. Amongst low-fee funds, we commonly find that those that perform well unconditionally and well in weak economic conditions do charge more than those that perform well unconditionally and poorly in weak economic conditions.

Sanctions are generally put to strip the target country from its available rents and weaken the government's stance against growing discontent in the population. We show however that sanctions may give legitimacy to an incumbent government by influencing the optimal level of religious ideology provided by the state and further stabilizing its grip to power and rents. While in a good state of nature sanctions build resilience as long as religious ideology among the population is strong, at bad times they compel the target country to move towards ideological moderation. In a world of asymmetric information, the target country always finds it optimal to send a signal that truly represents the prevailing state of nature in order to induce learning and reach a win-win outcome.

Public Econ. 17, 213-240 (1982) model of optimal non-linear taxation it is shown that when the utility function relating to consumption is logaritmic the shadow price of the incentive constraint relating to the optimal tax problem exactly equals the Gini coefficient of the second-best optimal income distribution of a utilitarian government. In this sense the optimal degree of income redistribution is determined by the severity of the incentive problem facing the policy-maker. Extensions of the benchmark model to allow for more general functional forms of the utility function and for more than two types of workers reveal that also in these cases the desired degree of income redistribution is positively correlated with the shadow prices of the incentive constraints.","[Rasmussen, Bo Sandemann] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Rasmussen, BS (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",brasmussen@econ.au.dk,,"Rasmussen, Bo Sandemann/0000-0002-5885-1292",,,,,6,0,0,1,12,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

For farm households, under labour market imperfections, such decisions are often interlinked. This calls for non-separable agricultural household models. According to this framework, second-order (or behavioural) effects include a direct (i.e., supply or demand reactions due to an exogenous shock) and an indirect (i.e., supply or demand adjustments to the endogenous variations in the shadow wage generated by the exogenous shock) component. Under large price changes or following structural interventions, such as those concerning land redistribution or mechanisation practices, neglecting such second-order effects on consumption and production can bias the final impact on household welfare. The main objective of this study is thus to develop a robust and comprehensive tool to evaluate the effect on household welfare of different agricultural policies in Tanzania and food price changes. A two-stage estimation strategy is adopted: the shadow price of labour is first estimated and then used to estimate production and demand systems as well as labour market functions. These models are subsequently used to simulate the effect on household welfare of a hypothetical 40% increase in the price of cereals and other crops and a hypothetical 10% increase in the hectares of arable land and in the use of ox-ploughs. The results are finally compared with the case in which a separable model is adopted.","[Tiberti, Luca] Univ Laval, Ctr Interuniv Risque Polit Econ & Emploi, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Tiberti, Luca] Univ Laval, Partnership Econ Policy, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Tiberti, Marco] Univ Florence, I-50127 Florence, Italy",Laval University; Laval University; University of Florence,"Tiberti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Ctr Interuniv Risque Polit Econ & Emploi, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",luca.tiberti@ecn.ulaval.ca,,"Tiberti, Luca/0000-0003-2305-6704",,,,,39,6,7,0,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The paper develops various bivariate GARCH models for regional and global returns: BEKK, constant correlation and dynamic correlation. The specification tests are used to choose between the models with and without asymmetric effects. The estimated innovations for the regional and global returns are then used as input for the univariate volatility spillover model which allows the unexpected returns of any particular GCC stock market to be driven by three sources of shocks: local, regional from Saudi Arabia and global from US. We find significant return spillover effects from Saudi Arabia and US to GCC markets. Trade, turnover and institutional quality have significant impacts on regional volatility spillovers from Saudi Arabia to GCC markets.

This paper investigates the gravity of the problems related to NTBs in Korea by surveying the assessments of Korea's trading partners on the issue. Based on the field data collected from six trading partners of Korea, we find that the Korean government has applied NTBs to protect specific sectors such as automobiles, animal-based products, and plants. Moreover, the potential protective intention of the Korean government towards other sectors like organic food, alcoholic products, pharmaceutical products, and service sectors including banking, insurance, telecommunication, and media is well noted, which has not been discussed in previous studies. The Korean government needs to consider how to eliminate de facto trade obstacles by simplifying complex import application procedures, harmonizing standards with international systems, and pursuing trade liberalization through continued domestic reforms. The transparency of the distributive system, licensing and administrative measures still needs to be improved. As the procedural hurdles of agricultural trade draw unremitting attention of Korea's trading partners, quarantine restrictions due to ambiguous long import application procedures, fumigation requirements, and residual restrictions also need to be based on global norms.","[Heo, Yoon] Sogang Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Zhang, Wen] Acad Korean Studies, Songnam, South Korea",Sogang University; Academy of Korean Studies,"Heo, Y (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",hury@sogang.ac.kr; zhangwen@aks.ac.kr,,,,,,,33,1,1,0,7,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

In addition, we use a Bayesian algorithm to analyze a large number of competing models. Among the explanatory variables, we include a nonlinear function of inflation that allows for threshold effects. We use an unbalanced panel data set of 27 Asian developing countries over the period 1980-2009. Our empirical evidence on the determinants of growth suggests that an economy's investment ratio is positively correlated to growth, whereas government consumption expenditure and terms of trade are negatively correlated. We also find evidence of a nonlinear relationship between inflation and economic growth, that is, inflation impedes economic growth when it exceeds 5.43% but does not have any significant effect on growth below that level.

This improvement is ascribed to firms' better alignment of product lines with consumer preferences, to expanded consumer choice, and to a limited rise in prices.

As a response to the trade collapse in the global crisis of 2008 and 2009, temporary trade restrictions have emerged in several countries. With analyzing the dynamics of a negative macroeconomic shock in the home economy first, and the subsequent introduction of trade restrictions in the foreign economy second, I show that both economies are in a worse position than they were during the economic downturn. The follow-ups to the recession and trade restrictions are investigated through three mechanisms: (1) variable markup as a new avenue of increasing competitive pressure for producers (e.g. more competitive firms lower their markups); (2) average individual firms' specific productivity cut-off, which induces their optimum export choice (e.g. an increase in the export productivity cut-off means exporting becomes more difficult than before.); and (3) the movement of international relative prices (e.g. the real exchange rate and terms of trade).","Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80204 USA",Children's Hospital Colorado; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus,"Moon, S (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80204 USA.",soojae.moon@ucdenver.edu,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Using a two-sector endogenous growth model where the interactions between health, education, and the environment are taken into account, we show that revenue-positive tax reforms combined with a change in the public spending structure may improve long-run growth and welfare. However, this outcome incurs relatively high welfare cost during the transition phase. This is particularly the case when the spending policy favors education spending. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using Bayesian techniques, we estimate a two-country DSGE model that distinguishes between Eurozone core and peripheral countries and accounts for national heterogeneities and a set of real, nominal and financial frictions. We find evidence of the key role of this cross-border channel as an amplifying mechanism in the diffusion of asymmetric shocks. Our model also reveals that under banking globalization, most national variables and the central bank interest rate are less sensitive to financial shocks while investment and current account imbalances are more sensitive to financial shocks. Finally, a counterfactual analysis shows that cross-border lending has affected the transmission of the recent financial crisis between the two groups of countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Quarterly time-series data were collected from nine provinces in South Africa for different house-size categories over the period of 1978.Q1 to 2012.Q4. Whereas other panel-based unit-root tests are joint tests of a unit root for all members of a panel and are incapable of determining the mix of integrated of order zero (I(0)) series and integrated of order one (I(1)) series in a panel setting, the SPSM proposed by Chortareas and Kapetanios (2009) can clearly identify how many and which series in the panel are stationary processes by classifying a whole panel into a group of stationary and nonstationary series. The empirical results from several panel-based, as well as standard pure time-series, unit-root tests, indicate that house prices for the nine provinces studied here are either stationary or nonstationary. However, results from the SPSM using the panel version of the Kapetanios et al. (KSS, 2003) test with a Fourier function unequivocally indicate that house prices are stationary for the nine provinces under study.

We argue that these two features are due to the local nature of the approximation and we show that they survive even when second or third order local approximations are used. However, these features disappear when debt limits and the associated precautionary motives are taken into account by a standard, global solution method. We subsequently investigate whether this qualitative difference has significant quantitative implications regarding the linear solution as an approximation to the model's equilibrium dynamics. Policy function differences between the local and global solutions can be large and remain significant even in the case of debt limits as loose as the natural debt limit. These differences can lead to significant discrepancies in implied simulated second moments. In a benchmark calibration, the cross-country correlation of consumption is 0.61 under linearization, but only 0.38 when a policy iteration algorithm is used.","[Anagnostopoulos, Alexis; Tang, Xin] SUNY Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook,"Anagnostopoulos, A (通讯作者)，SUNY Stony Brook, 100 Nicolls Rd, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",alexis.anagnostopoulos@stonybrook.edu,,"Anagnostopoulos, Alexis/0000-0002-5028-6743",,,,,41,0,0,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

One such issue is the pricing of these insurance packages and whether or not the reimbursements will cover necessary services. Therefore, policy concerns exist that increasing the number of insured individuals may not curtail costs. Conversely, providers may not wish to treat patients covered by excessively frugal plans such as Medicaid; hence the trade-offs between access and cost control. In this article, we present findings from a cost function and a productivity approach to determine the marginal cost of providing inpatient hospital care for hospitals operating in Florida during 2005. Using these methodological approaches, we are able to use the marginal rate of transformation to determine the relative marginal costs while controlling for hospital technical and allocative inefficiency. Our work differs from earlier articles as we avoid the Greene problem for cross-sectional models through a two-step approach.

We find that Mexico's welfare increases by 1.31%, U.S.'s welfare increases by 0.08%, and Canada's welfare declines by 0.06%. We find that intra-bloc trade increases by 118% for Mexico, 11% for Canada, and 41% for the U.S. We show that welfare effects from tariff reductions are reduced when the structure of production does not take into account intermediate goods or input-output linkages.

We show that minor modifications of the neoclassical model go a long way toward accounting for the capital accumulation path of the South Korean economy.

In a closed economy, a decrease in competition negatively affects a country's welfare and reallocates factors from low marginal cost sectors to high marginal cost sectors. However, in an open economy with trade liberalization, the properties of factor reallocation give a country the incentive to adopt a beggar-thy-neighbor policy, which decreases its competition level and maximizes its own welfare under certain conditions. Hence, international coordination of competition policies could possibly increase both world welfare and trade.","[Liu, Dingming] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Chen, Pu] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Renmin University of China,"Liu, DM (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, 422 Siming South Rd, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",puchen@ruc.edu.cn; dmliu@xmu.edu.cn,,"Liu, Dingming/0000-0001-5520-0526",,,,,15,0,0,1,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Unlike most previous studies, we address the problem of endogeneity of the remittance variable. The pattern of remittance inflows within the periods under review suggests that the effect of remittance might not be the same across time periods, and a standard empirical test confirms this dynamic. Ignoring this dynamic, a pooled model reveals that remittance inflows have no effect on economic growth. However, when we account for the dynamics and estimate separate models accordingly, allowing for the effect of remittance to vary across sub-periods, we find that the positive effect of remittance inflows was not only marginally bigger when compared to the pooled model, but it also became important for economic growth. Though relevant for growth, it is worth noting that remittance is not yet a major source of economic growth as the effect is still quite marginal.","[Eigbiremolen, God'stime Osekhebhen; Nnetu, Vivian Ikwuoma] Univ Nigeria, Dept Econ, Nsukka, Nigeria",University of Nigeria,"Eigbiremolen, GO (通讯作者)，Univ Nigeria, Dept Econ, Nsukka, Nigeria.",,,,,,,,41,2,2,0,5,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

This article is the first in tourism literature to test separately the determinants of vertically and horizontally differentiated services, using the most recent models in the theory of IIT. We examine bilateral trade among all trading partners of the sample of European countries, covering the period from 2000 to 2008. We show that differences in gross domestic product per capita and the income-distribution overlap, as well as cultural proximity, are the most significant driving forces behind VIIT for European countries. Geographic distance has a negative effect, whereas specific tourism endowments and relative size of the economies are less conclusive. These results confirm theory predictions and most of the empirical findings related to the pattern of VIIT for the manufacturing sector. As expected, we find that determinants of VIIT cannot explain horizontal intra-industry trade in tourism. We suggest two alternative methods of estimation: generalized least squares logistic function and the fractional logit estimator. We conclude that there are common factors explaining IIT in the manufacturing and tourism trades.","[Hanna, J.; Levi, L.; Petit, S.] Univ Valenciennes & Hainaut Cambresis, IDP, Valenciennes, France; [Petit, S.] Univ Lille, EQUIPPE, Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite Polytechnique Hauts-de-France; Universite de Lille,"Petit, S (通讯作者)，Univ Valenciennes & Hainaut Cambresis, IDP, Valenciennes, France.",sylvain.petit@univ-valenciennes.fr,"Petit, Sylvain/AGF-1646-2022","Petit, Sylvain/0000-0003-3391-5285",,,,,43,6,6,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This is carried out through a wide, in-depth, and structured examination of published scholarly papers. In recent decades, sustainable tourism has been one of the most significant subjects among academics and practitioners. In this paper, a classification scheme and a comprehensive literature review are presented in order to clarify, categorise, and interpret the current research on sustainable tourism definitions and applications. The classification scheme for this review contains 132 scholarly papers from 47 journals since the year 1993 up to 2013 categorised into 14 application areas. The five major topics are Paradigm, Sustainable Tourism Development, Market research and Economic, Policy-making, and Infrastructure. The scholarly papers are also sorted by (we suggest using the exact order used later in the paper) (1) year of publication; (2) publication journal; (3) subject area citations. It is hoped that this paper provides the needs of researchers and practitioners with easy references for sustainable tourism and its definitions and applications, and also presents future research opportunities.","[Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz; Maknoon, Reza] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Technol Foresight Grp, Dept Management Sci & Technol, POB 1585-4413, Tehran, Iran; [Hashemkhani Zolfani, Sarfaraz] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Futures Studies Res Inst, Tehran, Iran; [Sedaghat, Maedeh] Res Inst Shakhes Pajouh, Dept Management, Esfahan, Iran; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Inst Internet & Intelligent Technol, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Amirkabir University of Technology; Amirkabir University of Technology; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Hashemkhani Zolfani, S (通讯作者)，Amirkabir Univ Technol, Technol Foresight Grp, Dept Management Sci & Technol, POB 1585-4413, Tehran, Iran.",sa.hashemkhani@gmail.com,"Zolfani, Sarfaraz Hashemkhani/AAA-9918-2021; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018","Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X",,,,,186,123,134,12,72,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We derive the conditions for this improvement using Representative-Consumer and Children-for-Representative-Consumers efficiency criteria in the endogenous fertility setting (see Michel and Wigniolle, 2007). The result crucially depends on the relative amount of accumulated government debt in the economy. When the elasticity of interest rates to child benefit is close to zero and when there exists vast accumulated debt in the economy, financing child benefit programs by issuing debt and using lump-sum tax leads to Representative-Consumer-improvements.

Whereas the earlier literature often concluded that aggregate labor supply elasticities were small, we argue that recent work using structural models and micro data credibly supports large aggregate elasticities. We focus on three issues. First, earlier analyses abstracted from several key features, including human capital accumulation, that severely negatively biased estimates of a key preference parameter. Second, failure to understand that aggregate labor supply adjustments can occur along both the hours per worker and employment margins has led economists to misinterpret the implications of preference parameters for aggregate labor supply. Third, structural estimation of models that feature choice along the extensive margin using micro data typically finds large responses.","[Keane, Michael] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Rogerson, Richard] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",University of Oxford; Princeton University,"Keane, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",michael.keane@nuffield.ox.ac.uk; rdr@princeton.edu,"Keane, Michael/R-6329-2019; Keane, Michael/O-2840-2013","Keane, Michael/0000-0002-3918-1377",,,,,81,30,34,0,9,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4607-2,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

The processes are constantly changing and continue to drive and provide opportunities and open new possibilities for e-government development. The evolution of society requires public administrations to tackle many new challenges and changes. All these evolutionary changes demand the further development of government solutions to meet the challenges and new adequate requirements. After the solution is developed, it must be assessed whether those requirements have been met. As the e-government is constantly evolving all around the world this evolution is regularly measured and tracked by public institutions, private agencies and researchers. There are a number of published research papers on models that aim to evaluate e-government but most of them are focused on some particular purposes and objectives, types of evaluation perspectives. However, there is no evaluation model that could be directly adapted to e-government development in each country or each organization or each service in the country. In this paper, we aim to combine the analyzed models into a conceptual model that could provide a common framework for future research in the area of e-government assessment and a common point of reference in this area. For this purpose, a reference model for e-government monitoring, evaluation and benchmarking is proposed. The model is not associated with any particular e-government definition and/or model, evaluation purpose, dimension or criterion. It could be adapted to many specific cases in the process of design of specific models for monitoring, evaluation or benchmarking of e-government or e-government service.","[Ostasius, Egidijus; Laukaitis, Algirdas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Ostasius, E (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",egidijus.ostasius@vgtu.lt; algirdas.laukaitis@vgtu.lt,,,,,,,66,8,9,0,29,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

If the switch point is expressed in calendar time, TSE discounting captures time consistent behaviour. If it is expressed in waiting time, TSE discounting captures time invariant behaviour.

It begins by introducing essential concepts including domestic terrorism, transnational terrorism, defensive actions, proactive countermeasures, and guerrilla warfare. Three terrorist event databases, used by seven of the articles, are briefly introduced. These data sets are then used to display some stylized facts about domestic and transnational terrorism during the past four decades. Next, some essential strategic distinctions are drawn between defensive and proactive measures in the case of transnational terrorism when multiple countries are confronted by a common terrorist group. These strategic concerns vanish for domestic terrorism as a central government is able to internalize potential externalities. Finally, the key findings of the articles in the special issue are highlighted in two tables.","Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Richardson, TX 75080 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Sandler, T (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",tsandler@utdallas.edu,,,Vibhooti Shukla Endowment; Center for Global Collective Action at the University of Texas at Dallas,Vibhooti Shukla Endowment; Center for Global Collective Action at the University of Texas at Dallas,"The Vibhooti Shukla Endowment and the Center for Global Collective Action at the University of Texas at Dallas funded the May 2014 Conference on Terrorism and Counterterrorism Policy, where these articles along with others were initially presented.",,72,32,49,4,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

In this paper, we examine how physical proximity influences a firm's future productivity and its survival possibility. Our results indicate that a firm located in a region with a higher median total factor productivity (TFP) gains higher productivity from other firms in the same region. One possible explanation is that such a firm has more opportunity to access superior external knowledge and to produce more new ideas. Our results also indicate these productivity-enhancing characteristics do not seem to be industry-specific. Finally, we find that high productivity firms are the only significant sources of knowledge spillovers, suggesting that firms benefit most from combining their internal knowledge with the external knowledge of neighboring firms with high TFP on average.","Sungshin Womens Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136742, South Korea",Sungshin Women's University,"Song, B (通讯作者)，Sungshin Womens Univ, Dept Econ, 2 Bomun Ro 34Da Gil, Seoul 136742, South Korea.",bsong@sungshin.ac.kr,,,,,,,13,2,2,3,8,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

The study was conducted by surveying 255 people who planned to start their own business. The author's questionnaire was administered to all participants. Respondents recognised three main factors that motivate people to the commencement of one's own business activity: self-realisation and self-satisfaction, the possibility of higher earnings and independence in decision-making. Among the factors that hamper the commencement of one's own business, respondents cited lack of experience, lack of capital and risk of failure. There was no difference between women and men with regard to motives and barriers. Younger entrepreneurs perceived more barriers than older entrepreneurs. There was no discernible relationship between age and motive to the commencement of one's own business. Institutions handling financial aid should pay particular attention to the motives behind setting up a business. Deciding to aid a company should be preceded by an in-depth analysis of what the entrepreneur perceives to be the barriers to starting his/her own business as lack of funds is frequently not the only, or even the key, obstacle.","[Staniewski, Marcin] Univ Finance & Management Warsaw, Fac Management, PL-01030 Warsaw, Poland; [Awruk, Katarzyna] Univ Finance & Management Warsaw, Fac Psychol, PL-01030 Warsaw, Poland",,"Staniewski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Management Warsaw, Fac Management, 55 Pawia St, PL-01030 Warsaw, Poland.",staniewski@vizja.pl,"Staniewski, Marcin Waldemar/AAE-1854-2021","Staniewski, Marcin Waldemar/0000-0003-1913-6007; Awruk, Katarzyna/0000-0003-3068-6309",,,,,29,25,27,2,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The article studies the influence of regional inequalities in human capital on the competitiveness of the EU member states, drawing on a panel dataset of 22 EU countries and 266 NUTS 2 regions, over the period 2000-2011. The analysis is extended with the variables that can have a significant influence on the observed relationship, including the EU's Structural and Cohesion Funds, and differences in the levels of development between EU member states and regions. Applying different panel data estimators, it is determined that higher regional inequalities in human capital reduce the competitiveness of the EU member states. The EU's Structural and Cohesion Fund payments have a positive influence on competitiveness in the long run. The EU's new member states, as well as the EU countries in which most of the regions are classified as less developed regions, have lower competitiveness. The conclusions imply that the absorption of the EU's Structural and Cohesion Funds in less developed regions does not contribute sufficiently to the strengthening of national competitiveness. The results also confirm the need to integrate a more place-based approach into the EU's regional, and even national, competitiveness policies. With its approach in analysing the influence of regional inequalities in human capital, this article adds empirically to the existing studies about the ambiguous relation between regional inequalities and competitiveness. The conclusions can be used in the future EU regional policy planning that places special emphasis on measures, which are directed towards developing human capital potential.","[Tijanic, Lela] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Pula 52100, Croatia; [Obadic, Alka] Univ Zagreb, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula; University of Zagreb,"Tijanic, L (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, P Preradovica 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia.",letijan@unipu.hr; aobadic@efzg.hr,"Obadić, Alka/H-9836-2018","Obadić, Alka/0000-0002-8915-8853",,,,,67,4,4,3,26,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The analysis is based on a sample of over 300 Czech companies implementing mergers in 2001-2010. This sample was created using data from the Trade Bulletin and Trade Register of the Czech Republic. The analysis used basic statistical tests verifiiing the statistical significance of the particular explored indicators of merging and merged companies three years after the merger in relation to the same indicators at the moment of merger. The explored indicators were net earnings after taxes (EAT), return on assets (ROA) and return on equities (ROE). The period of three years after the merger was chosen due to the reduced influence of some accounting methods requiring revaluation or exclusion of some assets from the balance sheet of the merged company.","[Valouch, Petr; Sedlacek, Jaroslav] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Brno 60200, Czech Republic; [Kralova, Maria] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Masaryk University Brno,"Valouch, P (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",valouch@econ.muni.cz; kralova@econ.muni.cz; sedl@econ.muni.cz,"Valouch, Petr/O-4251-2014; Králová, Maria/D-1801-2014; Sedláček, Jaroslav/AAF-8051-2021","Králová, Maria/0000-0001-8515-8402; Sedláček, Jaroslav/0000-0001-6238-8619",,,,,14,5,6,0,8,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

The overall effect of referrals on wages can be decomposed into three distinct components. First, if referrals are used to help unemployed partners find jobs, then recommended workers are disproportionately concentrated in the left tail of the earnings distribution. This is a negative concentration effect of referrals, which emerges because workers accept (forward to the partner) job offers from more (less) productive employers. Second, if referrals are also used by workers to pool their less successful employed partners to more productive jobs, then the process of on-the-job search is intensified. This is a positive pooling effect of referrals. Third, better connected workers bargain higher wages for a given level of productivity. This is a positive effect of referrals on reservation wages and earnings. In the equilibrium, the overall effect of referrals can be positive (wage premiums) or negative (wage penalties). The negative effect is dominating in labor markets with strong productivity heterogeneity of firms and large bargaining power of workers. Otherwise, the positive effect is dominating. Referrals can have a negative effect on social welfare if there is a sharp drop in the search intensity after workers accept low productivity jobs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We show that frictions in credit supply amplify the effects of uncertainty shocks on economic activity. This amplification channel stems mainly from the stickiness in bank loan rates. This stickiness reduces the effectiveness in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We use a system dynamic approach and show that instability is a likely feature when macroeconomic behaviour is characterized by out-of-equilibrium dynamics with balance-sheet effects and deviation amplifying expectation formation rules that interact endogenously. We address the issue of the macroeconomic stabilization puzzle and carry out a quantitative evaluation based on sensitivity analysis with reference to Argentina, during the currency-board arrangement. We find that a tight fiscal policy is likelyto be destabilizing inasmuch as it adds to the fall in expenditure, output and the state of confidence. On the other side, a traditional monetary policy can fail in switching off macroeconomic instability if the reduction in interest rates does not compensate for the fall in the state of confidence, whilst a direct stimulus to aggregate expenditure is required to avoid an economic collapse.

Using a large panel of Gini indices covering 81 countries between 1990 and 2010, we find strong evidence that inequality declined in nations that were initially highly unequal, while inequality-increased in nations with initially low inequality. This pattern holds for both developed and developing countries, but developed countries' relative income distributions have converged at a more rapid pace. These findings are robust to the method of estimation, level of economic development, time horizon, data source or measure of inequality. Our results suggest that income distributions in countries are becoming increasingly unequal yet more similar to each other. Consequently, countries are beginning to coordinate their strategies to jointly reduce inequality through initiatives such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Compared with the observed end-of-panel mean value of no more than 7.26%, these estimates suggest that there has been significant public underinvestment in Africa.","[Fosu, Augustin Kwasi] Univ Ghana, ISSER, Accra, Ghana; [Getachew, Yoseph Yilma] Univ Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa; [Ziesemer, Thomas H.

Using a new, validated, index of graduate jobs, we find that the prevalence of graduate underemployment across 21 countries is correlated with the aggregate supply-demand imbalance, but not with indicators of labour market flexibility. Underemployment's association with lower job satisfaction and pay is widespread. Yet in most countries there are external benefits (social trust, volunteering, and political efficacy) associated with higher education, even for those who are underemployed. Taken together with existing studies we find that, in this era of mass higher education participation, under-employment is a useful indicator of the extent of macroeconomic disequilibrium in the graduate labour market. We conclude that governments should monitor graduate underemployment, but that higher education policy should be based on social returns and should recall higher education's wider purposes.","[Green, Francis; Henseke, Golo] UCL Inst Educ, London, England",University of London; University College London; UCL Institute of Education,"Green, F (通讯作者)，UCL Inst Educ, London, England.",francis.green@ucl.ac.uk; g.henseke@ucl.ac.uk,"Henseke, Golo/AAP-2603-2020","Henseke, Golo/0000-0003-0669-2100; Green, Francis/0000-0002-6786-5012","ESRC; ESRC/UKCES Strategic Partnership [ES/I03792X/1]; ESRC [ES/M010082/1, ES/J019135/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J019135/1, ES/M010082/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC/UKCES Strategic Partnership(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the ESRC-funded LLAKES Centre for Research on Learning and Life Chances with an additional contribution from the ESRC/UKCES Strategic Partnership (ES/I03792X/1.,,62,50,54,6,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

But how successful are such policies? Germany has one of the world's most generous child benefit systems, which was subject to a major reform in the mid-1990s. This article exploits the reform using a difference-indifferences approach. The main result suggests that child benefits lead to a substantial reduction of mothers' labor supply at the intensive margin. The result implies that the policy in question is less effective at improving family finances and, consequently, expensive for the taxpayer because increases in benefit receipt are accompanied by negative labor supply responses. However, suggestive evidence seems to support that parents improve their time investment in children.","[Hener, Timo] Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Hener, T (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",hener@ifo.de,,"Hener, Timo/0000-0002-9424-7893",,,,,28,5,5,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

In the new member states (NMS) of the European Union (EU), however, domestic lending contracted along with a shrinkage in cross-border financial inflows. In this paper, I investigate whether political integration with the EU has strengthened the relation between domestic credit growth and international financial inflows in the NMS in comparison to other emerging markets. Taking into account the period 2008-2014 and the boom period in the run-up to the 2008 crisis, I provide empirical evidence that domestic lending in both periods is more responsive to changes in cross-border bank lending if a country is a member of the EU.

For most governments this expansion has been seen as the silver bullet that improves economic growth and helps tackle problems of inequality. However, in most countries increasing numbers of graduates are going into jobs that were once done by non-graduates, raising the concern that the true social returns to HE expansion are low. Because of this it is unsurprising that economists have found it difficult to establish firm links between higher education expansion and economic growth. At the same time, in some countries, HE expansion has exacerbated problems of economic and social inequality. The paper argues that governments need to take a more realistic view of the role of HE, consider alternative ways of preparing people for the labour market, and at the same time explore more rigorously exactly how the sector is conducting itself.","[Holmes, Craig; Mayhew, Ken] Pembroke Coll, Oxford, England",,"Holmes, C (通讯作者)，Pembroke Coll, Oxford, England.",craig.holmes@pmb.ox.ac.uk; ken.mayhew@pmb.ox.ac.uk,"Holmes, Craig/V-3092-2019","Holmes, Craig/0000-0002-1664-8309",ESRC [ES/G020183/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,50,14,16,2,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The lack of activity in the green investment subsidy markets has been a concern as it appears optimal that countries should offer such support from a welfare point of view but progress has nonetheless been stalling, which motivates this paper. We show that free riding (which is likely to affect the green subsidy market) cools down the subsidy market with harmful welfare effects, and preemption (which is likely to affect the more active FDI subsidy market) overheats the subsidy market with similarly harmful effects. The theory dictates a taxation scheme that offsets these effects to restore the welfare to its maximum point. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To capture the large swing in the price-rent ratio accompanied by intermittent ups and downs, we incorporate a periodically collapsing bubble in an otherwise standard present value model. We then decompose the movements in the actual price-rent ratio into those explained by the expectations of housing market fundamentals (i.e., the rent growth, risk-free interest rate, and excess returns from housing investment) and the bubble. The bubble part set aside, most of the variations in the price-rent ratio are explained by the expected risk premium of housing investment, whereas the expected real interest rate and rent growth account for relatively small fractions of the variations. It is also found that the bubble has continuously accumulated since the early 2000s, reaching as high as 51% of the house price around the end of 2014. Finally, the recent increases in house price over 2007-2014 are likely to have been driven by self-fulfilling expectations typical of a bubble. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We study the optimal mix of two alternative instruments for incentive provision: a performance based wage (a carrot) and a termination threat (a stick). At any given point in time, these instruments are substitutes in the provision of incentives. We are particularly interested in the dynamic interaction of these two instruments. Both carrot and stick are used more intensively as the agent approaches the end of his finite life. The sharing of the surplus of the relationship plays a key role: a termination threat is included in the optimal contract if and only if the agent's expected future gain from the relationship is sufficiently high, compared to the principal's expected future gain. Also, a termination threat is more likely to be optimal if output depends more on luck than on effort, if the discount factor is high, or if the agent's productivity is low. The model, provided that the optimal contract includes a termination threat, essentially provides an alternative explanation for upward-sloping wage profiles even in the absence of full-commitment.","[Olcay, Nadide Banu] Univ Cologne, Seminar Personnel Econ & Human Resources Manageme, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Olcay, Nadide Banu] Cologne Grad Sch, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Olcay, NB (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Seminar Personnel Econ & Human Resources Manageme, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.;Olcay, NB (通讯作者)，Cologne Grad Sch, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",olcay@wiso.uni-koeln.de,,,Fritz Thyssen Foundation,Fritz Thyssen Foundation,"I am grateful to Tomas Sjostrom for advice.

While we find that better education reduces the probability of having poor self assessed health and disabilities, we do not find statistically significant effects of education on the probability of having poor physical functioning status or uncomfortable body pains in the previous four weeks. Moreover, we find an interesting result that better education increases the probability of having chronic diseases. While most existing studies only identify the effect of education at a particular level, one contribution of our paper is that it provides estimates much closer to the population average effect Moreover, our results imply that the underlying mechanism behind the effect of education on health might be different in developing countries from that in developed countries.

Findings from this paper illustrate heterogeneity in WTP associated with environmental and social attitudes, and family concerns. For instance, WTP is higher than average if respondents state a very high priority to air pollution but smaller than average if respondent's household contains more adults than the sample median. This contingent valuation exercise provides elements to carry out cost-benefit analysis of environmental policies both recently implemented and currently under discussion in the MCMA context. For instance, a cost-benefit analysis using estimates from this paper suggests benefits from improved air quality surpass the costs of investing in hybrid buses. Usefulness of this study is underscored by pointing out recent evidence suggesting that (1) air pollution in MCMA has larger health impacts than in similar cities located in developed countries, and (2) policies tackling air pollution in MCMA have had no impact on pollution levels.","[Filippini, Massimo] USI, Lugano, Switzerland; [Filippini, Massimo; Martinez-Cruz, Adan L.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CEPE, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Martínez-Cruz, AL (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CEPE, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",madan@ethz.ch,"Martinez-Cruz, Adan L./ABI-7504-2020; Filippini, Massimo/K-8155-2013","Martinez-Cruz, Adan L./0000-0001-7865-5339; Filippini, Massimo/0000-0002-5972-4439",,,,,62,21,24,0,25,CENTRO INVESTIGACION & DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS-CIDE,CIUDAD DE MEXICO,"CARR MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, SANTA FE, ALTAVISTA, CIUDAD DE MEXICO, ALVARO OBREGON, MEXICO",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

Their results show that the MF-MS-VAR fits the different recession regimes, and provides out-of-sample forecasts of recession probabilities which are more accurate than those derived from the MS-VAR and MS-AR models.

The subjects of the analysis were three residential buildings, for which the variability of the cladding and ventilation needs was assumed. In all analysed cases the application of four systems of energy supply to the building was also assumed. The optimal level of primary energy index value, dependant on the source of heat, was-established by means of the global cost method. This level was then compared with the requirements presently valid in Poland. The analysis also allowed for the determination of the growth in investment costs, that must be considered in order to achieve the energy needed for heating and ventilation at the level of 40 kWh/m(2)/a or 15 kWh/m(2)/a.

We ask whether changes in tax rates are less distortionary for workers engaged in a contest. To examine this potential rationale for a more progressive tax code, we first model the effort decisions of workers faced with progressive taxation under tournaments and piece rates. Because of the difficulty identifying any distortion that may be induced by the tax code in naturally occurring data, we then report on the results of a real-effort experiment based on this model. Consistent with a behavioral approach to public finance, we find that competitive tournament workers are less sensitive and hint, in our discussion, at the possible welfare benefits of progressive taxation in tournament economies.

The empirical results indicate that an increase in exports and government spending will positively affect value-added in the services sector. The findings also indicate that the services sector has a positive influence on the growth of per capita GDP.

Using original data on the geographical incidence of the Ponzi schemes, this paper estimates the impact of their breakdown on crime. We find that the crash of Ponzi schemes differentially exacerbated crime in affected districts. Confirming the intuition of the standard economic model of crime, this effect is only present in places with relatively weak judicial and law enforcement institutions, and with little access to consumption smoothing mechanisms such as microcredit. In addition, we show that, with the exception of economically-motivated felonies such as robbery, violent crime is not affected by the negative shock. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper introduces foreign direct investment (FDI) through public-private partnerships as a source of infrastructure financing in low-income countries. A two-sector open economy model is developed to assess the macroeconomic performance of FDI in infrastructure. With efficient foreign investment, an increase in revenue-generating infrastructure investment boosts productivity and spurs private investment while stabilizing domestic prices. A direct comparison between infrastructure financed by domestic versus foreign investment shows that foreign investment creates higher output growth and welfare gains and is preferable to domestically sourced investment, irrespective of the underlying financing instrument the domestic economy is employing. FDI in non-revenue-generating infrastructure is also analyzed and discussed.","[Germaschewski, Yin] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Germaschewski, Y (通讯作者)，Univ New Hampshire, Dept Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",yin.germaschewski@unh.edu,,,,,,,38,1,3,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

This paper uses a small open economy model with nominal wage and price rigidities to analyse the welfare effects of fiscal devaluation, understood as budgetary-neutral tax shift from employers' social security contributions towards consumption tax. The paper finds that fiscal devaluation can support external rebalancing by accelerating real exchange rate adjustments and regaining price competitiveness. From a household welfare perspective, internal devaluation with its concomitant worsening of the terms of trade tends to induce welfare losses. The overall welfare effects are pro-cyclical in the sense that the stronger the tax shift, the higher the welfare losses for the average household. The losses increase with the openness of the economy and the relative size of the tradable sector. In the presence of supply shocks, however, fiscal devaluation can imply small welfare gains. A scenario with flexible nominal exchange rates and autonomous monetary policy performs better in terms of household welfare, but implies stronger external fluctuations in the short run.

In a meta-analysis containing 441 results from 77 studies, we find groups significantly discriminate against each other in roughly a third of cases. Discrimination varies depending upon the type of group identity being studied: it is stronger when identity is artificially induced in the laboratory than when the subject pool is divided by ethnicity or nationality, and higher still when participants are split into socially or geographically distinct groups. In gender discrimination experiments, there is significant favouritism towards the opposite gender. There is evidence for both taste-based and statistical discrimination; tastes drive the general pattern of discrimination against out groups, but statistical beliefs are found to affect discrimination in specific instances. Relative to all other decision-making contexts, discrimination is much stronger when participants are asked to allocate payoffs between passive in-group and out-group members. Students and non-students appear to discriminate equally. We discuss possible interpretations and implications of our findings. (C) 2015 The Author.

Such leniency bias is at odds with the standard principal-agent model and has been explained with causes that range from social interactions to fairness concerns and to collusive behavior between the supervisor and the agent. We show that the principal-agent model, extended to consider loss-aversion and reference dependent preferences, predicts that the leniency bias is comparatively less detrimental to effort provision than the severity bias. We test this prediction with a laboratory experiment where we demonstrate that failing to reward deserving agents is significantly more detrimental than rewarding undeserving agents.

Drawing on endogenous ownership theory, this paper seeks to understand the relationship between ownership structure and firm performance in SMEs in China, which represents an embryonic market environment. Using survey data collected from 189 private firms in Shantou City, China, we find that ownership variables do not have a statistically significant relationship with firm performance. We examine the determinants of changing ownership shares and find that firm size and business instability are related to changes in ownership shares. Our findings provide empirical support for the central tenets of endogenous ownership theory. As such, the results can be interpreted as meaning that even in a developing market environment, such as China, market forces are strong enough to dominate ownership structure change or that the market mechanism is functioning well in some areas of emerging markets.","[Qin, Zhong] Shantou Univ, Sch Business, Shantou, Peoples R China; [Mishra, Vinod; Smyth, Russell] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Shantou University; Monash University,"Smyth, R (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",russell.smyth@monash.edu,"Smyth, Russell/AAE-1492-2019; Mishra, Vinod/D-1221-2011","Smyth, Russell/0000-0001-6593-5462; Mishra, Vinod/0000-0002-4686-5195",,,,,32,0,0,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Firstly, we provide trend analysis of the market for cross-border acquisitions by Chinese and Indian multinationals over the last two decades, 1995-2014. Specially, this paper, to date, is the first to analyze high-valuation cross-border acquisitions of Chinese state-owned (SOEs) and Indian private enterprises (POEs). Based on 61 high-valuation deals valued at approximately US$200 billion, we find that Chinese SOEs completed more high-valuation deals, seek to invest in resource-scarce industries, and diversify their risk by targeting developed, emerging and developing countries. While Indian POEs largely prefer to invest in developed economies for both market and strategic-asset seeking, and follow an effective portfolio matrix by concentrating diversified sectors. Lastly, we discuss several policy implications pertaining to disinvestment and turnaround strategy of loss-making SOEs in EE, national interest and security concerns over EE state-driven outbound acquisitions, and foreign investment regulations.

Furthermore, we model both the means and volatilities of daily bond yield spreads in terms of potential determinants. By doing so, we obtain other effects free sovereign bond spreads, which together with the robust copula method would correctly uncover the core contagion, when present The empirical results indicate that the German stock index return, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, stock index returns of these countries, S&P 500 returns, VIX and sovereign debt ratings have had significant impacts on the bond yield spreads and/or volatilities, particularly in the post-crisis period. We find overwhelming evidence of financial contagion effects among the peripheral countries. The two large countries Spain and Italy appear to be operating independent of each other, whereas Ireland, Greece and Portugal are found to be the exporters of contagion. In globally interconnected financial markets, central bankers and policy makers are concerned about contagion, through which the crisis proliferates around the region and beyond, triggering instability in the financial markets. Thus, our findings have implications for international policy debate, debt crisis risk management and financial market participants. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Relaxing the commitment assumption prevents sellers from using price posting as a signaling device to direct buyers' search. Private information about the gains from trade and inefficient entry on the demand side then contribute to market illiquidity.

Our empirical findings suggest that manufacturer decisions depend on dealers' retail network: manufacturers are inclined to choose a sole dealer for their brands if that dealer also has retail outlets for substitute brands in the local market and to choose multiple dealers otherwise. These findings can be explained by the theory proposed by [Mathewson, G. F., Winter, R. A., 1994. Territorial restrictions in franchise contracts. Economic Inquiry 32 (2), 181-192.], who suggest that manufacturers transfer the exclusive right of resale from themselves to dealers only if dealers' contribution is crucial to the vertical relationship. When dealers also have extensive retail channels for other brands, their retail efforts and experience become crucial to brand success, and thus manufacturers are more likely to offer them sole resale rights. Moreover, our empirical findings suggest that manufacturers also consider product quality and market conditions when making their decisions. Journal of Comparative Economics 44(1) (2016) 961-981.

I derive the theoretically correct prices required to impute home production value added and productivity and apply this method to estimate annual U.S. home production accounts from 1929 to 2010. Both labor productivity and technical change grew steadily after World War Two, but slowed after the late-1970s. Capital intensity increased in the late -1970s due to increased consumer durables holdings, suggesting that the home production function must allow for more substitutability between capital and labor than Cobb-Douglas. Including home production significantly reduces the shift from goods to services production relative to published GDP. The productivity slowdown coincides with a shift to market services, suggesting that it was slower - not faster - home productivity that encouraged shifting production out of the home.

In this paper, we explore the evolution of postsecondary impacts of the interaction of school entry and compulsory schooling laws in Michigan. We employ a regression-discontinuity (RD) design using longitudinal administrative data to examine effects on high school performance, college enrollment, choice, and persistence. On average, we find that children eligible to start school at a relatively younger age are more likely to complete high school, but underperform while enrolled, compared to their counterparts eligible to start school at a relatively older age. In turn, these students are 2 percentage points more likely to first attend a two-year college and enroll in fewer total postsecondary semesters, relative to their older counterparts. We explore heterogeneity in these effects across subgroups of students defined by gender and poverty status. For example, we illustrate that the increase in the high school graduation rate of relatively younger students attributable to the combination of school entry and compulsory schooling laws is driven entirely by impacts on economically disadvantaged students.","[Hemelt, Steven W.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Rosen, Rachel B.] MDRC, New York, NY USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine,"Hemelt, SW (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC USA.",hemelt@email.unc.edu; rachel.rosen@mdrc.org,,,"Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education [R305B110001, R305E100008]","Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education(US Department of Education)","The research reported here was supported by the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through Grants R305B110001 and R305E100008 to the University of Michigan.",,25,6,10,1,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

This increase in filings has been interpreted as a sign of increased innovative performance. In this paper, we argue that the explanation is much simpler. First, using a novel dataset, we document that trademark filing fees have been steadily decreasing and converging across countries in Europe. Second, using dynamic panel data econometrics, we find that national trademark filings are price-sensitive: a fee decrease by 10% increases filings at an office by about 10.5%. These estimates suggest that a substantial proportion of the rise in filing numbers can be explained by lower fees. We also document that trademark filings at national offices in Europe became more elastic after the mid-1990s. Arguably, this is because the European Community Trademark became available as an attractive alternative to national filings in 1996 and increased the price-sensitivity of applicants.","[Herz, Benedikt; Mejer, Malwina] European Commiss, Directorate Gen Internal Market Ind Entrepreneurs, Brussels, Belgium",,"Herz, B (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Directorate Gen Internal Market Ind Entrepreneurs, Brussels, Belgium.",benedikt.herz@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,7,7,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We develop a model in which group members interact repeatedly, and might be temporarily unable to contribute to public goods production during some periods. We show that an increase in the group size generates two opposite effects- the standard free-riding effect that suppresses cooperation, and the novel large-scale effect that enhances cooperation. Our results indicate that the former effect dominates in relatively large groups while the latter dominates in relatively small groups. We, therefore, provide a rationale for a non-monotonic group-size effect that may explain previous empirical and experimental findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This underrepresentation within the field of economics is present at the undergraduate level, continues into the ranks of the academy, and is barely improving over time. It likely hampers the discipline, constraining the range of issues addressed and limiting our collective ability to understand familiar issues from new and innovative perspectives. In this paper, we first present data on the numbers of women and underrepresented minority groups in the profession. We then offer an overview of current research on the reasons for the underrepresentation, highlighting evidence that may be less familiar to economists. We argue that implicit attitudes and institutional practices may be contributing to the underrepresentation of women and minorities at all stages of the pipeline, calling for new types of research and initiatives to attack the problem. We then review evidence on how diversity affects productivity and propose remedial interventions as well as findings on effectiveness.

First, we embed a novel quarterly composite global production index for the four basic staples corn, wheat, rice, and soybeans in a standard vector auto regression model, and we estimate the dynamic effects of global food commodity supply shocks on the U.S. economy. As an alternative, we also estimate the consequences of 13 narratively identified global food commodity price shocks. Both approaches lead to similar conclusions. Specifically, an unfavorable food commodity market shock raises food commodity prices, and leads to a rise in food, energy, and core inflation, and also to a persistent decline in real GDP and consumer expenditures. A closer inspection of the pass-through reveals that households do not only reduce food consumption. In fact, there is a much greater decline in durable consumption and investment. Overall, the macroeconomic effects turn out to be a multiple of the maximum impact implied by the share of food commodities in the consumer price index and household consumption.","[De Winne, Jasmien; Peersman, Gert] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"De Winne, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",,,,,,,,5,11,11,0,5,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

While a large body of previous work has estimated the effects of that contracting, surprisingly little has investigated how those effects vary with the generosity of the contract. In this paper we examine this issue in the Medicare Advantage (MA) program, through which the federal government contracts with private insurers to coordinate and finance health care for 17 million Medicare recipients. To do this, we exploit a substantial policy-induced increase in MA reimbursement in metropolitan areas with a population of 250,000 or more relative to MSAs below this threshold. Our results demonstrate that the additional reimbursement leads more private firms to enter this market and to an increase in the share of Medicare recipients enrolled in MA plans. Our findings also reveal that about one-eighth of the additional reimbursement is passed through to consumers in the form of better coverage. A somewhat larger share accrues to private insurers in the form of higher profits and we find suggestive evidence of a large impact on advertising expenditures. Our results have implications for a key feature of the Affordable Care Act that will reduce reimbursement to MA plans by $156 billion from 2013 to 2022. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Since such mutual cross-participations imply a lower degree of competition, the conventional wisdom is that consumer surplus and social welfare, despite the increase in industry profits, are harmed. By contrast, when the labour market is unionised, we show the counterintuitive result that both consumer surplus and social welfare increase with the share of mutual cross-participation. Interestingly, this occurs not only when unions are wage-aggressive but even if they are fairly risk-averse. Therefore, a rather paradoxical conclusion-which may have anti-trust policy implications-is that the interlocking cross-ownership ensuring the highest profit (i.e. the most collusive mutual cross-participation) may be socially preferred when there are unions in oligopoly industries. Finally, it is shown that, even though details change, the results also hold qualitatively under differentiated products, price competition and triopoly.","[Fanti, Luciano] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Via Cosimo Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, PI, Italy",University of Pisa,"Fanti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Via Cosimo Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, PI, Italy.",luciano.fanti@unipi.it,,,,,,,29,10,10,0,8,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Results in economics find instead little to no support. In this paper we test whether this dissonant result across disciplines is due to the fact that economists have implemented only one form of illusory control. We identify and separately tests in an incentive-compatible design two types of control: (a) over the resolution of uncertainty, as usually done in the economics literature, and (b) over the choice of the lottery, as sometimes done in the psychology literature but without monetary payoffs. Results show no evidence of illusion of control, neither on choices nor on beliefs about the likelihood of winning.","[Filippin, Antonio] Univ Milan, Dept Econ, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Filippin, Antonio] Inst Study Labor IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Crosetto, Paolo] Univ Grenoble Alpes, GAEL, INRA, CNRS,Grenoble INP, F-38000 Grenoble, France",University of Milan; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble,"Filippin, A (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Econ, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy.;Filippin, A (通讯作者)，Inst Study Labor IZA, Schaumburg Lippe Str 5-9, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",antonio.filippin@unimi.it; paolo.crosetto@gmail.com,"Crosetto, Paolo/M-1304-2019; Filippin, Antonio/L-4243-2017","FILIPPIN, ANTONIO/0000-0002-3824-9544",Max Planck Institute in Jena,Max Planck Institute in Jena(Max Planck Society),We are grateful to the Max Planck Institute in Jena for financial and logistic support and to Florian Strum and Nadine Marmai for excellent lab assistance.

Agents derive payoff from having access to the information of others through communication or spillovers via the links between them. Linking decisions are based on network-dependent marginal payoff and a network-independent noise capturing exogenous idiosyncratic effects. Moreover, agents have a limited observation radius when deciding to whom to form a link. I find that for small noise the observation radius does not matter and strongly centralized networks emerge. However, for large noise, a smaller observation radius generates networks with a larger degree variance. These networks can also be shown to have larger aggregate payoff. I then estimate the model using a network of co-inventors and scientific collaborations in physics and economics, and find that the model can closely reproduce a variety of observed patterns. I show that local search is important in all the empirical networks conside, but that economists tend to search more broadly for new collaboration opportunities.","[Koenig, Michael D.] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"König, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",michael.koenig@econ.uzh.ch,"Koenig, Michael/IVH-5609-2023",,"Swiss National Science Foundation [PBEZP1-131169, 100018_140266]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [100018_140266, PBEZP1-131169] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)",Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"I am grateful to Matt Jackson for his guidance and support.

They have been variously labelled as social, local and alternative money but their economic meaning has still to be discussed. On the one hand, they have been hailed as innovative tools for socio-territorial policies with a focus on localist, anti-globalist and anti-capitalist values. On the other, the emphasis on the value of currencies as instruments of alternative territorial development runs the risk of overshadowing issues concerning the specific features of such projects. The first part of this paper puts forward an interpretation of the current situation as a crisis of the liquidity principle and suggests that the principle of clearing instead represents the primary point of reference for any institutional arrangement aimed at restoring a balanced relationship between lenders and borrowers. A critical review of known European complementary monetary circuits is followed by examination of the Sardex clearing system. The paper then goes on to argue by means of a stock-flow consistent model that complementary monetary circuits can serve to stabilise local economic systems. In particular, a local clearing union for local exchanges has the effect of stabilising the profits of firms while attenuating the impact of the credit crunch at same time.","Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy; Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France; Univ Trento, Trento, Italy",University of Bergamo; University of Trento,"Lucarelli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Dipartimento SAEMQ, Via Caniana 2, I-24126 Bergamo, Italy.",lucarelli@unibocconi.it,"Lucarelli, Stefano/B-5253-2016","Lucarelli, Stefano/0000-0003-1971-3265",,,,,51,17,17,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Moreover, it examines whether recent oil shocks and financial events have significant impact on the conditional correlations and diversification benefits. Using stock returns from developed, emerging, GCC countries and a global portfolio, the empirical findings show that while developed and emerging stock markets have experienced increased correlations over relatively long periods of time, the correlation in GCC stock markets remained low and constant offering high diversification benefits. Interestingly, the paper also finds that, during 2012-2014, the rising conditional correlation levels have reversed trends in developed and emerging markets alike offering more potential for international diversification.

China is the nexus of intra-Asian trade and direct investment flows. China's rapid growth in the recent decade relied on a state-directed investment model, akin to the state-run Big Push growth model. As in most big push experiences, intermediate term success leads to economic stresses. China's leaders can no longer ignore obvious signs of rising malinvestment, corporate debts, environmental degradation, and social disparity, all amid an aging population and tightening resource constraints. China's economic slowdown also forces economic adjustment upon its neighbors, rendered more difficult by China's policy ambiguity and volatility.

It was pursued by people who were known specifically as game theorists and who did almost nothing but game theory, while other economists had little idea what game theory was. Game theory is now a standard tool in economics. Contributions to game theory are made by economists across the spectrum of fields and interests, and economists regularly combine work in game theory with work in other areas. Students learn the basic techniques of game theory in the first-year graduate theory core. Excitement over game theory in economics has given way to an easy familiarity. This essay first examines this transition, arguing that the initial excitement surrounding game theory has dissipated not because game theory has retreated from its initial bridgehead, but because it has extended its reach throughout economics. Next, it discusses some key challenges for game theory, including the continuing problem of dealing with multiple equilibria, the need to make game theory useful in applications, and the need to better integrate noncooperative and cooperative game theory. Finally it considers the current status and future prospects of game theory.","[Samuelson, Larry] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Samuelson, L (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",larry.samuelson@yale.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-1459158]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1459158] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","I thank Ken Binmore, Scott Kominers, and the editors of the Journal of Economic Perspectives for helpful comments and discussions.

A phase-out mechanism is built into the model to reflect the long-term changes of subsidy policy. We apply the proposed model to empirically evaluate the investment value and optimal timing for solar photovoltaic power generation in China. Our empirical results show that the current investment environment in China may not be able to attract immediate investment, while the development of carbon market helps advance the optimal investment time. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the dynamics of investment value and optimal timing under the changes of unit generating capacity, subsidy level, market price of electricity, CO2 price and investment cost.

Investment return studies using hedonic and resale price regressions on different artistic periods and styles produce estimates of varying rates of return, predominately low rates with high standard deviations. The present study employs a new sample of American art sold at auction between 1987 and 2011-art created before 1950 by 33 artists born prior to 1900. Our study, unlike those that preceded it, considers works that are no-sales (those bought-in for failing to sell at auction at or above a predetermined and negotiated minimum price), in addition to full transaction costs-buyers and sellers premia on hammer prices. We conclude that investment return calculations are biased upward and may be negative when these factors are considered and that the consumption utility of art may be higher than previously thought. However, using a variant of the capital asset pricing model, we find that investment in early American art may still be desirable in a diversified portfolio of assets for when the price of stock assets falls, the price of art does not fall in the same proportion.","[Anderson, Seth C.] Tuskegee Univ, 257 Belmonte Dr, Auburn, AL 36830 USA; [Ekelund, Robert B., Jr.] Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, 404 Blake St, Auburn, AL 36830 USA; [Jackson, John D.] Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Liberal Arts, Auburn, AL 36840 USA; [Tollison, Robert D.] Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA",Tuskegee University; Auburn University System; Auburn University; Auburn University System; Auburn University; Clemson University,"Ekelund, RB (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Econ, 404 Blake St, Auburn, AL 36830 USA.",bobekelund@prodigy.net,,,,,,,28,1,1,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

There is compelling evidence of a high percentage of dropouts from high schools in poor countries. The endogenous sorting of homogeneous workers into skilled and unskilled types might be the outcome of exposure to income risk and an individual's aversion to risk. We obtain the critical risk aversion associated with income levels above which no individual chooses education. Broad-based economic policies may have perverse impact on educational attainments of individuals. We argue that such an analysis has been largely neglected in related studies. This outcome may also be undesirable from the perspective of a social planner. To address this, we suggest a sector-specific tax-subsidy scheme as a corrective instrument of public policy.

We construct a complete and balanced panel data set of 88 countries for the period 1980-2010, and then differentiate between four groups of countries. Models for non-stationary heterogeneous panels, as well as panel threshold regression models, are used to estimate the determinants of aggregate consumption. The core finding of the paper is that the financial openness effect on consumption changes in the course of economic development, with the level or per capita income acting as a threshold which is consistently estimated within the model. The openness effect is non-homogeneous across groups, stronger for low levels of per capita income and diminishes as income rises. These findings provide new insights into the welfare effect of financial liberalization.","[Bousmah, Marwan-al-Qays] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Bousmah, Marwan-al-Qays] EHESS, Paris, France; [Onori, Daria] Univ Orleans, CNRS, UMR 7322, LEO, F-45067 Orleans, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Orleans,"Bousmah, MAQ (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Charite, 2 Rue, F-13236 Marseille 02, France.;Bousmah, MAQ (通讯作者)，EHESS, Charite, 2 Rue, F-13236 Marseille 02, France.",marwan-al-qays.bousmah@univ-amu.fr,"Bousmah, Marwân-al-Qays/B-7676-2018","Bousmah, Marwân-al-Qays/0000-0001-5346-5184; Onori, Daria/0000-0003-4648-8403",Aix-Marseille University,Aix-Marseille University,"The authors would like to thank Stephen Bazen, Raouf Boucekkine, Thomas Chuffart, Russell Davidson, Emmanuel Flachaire, Xavier Joutard, Minjoo Kim, Anne Peguin-Feissolle, Bilel Sanhaji and Bruno Ventelou for helpful comments and suggestions.

We develop a theoretical model in which we explain the impact of health insurance on savings through the impact of health insurance on out-of-pocket (OOP) health expense given the household level of wealth and seriousness of illness. We test the model empirically using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey. We run endogenous and exogenous quantile regressions to evaluate the effects of NCMS participation on the distributions of household savings and OOP health expense. The impact of NCMS varies with the seriousness of illness. The NCMS induces an increase in OOP health expense for mild illness and, inversely, a decrease in health payments for more serious illnesses. The NCMS also leads to a higher incidence of catastrophic healthcare spending. The impact of the NCMS, given a certain state of illness, also varies with the household level of wealth. Poor households face health expense for both mild and serious illnesses. As the NCMS has opposite effects on the OOP expense for these two kinds of illness, we observe no effect on poor households' precautionary savings. Because the decrease in OOP health expense for mild illness is larger for less poor households, the NCMS induces a decrease in their savings. For the most affluent households, the higher decrease in OOP spending on most moderate illness is dominated by a sharp increase in catastrophic expense, causing an increase in savings. To significantly reduce household savings and enhance household consumption, the NCMS has to offer better coverage against both serious and catastrophic health risks.","[Cheung, Diana] CREST, Paris, France; [Laffargue, Jean-Pierre; Padieu, Ysaline] Univ Paris 01, F-75231 Paris 05, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Cheung, D (通讯作者)，CREST, Paris, France.;Cheung, D (通讯作者)，Ctr Rech Econ & Stat, Lab Microeconometrie, Timbre J390,Bur 2122,15 Blvd Gabriel Peri, F-92245 Malakoff, France.",diana.cheung75@gmail.com,,,"National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety; China Center for Disease Control and Prevention; Carolina Population Center [5 R24 HD050924]; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH [R01-HD30880, DK056350, R24 HD050924, R01-HD38700]; Fogarty International Center, NIH; China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health","National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety; China Center for Disease Control and Prevention; Carolina Population Center; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Fogarty International Center, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC)); China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health","This research uses data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS).

In truth, no single agency or department operates in a vacuum or in isolation of other organizational entities. According to world-renowned leadership and management expert, W. Edwards Deming, a given agency's ability to perform its duties effectively is the result of a myriad of interdependent processes and operations with other organizations. Consequently, effective leaders must develop an understanding of how the departments they oversee both influence, and are at the same time influenced by the outside agencies and organizations upon whom they mutually depend. 1) We draw jointly on W. Edwards Deming's System of Profound Knowledge (SoPK) framework and Arthur T. Denzau and Douglass C. North's (1994) New Institutional Economics (NIE)-based work on Shared Mental Models (SMM) to explore why inter-agency cooperation tends to be limited in 'traditional' organizational environments. 2) Drawing on Denzau and North's SMM, we then suggest how inter-organizational communication and cooperation can be facilitated via two means of learning-training and experiential. 3) We then apply concepts from Denzau and North's SMM to suggest a modified model of the Nash equilibrium used in game theory. This model is then used to operationalize the learning path to Deming's approach to 'systems thinking' (SoPK.) 4) Finally, we provide a real-world example to illustrate the modified model.","[Denzau, Arthur T.] Claremont Grad Univ, Claremont, CA USA; [Minassians, Henrik P.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Urban Studies & Planning, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; [Roy, Ravi K.] Southern Utah Univ, Master Publ Adm Program, Cedar City, UT 84720 USA; [Roy, Ravi K.] W Edwards Deming Inst, Ketchum, ID 83340 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; California State University System; California State University Northridge; Utah System of Higher Education; Southern Utah University,"Roy, RK (通讯作者)，Southern Utah Univ, Master Publ Adm Program, Cedar City, UT 84720 USA.;Roy, RK (通讯作者)，W Edwards Deming Inst, Ketchum, ID 83340 USA.",,,,,,,,13,4,4,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2016,69.0,3,,,,,471,491,,,,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DY7JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385304700003,0

Using administrative records of taxes paid and true tax liabilities, we use these treatments to document that intrinsically motivated compliance is substantial, that a significant fraction of it may be driven by duty-to-comply preferences, and that there is no crowd-out between extrinsic and intrinsic motivations.","[Dwenger, Nadja] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Econ, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Kleven, Henrik] London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Rasul, Imran] UCL, Drayton House,30 Gordon St, London WC1H OAX, England; [Rincke, Johannes] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Dept Econ, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany",University Hohenheim; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; University College London; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Dwenger, N (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Dept Econ, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",nadja.dwenger@uni-hohenheim.de; h.j.kleven@lse.ac.uk; i.rasul@ucl.ac.uk; johannes.rincke@fau.de,,,"Schoeller Foundation; ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS [RES-544-28-5001]; ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010147/1, RES-544-28-5001] Funding Source: researchfish",Schoeller Foundation; ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank Alan Auerbach, Loukas Balafoutas, Oriana Bandiera, Richard Blundell, Raj Chetty, Michael Devereux, Denvil Duncan, Hilary Hoynes, Larry Katz, Judd Kessler, R.Vijay Krishna, Steve Levitt, Brian McManus, Paul Niehaus, Kathleen Nosal, Ricardo Perez-Truglia, Michael K.Price, Emmanuel Saez, Jonathan Shaw, Monica Singhal, Joel Slemrod, Sarah Smith, Christian Traxler, Shlomo Yitzhaki, anonymous referees, and numerous seminar participants for useful comments.

National defense depends on military expenditure and on the strategic environment reflecting a potential hostile external threat. We use aggregate data on consumption, investment, and military spending for the US economy to estimate the parameters of the model. Estimation results suggest that consumption and national defense are complements and that military spending variability is mainly explained by external threat shocks although it also depends on the macroeconomic conditions. We compute impulse response functions of the main macroeconomic variables to several shocks: a total factor productivity shock, a defense technology shock, and a strategic environment shock. Surprisingly, we find that the optimal response to an increase in the external threat (a worsening in the strategic environment) will rise output by reducing consumption and increasing investment.","[F-De-Cordoba, Gonzalo; Torres, Jose L.] Univ Malaga, Dept Econ, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Torres, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dept Econ, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",jtorres@uma.es,"Torres, José/ABF-6814-2021","Torres, Jose L./0000-0002-7469-5656",[P07-SEJ-02479],,The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Research Grant P07-SEJ-02479.,,40,7,7,0,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

In particular, we compare nominal GDP targeting to inflation and output gap targeting as well as to a conventional Taylor rule. These comparisons are made on the basis of welfare losses relative to a hypothetical equilibrium with flexible prices and wages. Output gap targeting is the most desirable of the rules under consideration, but nominal GDP targeting performs almost as well. Nominal GDP targeting is associated with smaller welfare losses than a Taylor rule and significantly outperforms inflation targeting. Relative to inflation targeting and a Taylor rule, nominal GDP targeting performs best conditional on supply shocks and when wages are sticky relative to prices. Nominal GDP targeting may outperform output gap targeting if the gap is observed with noise, and has more desirable properties related to equilibrium determinacy than does gap targeting.

To establish the direction of causality, we use an instrumental variable strategy that exploits Brazilian state laws on judicial organization, and focus on differences in court congestion across otherwise similar neighboring municipalities located across judicial district borders within the same state.

The error correction model under autoregressive-distributed lag mechanism suggests that CO2 emissions converge to their long-run equilibrium level by a 49.2% speed of adjustment every year by the contribution of energy consumption, economic growth, and FDI. The Toda-Yamamoto (0051> 1995) causality test results imply that carbon emissions and FDI, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions have bidirectional causal relationships.

We test perfect BNE against the criteria laid out by Kohlberg and Mertens (1986). We show that, for a focal class of Bayesian games, perfect BNE exists. Moreover, when payoffs are continuous, perfect BNE is limit undominated for almost every type. We illustrate the use of perfect BNE in the context of a second-price auction with interdependent values. Perfect BNE selects the unique pure strategy equilibrium in continuous strategies that separates types. Moreover, when valuations become independent, the equilibrium converges to the classical truthful dominant strategy equilibrium. We also show that less intuitive equilibria in which types are pooled are ruled out by our selection criterion. We further argue that standard selection criteria for second-price auctions have no bite here. Bidders have no dominant strategies, and the separating equilibrium is not sincere.

Two firms invest simultaneously into new products creation and into further development of the quality of these products. Each firm may benefit from the costless technological spillover in case of technological leadership of the other firm. At the same time they cooperate in the joint creation of new products. Three different scenarios emerge: constant technological leadership, the technological leapfrogging and symmetric outcome with or without potential spillovers. R&D is maximal for the first scenario and minimal for the symmetric play under the threat of spillover with endogenous specialization of firms' activities in cases of constant leadership and leapfrogging. Definition of technological competition intensity as inverse to the technology gap allows to recover inverted-U relationship between those two in a multidimensional context.","[Bondarev, Anton] Univ Basel, Dept Econ & Business, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Bondarev, A (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Dept Econ & Business, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",anton.bondarev@unibas.ch,"Bondarev, Anton/AAN-2622-2021; Bondarev, Anton/N-1784-2017; Bondarev, Anton/AAD-1506-2021","Bondarev, Anton/0000-0003-4572-2405; Bondarev, Anton/0000-0003-4572-2405;",,,,,33,4,5,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

In particular, this result implies the existence of equilibria since the men-optimal stable matching is supported by true preferences and hence an equilibrium outcome.

This assumption is increasingly violated in the digital economy, where coupons are traded with increased frequency online. In this paper, we analyze the welfare impacts of coupon trading using a modified Hotelling model where firms send coupons to poach each other's loyal customers. The possibility of coupon trading renders this important instrument for price discrimination less effective. Moreover, coupon distribution has unintended consequences when coupon traders sell coupons back to a firm's loyal customers. Consequently, coupon trading may reduce firms' incentive to distribute coupons, leading to higher prices and profits. We find that, an increase in coupon distribution cost lowers promotion frequency but raises promotion depth, and an increase in the fraction of coupon traders lowers both promotion frequency and promotion depth.","[Kosmopoulou, Georgia] Natl Sci Fdn, 4201 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22230 USA; [Kosmopoulou, Georgia; Liu, Qihong] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, 308 Cate Ctr Dr, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Shuai, Jie] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, 182 Nanhu Ave, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China",National Science Foundation (NSF); University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Shuai, J (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, 182 Nanhu Ave, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China.",georgiak@ou.edu; qliu@ou.edu; shuaijie@gmail.com,,"Liu, Qihong/0000-0002-9143-5311",Office of the Vice President for Research at the University of Oklahoma,Office of the Vice President for Research at the University of Oklahoma,"We would like to thank the Editor Giacomo Corneo and two anonymous referees whose comments allowed us to improve the paper significantly.

We define education-specific measures of job creation and job destruction at the firm level, and we use these measures to construct a measure of surplus job creation, defined as jobs created on top of any simultaneous destruction of similar jobs in incumbent firms in the same region and industry. Using Danish employer-employee data from 2002-2007 that identify the start-ups and that cover almost the entire private sector, these measures allow us to provide a more nuanced assessment of the role of entrepreneurial firms in the job-creation process than in previous studies. Our findings show that although start-ups are responsible for the entire overall net job creation, incumbents account for more than one-third of net job creation within high-skilled jobs. Moreover, start-ups only create approximately half of the surplus jobs and even less of the high-skilled surplus jobs. Finally, our approach allows us to characterise and identify differences across industries, educational groups and regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our estimates imply quality-related competition for viewership between teams in the face of large disparities in quality. However, when both teams are of high quality, viewership increased beyond what own-team success would predict alone for the competing team.

In this paper we consider how product variety affects consumer search intensity and the dispersion of prices in multi-product retail markets. We employ online grocery pricing data from four large retailers in the UK to estimate search costs and equilibrium price dispersion for food products under circumstances where: (i) consumers search for single products; and (ii) consumers search for multiple products at once. We compare estimates in each case between a model in which utility increases with product variety and a model in which utility is not a function of variety. Relative to our preferred specification with variety effects in utility, we find estimates of both search cost and search frequency to be biased upwards in single product settings when variety effects are ignored; however, we find estimates of search costs are biased upwards while search frequency is biased downwards in multi-product settings when variety effects in utility are ignored.

Distinguishing between intra-island, inter-island, and international connectivity is essential in order to understand the nature of the challenges and causes behind the bottlenecks. High domestic shipping costs are identified as one key challenge. The Government of Indonesia has identified improved connectivity as a key issue in promoting economic growth, especially in the manufacturing sector, now that Indonesia can no longer rely on commodities as a driver of growth. Better infrastructure, regulations, and coordination among stakeholders are crucial components in promoting improved connectivity for manufacturing growth. Promoting investment in infrastructure is necessary, including both hard and soft infrastructure. However, Indonesian experience highlights that without regulatory reform and improved policy coordination, infrastructure investment will continue to lag behind. There is a need for an improved and empowered governance structure to turn investment plans into reality.","[Sandee, Henry] World Bank, Indonesia Stock Exchange Bldg, Jakarta 12190, Indonesia",The World Bank,"Sandee, H (通讯作者)，World Bank, Indonesia Stock Exchange Bldg, Jakarta 12190, Indonesia.",hsandee@worldbank.org,,,,,,,10,14,15,1,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

It was also likely that the imperfections would lead to difficulties, possibly even crises. This article identifies six flaws, most of which had been identified even before the launch of the euro. It starts by pinpointing why the Eurozone, a bold and unprecedented experiment, is inherently fragile. It is not conducive to the convergence of national inflation rates, it is not an optimum currency area, and it is not a federal state. Taking these characteristics as given, the article argues that the Eurozone needs to address their implications. It observes that it has not been the case so far, hence the six flaws: fiscal discipline has not been achieved; the need for a Banking Union, which has finally been recognized and only partly implemented; the ECB is not a complete and fully independent central bank; some member countries need a sovereign debt relief; structural reforms are badly needed but intrusiveness cannot be the solution; the governance of the Eurozone is not designed for crisis management.","[Wyplosz, Charles] Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland; [Wyplosz, Charles] CEPR, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Wyplosz, C (通讯作者)，Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland.;Wyplosz, C (通讯作者)，CEPR, Geneva, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,67,7,7,1,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

This lacklustre performance, which remained stubbornly low despite the SSA's growth spurt that started in the mid-1990s, masks a great deal of variations across sectors and countries. Using a structural decomposition, we examine, for a representative sample of SSA countries, the sectoral sources that hold back their convergence to the US frontier. Our results suggest the presence of strong - and possibly long-lasting - headwinds that have wiped out the favourable effects of substantial, yet circumstantial, tailwinds. Headwinds, quantified by the unfavourable within- and reallocation-effects, are indicative of significant capital-deepening and technology gaps, both of which are extremely hard to bridge. The tailwinds, represented by favourable between-effects, result from the convergence of the SSA labour force to sectors where some US sectors have seen a slowdown of their productivity relative to that of the whole economy - a development unrelated to the fundamentals underlying the SSA economy. Although few exceptions emerged out of this general pattern, these results are indicative of a bleak outlook for the SSA economic performance at least in the medium run.","[Harchaoui, Tarek M.] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Global Econ & Management, Groningen, Netherlands; [Ungor, Murat] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey",University of Groningen; Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Üngör, M (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey.",murat.ungor@tcmb.gov.tr,"ÜNGÖR, MURAT/B-4217-2016","ÜNGÖR, MURAT/0000-0002-9217-4221",,,,,14,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We also find that postwar employment had no differential effect on divorce rates of the affected cohorts of women.

Interestingly, this decline is much sharper for women than men, meaning women increasingly marry less educated men as they age. Moreover, quality has worsened for educated women over several decades, while it has improved for men. Using a non-stationary sequential search model, we identify and quantify the search frictions that generate these age-dependent marriage outcomes. We find that single-life utility is typically the dominant friction, though college women in the 1950 and 1970 cohorts are affected even more by deteriorating suitor quality. Regardless of educational status, individual choice (as opposed to pure luck) is pivotal in explaining marriage market outcomes earlier in life. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

If voters take into account only direct effects in the regulated sector, not only workers that enjoy minimum wages but also workers in the other sector are willing to vote for wage rises in each period. The reason is that they expect higher real wages for themselves, too. The political process leads to constantly rising unemployment and tax rates. The resulting crisis may trigger new insights into economic relationships on the part of the voters and may reverse bad times.","[Beilharz, Hans-Joerg] Int Univ Appl Sci Bad Honnef, Bonn, Germany; [Gersbach, Hans] ETH, CER ETH Ctr Econ Res, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Gersbach, Hans] CEPR, London, England",International University of Applied Sciences - Germany; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Gersbach, H (通讯作者)，ETH, CER ETH Ctr Econ Res, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",hgersbach@ethz.ch,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We find that an accommodative monetary policy may be growth-enhancing and welfare improving (through the inequality reduction) while making unpleasant fluctuations more likely. Conversely, a regulation reinforcing the role of collateral and tempering the financial market imperfections may stimulate the economic growth while pursuing the goal of stabilization.

We provide a simple framework to analyze the impact of UC on the allocation of workers between formal and informal activities, as well as the allocation of workers between sectors featuring different incentives to go informal. We show that a reasonable amount of UC may reduce informality, while larger amounts of UC induce large disincentives to go formal because of the level of taxation involved. We also argue that the financing of UC should be part and parcel of a well-conceived UC system. We show that UC finance based on payroll taxes is likely to entail an excess level of informality resulting from cross-subsidies between heterogenous sectors. The introduction of a simple layoff tax meant to finance the UC system is then shown to reduce informality, hence highlighting how a well-designed financing scheme may be used as a supplementary instrument to curb informality.","[Charlot, Olivier] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, Cergy, France; [Malherbet, Franck] CREST, Ecole Polytech, IZA & fRDB, Paris, France; [Ulus, Mustafa] Galatasaray Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",CY Cergy Paris Universite; Galatasaray University,"Charlot, O (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, Cergy, France.;Malherbet, F (通讯作者)，CREST, Ecole Polytech, IZA & fRDB, Paris, France.;Ulus, M (通讯作者)，Galatasaray Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",ocharlot@u-cergy.fr; franck.malherbet@ensae.fr; mulus@gsu.edu.tr,"Ulus, Mustafa/AAC-5227-2020","Ulus, Mustafa/0000-0002-3970-4246; Charlot, Olivier/0000-0003-2245-2369",,,,,40,4,4,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

It shows that technological progress in the North benefits its Southern trading partner. However, if Southern consumers need to hold Northern money to pay for imports, a monetary expansion in the North hurts the South. In particular, it increases the demand for Northern money in the South, which has to be met by a transfer of real resources from the South to the North. This has an adverse effect on the terms of trade for the South and on the trade balance for the North.

Declining demand can give rise to difficult questions for regulators, in particular, the extent to which network operators can fully recover the costs of historic investments, and the efficiency and distributional effects of applying different rate structures. It can also raise fundamental questions about: the on-going rationale for regulation; the essential functions provided by network operators; and whether regulations should be applied symmetrically to traditional and alternative suppliers. Depending on the pace and scale of the decline, regulation may need to adapt. Proposals for adapting regulation are identified and critically examined in this paper, particularly in terms of the approach to setting the allowed level of revenues and the determination of rate structures.","[Decker, Christopher] Univ Oxford, CSLS, Law & Econ, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Decker, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, CSLS, Law & Econ, Oxford, England.",christopher.decker@wolfson.oxon.org,,,,,,,77,8,10,1,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

We find that resource costs explain a large share of bank interest margins, which generates a floor for the interest rate on loans. Idiosyncratic shocks hitting the banking industry generate non-negligible effects on the rest of the economy, but their impact on wages and the rental rate of capital is rather small. The pro-cyclicality of the banking sector is therefore unlikely to feed back strongly to economic activity in the absence of large wealth effects on household. Positive productivity shocks hitting the industrial sector induce sizable increases of the rate on loans and sharp increases in the total hours worked in the banking system. Economy-wide negative technological shocks do indeed generate losses in the banking industry that are not only substantial but are proportionally larger than in the industrial sector. Large banking crises may emerge as a consequence of negative technological shocks hitting bank borrowers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The boom in trade has partly been made possible by the use of resource-for-infrastructure swap agreements (the so-called Angola-mode deals), in which Chinese companies finance and build infrastructure in Africa in exchange for access to natural resources. The concomitant increase in resource export to China has however raised serious concerns that these trade arrangements may reinforce Africa's resource dependence rather than reduce it. In this article we use a dynamic panel data model to examine whether the Angola-mode deals have reinforced resource dependence and impeded export diversification in African countries. Our results indicate that by helping African countries reduce existing infrastructure bottlenecks, resources-for-infrastructure swap deals enabled them to increase their diversification capacity.

On the one hand, such a policy would benefit the older generations in the population by improving their health status. On the other hand, an economy that has a high share of the elderly may sharply increase the tax rate that finances the public health insurance program, which is mainly financed by working-age generations. Due to the trade-off, the impact of the policy on average welfare is ambiguous. To quantify this effect, I examine the South Korean plan to expand its public health insurance despite the country's rapidly aging population. I build an overlapping-generations model and track the effect of the proposed public health insurance expansion on welfare over a transition path. The results suggest that the proposed expansion not only increases average welfare, but also the welfare of the working-age generations who would be more likely to resort to preventative medicine. However, such welfare gains can be lost if implementation of the policy were to be postponed to a later highly old-age dependent economy.","[Lim, Kyoung Mook] Washington Coll, Dept Econ, Chestertown, MD 21620 USA",,"Lim, KM (通讯作者)，Washington Coll, Dept Econ, Chestertown, MD 21620 USA.",mlim2@washcoll.edu,,,,,,,46,0,1,2,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

But the theoretical effect of BMI on marital entry is actually uncertain because women who anticipate poor outcomes in the marriage market are more likely to accept early offers, while women with more desirable characteristics can afford to wait for a better match. Using data from the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we show that female entry into marriage does decline as BMI rises, but that early marriage is nonlinear in BMI. Women with an extremely high BMI or with a BMI in the most attractive range are less likely to marry early.","[Malcolm, Michael] West Chester Univ Penn, Dept Econ, W Chester, PA 19382 USA; [Kaya, Ilker] Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",American University of Sharjah,"Malcolm, M (通讯作者)，West Chester Univ Penn, Dept Econ, W Chester, PA 19382 USA.",mmalcolm@wcupa.edu,"kaya, ilker/S-7910-2019","kaya, ilker/0000-0002-8666-8794",,,,,18,9,9,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

In our setting, the target market is defined as the fraction of consumers that have a positive valuation for the product that is licensed. It is shown that, no matter how thin the target market is, know-how transfer always takes place. Consistent with actual practice, the optimal licensing contract includes a royalty on sales to attenuate the moral hazard problem. However, full know-how transfer will not occur for low enough maximum willingness to pay and high enough convexity of know-how cost. Finally, it is also shown that the effective (inclusive of the royalty) marginal cost exceeds the one when know-how transfer does not occur thus showing a potential malfunction of know-how transfer specially if the recipient is a developing country.","[Mendi, Pedro] Univ Navarra, Navarra Ctr Int Dev, Edificio Bibliotecas, Pamplona 31009, Spain; [Moner-Colonques, Rafael] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal & ERI CES, Fac Econ, Campus Dels Tarongers,Avd Dels Tarongers S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Sempere-Monerris, Jose J.] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal & ERI CES, Voie Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Sempere-Monerris, Jose J.] CORE UCL, Voie Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",University of Navarra; University of Valencia,"Mendi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, Navarra Ctr Int Dev, Edificio Bibliotecas, Pamplona 31009, Spain.",pmendi@unav.es; Rafael.Moner@uv.es,"Sempere-Monerris, Jose J./E-6234-2016; Moner-Colonques, Rafael/E-6302-2016; Mendi, Pedro/K-9218-2014","Sempere-Monerris, Jose J./0000-0001-6759-2117; Moner-Colonques, Rafael/0000-0002-4389-0870; Mendi, Pedro/0000-0001-7253-7534",Fundacion Ramon Areces; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-45045-R]; Generalitat Valenciana [PROMETEOII/2014/054],Fundacion Ramon Areces; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)),"We thank the editor and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Its budget has experienced a long period of stagnation and decline, with its real value in 2013 below that in 1980 and having declined by 50 percent as a percent of the total NSF budget. The number of grants made by the program has also declined over time, and its current budget is very small compared to that of many other funders of economic research. Over the years, NSF-supported research has supported many of the major intellectual developments in the discipline that have made important contributions to the study of public policy. The public goods argument for government support of basic economic research is strong. Neither private firms, foundations, nor private donors are likely to engage in the comprehensive support of all forms of economic research if NSF were not to exist. Select universities with large endowments are more likely to have the ability to support general economic research in the absence of NSF, but most universities do not have endowments sufficiently large to do so. Support for large-scale general purpose dataset collection is particularly unlikely to receive support from any nongovernment agency. On a priori grounds, it is likely that most NSF-funded research represents a net increase in research effort rather than displacing already-occurring effort by academic economists. Unfortunately, the empirical literature on the net aggregate impact of NSF economics funding is virtually nonexistent.","[Moffitt, Robert A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Econ, Baltimore, MD 21211 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Moffitt, RA (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Econ, Baltimore, MD 21211 USA.",moffitt@jhu.edu,,,,,,,55,2,2,0,5,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Such games may behave differently from either games with strategic complements or games with strategic substitutes. Under mild assumptions (on one or two players only), the equilibrium set in a GSH is totally unordered (no two equilibria are comparable in the standard product order). Moreover, under mild assumptions (on one player only), parameterized GSH do not allow decreasing equilibrium selections. In general, this cannot be strengthened to conclude increasing selections. Monotone comparative statics results are presented for games in which some players exhibit strategic substitutes and others exhibit strategic complements. For two-player games with linearly ordered strategy spaces, there is a characterization. More generally, there are sufficient conditions. The conditions apply only to players exhibiting strategic substitutes; no additional conditions are needed for players with strategic complements.

This is done by determining whether they experience symmetric responses to common shocks. Given that the problem of dimensionality plagues large-scale macroeconomic modelling, a Global VAR model by Pesaran, Schuermann, and Weiner (2004) and Dees, Mauro, Pesaran, and Smith (2007) is used. The results in this paper provide some weak evidence of symmetric responses to the common (global) shocks of interest: a US monetary policy shock, a US output shock, a Chinese output shock; an oil price shock. Shocks from the US produced the most symmetric responses. The lack of symmetry in some cases has implications for further policy coordination. Since migrant remittances could provide an adjustment mechanism, further labour market integration is needed as it currently lags behind trade and financial integration in the region.

Panel Smooth Threshold Regressions indicate the existence of strong threshold effects in the aid-tax relationship depending on the level of government stability. They also indicate that the effect of aid on tax revenue is gradual and varies across countries according to the level of government stability. We find that aid directly reduces tax revenues but for higher levels of government stability it enhances tax performance. We provide estimates of country time-varying coefficients of aid effect. We find on average a positive impact of aid.

Students borrow more in response to both tuition increases and appropriation cuts. This article investigates the feedback of how borrowing and tuition influence state appropriations. Using a panel data set of 450 four-year public universities from 1999 to 2012, we employ three-stage least squares techniques to control for the endogeneity between state appropriations, tuition and student borrowing. There is evidence that state policy-makers respond to increases in university tuition and student borrowing by decreasing future appropriation levels. After controlling for the effect of appropriations on tuition and borrowing, a one-dollar increase in student borrowing reduces state appropriations per student by $0.06, and a one-dollar increase in tuition results in a decrease of $0.45 in state appropriations per student. When universities increase tuition for reasons other than a reduction in state appropriations, policy-makers respond with a significant cut in future appropriations which could signal an incentive strategy.","[Raisanen, Samuel R.] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA; [Birkeland, Kathryn F.] Univ S Dakota, Beacom Sch Business, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA",Central Michigan University; University of South Dakota,"Birkeland, KF (通讯作者)，Univ S Dakota, Beacom Sch Business, Vermillion, SD 57069 USA.",Kathryn.Birkeland@usd.edu,,"Raisanen, Samuel/0000-0003-3620-1157",,,,,6,3,11,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Effectively this means that the main characteristics of the model simplify to a random walk model with age-specific drift components. But restricting the adjustment mechanism of the stochastic and linear trend components to be identical may be too strong a simplification. In fact, the presence of a stochastic trend component may itself result from a bias induced by properly fitting the linear trend that characterizes mortality data. We find empirical evidence that this feature of the Lee-Carter model overly restricts the system dynamics and we suggest to separate the deterministic and stochastic time series components at the benefit of improved fit and forecasting performance. In fact, we find that the classical Lee-Carter model will otherwise overestimate the reduction of mortality for the younger age groups and will underestimate the reduction of mortality for the older age groups. In practice, our recommendation means that the Lee-Carter model instead of a one-factor model should be formulated as a two-(or several) factor model where one factor is deterministic and the other factors are stochastic. This feature generalizes to the range of models that extend the Lee-Carter model in various directions.","[Callot, Laurent] Free Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Callot, Laurent] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Callot, Laurent; Haldrup, Niels; Kallestrup-Lamb, Malene] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark; [Callot, Laurent; Haldrup, Niels; Kallestrup-Lamb, Malene] CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Aarhus University; CREATES,"Haldrup, N (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark.;Haldrup, N (通讯作者)，CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark.",nhaldrup@creates.au.dk,,"Haldrup, Niels/0000-0003-0207-8234",CREATES - Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series - Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF78],CREATES - Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series - Danish National Research Foundation,"This research was supported by CREATES - Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series (DNRF78), funded by the Danish National Research Foundation.",,11,10,11,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Our main result demonstrates that any payoff profile that exceeds the pure minmax payoff profile can be approximately sustained by a pure strategy finite memory subgame perfect equilibrium of the repeated game if the players are sufficiently patient. We also show that the result can be extended to any payoff profile that exceeds the mixed minmax payoff profile if players can randomize at each stage of the repeated game. Our results requires neither time-dependent strategies, nor public randomization, nor any communication. The type of strategies we employ to establish our result turn out to have new features that may be important in understanding repeated interactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This paper investigates the impact of leniency programs on cartel stability when demand is uncertain and firms cannot perfectly observe their rival's choices. We show that pre-investigation leniency may or may not be effective in destroying the cartel, but in neither case affects the duration of price wars. Post-investigation leniency may have ambiguous welfare effects, in affecting both cartel stability and price wars duration. LPs applying in situations where leniency is not urgently needed may be not only ineffective, but also welfare reducing. Hence, in markets where negative demand shocks are sufficiently frequent, leniency policies may produce undesirable effects.","[Charistos, Konstantinos] Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, 156 Egnatia Str, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece",University of Macedonia,"Charistos, K (通讯作者)，Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, 156 Egnatia Str, Thessaloniki 54006, Greece.",kostchar@uom.edu.gr,,"Charistos, Konstantinos/0000-0002-1848-546X",,,,,12,0,0,2,18,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

In China, the central government is responsible for policy formation and the local governments are responsible for policy implementation, where local governments are allowed ample flexibility in the ways to achieve the policy mandate. This arrangement is conducive to local competition, but there is no built-in mechanism in the system to regulate such competition. The system is defective in the execution of an industrial policy in that it fails to discipline the recipients of policy favours and to make efficient exit selections. Because local competition involves policy resources as well as economic resources, the outcome of competition is not necessarily consistent with the comparative advantage of the region. The more that policy is emphasised in industrial development, the more that competition tends to favour large and rich cities. After a certain period of hands-off local competition, the timing of which is unpredictable but will come when the industry runs into troubles, the central government holds the ultimate power to determine the winners. The central government typically picks the 'large and strong' firms as the winners, which are crowned as a national team and became eligible for further policy support. This institutional set-up produces a rapidly growing industry, which often results in over-capacity but not necessarily a competitive industry. I use the case of China's solar photovoltaic industry to illustrate these points.","[Chen, Tain-Jy] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chen, TJ (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, 1,Sect 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.",tainjy@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,45,20,20,0,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Using data on light sweet crude oil futures from 2004 to 2013, which contains a crisis period, we examine the importance of volatility and jumps extracted from the futures in explaining CDS spread changes. The analysis is performed at an index level and by rating group; as well as for the pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis periods. Our findings are consistent with Merton's theoretical framework. At an index level, futures jumps are important when explaining CDS spread changes, with negative jumps having higher impact during the crisis. The continuous volatility part is significant and positive, indicating that futures volatility conveys relevant information for the CDS market. As for the analysis per rating group, negative jumps have an increasing importance as the credit rating deteriorates and during the crisis period, while the results for positive jumps and futures volatility are mixed. Overall, the relation between the CDS market and the futures market is stronger during volatile periods and strengthened after the Global Financial Crisis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Does this in-turn lead to worse labour market outcome for minorities? We assess these important questions using British attitude and labour force data. The attitude data show that racial prejudice is counter cyclical, with the effect driven by large increases for high-skilled middle-aged working men - a 1%-point increase in unemployment is estimated to increase self-reported racial prejudice by 4%-points. Correspondingly, the labour force data show that racial employment and wage gaps are counter-cyclical, with the largest effects also observed for high skilled men, especially in the manufacturing and construction industries-a 1%-point increase in unemployment is estimated to increase the wage gap by 3%. These results are entirely consistent with the theoretical literature, which proposes that racial prejudice and discrimination are the result of labour market competition among individuals with similar traits, and that the effects of this competition are exacerbated during periods of economic downturn.

Our contribution is both theoretical and methodological. We conduct a multivariate analysis employing nonlinear tools, namely the Partial Transfer Entropy and the Asymmetric Mackey-Glass causality test. In particular, we build a system comprising the petroleum complex (crude oil, gasoline and heating oil), the S&P500 index and the 1-month futures-spot spread for crude oil. By adopting a rolling-window approach, we observe a persistent lead-lag relationship between the S&P500 index and the market participants' expectations for crude oil, from 2004 to 2009. Depending on the bubble period in the stock market, it appears that the resulting coupling becomes subject to the deterioration of global economic activity, induced by large common shocks.

When agents observe only one signal, they have no incentive to reveal the signal because such a revelation would negate their information advantage. However, when agents observe multiple signals, they may be incentivized to reveal certain signals that could lower their opponents' bids and thereby result in a higher profit from other signals. This paper shows that there exists an equilibrium with revelation of common-value signals in standard auctions, which is an efficient equilibrium that maximizes the social welfare and could provide the seller with a higher profit than a situation with no information revelation.

We review the emerging literature, which investigates the institutional determinants of political selection. We discuss pay in politics, parties, their candidate selection procedures and electoral rules, institutions enhancing transparency in politics, and institutions which govern dual office holding in different branches of government. We argue that further comparative analyses are essential in order to gain an improved understanding of the impact that institutions have on political outcomes, not only via the channel of accountability, but also via the channel of selection.","[Braendle, Thomas] Univ Basel, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Braendle, Thomas] Fed Dept Finance, Bern, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Braendle, T (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland.;Braendle, T (通讯作者)，Fed Dept Finance, Bern, Switzerland.",thomas.braendle@efv.admin.ch,,,,,,,129,14,16,2,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

As many best-selling games contain hyper-realistic violence, many researchers and policymakers have hypothesized that violent games cause violent behaviors. Laboratory experiments have found evidence suggesting that violent video games increase aggression. Before drawing policy conclusions about the effect of violent games on actual behavior, these experimental studies should be subjected to tests of external validity. Our study uses a quasi-experimental methodology to identify the short-run and medium-run effects of violent game sales on violent crime using time variation in retail unit sales data of the top 30 selling video games and violent criminal offenses from both the Uniform Crime Report and the National Incident-Based Reporting System from 2005 to 2011.

We provide empirical evidence on this question by using a reform to the UK tax-credit system in 2003 as a quasi-experiment. We find that the reform caused low-income households to reallocate spending towards children's goods. The results further demonstrate that the effects of directing welfare benefits to women can extend beyond child expenditures to goods that are collectively consumed by all household members.

In a repeated rounds design the timing of feedback (delayed vs. immediate) is investigated in combination with a reduction of wealth in some periods, presented either as a rather unfair intervention of the authorities, or due to a comparatively neutral manipulation. The results reveal a strong impact of timing of feedback on tax compliance: participants in conditions of delayed feedback show significantly higher compliance than those in conditions of immediate feedback. In addition, participants receiving delayed feedback are more likely to state that the probability of audit is high as well as that fines in case of detection are severe, but on the other hand perceive the timing of feedback and the authorities as more unfair. No main effect of the reason for the wealth reduction could be identified. The finding that the difference in compliance between delayed and immediate feedback on tax audits develops over time supports the assumption that in decisions based on experience the probabilities of rare events are underweighted, while in decisions based on descriptions people make choices as if they overweight probabilities of rare events.

We consider a general functional form for agents' utility that incorporates both the effects of distance and of neighbors' degree. Consequently, we introduce a framework that can be seen as a degree-distance-based connections model with both negative and positive externalities. Our analysis shows how the introduction of negative externalities modifies certain results about stability and efficiency compared to the original connections model. In particular, we see the emergence of new stable structures, such as a star with links between peripheral nodes. We also identify structures, for example, certain disconnected networks, that are efficient in our model but which could not be efficient in the original connections model. While our results are proved for the general utility function, some of them are illustrated by using a specific functional form of the degree-distance-based utility.","[Moehlmeier, Philipp] Univ Bielefeld, BiGSEM, Ctr Math Econ, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Rusinowska, Agnieszka] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, CNRS, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75247 Paris 05, France; [Tanimura, Emily] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Bd Hop 106 112, F-75647 Paris, France",University of Bielefeld; Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Möhlmeier, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, BiGSEM, Ctr Math Econ, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany.;Rusinowska, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, CNRS, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, F-75247 Paris 05, France.;Tanimura, E (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Bd Hop 106 112, F-75647 Paris, France.",philipp.moehlmeier@uni-bielefeld.de; agnieszka.rusinowska@univ-paris1.fr; Emily.Tanimura@univ-paris1.fr,"Rusinowska, Agnieszka/KCL-5447-2024","Rusinowska, Agnieszka/0000-0003-3803-9907","National Agency for Research (Agence Nationale de la Recherche), Project DynaMITE [ANR-13-BSH1-0010-01]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [GRK 1134/2]; Bielefeld Graduate School of Economcis and Management (BiGSEM); EBIM; BiGSEM; Center for Mathematical Economics; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-13-BSH1-0010] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)","National Agency for Research (Agence Nationale de la Recherche), Project DynaMITE(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Bielefeld Graduate School of Economcis and Management (BiGSEM); EBIM; BiGSEM; Center for Mathematical Economics; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","We would like to thank an anonymous referee, the editor, and participants of the conference The Role of Externalities in Networks (Baton Rouge, February 23-24, 2013), in particular Hans Haller, Ahmed Saber Mahmud, and Sudipta Sarangi, and also Herbert Dawid and Tim Hellmann, for helpful comments.

Use of task-based occupation measures, such as 0*Net, may mitigate the bias caused by coding error if the occupation is misclassified as an occupation similar to the true occupation. Measuring occupational changes in task space, I find that task-based measures reduce the problems of coding error, but only slightly. If one does not correct for coding error, one overestimates traditional occupational mobility rates by about 90%; using task-based measures, the overestimate of mobility is still 75%. I also show that when tasks are used as regressors and coding error is not corrected, estimates will be attenuated by 15%-20%. Task-based measures are a slight improvement over census occupation codes but are no panacea for dealing with coding error. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The banking system is built as a network of heterogeneous banks which are connected with one another. In such a system, single credit events propagate through the interbank market from debtors to creditors and across the system. The shock is imposed as an unexpected event. We demonstrate that while idiosyncratic shocks cannot substantially disturb the banking system, a systemic shock of even a moderate magnitude can be highly detrimental. Such shock includes a huge contagious potential. We demonstrate that the costs of the shock are largely determined by the extent of contagion and range from negligible to catastrophic. The results imply that a severe crisis has to be initiated by a systemic shock of at least moderate magnitude. Capital ratio and the bank size are two additional factors of the banking system stability. Finally, credit risk analysis is sensitive to the network topology and exhibits a profound nonlinear characteristic.","[Steinbacher, Matjaz] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Steinbacher, Mitja] Fac Business Studies, Ciril Metodov Trg 9, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Steinbacher, Matej] Univ Donja Gorica, Podgorica 81000, Montenegro",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Donja Gorica,"Steinbacher, M (通讯作者)，Fac Business Studies, Ciril Metodov Trg 9, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",matjaz.steinbacher@gmail.com; mitja.steinbacher@gmail.com,"Steinbacher, Mitja/JZT-8846-2024; Steinbacher, Matjaz/Y-8029-2019","Steinbacher, Matjaz/0000-0003-4521-8890; Steinbacher, Mitja/0000-0003-1865-6262",,,,,55,10,11,0,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

It describes the decline in the sectoral shares of domestic value-added in a country's exports as the country becomes more integrated into the global value chains (GVCs). We argue that the decline of the domestic value-added share in a country's exports is likely to be caused by the expansion of high value-adding activities performed by foreign lead firms in the upper stream of the GVCs. The variables of interest the domestic value-added share in exports and foreign high-skill labor embodied in a country's exports (a proxy for foreign lead firms' high value-adding activities) are estimated using a multi-regional global input-output model. Using these results and other control variables, we apply a panel cointegration model to explain and assess the likelihood of value-added erosion and its possible determinants.","[Caraballo, Jose G.] Univ Puerto Rico, Cayey, PR USA; [Jiang, Xiao] Denison Univ, Granville, OH 43023 USA",University of Puerto Rico; University of Puerto Rico at Cayey; University System of Ohio; Denison University,"Caraballo, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Puerto Rico, Cayey, PR USA.",,,,,,,,15,18,19,3,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

This paper considers theoretically and empirically how exporters' dependence on imported inputs affects their choice of invoicing currency. The model predicts that exporters that depend more on foreign currency-denominated inputs are less likely to price in their home currency. I test this and other theoretical results using a novel dataset that covers UK trade transactions with non-EU countries. I find considerable support for the model's predictions. A 10 percentage point higher share of foreign currency-denominated inputs is associated with a 20 percentage point higher probability of pricing in the same foreign currency relative to the producer's currency.

Identification often involves assuming either that policy shocks are different to those on other news days (identification via heteroskedasticity) or, that they are the same (homogeneity). These monetary policy changes sometimes cause shifts in the yield curve and sometimes rotations. An additional identifying assumption is typically made whether this behavior reflects a single type of monetary policy shock or, whether two types of shocks are present. This paper applies a single theoretical framework to empirical evidence from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States prior to and following the crisis events of 2008.

Knight's course on Business Cycles at the University of California at Berkeley in the fall of 1936. It emerges from the notes that the methodological gap between Keynes and Knight was irreducible, which explains the harsh tone of Knight's published review of The General Theory. Connected to this is Knight's strenuous defense of the 'postulates of classical political economy' as criticized by Keynes in chapter 2 of his book, an argument that was better expounded in the classroom than in the review. However, besides strong criticisms, a few constructive remarks can also be found in the notes. In criticizing Keynes, Knight proposed an interesting analysis of the business cycle that he did not develop in the published review of The General Theory, and there is even some evidence that Knight was attracted to Keynes's discussion of 'liquidity preference.'","[Fiorito, Luca] Univ Palermo, I-90133 Palermo, Italy",University of Palermo,,,"Cristiano, Carlo/JDM-4376-2023","Cristiano, Carlo/0000-0002-8657-6187",,,,,0,4,4,0,1,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

We claim that this simplification is obtained either by neglecting the other players' incentives and beliefs or by taking them into consideration only for a subset of game outcomes. We analyze subjects' eye movements while playing a series of two-person, 3 9 3 one-shot games in normal form. Games within each class differ by a set of descriptive features (i.e., features that can be changed without altering the game equilibrium properties). Data show that subjects on average perform partial or non-strategic analysis of the payoff matrix, often ignoring the opponent's payoffs and rarely performing the necessary steps to detect dominance. Our analysis of eye-movements supports the hypothesis that subjects use simple decision rules such as choose the strategy with the highest average payoff'' or choose the strategy leading to an attractive and symmetric outcome'' without (optimally) incorporating knowledge on the opponent's behavior. Lookup patterns resulted being feature and game invariant, heterogeneous across subjects, but stable within subjects. Using a cluster analysis, we find correlations between eye-movements and choices; however, applying the Cognitive Hierarchy model to our data, we show that only some of the subjects present both information search patterns and choices compatible with a specific cognitive level. We also find a series of correlations between strategic behavior and individual characteristics like risk attitude, short-term memory capacity, and mathematical and logical abilities.","[Devetag, Giovanna] Luiss Guido Carli, Dept Business & Management, Viale Pola 12, I-00198 Rome, Italy; [Di Guida, Sibilla] Univ So Denmark, COHERE, Dept Econ & Business, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Di Guida, Sibilla] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, SBS EM, Brussels, Belgium; [Polonio, Luca] Univ Trent, Dept Cognit Sci & Educ, Corso Bettini 31, I-38068 Rovereto, Italy; [Polonio, Luca] Univ Trent, Ctr Mind & Brain Sci, Corso Bettini 31, I-38068 Rovereto, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University; University of Southern Denmark; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; University of Trento; University of Trento,"Di Guida, S (通讯作者)，Univ So Denmark, COHERE, Dept Econ & Business, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",giovanna.devetag@gmail.com; sidg@sam.sdu.dk; luca.polonio@unitn.it,"Polonio, Luca/AAD-8190-2022","polonio, luca/0000-0001-6088-0482; Di Guida, Sibilla/0000-0002-3548-4733","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research'' (MIUR); Fonds de la Recherche Fondamentale Collective [2.4614.12]; Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Perugia","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research'' (MIUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Fonds de la Recherche Fondamentale Collective(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Perugia(Fondazione Cassa Risparmio Perugia)","Financial supports from the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research'' (MIUR, project PRIN 2008), from the Fonds de la Recherche Fondamentale Collective'' (research grant Preference dynamics in adaptive networks'', no 2.4614.12) and from the Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Perugia'' (grant Ricerca di Base 2010'') are gratefully acknowledged.

In order to do so, we draw parallels between the work of Elinor Ostrom on principles of sustainable governance and Branko Horvat's theory of self-management developed in the context of socialist Yugoslavia. We employ Foucault's concept of governmentality to address the need for a socialist political rationale and governing principles, drawing our starting points from Ostrom and Horvat. First, we leave behind commons theorizing that relies on exodus strategies, instead drawing inspiration from Yugoslav self-management as an attempt of linking up the firm to wider social relations aimed at creating egalitarian, radically democratic, and materially sustainable societies. Second, we propose that the search for alternatives to capitalism and etatism goes beyond a change in ownership regime, and into principles of governance. While much of the contemporary progressive political agenda is concerned with distributional issues, we propose that devising governance principles to disable the formation of class control is the crucial innovation needed to advance a socialist governmentality. Finally, formulating the principles of socialist governmentality requires abandoning our reliance on indefinite economic growth which is seriously threatening the material base of human life.","[Dolenec, Danijela] Univ Zagreb, Fac Polit Sci, Ozujska 11, HR-10110 Zagreb, Croatia; [Zitko, Mislav] Univ Zagreb, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb,"Dolenec, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Polit Sci, Ozujska 11, HR-10110 Zagreb, Croatia.",ddolenec@fpzg.hr,,"Dolenec, Danijela/0000-0001-5974-3499",,,,,61,4,5,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

The analysis identifies structural changes in the composition of Mexico's trade and the parameters that affect it across five subperiods marked by statistical breakpoints. The results indicate that a tightening of the balance-of-payments constraint may account for the post-liberalisation slowdown in Mexico's growth only during certain subperiods and that the impact of real exchange rate changes on the trade balance has diminished, most likely as a result of the increasing integration of export industries into global supply chains. The results also suggest an asymmetry, whereby a country cannot sustain growth above the rate consistent with balance-of-payments equilibrium, as expected, but it can grow persistently below that rate when other constraints are more binding.","[Ibarra, Carlos A.] Univ Americas Puebla, Cholula, Mexico; [Blecker, Robert A.] Amer Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Universidad Americas Puebla (UDLAP); American University,"Blecker, RA (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",blecker@american.edu,,,,,,,46,18,22,0,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Then we determine empirically the influence of each of these dimensions on Spaniards tax morale. The exercise is performed for the period 2003-2010 with the Fiscal Barometer database provided by the Spanish Institute for Fiscal Studies. Besides a probit estimation, common in the literature, an OLS regression is carried out to estimate the impact of a tax morale indicator constructed with the principal components technique. Overall, the results achieved substantially confirm the theoretical predictions. Tax morale in Spain is influenced by factors belonging to the three dimensions identified.","[Lopez Laborda, Julio; Sanz Arcega, Eduardo] Univ Zaragoza, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Laborda, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain.",,"ARCEGA, EDUARDO SANZ/AAA-1615-2019",,,,,,85,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

Using panel data from 1991 to 2011, we conduct panel regression to examine whether the relationship between banks, stock markets, and economic growth differs across income levels, and to identify the channels through which financial development affects economic growth. The empirical evidence suggests that, in low- and middle-income countries, banking development has a positive impact on economic growth. However, contrary to the conventional findings, the impact is negative in high-income countries. Moreover, stock market development and economic growth are positively associated in both middle- and high-income countries. Therefore, it seems that a well-functioning financial system may not always be sufficient to achieve economic growth in high-income countries, while it promotes economic growth in developing countries.

We prove that in all finite generic extensive-form games of perfect information, every solution trajectory to the continuous-time best-response dynamic converges to a Nash equilibrium component. We show the robustness of-this convergence in the sense that along any interior approximate best-response trajectory, the evolving state is close to the set of Nash equilibria most of the time. We also prove that in any perfect-information game in which every play contains at most one decision node of each player, any interior approximate best-response trajectory converges to the backward-induction strategy profile. Our final result concerns self-confirming equilibria in perfect-information games. If each player always best responds to her conjecture of the current strategy profile, and she updates her conjecture based only on observed moves, then the dynamic will converge to the set of self-confirming equilibria.

In this paper, we analyze the causes of the prolonged slowdown of the Japanese economy (the lost decade). Economics Nobel laureate Paul Krugman has argued that Japan's lost decade is an example of a liquidity trap. However, our empirical analysis shows that stagnation of the Japanese economy comes from its vertical IS curve rather than a horizontal LM curve, so the Japanese economy has been facing structural problems rather than a temporary downturn. The vertical IS curve is caused by an insensitivity of investment to a lower interest rate partly because of the decline of sales due to the aging population and firms not wanting to invest. The structural problems come from the aging demographic, which is often neglected by scholars and policy-makers, and also from the allocation of transfers from the central government to local governments, and the unwillingness of Japanese banks to lend money to startup businesses and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), mainly because of Basel capital requirements. Many countries, like China, are expected to face similar issues, particularly given the aging population. The present paper will address why the Japanese economy has been trapped in a prolonged slowdown and provide some remedies for revitalizing the economy.","[Yoshino, Naoyuki] Keio Univ, Asian Dev Bank Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Yoshino, Naoyuki; Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farhad] Keio Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farhad] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan",Keio University; Keio University; University of Tokyo,"Taghizadeh-Hesary, F (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Tokyo, Japan.;Taghizadeh-Hesary, F (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.",nyoshino@adbi.org; farhadth@gmail.com,"Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farhad/R-5136-2018","Taghizadeh-Hesary, Farhad/0000-0001-5446-7093; Yoshino, Naoyuki/0000-0001-8060-5314",,,,,31,15,16,1,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2016,24.0,2,,,,,23,47,,10.1111/cwe.12149,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DH7VH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373001400002,0

We differ from the rest of the literature on reciprocal contracting by assuming that punishments cannot be enforced in the event that cooperation breaks down. We fully characterize the outcomes that can be supported as perfect Bayesian equilibrium outcomes in such an environment. We use our characterization to show that the set of supportable outcomes with reciprocal contracting is larger than the set of outcomes available in a centralized mechanism design environment in which the mechanism designer is constrained by his inability to enforce punishments against non-participants. The difference stems from the players' ability in our contracting game to convey partial information about their types at the time they offer contracts.

More specifically, this article proposes a research hypothesis to address the question: Do individuals who are strongly tied to other individuals within the social networks become more health conscious or literate and hence use more health services? This paper extends prior research on social support, health literacy and health care utilization to investigate the association between social interaction and health service demand. Using the China Health and Nutrition Survey, the paper provides cross-sectional evidence that people who are socially active and connected with their friends made more visits to health care providers. It also finds that people of male gender, being single, having more years of education, and no health insurance coverage tend to avoid seeking health services. The quasi-experimental study, which examines the events that exogenously intensified social interactions in some but not all Chinese provinces, indicates that social capital is more an antecedent than a consequence of health service needs.

The latter optimum involves, in general, decreasing lifetime consumption profiles as well as raising the retirement age. This result is robust to the introduction of unequal life expectancies and unequal productivities.","Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Leroux, Marie-Louise] ESG Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, CIRPEE, Dep Sc Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; CORE, Louvain, Belgium; Univ Liege, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; PSE, Paris, France; CEPR, London, England; Univ Paris East Creteil, Paris, France; Inst Univ France, Paris, France",Princeton University; University of Liege; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Institut Universitaire de France,"Ponthiere, G (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Ecole Normale Super, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",gregory.ponthiere@ens.fr,"Fleurbaey, Marc/HHS-9231-2022",,ANR Equirisk (Equity in Risky Intertemporal Economic Environments) [ANR-12-INEG-0006-01],ANR Equirisk (Equity in Risky Intertemporal Economic Environments)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"The authors are grateful to Benoit Decerf, Gabrielle Demange, Jean-Francois Laslier, John Leach, Alessandro Lizzeri, Nicola Persico, Thomas Piketty, Pierre Yared, Stephane Zuber, and an anonymous referee for their comments on this article.

Applying a decomposition of FDI strategies to the universe of cross-border mergers (the dominant form of FDI) over the period 1999-2010, it emerges that taxes have a much more nuanced effect on FDI than frequently suggested; while corporate taxes affect FDI negatively, the tax elasticity varies depending on the FDI strategy (with vertical FDI being in general more responsive), the exact measure of taxation, and international tax considerations (double taxation, withholding taxes). Sales taxes also affect FDI, but only horizontally.","[Herger, Nils] Study Ctr Gerzensee, Dorfstrasse 2,POB 21, CH-3115 Gerzensee, Switzerland; [Kotsogiannis, Christos; McCorriston, Steve] Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England; [Kotsogiannis, Christos] CESIfo, Munich, Germany",Study Center Gerzensee; University of Exeter; Ifo Institut,"McCorriston, S (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Rennes Dr, Exeter EX4 4PU, Devon, England.",nils.herger@szgerzensee.ch; c.kotsogiannis@exeter.ac.uk; s.mccorriston@ex.ac.uk,,"Kotsogiannis, Christos/0000-0002-1081-4046; Herger, Nils/0000-0003-2641-3412",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-37572],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"The comments of two anonymous referees are acknowledged with thanks.

Using U.S. stock prices from the CRSP database for the 1995-2011 period, this paper is the first study that empirically determines the BPT optimal portfolio. We show that Shefrin and Statman's (2000) optimal portfolio is Mean Variance (MV) efficient in more than 70% of cases. However, our results also indicate that the BPT portfolio exhibits a high level of risk, high returns and positively skewed returns. We show that the risk aversion coefficient of the BPT portfolio is up to 10 times lower than the risk aversion degree shown by typical MV investors. Even if the asset allocations may coincide, typical MV investors will not usually select the BPT optimal portfolios. These results underline that MVT and BPT cannot be used interchangeably.

This paper explains all four of these stylized facts within a single model as a result of the interaction between the common monetary policy, inflation heterogeneity and a relaxation of the credit constraint in the nontradable sector of the periphery. When nontradable goods are used as collateral, an increase in their prices can initiate an overborrowing spiral and lead to a balance of payment imbalances. Furthermore, the model endogenizes differences in unit labor costs between the core and the periphery of the Euro area.","[Sy, Mouhamadou] African Dev Bank AfDB, Res Dept, EDRE, Ave Jean Paul II,BP V 316 Abidjan, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire",African Development Bank Group (AfDB),"Sy, M (通讯作者)，African Dev Bank AfDB, Res Dept, EDRE, Ave Jean Paul II,BP V 316 Abidjan, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire.",m.sy@afdb.org,,,,,,,62,3,4,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We find that renouncing monetary policy autonomy becomes a cost of currency integration when the consumption basket weights differ between candidate countries and when country-specific total factor productivity (TFP) shocks hit economies, even when the union fulfills the classic optimum currency area theory of labor mobility. We also found that a firm's PTM behavior has a significant effect on the welfare implications of currency integration combined with labor mobility. For instance, currency integration does not produce greater welfare losses in the PTM case (where the labor input weights differ across member countries and asymmetric labor disutility shocks occur), although greater welfare losses arise in the case of producer currency pricing.","[Yoshimi, Taiyo] Nanzan Univ, Dept Econ, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",,"Yoshimi, T (通讯作者)，Nanzan Univ, Dept Econ, Showa Ku, 18 Yamazato Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4668673, Japan.",yoshimi@nanzan-u.ac.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [15H05393]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H05393] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (A) [15H05393].",,30,0,0,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

The main determinants of technological and non-technological innovations are the level of investment in innovation activities and the size of the firm.

In this differentiated product market, tariff reductions through Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) are expected to strengthen the competitiveness of imported beef and, therefore, to mitigate the effects arising from the market power of domestic marketers. The present study develops a simulation model that evaluates this mitigating effect by explicitly reflecting the market structure that domestic beef marketers constitute. The simulation results indicate that the farm-retail marketing margin would decrease by 10.59% or 6.79% due to the Korea-US and Korea-Australia FTAs, respectively, if domestic beef marketers formed a cartel or an oligopoly market (i.e. the degree of market power is 0.5), while the marketing margin under a competitive market scenario is simulated to have no change. The value of beef production would decrease by 1009 million dollars if the marketers form a cartel and hence exercise monopoly power. The FTAs are simulated to reduce the value of beef production by 564 million dollars under the competitive market scenario.","[Ahn, Byeong-Il] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",Korea University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Ahn, BI (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",ahn08@korea.ac.kr,,"Ahn, Byeong-il/0000-0002-3504-2898",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2012S1A2A1A01031554],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government [NRF-2012S1A2A1A01031554].,,29,2,2,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Our model makes it possible to analyse, in terms of convergence, the results obtained in Spanish regions with the policies implemented during the period 1980-2011. The results support the idea that education and fiscal policies have a positive effect on regional development and cohesion. Therefore, we can conclude that it is possible to obtain better results for regional convergence with higher rates of public investment in education and tax revenues.

In this paper we evaluate the welfare and macroeconomic effects of increasing the retirement age for various demographic scenarios under three major pension systems (defined benefit, notionally defined contribution and funded defined contribution). We compare populations with decreasing fertility, increasing longevity and one subject to both of these changes, and show that the welfare effects of raising MERA stem mainly from longevity. We show that - for increasing longevity - raising the retirement age is universally welfare enhancing for all living and future cohorts, regardless of the pension system and fertility. Finally, we show scope for further welfare gains if productivity is relatively high at old ages.

The pro arguments made in response are that the claimed elusiveness is not a problem. Furthermore, many of the evaluation problems inherent in the empirical use of Tobin ' s q, like estimation of replacement cost of assets, can be avoided.

We link payout and smoothing decisions to different regulatory mechanisms (cost-based vs. incentive regulation) and state versus private ownership. We test our predictions on a panel of listed European electric utilities, accounting for potential endogeneity of the choice of regulatory and ownership patterns. We find that incentive-regulated firms smooth their dividends less than cost-based regulated firms and that they report higher target payout ratios. Consistent with the interest group theory of regulation, we find that incentive regulation schemes are less likely when the state is still an important shareholder in the sector. Additionally, our results show that government control undermines the efficiency-enhancing effects of incentive regulation on dividend policy, for example, lower smoothing is only due to private firms.

In this paper we exploit a feature of teacher labour markets to determine the impact of teacher wages. Teacher wages are commonly set in a manner that results in flat wages across heterogeneous labour markets. This creates an exogenous gap between the outside labour market and inside (regulated) wage for teachers. We use the centralised wage regulation of teachers in England to examine the effect of pay on school performance. We use data on over 3000 schools containing around 200,000 teachers who educate around half a million children per year. We find that teachers respond to pay. A ten percent shock to the wage gap between local labour market and teacher wages results in an average loss of around 2% in average school performance in the key exams taken at the end of compulsory schooling in England.

In order to achieve this objective, we examine a number of determinants of migration from the EU candidate and potential candidate countries to the EU member countries and specify and estimate an extended gravity model of migration, based on panel data analysis, for six EU candidate and potential candidate countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia(1), Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey) and EU-27 member states in the period 2001-2014. Our results indicate that the difference in income level between the EU-27 and EU candidate and potential candidate countries, measured as real GDP per capita, the gross average monthly wages in the EU candidate and potential candidate countries and the stock of the EU candidate and potential candidate countries' nationals residing in the EU-27 member states as a share in the total population of the countries of origin are the main determinants of migration from the EU candidate and potential candidate countries to the EU-27. One of the most important finding of our analysis is that the achieved progress of the EU candidate and potential countries on their way towards full EU would have a positive, but only marginal significant impact on the emigration from these countries to the EU member states.","[Bucevska, Vesna] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Econ Skopje, Skopje, Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje,"Bucevska, V (通讯作者)，Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Econ Skopje, Skopje, Macedonia.",vesna.bucevska@eccf.ukim.edu.mk,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,203,212,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100023,0

Although the quantity (employment) adjustments that followed have been well documented, the changes that were triggered in the wage structures of the two sectors remain largely unexplored. In this article we examine these changes using Greek Labour Force Survey micro-data. We find a differential adjustment across sectors in terms of magnitude, timing, and structure. Despite general perceptions, adjustment in public sector wages has been slow and limited, with pre-crisis premia persisting throughout the period. Instead, the private sector recorded substantial adjustment, changing noticeably its valuation of worker and job characteristics and emerging from the crisis with a structure of returns that rewards more intensively marketable skills.

Using data on international trade of Turkish provinces and the change in the capacity of the roads connecting them to the international gateways of the country, we estimate the distance elasticity of trade associated with roads of varying capacity. Three key results emerge. First, the cost of an average shipment over a high-capacity expressway is about 70% lower than it is over single-lane roads. Second, the present value of a 10-year stream of trade flows generated by a one-dollar investment in road infrastructure ranges between $0.7 and $2. Third, the reduction in transportation costs is greater the more transportation-sensitive an industry is. To the extent that efficient logistics enable countries to take part in global supply chains and exploit their comparative advantages, our findings have important developmental implications.

This article further explores the corresponding relationships between coal price fluctuations and variations in the effects of these fluctuations to analyse the asymmetric influence of coal price fluctuations on China's macroeconomy. Coal price fluctuations exerted significant long-term positive effects and short-term negative effects on China's output variables, with an average delay of 11 months; they had positive effects on investment and consumption over the long term and an increasingly negative effect on imports and exports. The average delays were 9 months for investment, 6.5 months for consumption and 10 months for imports and exports.

We show that primary surpluses this large and persistent are rare. In an extensive sample of high- and middle-income countries there are just three (non-overlapping) episodes where countries ran primary surpluses of at least 5 per cent of GDP for 10 years. Analyzing a less restrictive definition of persistent surplus episodes (primary surpluses averaging at least 3 percent of GDP for five years), we find that surplus episodes are more likely when growth is strong, when the current account of the balance of payments is in surplus (savings rates are high), when the debt-to-GDP ratio is high (heightening the urgency of fiscal adjustment), and when the governing party controls all houses of parliament or congress (its bargaining position is strong). Left wing governments, strikingly, are more likely to run large, persistent primary surpluses. In advanced countries, proportional representation electoral systems that give rise to encompassing coalitions are associated with surplus episodes. The point estimates do not provide much encouragement for the view that high-debt European countries will be able to run a primary budget surplus as large and persistent as officially projected.","[Eichengreen, Barry] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Grad Inst, Geneva, Switzerland; CEPR, Geneva, Switzerland",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Eichengreen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"Panizza, Ugo/AAU-2064-2021","Panizza, Ugo/0000-0002-7354-1583",,,,,76,20,22,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

The analytic framework is used to explore the long-run growth prospects for Egypt in a changing climate. Based on a review of existing estimates of climate change impacts on agricultural productivity, labour productivity and the potential losses due to sea-level rise for the country, the model is used to simulate the effects of climate change on aggregate consumption, investment and income up to 2050. Available cost estimates for adaptation investments are employed to explore adaptation strategies. The simulation analysis suggests that in the absence of policy-led adaptation investments, real GDP towards the middle of the century will be 6.5% lower than in a hypothetical baseline without climate change. A combination of adaptation measures, that include coastal protection investments for vulnerable sections along the low-lying Nile delta, support for changes in crop management practices and investments to raise irrigation efficiency, could reduce the GDP loss in 2050 to around 2.6%.

The dominant technological aspect of innovation has been facing some criticism because it does not fully consider innovation in services and ignores many important non-technological elements of innovative organizational activities. Non-technological innovation are related to organizational restructuring, human resources and ways of management. Moreover, they are often found to be causally related to technological innovations. The concept of management innovation, as a distinct type of non-technological innovation is still in its infant phase in research formulation and confirmation, and that especially refers to the context of research in the public sector. Generally, management innovations as a special type of non-technological innovations represent creating and implementation of new management practices, processes, structures or techniques. The purpose and objectives of this paper are to define the initial concepts in the study of management innovations in the public sector taking into account the specificities of public organizations and existing studies that have dealt with this special kind of innovation in the public sector. In the wake of the previous research, typology of management innovations was proposed, which was empirically tested in the context of local government, whose role was recently further emphasized by actual public administration reforms aimed at increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of public services, and often through implementation of new methods and management concepts. Research results based on the conducted factor analysis shows that the variables structural and procedural management innovations are evaluated as reliable and appropriate measuring instrument of management innovations. These results imply that it is meaningful to further carry out research in the field of management innovations along the lines of the resulting typology, and which may result in valuable findings, considering that it is useful to observe management innovations as a factor and a precondition for easier and more successful implementation of changes, which are inevitable in Croatian local government and what can result in greater rationalization, efficiency and ultimately higher quality of services.","[Fabic, Mirjana Grcic; Kutnjak, Goran; Skender, Helga Pavlic] Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Fabic, MG (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia.",mirjana.grcic.fabic@efri.hr; goran.kutnjak@efri.hr; hpavlic@efri.hr,"Fabić, Mirjana Grčić/R-3492-2018; Grčić Fabić, Mirjana/GNP-4472-2022; Fabic, Mirjana Grcic/ABC-6230-2020","Fabić, Mirjana Grčić/0000-0002-8995-7452; Grčić Fabić, Mirjana/0000-0002-8995-7452;",,,,,18,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,757,767,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600076,0

However, there is still a lack of systematic analyses of these issues, especially in the context of the new EU member countries. This study aims to address this research gap. It examines an important topic in applied macroeconomics research-the Phillips curve-and chooses three Baltic countries, namely, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as case studies. In other words, the main objective of this paper is to revisit the debate on the inflation-unemployment trade-off by estimating the new Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) in the Baltic region over the period of 1995-2013. The analysis was based on the generalized method of moments (GMM) procedure suggested by Gali and Gertler (1999). The novelty of the present study is that it applied the Gali-Gertler method to examine the trade-off relationship between inflation and unemployment in the Baltic countries. This study yielded some important findings. Firstly, it was found that inflation dynamics in the Baltic countries was largely determined by forward-looking behaviour, which means that firms located in the region had forward-looking price setting tendency and they paid due attention to the expected level of inflation. Secondly, the inflation dynamics did not seem to be determined by backward tendency and the firms in the region did not have backward price setting tendency. Thirdly, no significant trade-off relationship was detected between inflation rate and marginal cost. In other words, there was no significant negative association between the inflation rate and marginal cost in the Baltic countries.","[Furuoka, Fumitaka] Univ Malaya, Asia Europe Inst, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Furuoka, F (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Asia Europe Inst, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",fumitaka@um.edu.my,"Furuoka, Fumitaka/C-4197-2012","Furuoka, Fumitaka/0000-0003-1863-387X",,,,,32,1,1,0,5,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Economic policies should be implemented to create better conditions for higher investment of remittances into production and human capital accumulation, which can yield greater benefits from both micro and macroeconomic perspective. Recipient country financial development may often be negatively affected by remittances, since they help reduction of existing financial constraint and are mostly directly oriented to consumption.

The recent literature on Dutch disease describes alternative policy rules to manage the income flow from the expected natural resource revenue, which can either be spent to raise immediate consumption or on public infrastructure to increase future productivity. We simulate four strategies. As a conservative strategy, Niger can spend only the interest earned on revenue in a sovereign wealth fund (bird-in-hand strategy); alternatively, it can borrow to spend now and repay with expected natural resource revenue. The key to the benefits of significant mineral revenue lies with the productivity and supply responses of spending. If significant output gain is assured, the different spending strategies have very similar effects on real consumption. Dutch disease, the overshooting of relative prices of non-tradable sector or the shrinking share of traded sectors in the economy, is also ameliorated with greater supply flexibility. Growth paths of alternative spending strategies differ markedly in timing and pattern, however, when spending does not raise productivity. The more aggressive spending plan may result in a boom-bust cycle if fiscal adjustments and debt repayments are necessary for any significant borrowing against future revenue and productivity gains are not realized.

In this paper, I build a panel structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model for a short panel of 119 countries over 10 years and find support for the institutions hypothesis. Controlling for individual fixed effects, I find that exogenous shocks to a proxy for institutional quality have a positive and statistically significant effect on GDP per capita. On average, a 1% shock in institutional quality leads to a peak 1.7% increase in GDP per capita after six years. Results are robust to using a different proxy for institutional quality. There are different dynamics for advanced economies and developing countries. This suggests diminishing returns to institutional quality improvements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We conduct a randomized experiment in post-revolution Egypt to measure the impact of insuring microenterprises against this uncertainty. Demand for macroeconomic shock insurance was high, with a take-up rate of 36.7%. However, purchasing insurance does not change the likelihood a business takes a new loan, the size of the loan, or how they invest this loan. We attribute this lack of effect to microenterprises largely investing in inventories and raw materials rather than irreversible investments like equipment, suggesting that macroeconomic and political risk is not inhibiting their investment behavior. The challenges of introducing an innovative insurance product in an environment where microentrepreneurs had little previous insurance exposure are particularly evident in a second year, where take-up was extremely low following political events that came close to, but did not, trigger insurance pay-outs.

The modern approach of predicting the future of technology, taking into account the multidimensionality of the environment, is, among other things, the Future-Oriented Technology Analysis (FTA). Designing the FTA research procedure is a complex process, both in organizational and methodological terms. The catalogue of methods that can be used in this process is extensive and constantly open. However, in the source literature the rules for the selection of methods appropriate for the type of research were not specified. The ways of combining methods in the research process were also missing. The main aim of this article was to present the author's classification of methods of future-oriented technology analysis and indicate the possibilities of its application. In the text, using statistical methods and artificial neural networks, the classification of methods with the potential of exploitation in prospective technology analysis was carried out. Each of the received classes was analysed, the characteristics of particular groups of methods were selected, and authorial names characterizing the given classes were chosen. According to the author, the application of the proposed classification of methods of future-oriented technology analysis facilitates the design of the FTA research process. It will contribute to the systematization and standardization of the manner of selection of research methods. It will also allow for the selection of complementary methods.","[Halicka, Katarzyna] Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A Str, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Halicka, K (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A Str, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",k.halicka@pb.edu.pl,"Halicka, Katarzyna/D-4855-2015","Halicka, Katarzyna/0000-0001-6370-8995",,,,,76,33,33,2,28,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Increased heterogeneity raises aggregate productivity and production, more so the fiercer competition is.

Most of Russian regions (56) have implemented differentiated tax rates for different taxpayers. 15 regions have set a single lowered rate for all taxpayers, while in 12 regions tax rate remained unchanged.The research focused on testing the hypothesis that low tax burden has a favourable effect on the small enterprise's development. In the regression equation the number of small enterprises, the number of employees, turnover and investment were used as dependent variables. Apart from the tax rate, regressors included the following control variables: gross regional product per capita, economic potential and investment risks ranking of the region by the agency Expert.The relationship between the mentioned indicators was modeled with logarithmic-linear and doubly-logarithmic functions both without a time lag and with a one-year time lag. The results of assessment of the models do not provide sufficient evidence to prove the hypothesis. Regions with a lower tax rate show better performance in the number of new enterprises and turnover. However, no influence on the dynamics of employment and investment was found.Multiple research papers prove similar effects of lowered tax rate in other countries.

Given the recent empirical findings that the credit spread has a useful explanatory power for future economic fluctuations, we also suggest that the business-cycle component of the credit spread can better predict the probability of a recession than the usual time domain analysis.

Increased wind capacity reduces the mean and the variance of production costs but only the variance of electricity prices. Wind generators see their market revenues increase while consumer payments and fossil generator profits do not considerably vary as wind capacity increases. Risk aversion is captured by considering the conditional value-at-risk for both consumers and producers. The optimal level of wind generation increases as risk aversion increases due to the potential of wind to act as a hedge against very high electricity prices in high fuel price scenarios.","[Lynch, Muireann A.; Curtis, John] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Lynch, MA (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",muireann.lynch@esri.ie,"Lynch, Muireann/HTS-0230-2023; Curtis, John/Q-8539-2018","Curtis, John/0000-0002-6957-5684",Energy Policy Research Centre; Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF),Energy Policy Research Centre; Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)),John Curtis acknowledges funding from the Energy Policy Research Centre.

The dependency on imports is rather high even in product groups with potentially sufficient domestic supply. On the other hand, the capability of domestic producers to compete globally has opened new markets for exporters. Gravity models have been extensively used in the analysis of bilateral trade flows due to their empirical success in determining trade potential of a country. The research aims to offer a gravity model of Latvia's agri-food trade selecting the appropriate estimator for the model, and applying the model in the evaluation of determinants of the trade flows as well as forecast further flows.

First, we derive the optimal mechanism, neglecting the incentive constraint for the deadline. The deadline of the winner determines the time of the allocation and therefore also the amount of information available to the seller when he decides whether to allocate to a buyer. Depending on the shape of the markup that the seller uses, this can lead to a violation of the neglected incentive constraint. We give sufficient conditions on the type distribution under which the neglected constraint is fulfilled or violated. Second, for the case that the constraint cannot be neglected, we consider a model with two periods and two buyers. Here, the optimal mechanism is implemented by a fixed price in period one and an asymmetric auction in period two. The asymmetry, which is introduced to prevent the patient type of the first buyer from buying in period one leads to pooling of deadlines at the top of the type space.

Using the Arellano-Bond dynamic panel data analysis on 36 SSA countries from 1980 to 2010, we first characterise the impact of presidential elections on two policy variables: government budget deficits and money growth. We then examine the impact of government budget deficits and money growth on inflation, while taking account of any direct political pressure via presidential elections. Importantly, we show that country groups, based on the level of income, are important in teasing out the varying effects of budget deficits and elections, finding evidence of political budget cycles and political monetary cycles in the middle-income countries. We also characterise whether a country is part of a fixed-exchange rate regime, showing that this limits electoral pressure on the monetary policy variable. We examine the competitiveness of elections by whether they are multiparty or single-party elections and by whether there is an incumbent candidate running for re-election. When we examine the feed-on effects on inflation, there is little indication that the election pressures on either fiscal or monetary variables become inflationary. There is evidence, however, of money growth and budget deficits being directly inflationary, particularly in the low-income countries.","[Neumann, Rebecca] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Ssozi, John] Baylor Univ, Hankamer Sch Business, Dept Econ, Waco, TX 76798 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Baylor University,"Neumann, R (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",rneumann@uwm.edu,,,,,,,36,3,3,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

In a second stage, we assess the determinants of efficiency, emphasizing the relation between efficiency and risks. In the Romanian banking system, the relationship between concentration and efficiency supports Hicks's 'quiet life hypothesis'. With respect to the impact risk factors on efficiency, we find that a lower failure risk and a higher liquidity are positively associated with efficiency, while solvency risk is negatively associated with efficiency. We also find that banks with a higher return on equity and a higher level of financial intermediation are more efficient. An increase in the net interest margin leads to a decrease in efficiency, signaling a higher credit risk. The effects of the financial crisis on commercial banks in Romania were observable in 2008, when the cost efficiency and productivity decreased. Empirical results suggest that the contribution of the funds to the increase in productivity is the most significant, while that of labor and capital productivity is lower.","[Nitoi, Mihai] Romanian Acad, Inst World Econ, Bucharest, Romania; [Spulbar, Cristi] Univ Craiova, Dept Finance, Craiova, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences; University of Craiova,"Spulbar, C (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Dept Finance, Craiova, Romania.",mihai.nitoi@iem.ro; cristi.spulbar@feaa.ucv.ro,"Spulbar, Cristi Marcel/AAL-1451-2020; Niţoi, Mihai/I-2913-2016","Spulbar, Cristi Marcel/0000-0002-3909-9496; Nitoi, Mihai/0000-0001-7151-0612",project Routes of academic excellence in doctoral and post-doctoral research - READ; European Social Fund; Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/137926],project Routes of academic excellence in doctoral and post-doctoral research - READ; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development,"This work was financially supported through the project Routes of academic excellence in doctoral and post-doctoral research - READ co-financed through the European Social Fund, by Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, contract no POSDRU/159/1.5/S/137926.",,51,3,3,0,20,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Based on a shift-share decomposition, it shows that the growth in the service share can explain at least half of the overall variation in female hours, both over time and across countries.","[Olivetti, Claudia] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA; [Olivetti, Claudia] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Petrongolo, Barbara] Queen Mary Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, London E1 4NS, England; [Petrongolo, Barbara] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London WC2A 2AE, England",Boston College; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Olivetti, C (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.;Olivetti, C (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",claudia.olivetti@bc.edu; b.petrongolo@qmul.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,103,110,124,6,52,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4608-9,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

The literature disagrees on whether this effect is due to firms' reactions to high demand or to changes in consumer behavior. I propose a strategy that enables the identification of supply and demand movements by examining unpredictable and short-lived exogenous demand shocks. During these periods, firms do not have time to adjust pricing or advertising strategies, and most activity comes from changes in consumer behavior. My model shows that during periods of exogenous high demand, consumers migrate toward cheaper, lower-quality products. I focus on ice cream purchases, which have a seasonal peak during the summer and increase during less-predictable periods of unseasonably high temperatures. Using individual-level data, I test model implications and estimate structural parameters, finding evidence consistent with consumers' quality shifts. I also reject alternative supply-side theories' explanations for the main drivers of the observed price dynamics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The main reason is the proceeding globalization of individual markets. Marketers need to react promptly on the changing requirements of consumers. One of the latest marketing techniques is sensory marketing based on creating synergy between product and consumer using human senses, leading to increased consumption. The taste is the most specific human sense. It is very subjective and that is why the taste is less utilized in marketing strategies. But it is also very powerful and can be used in marketing to attract consumers on the world market. In this paper we present results of our study with several taste tests. It was found out that there is a strong relationship between the taste of chosen products and additional information that consumers had in their disposal. The more information consumers have in disposal, the more positive is the taste of the products. There is also a correlation between the taste and the brand name. Consumers rate favourite brands more positively. If consumers have an opportunity to taste cheaper products before buying, they prefer them to more expensive and well-known products.","[Rybanska, Jana; Nagyova, L'udmila; Kubelakova, Andrea] FEM SUA, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",,"Rybanská, J (通讯作者)，FEM SUA, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",xrybanskaj@is.uniag.sk; ludmila.nagyova@uniag.sk; xkubelakova@is.uniag.sk,"Nagyova, Ludmila/I-8152-2018","Nagyova, Ludmila/0000-0002-5220-2857",,,,,17,1,1,2,5,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1912,1918,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800237,0

Optimum tax formulas take the same form as standard welfarist tax formulas by simply substituting standard marginal social welfare weights with those generalized weights. Weights directly capture society's concerns for fairness without being necessarily tied to individual utilities. Suitable weights can help reconcile discrepancies between the welfarist approach and actual tax practice, as well as unify in an operational way the most prominent alternatives to utilitarianism such as Libertarianism, equality of opportunity, or poverty alleviation.","[Saez, Emmanuel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Stantcheva, Stefanie] Harvard Univ, Soc Fellows, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Harvard University,"Saez, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, 530 Evans Hall 3880, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",saez@econ.berkeley.edu; sstantcheva@fas.har-vard.edu,,,NSF [SES-1156240]; MacArthur Foundation; Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); MacArthur Foundation; Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley,"We thank Steve Coate, Florian Ederer, Marc Fleurbaey, Bas Jacobs, Louis Kaplow, Henrik Kleven, Etienne Lehmann, Ben Lockwood, Thomas Piketty, Maxim Troshkin, Aleh Tsyvinski, Matthew Weinzierl, Nicolas Werquin, three anonymous referees, and numerous conference participants for useful discussions and comments.

The results show that 3/4 of students have normal body weight. Underweight applies particularly to women, on the contrary, overweight to men. Students with underweight are the biggest consumers of fruit, vegetable and dairy products; students with moderate obesity eat smoked meats most often. Students from the smallest villages (to the max 499 inhabitants) lead in the frequency of consumption of fried food and sugary drinks. Students from municipalities with 10-20 thousand inhabitants prefer whole grain breads and poultry. Improper eating habits lead to growth of prevalence of non-communicable diseases; beside other things it brings increasing health care costs, which may become unsustainable for the society and may weaken the competitiveness of regions.","[Somerlikova, Kristina; Hubelova, Dana] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Appl Stat & Demog, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Trida Gen Piky 7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Somerlíková, K (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Appl Stat & Demog, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Trida Gen Piky 7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",somerlik@mendelu.cz; hubelova@mendelu.cz,"Somerlikova, Kristina/E-4852-2018; Hubelova, Dana/A-9741-2018","Somerlikova, Kristina/0000-0001-9093-6707; Hubelova, Dana/0000-0002-2551-8792",,,,,25,5,5,0,9,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,513,521,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-66,0.0,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500067,0

I find significant effects of entry labor market conditions on wages, job quality, and the transition time from school to work. In contrast to published evidence on more educated workers, I also find large effects on work hours on both the extensive and the intensive margins. When workers leave high school in a recession, they take substantially longer to find a job, earn lower wages, and work fewer full-time weeks and more part-time weeks.

A secular identity allows an individual to derive more pleasure from consumption than religious individuals, leading secular individuals to work harder and to save more in order to experience this pleasure from consumption. These activities are conducive to economic growth. Higher income makes consumption more affordable and increases the appeal of a secular identity for the next generation. An extension of the basic model investigates the Protestant Reformation as an intermediate stage during the take-off to growth. Another extension introduces intergenerationally dependent religious preferences and demonstrates how a social multiplier amplifies the speed of secularization.

However, these taxes may also impose several short-run macroeconomic policy challenges, the nature of which remains underexplored. This paper investigates the mechanisms through which environmental taxes on fossil fuel usage can affect the main macroeconomic variables in the short-run. We concentrate on a particular mechanism: speculative storage. Formulating and using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model, calibrated for the United States, with an explicit storage facility and nominal rigidities, we show that in designing environmental tax policies it is crucial to account for the fact that fossil fuel prices are subject to speculation. The existence of forward-looking speculators in the model improves the effectiveness of tax policies in reducing fossil fuel usage. Improved policy effectiveness, however, is costly: it drives inflation and interest rates up, while impeding output. Based on this tradeoff, we seek an answer to the question how monetary policy should interact with environmental tax policies in our DSGE model of fossil fuel storage. We show that, in an environment with no speculative storers, monetary policy should respond to output along with CPI inflation in order to minimize the welfare losses brought by taxes. However, when the storage facility is activated, responding to output in the monetary policy rule becomes less desirable. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Even though the least developed regions in Slovakia showed the most activity in submitting project proposals, the volume of both contracted amount and funding spent is greater in regions with better economic situation.

We find that stated behavior accurately predicts actual behavior at a middle level of respondent certainty, overpredicts actual behavior at a lower level of certainty, and underpredicts behavior at a higher level of certainty.

We select equity price indexes from three developed countries (the US, the UK and Germany) and five BRICS member countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and consider ten economic/financial events for investigation. Seven correlations exhibit a positively sloped trend, and one exhibits a horizontal trend. All of these trends have undergone one or two structural breaks, which moved the corresponding correlations to their highest-ever evolutionary paths. These structural breaks are associated with one or more of the ten episodes considered, and a common event impacting all eight of the correlation trends is detected to be the 2008 adverse oil shock.

By using the bilateral trade input-output (BTIO) approach, this study investigates the CO2 emissions embodied in China-Japan trade during 1995-2009 and attempts to identify the driving forces for the change in CO2 emissions embodied in China's exports to Japan during that period by using structural decomposition analysis (SDA). Result shows that CO2 emissions embodied in China's exports increased by about 100% from 1995 to 2009, whereas those embodied in China's imports increased by about 500% during the same period. Result of this research also reveals that the scale effect had a large influence on the increase in CO2 emissions embodied in China-Japan trade. The technical effect greatly decreased CO2 emissions embodied in China's exports to Japan, but obviously increased those embodied in imports. The influence of the structural effect was relatively small and insignificant in the change of CO2 emissions embodied in China's exports to Japan, but was notable in the change of emissions embodied in imports.","[Zhao, Yuhuan] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Song; Zhang, Zhonghua; Liu, Ya] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jiaqin] Georgia Coll & State Univ, Dept Management, Milledgeville, GA USA",Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia College & State University,"Zhao, YH (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",zhaoyuhuan@bit.edu.cn,"Wang, Song/P-8816-2015; Wang, Song/AFR-4964-2022","Wang, Song/0000-0002-7790-6527; Wang, Song/0000-0002-7790-6527",National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [71273026],National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [grant number 71273026].,,45,26,29,12,92,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Finally, we offer a point and interval estimation of these effects on the British demand for tourism to Spain. Our results reveal the importance of economic factors such as the British income and the evolution of the real prices both in Spain and in Portugal. Moreover, the terrorist attacks of ETA and 11-M had a negative effect on the British demand for tourism to Spain.

A small change in the emission per output ratio can result in a discrete jump in the stable size of a coalition and global welfare evaluated under the stable coalition size. In the case of three countries, the grand coalition may be destabilized by the implementation of cleaner technologies, ultimately resulting in higher global emissions and lower global welfare. In the case of more than three countries, implementing cleaner technologies may result in a discrete jump, either upward or downward, of the largest stable coalition size and welfare. We examine both, the case of a flow and that of a stock pollutant. In the latter case, we show that the higher the stock of pollution at the instant when the cleaner technology is implemented, the more likely that a grand coalition of three countries is destabilized. Measures that enhance the natural rate of decay of stock pollutants are shown to have similar effects on the size of stable coalitions to reductions in the emission per output ratio.","[Benchekroun, Hassan] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Benchekroun, Hassan] McGill Univ, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Chaudhuri, Amrita Ray] Univ Winnipeg, Dept Econ, CentER, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada; [Chaudhuri, Amrita Ray] TILEC, Tilburg, Netherlands",McGill University; McGill University; Universite de Montreal; University of Winnipeg; Tilburg University,"Benchekroun, H (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada.",hassan.benchekroun@mcgill.ca; a.raychaudhuri@uwinnipeg.ca,,,SSHRC; FQRSC; Board of Regents of the University of Winnipeg,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); FQRSC; Board of Regents of the University of Winnipeg,"We thank Archan Hazra for research assistance.

Among other public policies aiming at reducing this duality, financial incentives could induce employers to lengthen contract duration or favour permanent contracts. This article develops a matching model fitted to the French labour market characteristics and calibrated on French data. A gradual decrease in unemployment contributions or a firing tax reduces the share of short-term contract in total employment but increases market rigidity and lowers labour productivity. However, decreasing unemployment contributions gradually is less favourable for new entrants than a firing tax and lengthens unemployment spells. An additional contribution levied on short-term contracts to finance a bonus for permanent-contract hirings also decreases labour market duality and increases activity by 0.13% but without negative impacts on labour market flexibility and productivity.

An average premium of 2% is found despite the fact that most workers are already covered by industry-level agreements. To explore the origin of the premium, I construct a simple bargaining model from which I derive three predictions, which are tested empirically using matched employer-employee data. The main prediction is that if intra-firm bargaining is behind the union wage premium, the latter increases with the amount of quasi-rents available in the firms that unions organise. This prediction is validated empirically when firms' market shares are used as a proxy for their rents.","[Breda, Thomas] CNRS, Paris Sch Econ, F-75700 Paris, France; [Breda, Thomas] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Paris School of Economics; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Breda, T (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Bd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",thomas.breda@ens.fr,,,British Academy through a Newton postdoctoral fellowship,British Academy through a Newton postdoctoral fellowship,"Some of the work on this study was done while I was at the Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics with funding from the British Academy through a Newton postdoctoral fellowship.

The first two show that transparency reduces the variability of inflation and the output gap but does not affect their average levels. But if the Central Bank is unable to commit to one particular set of preferences for all circumstances, then in line with the hypothesis of constructive ambiguity we find that both the levels and the variability of output and inflation will be affected - which means that this form of imperfect transparency could be used strategically. An empirical examination of these results, based on an index constructed by Eijffinger and Geraats, shows that macroeconomic averages are not much affected by transparency. But transparency appears to reduce the variability of inflation while increasing the variability of output. That suggests that Central Banks may in fact exploit constructive ambiguity when they try to be transparent.","[Demertzis, Maria] De Nederlandsche Bank, Res Dept, NL-1000 AB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hallett, Andrew Hughes] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AR, Fife, Scotland",European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV; University of St Andrews,"Hallett, AH (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AR, Fife, Scotland.",m.demertzis@gmail.com; ahh1@st-andrews.ac.uk,,,,,,,43,7,7,0,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

While political ecology, the analysis of common pool resources, and ecological economics, among others, have provided praiseworthy insights into such conflicts, institutional approaches to these phenomena are still scarce. Classical institutional economics has occasionally been put to work on environmental issues, but proposed frameworks remain relatively underdeveloped. We wish to contribute to institutional research on environmental issues by building upon Bruno Theret's interpretation of John R. Commons's transactional model and applying the framework to a case of socio-environmental conflicts. First, we briefly sketch the landscape of institutional contributions (especially those that follow the classical institutionalist tradition) to the analysis of environmental issues. We explain why Commons has largely been ignored on these issues. Then, we analyze some of the key concepts of Commonsian economics that are of particular interest to our theoretical elaboration. Following this, we depict Commons's transactional scheme and propose an application to a case of socioenvironmental mining conflict in Peru. Our framework could complement existing ones and shed light on the institutional dynamics of natural-resource management through conflict.","[Dupuy, Romuald] CEARC Cultures Environm Arctic Representat & Clim, Paris, France; [Roman, Philippe] Univ Paris 03, REEDS Int Ctr Res Ecol Econ Eco Innovat & Tool De, F-75230 Paris 05, France; [Roman, Philippe] Univ Paris 03, Inst Latin Amer Studies, F-75230 Paris 05, France; [Mougenot, Benoit] Univ Versailles St Quentin En Yvelines, REEDS, Versailles, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris Saclay,"Dupuy, R (通讯作者)，CEARC Cultures Environm Arctic Representat & Clim, Paris, France.",,"Mougenot, Benoit/N-8195-2019; Mougenot, Benoit/C-3032-2018","Mougenot, Benoit/0000-0001-5956-7659; Mougenot, Benoit/0000-0001-5956-7659",,,,,99,14,14,2,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

China's land laws give provision of land a central role in local officials' growth promotion strategies. Requisitions of farmland by local authorities have engendered significant rural unrest. In response, the central government has attempted to re-establish control over the pace of urban land expansion by enacting regulations limiting conversion of rural land to urban uses. We derive theoretically the conditions under which non-compliance with such regulations is optimal. An econometric investigation shows that legal restrictions on farmland conversion had little or no effect on rates of farmland loss but did limit urban spatial growth. Our econometric evidence is consistent with limited enforcement of those legal limits on farmland conversion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

While the assessment of the asymmetric impact on petroleum product prices based on the upward and downward movement of crude prices is well documented in the literature, the contribution of this paper is in splitting the crude price fluctuation in multiple partial sum series, which allows for a more detailed and minute analysis of the relationship. Apart from confirmation of nonlinear influences, we also found the presence of a relatively high asymmetric impact at the lower quantiles of crude oil price changes. This implies that the benefits of sharp reductions of crude prices are, in general, not transferred to various petroleum products. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We identity the starting, the ending, the intensity, and the persistence of nonlinear episodes. The six episodes identified in the period studied were found to be contemporaneous with international financial crises, which allows us to speculate that the contagion caused by financial crises induces nonlinear dependencies. We advocate that this test could be complementary to traditional tests employed in the study of financial contagion. We observe systematic nonlinear structure in the stock index return series that have been associated with temporary lack of market efficiency.

An increasing importance of short-term volatility components is evident across all metals in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and the related sharp decline in industrial metal prices. The heavier impact of short-term volatility corresponds consistently to a decreasing persistence of the volatility of realized volatility. In terms of predictive accuracy, even though leverage effects or GARCH-terms related to the volatility of realized volatility are characterized for the most part by significant in-sample parameters, the plain HAR model cannot be consistently outperformed by explicitly accounting for these stylized facts.

This paper provides evidence on the harmful effects of fine particulate pollution for Ontario, where municipalities enjoy particulate levels well below US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards and predominantly below Canada-wide standards. Results provide strong evidence for the detrimental effect of fine particulate pollution for the respiratory health of children, with a one standard deviation change in particulate pollution, leading to a 4% increase in respiratory admissions. While these results inform the stringency of current pollution standards, they also highlight the importance of an international approach to air quality. For instance, the paper also shows that particulate levels in Ontario municipalities are strongly influenced by southerly winds from US jurisdictions, which adhere to more lenient EPA standards.","[Ward, Courtney J.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Ward, CJ (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada.",courtney.ward@dal.ca,,,,,,,36,19,21,1,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

We find a dramatic increase in mortality on the day that salaries arrive. The increase is especially pronounced for younger workers and for deaths due to activity-related causes such as heart conditions and strokes. The effect is entirely driven by an increase in mortality among low income individuals, who are more likely to experience liquidity constraints.

We develop a conceptually innovative model and new dataset to assess deep integration to reduce these three types of trade costs in the East African Community, the Common Market of East and Southern Africa and South African Development Community (EAC-COMESA-SADC) 'Tripartite' Free Trade Area (FTA), within the EAC alone and unilaterally by the EAC. We find that there are substantial gains for all six of our African regions from deep integration in the Tripartite FTA or comparable unilateral reforms by the EAC; but the estimated gains vary considerably across countries and depend on the reform. Thus, countries would have an interest in negotiating for different reforms in different agreements. Tariff removal in the Tripartite FTA would produce only small losses or gains, depending on the country. Interestingly, we estimate that Kenya gains less from comparable unilateral liberalisation by the EAC than from the Tripartite FTA, due in part to an umbrella of protection in services markets in the Tripartite region.","[Balistreri, Edward J.] Colorado Sch Mines, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Tarr, David G.] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Yonezawa, Hidemichi] ETH, Zurich, Switzerland",Colorado School of Mines; The World Bank; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Tarr, DG (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",dgtarr@gmail.com,"Balistreri, Edward J/A-6686-2013; Yonezawa, Hidemichi/ADE-5543-2022","Balistreri, Edward/0000-0001-6740-0066; Yonezawa, Hidemichi/0000-0002-9658-7226",Government of the Netherlands under the Bank-Netherlands Partnership Programme [TF012466],Government of the Netherlands under the Bank-Netherlands Partnership Programme,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Government of the Netherlands under the Bank-Netherlands Partnership Programme, project TF012466.",,59,17,17,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

This study examines the employment growth of young, small innovative firms (denoted as innovative youngsters) and contrasts it with the employment growth of established 'mature innovators' in 23 European transition economies, where varying degrees of intellectual property protection apply. The growth figures of the two firm groups vary significantly across different intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes. Innovative youngsters seem to benefit from strong intellectual property protection, while mature innovators exhibit the highest employment growth rates when IPRs are rather weak. These findings point to important undiscovered differences in employment growth patterns, which might explain some of the ambiguous results of former research on IPRs, and provide a reason why certain countries might benefit from strong IPRs while others might not.

Using unique panel data collected by Dun and Bradstreet, we find that agglomeration externalities increase the productivity of firms by up to 8%. Economic policies that subsidize firm relocations to the central business district increase agglomeration externalities in that area.

Historically, household surveys commonly employed self-reported land area measurements for cost-effectiveness and convenience. However, as we illustrate here, these self-reported estimates may measure land with systematic error resulting in sizable biases. This has led to the increased use of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and other modern technologies to measure land size. In this article, we compare self-reported (SR) and GPS land measurement to assess the differences between the measures, to identify the sources of differences, and to determine the implications of the different measures on agricultural analysis. The results from the analysis of data from four African countries indicate that SR land areas systematically differ from GPS land measures and that this difference leads to biased estimates of the relationship between land and productivity and consistently low estimates of land inequality. Through the evidence and analysis presented here, we conclude that the more systematic use of GPS-measured land area will result in improved agricultural statistics and more accurate analysis of agricultural relationships, which will better inform future policy.","[Carletto, Calogero; Gourlay, Sydney] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Winters, Paul] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",The World Bank; American University,"Carletto, C (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",gcarletto@worldbank.org,"Winters, Paul/HKE-8169-2023; Chekalin, Vyacheslav/S-6391-2017","Winters, Paul/0000-0001-9976-4534;",,,,,39,90,103,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

We assume that consumers simplify complex problems by neglecting some relevant aspects. This creates an incentive for a firm to supply simple products. Simultaneously, limited attention offers partial protection to customers from the monopolist's market power. We further assume that customers' attention varies with the set of alternatives. A firm may then manipulate its customers' attention through the range of products it offers. We show that a firm can increase its profit by introducing goods that have the sole function of manipulating consumer attention. Finally, we analyze the impact of limited attention on the screening of heterogeneous customers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In our first example, the firm sells a durable experience good and a complementary non-durable good to a representative consumer. Tying shifts profits from the durable to the non-durable good, making profits more sensitive to the consumer's experience. In our second example, the firm sells a single experience good to consumers with heterogeneous demands. Minimum purchase requirements screen out the low-volume consumers who would otherwise free ride on the superior monitoring of the high-volume consumers. The examples illustrate that purchase restraints can increase both firm profits and consumer surplus by making firm profits more sensitive to consumer experience, either directly by giving the consumer more control over the stream of profits or indirectly by constraining consumers to monitor more intensively.

This paper introduces long-term labour into PKK models.

Consistently with previous studies, a vast majority of contract choices are unlikely to be compatible with time-consistent behavior. For 56.83% of members, the actual cost per visit with the contract is higher than the pay-per-visit option. Conditional on paying more with a subscription, we calculate that the median cost of choosing along-term contract over the per-visit option is $346.45, excluding any commitment value. However, we compute that nearly all members would have paid less with the long-term contract if they had exercised as often as they initially planned. We study how actual attendance following contract choice is related to baseline reports of self-control. We find that reports of self-control problems are associated with low future attendance and with faster decrease in attendance, in particular after New Year, but not with expected attendance. Our results are consistent with a model of health club participation where agents underestimate the severity of their self-control problems. We find that individuals with a large gap between expected and realized attendance have a lower probability of contract renewal which has implications for mechanism design to retain customers.

Specifically, it compares the income and poverty of households integrated into a Malawian sugar investment with those households not integrated. Two different supply-chain set-ups are studied: smallholder outgrower and vertically integrated estate-production systems. Potential selection bias is addressed using propensity score matching and a number of robustness checks. We find significant positive income differences between participants in either supply-chain set-up and the respective counterfactual. Overall, income poverty is significantly lower among outgrowers relative to the counterfactual, whereas in the case of estate workers these differences are only significant for the extreme poverty line. Qualitative interviews confirm these results, but they also allude to risks for the rural poor associated with social conflicts in the expansion of new outgrower schemes as well as a lack of transparency in the operation of existing schemes, which are likely to undermine the poverty-reducing potentials of such investments.","[Herrmann, Raoul] DIE, German Dev Inst, Bonn, Germany; [Herrmann, Raoul; Grote, Ulrike] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Environm Econ & World Trade, Hannover, Germany",Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); Leibniz University Hannover,"Herrmann, R (通讯作者)，DIE, German Dev Inst, Bonn, Germany.",raoul.herrmann@die-gdi.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under research programme Social-Ecological Research,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under research programme Social-Ecological Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We appreciate funding of the research by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the auspices of the research programme Social-Ecological Research.

According to the results, GVC participation is more active in Korea's Manufacturing sector than in its primary sector in terms of VAX ratios. In addition, decreasing trends in VAX shares in Korea's major export-oriented industries imply an increasing level of GVC activity over time until around 2009. Further, evaluated in terms of value-added exports to the world, China, the US., and Japan, there is no evidence of any erosion in the competitiveness of key export-oriented industries despite the value-added deficit in trade with Japan. This trade deficit is fully covered by the surplus in trade with other countries within the global production network, and the deficit show sharp decreases in recent years. The decomposition of VAX implies that exports of intermediate goods dominate exports of final goods, and the decomposition of gross exports into nine terms suggests that the vertical specialization involving the use of foreign intermediate goods (VS) is not dominant, which is inconsistent with general expectations. Instead, other forms of vertical specialization.

However, the lack of subnational input-output data is a major obstacle which leads to a wide use of non-survey methods. Like other non-survey methods, the cross-hauling adjusted regionalization method (CHARM) was originally developed for the construction of single-regional IOT. In this paper, we extend CHARM to the case of bi- and multi-regional IOT. We find that the original CHARM formula has two limitations that are also of great importance for the single-regional case: First, cross-hauling in interregional trade is implicitly set to zero and, second, accounting balances may be violated owing to structural differences between the regional and national economies. We present a modified formula addressing these issues and examine its performance in terms of a case study.","[Toebben, Johannes] Forschungszentrum Julich, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Kronenberg, Tobias Heinrich] Hsch Bochum, Bochum, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Hochschule Bochum,"Többen, J (通讯作者)，Forschungszentrum Julich, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",j.toebben@fz-juelich.de,,"Kronenberg, Tobias/0000-0001-9796-986X",,,,,46,40,41,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

However, VAR models are linear and the solutions of DSGEs are often linear approximations; hence they do not consider time variation in parameters that could account for inherent nonlinearities and capture the adaptive underlying structure of the economy, especially in crisis periods. A novel method for time-varying VAR models is introduced. As an extension to the standard homoskedastic TVP-VAR, we employ a Markov-switching heteroskedastic error structure. Overall, we conduct a comparative empirical analysis of the out-of-sample performance of simple and hybrid DSGE models against standard VARs, BVARs, FAVARs, and TVP-VARs, using data sets from the U.S. economy. We apply advanced Bayesian and quasi-optimal filtering techniques in estimating and forecasting the models.","[Bekiros, Stelios D.] European Univ Inst, Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, Florence, Italy; [Bekiros, Stelios D.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece; [Paccagnini, Alessia] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy",European University Institute; Athens University of Economics & Business; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Bekiros, SD (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, Via Piazzuola 43, I-50133 Florence, Italy.",stelios.bekiros@eui.eu,"Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/K-4041-2014","Bekiros, Professor Dr. Stelios/0000-0002-9376-8726; Paccagnini, Alessia/0000-0002-2421-7242","European Community [303854]; Dote ricercatori: FSE, Regione Lombardia","European Community; Dote ricercatori: FSE, Regione Lombardia(Regione Lombardia)","The first author is supported by the Marie Curie Fellowship (FP7-PEOPLE-2011-CIG, No. 303854) under the 7th European Community Framework Programme.

Contrary to previous applications of these types of models, I find that generically the distribution of idiosyncratic shocks affects the risk premia of aggregate shocks and that the equilibrium is constrained inefficient in the sense that a planner can Pareto improve the equilibrium outcome by assigning different portfolio choices to agents. The inefficiency is caused by a 'portfolio externality': the average portfolio of the economy affects the portfolio return of each agent. The constrained efficient outcome can be achieved through linear taxes and subsidies that I characterize in closed-form. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The crucial extension is that retailers can play a significant role and this can turn conventional wisdom upside down, e.g.: retail competition need not benefit the upstream firms and wholesale pricing can dominate retail pricing in spite of double marginalization because of the incentives it provides to retailers.

Evidence from Mexico's Seguro Popular,LATIN AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Public health insurance; Crowding-out; Private transfers; Mexico; Seguro Popular,SOCIAL PROTECTION; PROGRAM; INCOME; IMPACT,"This study examines whether Seguro Popular, a free-of-charge publicly provided health insurance program for otherwise uninsured households, crowded-out private transfers in Mexico. Using data from the National Household Income and Expenditure Survey, the effects of Seguro Popular are identified using the spatial variation in the program's coverage induced by its sequential roll-out throughout Mexico. The results show that Seguro Popular reduced on average a household's probability of receiving private transfers by 5.55 % points. This finding appears to be driven by domestic private transfers, since the program's effects are only statistically significant for private transfers originating within Mexico. In addition, Seguro Popular had a weak and not statistically significant negative effect on the amount of private transfers received. Failure to take into account possible changes in private behaviour induced by Seguro Popular may overstate the program's potential benefits or distributional impacts.","[Orraca-Romano, Pedro P.] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Orraca-Romano, PP (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",p.orraca-romano@sussex.ac.uk,"Orraca Romano, Pedro P./ACR-4397-2022","Orraca Romano, Pedro P./0000-0003-0215-1251",,,,,38,5,7,0,11,CENTRO INVESTIGACION & DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS-CIDE,CIUDAD DE MEXICO,"CARR MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, SANTA FE, ALTAVISTA, CIUDAD DE MEXICO, ALVARO OBREGON, MEXICO",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

The results show that regulation is positive and significantly related to income inequality. The results indicate that regulation has differential effects in developing countries, with the most detrimental effect in Latin America. After controlling for types of regulation, it emerges that labor and general business regulations have a positive effect, while credit market regulations have no effect on the distribution of income.

A fully redistributive fiscal policy eliminates the extra inflation bias, but at the cost of reducing Ricardians' welfare. A fiscal authority that redistributes income only partially reduces the inflation bias, but raises government spending. Although a fully conservative monetary policy is necessary to get price stability, it implies a reduction in liquidity-constrained consumers' welfare, in the absence of redistributive fiscal policies. Finally, under a crisis scenario, none of the policy regimes is able to avoid the fall in economic activity when the increase in the fraction of LAMP is coupled with a negative technology shock, whereas optimal policy can avoid recession when it responds to the increase in LAMP proportion alone.","[Albonico, Alice] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy; [Rossi, Lorenza] Univ Pavia, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Pavia,"Albonico, A (通讯作者)，Dept Econ Management & Stat, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",alice.albonico@unimib.it,,"Albonico, Alice/0000-0002-9833-058X",Foundation Alma Mater Ticinensis,Foundation Alma Mater Ticinensis,"We thank Guido Ascari for helpful comments.

The structural difficulties of poor countries in accessing trade finance have, however, not disappeared-and might have been worsened. Trade finance markets are characterized by a greater selectivity in risk-taking, flight to 'quality' customers, and a re-focusing of global trade finance suppliers (banks) towards their largest customers in developed countries. In that environment, it seems that the lower end of the market has been struggling to obtain affordable finance, with the smaller companies in the smaller, poorer countries most affected. This is an area where statistics are difficult to find and causality hard to establish. The paper takes a critical look at some of the recent available-mostly survey-based-information suggesting that a significant trade finance market gap exists in Sub-Saharan Africa and poor countries in developing Asia. It looks at policy steps that are being taken to alleviate in part this situation.","[Auboin, Marc] World Trade Org, London, England",World Trade Organization,"Auboin, M (通讯作者)，World Trade Org, London, England.",marc.auboin@wto.org,,"Auboin, Marc/0000-0002-1276-8426",,,,,16,5,6,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The substantive drop in the cost of panels since 2007, coupled with the introduction of the Feed-in Tariff (FiT) Scheme in 2010, has resulted in a rapid increase in installation of PV panels in the UK, from 26.5MWp in 2009 to over 5GW by the end of 2014. Yet there has been no comprehensive analysis of the determinants of PV deployment in the UK. This paper addresses this gap by employing spatial econometrics methods to a recently available data set at a fine geographical detail. Following a traditional regression analysis, a general to specific approach has been adopted where spatial variations in the relationships have been examined utilising the spatial Durbin model using the cross-sectional data relating to the UK NUTS level 3 data. Empirical results indicate that demand for electricity, population density, pollution levels, education level of households and housing types are among the factors that affect PV uptake in a region. Moreover Lagrange Multiplier test results indicate that the spatial Durbin model may be properly applied to describe the PV uptake relationship in the UK as there are significant regional spillover effects.

The Law and Justice Party government (PiS, 2005-2007) and the country's membership in the European Union have given a boost to this debate, which a group of intellectuals ideologically close to the party has taken up. As an analysis of the social and political careers of the persons involved shows, this debate hinges on differences regarding: the function of history, the role of intellectuals, and the interpretations of changes during the post-Communist era. Despite the change of majority in 2007, we observe a continuity in the social and political functions assigned to history. Nonetheless, the instrumentalization of a history policy varies depending on the parties and persons involved and the interests pursued.","Univ Strasbourg, SAGE UMR 7363, ATER IEP Strasbourg, Polit Sci, Strasbourg, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Behr, V (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, SAGE UMR 7363, ATER IEP Strasbourg, Polit Sci, Strasbourg, France.",valentin.behr@gmail.com,"behr, valentin/GWR-0114-2022",,,,,,60,6,6,0,6,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Our approach differs from previous work on carbon convergence in that it employs a theoretical framework to construct a CO2 performance index, which explicitly takes into account that industrial firms produce good as well as bad outputs. This index is then used as the dependent variable in a growth-type regression equation. We employ a data set covering 14 industrial sectors over the time period 1990-2008. The results suggest the presence of conditional beta-convergence in CO2 performance among the industrial sectors in Sweden. Moreover, the speed of convergence varies significantly in the sense that the higher the capital intensity is, the lower is the convergence rate to the different steady states. This is likely to reflect the importance of - and in part the costs associated with - capital turnover to achieve a transition towards lower CO2 emission paths. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Two principal factors have contributed to this evolution: a body of evidence showing how psychological bias affects the behavior of economic actors; and an accumulation of evidence that is hard to reconcile with fully rational models of security market trading volumes and returns. In particular, asset markets exhibit trading volumes that are high, with individuals and asset managers trading aggressively, even when such trading results in high risk and low net returns. Moreover, asset prices display patterns of predictability that are difficult to reconcile with rational expectations-based theories of price formation.

We demonstrate that, under standard assumptions in the literature, the magnitude of unobservable, residual trade costs is large, and that their ignorance leads to a bias of the importance of observable trade-cost measures as well as of country-specific variables that are either solved implicitly through structural estimation or estimated explicitly as fixed effects. The reason is that, due to general-equilibrium linkages, some country-specific variables are endogenous to residual trade costs, regardless of whether they are captured by iteratively-solved structural terms or by country(-time) fixed effects. As a result, quantifications of effects of trade costs and comparative static results are also biased. Apart from diagnosing this problem, the paper provides remedies for it by proposing theory-consistent approaches including a two-step procedure that permits identifying partial effects of observable gravity variables on total trade costs and trade flows which do not suffer from the unobserved-trade-cost bias.

In some advanced countries, however, higher education costs and the level of indebtedness among graduates have increased dramatically during recent years. This phenomenon is particularly evident in the United States, and within the biomedical sciences sector. In this paper, we develop a basic model of economic growth in order to investigate the effects of biomedical graduate indebtedness on the allocation of human resources in R&D activities and hence on the growth process. In particular, we derive a 'science-growth curve', i.e., a relation between the share of pure researchers and the economy's rate of growth, and we find two possible effects of student indebtedness on economic growth: a composition effect and a productivity effect.

Three notions of reference wage appear to be being of particular importance: (i) the median wage level in one's firm, (ii) the level of wage of similar workers in the region, and (iii) the top 1% wage in one's firm. The first one triggers a signal effect, whereby all employees - especially young ones - whatever their relative position in the firm, are happier the higher the median wage in their firm, holding their own wage constant. The second and the third ones are sources of relative deprivation, i.e. workers' satisfaction decreases with the gap between their own salary and these reference categories. These findings are based on objective measures of earnings as well as subjective declarations about wage satisfaction, awareness of other people's pay and reported income comparisons.

The leading equilibrium concept is Walrasian equilibrium, and the dynamics (specifically, regret-matching dynamics) apply to trading games that fit the economic structure and whose pure Nash equilibria implement the Walrasian outcomes. Interestingly, in the case of quasilinear utilities (or transferable utility), all the concepts essentially coincide, and we get simple deterministic dynamics converging to Walrasian outcomes.

We find that a rise in tariffs on imports of outsourced goods contributes to an increase in employment by inducing a shift in production, but also leads to an appreciation of the real exchange rate that tends to reduce employment. The effect of real exchange rate appreciation dominates the effect of the production shift, and accordingly employment and consumption fall.

Gurus announce their beliefs and act accordingly. Gurus are strategic: they take into account the impact of their announced beliefs on the other agents, hence on prices. Standard agents observe gurus' performances, choose a guru and follow her/his recommendations. Prices are determined through a classical Walras mechanism. The competition among gurus for attracting followers among standard agents is governed by the level of accuracy of their predictions. The strategic behavior leads to belief subjectivity and heterogeneity among the gurus even when gurus' initial beliefs coincide with the objective belief. Optimism as well as pessimism can both emerge. We find a positive correlation across the agents between pessimism and risk tolerance. The representative agent belief, or the consensus belief is pessimistic. As a consequence of the pessimistic bias at the aggregate level, the risk premium is greater than in the standard rational expectations equilibrium. We show on an example that this impact is significative. In a multi-asset framework, the impact is stronger on the riskier assets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using politics as a context for our study, we employ two distinct subject pools - highly politically active individuals and workers from an online labor market. We find that priming individuals to consider the competitive nature of politics has a strong negative effect on women's interest in political office, but not on men's interest, hence significantly increasing the gender gap in leadership ambition.

Motivated by this, the present study intends to examine two important research issues. First, we test the impact of bribe payment on firms' performance. Specifically, from an empirical point of view, we investigate two important but alternative hypotheses namely 'grease the wheels' and 'sand the wheels'. Second, we intend to identify firms that must pay bribe. The study is based on the enterprises survey data of the World Bank. The findings on the effects of bribe on firm's performance are rather mixed. We noted that bribe works as tax on profitability of firms and reduces efficiency. However, the evidence is inconclusive relating to productivity. On the other hand, bribing shows a positive effect on the firms' export and product innovation. Therefore, the evidence provides support to both the hypotheses. Findings regarding who must pay bribe reveal that tax-evading firms are likely to pay greater bribes to the government officers. Furthermore, policy impediments are an important cause of bribe payment. Thus, it is the complexity in the system (policy or bureaucratic) which tends to raise the probability of paying bribes and dampen performance. In the light of these findings, policy implications are brought out. (C) 2015 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The middle income trap is, in essence, a growth trap, and refers to the situation in which a middle income economy experiences growth stagnation or a growth rate that is lower than that of high income economies. Nonetheless, it is hard to fully comprehend the formation of the trap solely based on growth theories. Historical data indicate that the middle income economies do not lack growth potential, and the real problem is that although their long-term average growth rates are higher than those of the high income economies, their average growth rates over a business cycle or an even longer period of time often fall below those of the high income economies. The cause of this phenomenon is neither short-term macroeconomic fluctuations nor long-term growth potential, but the frequent occurrence of financial crises in middle income economies. As a middle income economy, China is also facing the risk of a financial crisis, and the key to avoiding the middle income trap is to guard against future financial crises, preventing unsound financial liberalization and mismanagement of the corporate debt ratio.","Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Yao, ZZ (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yaozz@cass.org.cn,,,,,,,12,9,9,3,55,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2015,23.0,5,,,,,26,42,,10.1111/cwe.12126,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CT5FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362835200002,0

The Luenberger productivity indicator is constructed based on a quadratic output directional distance function with undesirable outputs, and then combined with the deterministic metafrontier to develop DPMLPI. The DPMLPI can be decomposed into efficiency change, technological change and productivity growth gap. The productivity growth gap can be further divided into efficiency change gap and technological change gap. The parametric linear programming technique is used to estimate parameters and construct the metafrontier. An empirical study for the Korean fossil fuel power industry at the plant-level is conducted for the 2003-2011 period. The results show a 0.15% increase in environmentally-sensitive productivity growth, which is mainly driven by environmental technological change. The oil-fired power plants show higher levels than the coal-fired ones of environmentally sensitive productivity growth and technological change performance. Some related policy implications are also proposed for the Korean fossil-fuel power sector. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The rationale for studying income taxation in this particular context is that first best taxes on housing wealth may be infeasible (at least in a shorter time perspective), while income taxes indirectly affect both the level and composition of accumulated wealth. We show that a suboptimally low tax on housing wealth provides an incentive for the government to subsidize financial saving and tax labor income at the margin. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We argue that one reason for the improvement could be firms trying to substitute for low domestic demand by shifting sales to the export market, particularly during economic recessions. Our econometric model therefore adds domestic demand as a further variable to smooth transition regression model that tries to capture business cycle effects by capacity constraints. In four out of our five countries, we find a substitutive relationship between domestic and foreign demand during more extreme stages of the business cycle.

In the experiment, participants' effort increased only their own payoff or also the donation to a negatively perceived charity. We introduced ignorance by letting agents decide whether to learn if the effort benefits the charity. As expected, agents exerted significantly higher efforts if they knew the negatively perceived charity would receive no benefits. Yet, when given the choice, almost one-third of the agents chose to stay ignorant and exert significantly more effort than agents who knew their effort would benefit the charity. Importantly, if the uncertainty about the donation to the charity was introduced exogenously, agents exerted lower effort than ignorant agents, which suggests that not having information about the consequences of one's own actions alone does not lead to self-interested behavior, but rather, the sorting of social agents of a low type into ignorance drives self-interested behavior of ignorant agents.

This fact can lead to a shortage situation in which certain previously committed customer orders cannot be served because there are not enough homogeneous units of a specific FG (i.e., with the same tone and gage). In this paper, a Model-Driven Decision Support System (DSS) is proposed to reassign the actual homogeneous stock and the planned homogeneous sublots to already committed orders under uncertainty by means of a mathematical programming model (SP-Model). The DSS functionalities enable ceramic decision makers to generate different solutions by changing model options. Uncertainty in the planned homogeneous quantities, and any other type of uncertainty, is managed via scenarios. The robustness of each solution is tested in planned and real situations with another DSS functionality based on another mathematical programming model (ASP-Model). With these DSS features, the ceramic decision maker can choose in a friendly fashion the orders to be served with the current homogeneous stock and the future uncertainty homogeneous supply to better achieve a balance between the maximisation of multiple objectives and robustness.","[Alemany, M.

This paper attempts to explain the two concepts in a unify theory framework. In the view of conflict economics, a nation's defense spending can be seen as the fighting commitment of distributive effort in the global economy while other is the productive effort. The development of global economy needs the productive efforts from almost every nation, and the distribution of the aggregate output is determined in large degree by the fighting commitment of each nation. The numerical simulation of the model gives a reasonable explanation of the patterns of the divergence/convergence of prosperity-poverty gap between nations, the fact which is evidenced by many empirical analyses. (1) Given the initial wealth ratio between nations fixed, there is a critical value of fighting decisiveness, when the actual value is larger than the critical value, it is more likely to result in Matthew effect; otherwise the gap would gradually be shortened. (2) Given the fighting decisiveness fixed, there is a critical value of initial wealth ratio, when the actual value is larger than the critical value, it is more likely to result in Matthew effect; otherwise, the gap would gradually be shortened. The study gives a new perspective to explain and handle the increasingly defense spending and the prosperity-poverty gap between nations.","Natl Univ Def Technol, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",National University of Defense Technology - China,"Meng, BB (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Def Technol, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",dreamenger@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

By using Chinese firm-level production data and transaction-level trade data during 2000-2006 to construct firm-specific input trade costs, we find rich evidence that a reduction in input trade cost for large trading firms leads to an increase in export intensity (i.e., exports over total sales). The impact is more pronounced for ordinary firms than that for hybrid firms which engage in both processing and ordinary trade since ordinary import enjoys the free-duty treatment in China. The declining input trade costs not only increase the probability of firm's being new exporters (i.e., extensive margin) but also lead to higher export intensity (i.e., intensive margin). Such results are robust to different empirical specification and econometric methods.","[Tian, Wei] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Econ & Trade, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yu, Miaojie] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Ctr Econ Res CCER, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics; Peking University,"Yu, MJ (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Ctr Econ Res CCER, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",mjyu@ccer.pku.edu.cn,"Yu, Miao/HRC-0342-2023",,,,,,22,12,12,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Given that there is quite a high tax wedge in the country, we analyse the impact of labour tax cuts through a reduction in social security contributions on the employment rate for workers of different skill types. Results show that tax shifting is higher, that is, wages will increase more as a result of reduced social contributions for high-skilled than for low-skilled workers. From a policy perspective our results indicate that it could be more effective to focus on selective tax reductions instead of applying across-the-board tax cuts.","Univ Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Zarkovic-Rakic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.",zarkovic@ekof.bg.ac.rs,,,,,,,27,2,2,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JUL 3,2015,27.0,3,,,,,395,410,,10.1080/14631377.2015.1055982,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CP1BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359609600006,0

We develop a simple two state mean field game model to analyse the competition between two paradigms based on Kuhn's theory of scientific revolution. The dynamics of the model are driven by the scientific choice of young researchers at the beginning of their career. Despite the possibility of multiple equilibria, the model exhibits at least one stable solution in which both para digms coexist. The occurrence of shocks on the parameters may induce the shift from one paradigm to the other. During this shift, researchers' choice is proved to be having a great impact on the evolution of sciences.","[Besancenot, Damien] Univ Paris 13, IFRIS, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France; [Besancenot, Damien; Dogguy, Habib] Univ Paris 13, CEPN, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France",Universite Paris 13; Universite Paris 13,"Dogguy, H (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, Dept Econ, CEPN, 99 Ave Jean Baptiste Clement, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France.",besancenot.damien@univ-paris13.fr; habib.dogguy@gmail.com,"besancenot, damien/Q-5893-2019",,Labex SITES,Labex SITES,"Correspondence: Habib Dogguy, Department of Economics CEPN, University Paris 13, 99 avenue Jean-Baptiste Clement 93430 Villetaneuse, France.

We find that increasing domestic inflation reduces domestic R&D investment and the growth rate of domestic technology. Given that economic growth in a country depends on both domestic and foreign technologies, increasing foreign inflation also affects the domestic economy. When each government conducts its monetary policy unilaterally to maximize the welfare of domestic households, the Nash-equilibrium inflation rates are generally higher than the optimal inflation rates chosen by cooperative governments who maximize the welfare of both domestic and foreign households. Under the CIA constraint on R&D (consumption), a larger market power of firms amplifies (mitigates) this inflationary bias. We use cross-country panel data to estimate the effects of inflation on R&D and also calibrate the two-country model to data in the Euro Area and the US to quantify the welfare effects of decreasing the inflation rates from the Nash equilibrium to the optimal level.

This paper uses the multi-regional and multi-commodity computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and the GTAP8.1 database to investigate the economic and environmental effects of carbon tariffs on Chinese exports. The following three policy scenarios are considered: 1) the abating countries implement cap-and-trade emission programs without BTAs; 2) the unilaterally abating countries levy import tariffs and export subsidies on non-abating countries; and, 3) the abating countries implement unilateral climate policies combined with ECT imposed by China. The ECT policy of China is evaluated with a carbon price set at 17 US$/t-CO2. Results illustrate that the ECT voluntarily implemented by China is ineffective in reducing its domestic CO2 emissions. Moreover, ECT merely has a minor impact on global emissions. Finally, the competitiveness of China's energy-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) industries suffers substantial losses if export tariffs are imposed. However, China's gains in terms of welfare and gross domestic product (GDP) would be slightly improved if an ECT policy is implemented, compared to the scenario where China is subjected to BTAs levied by the abating coalition. In the light of the tradeoff between tariff revenue for welfare and competiveness losses of the EITE industries, it is therefore difficult to conclude that carbon tariff on Chinese exports is an alternative policy to BTAs.

Theoretically we show that, in addition to commonly used importer characteristics, quality increases (i) in trade-weighted specific transportation cost to destinations other than the importer and (ii) in trade-weighted preference for quality of destinations other than the importer. These two channels extend the familiar Alchian-Allen and Linder theories to the multilateral setting. The data confirm the theoretical prediction. Non-OECD exporters who face a stronger demand for quality from richer countries charge about 10% more for all destinations. At the same time, countries whose demand is especially distorted by the Alchian-Allen effect charge 58% more. Moreover, geography is more significant to the quality choice of developing countries. Multilateral geographic factors explain 13% of the price variation for non-OECD exporters, 3% for small OECD exporters, and are not significant for OECD exporters overall. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis reveals remarkable cross-country diversity in levels and patterns of the gender gap along the earnings distribution; for the majority of the countries the crisis is associated with declining male/female disparities. We address the role played by labour market institutions in shaping the observed gender pay gap levels and patterns. Labour market deregulation increases gender inequality at the middle and at the top of the pay distribution, but reduces disparities at the bottom. Higher union density and wage coordination reduce the pay gap, with stronger equalizing effects on better-paid jobs.

If single crossing is violated, global incentive compatibility constraints have to be taken into account. This paper studies monotone solutions in a screening model that allows a one-time violation of single crossing. The results show that local and non-local incentive constraints distort the solution in opposite directions. Therefore, the optimal decision might involve distortions above as well as below the first-best decision. Furthermore, the well-known no distortion at the top property does not necessarily hold. The results show that the decision can even be distorted above first best for all types. Sufficient conditions for existence, (strict) monotonicity and continuity of the solution are presented. A new necessary condition satisfied by such solutions is found. An algorithm based on this condition can calculate continuous and strictly monotone solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

As a result, employers have new requirements in the form of worker autonomy and so-called soft skills. These changes seem to mark a break with the expectations of submission and conformity highlighted by Edwards's analysis. Nevertheless, the changes in employers' practices reflect not so much the disappearance of forms of control as a shift towards less authoritarian but equally powerful forms based on the shifting of responsibility on to employees and the internalization of organizational norms. In making this case, we draw more particularly on the example of front-line workers in retailing and the hotel and restaurant industry.","[Bailly, Franck] Univ Rouen, CREAM EA 4702, F-76000 Rouen, France; [Lene, Alexandre] Univ Lille 1, CLERSE CNRS, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite de Rouen Normandie; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille,"Bailly, F (通讯作者)，Univ Rouen, Econ, CREAM EA 4702, UFR Droit Sci Econ & Gest, 3 Ave Pasteur, F-76000 Rouen, France.",franck.bailly@univ-rouen.fr,,,,,,,49,5,7,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

The supply side determination of export growth relates it, as well as the cross-sectoral subsidy, to the economy's industrial structure and difference in productivity growth between sectors. Starting off from fixed sector sizes we endogenise the relation between sector sizes and the productivity growth differential and highlight an economy's structural flexibility. We also highlight the differing implications for the economy from whether a widening productivity growth gap is due to higher productivity growth in the tradable sector or lower productivity growth in the non-tradable sector. When analyzing a transition economy's ability to transform differences in productivity growth into aggregate growth we find a highly context specific relation. We show how transition might be characterized by aggregate growth exceeding tradable sector productivity growth or vice versa depending on the combination between industrial structure, the prevailing incentives for structural change and the ability to take advantage of such incentives. We identify tipping points for endogenous phase shifts where aggregate growth changes from accelerating to diminishing growth and vice versa. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We construct a model with two competing firms each producing a good of different environmental quality and two types of consumers with high and low preferences for environmental quality and characterize a benchmark equilibrium in which each consumer acts individually and disregards that his decision to buy a good may affect the level of pollution. We then show that, compared to the benchmark equilibrium, collective action by consumers with high preference who take into account the impact of their combined decision to buy a good on pollution will result in an equilibrium with not only lower pollution and higher social welfare, but also higher prices and profits for the firms.

The choice of mechanism for selecting decision(s) for payoff is an essential design feature unless subjects isolate each one of the multiple decisions. We report treatments with different payoff mechanisms but the same decision tasks. The data show large differences across mechanisms in subjects' revealed risk preferences, a clear violation of isolation. We illustrate the importance of these mechanism effects by identifying their implications for classical tests of theories of decision under risk. We discuss theoretical properties of commonly used mechanisms, and new mechanisms introduced herein, in order to clarify which mechanisms are theoretically incentive compatible for which theories. We identify behavioral properties of some mechanisms that can introduce bias in elicited risk preferences-from cross-task contamination-even when the mechanism used is theoretically incentive compatible. We explain that selection of a payoff mechanism is an important component of experimental design in many topic areas including social preferences, public goods, bargaining, and choice under uncertainty and ambiguity as well as experiments on decisions under risk.","[Cox, James C.; Sadiraj, Vjollca] Georgia State Univ, Expt Econ Ctr, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Schmidt, Ulrich] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24098 Kiel, Germany",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Kiel,"Cox, JC (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Expt Econ Ctr, 14 Marietta St NW, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",jccox@gsu.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SES-0849590]; Fritz Thyssen Stiftung,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Fritz Thyssen Stiftung,"Financial support was provided by the National Science Foundation (Grant number SES-0849590) and the Fritz Thyssen Stiftung.

This allows to model the anticipation of potential disappointment when receiving bad news. We show that this emotional impact depends on whether information is instrumental, i.e. whether it affects the decision about a subsequent action. The desirability of information in emotional terms can thus not be analyzed separately from its desirability in material terms. We apply the model to a patient's choice problem to undergo medical screening. The availability of effective cure and the timing of testing are predicted to be significant determinants of test uptake.

Panel is depicting FDI flows coming from the external non-EU investors and does not include intra EU investment flows among the member countries (firstly due to the relative insignificance of the intra-EU flows compared to the outer inflow values and secondly due to the need to answer what exactly leads non-European investor to opt for the EU country A and not B).

Domestic employment increases when the number of overseas subsidiaries increases. Both job creation/destruction rates of multinational enterprises are high, and the globalization of Japanese firms accelerates de-industrialization in Japan.

J,"Lloyd, P",,,,"Lloyd, Peter",,,Customs Union and Fiscal Union in Australia at Federation,ECONOMIC RECORD,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RESTRICTIVENESS; TARIFF,"A central feature of the constitutional changes imposed at the time of Federation in 1901 was the fiscal union' of the six States. This union involved the abolition of tariffs on trade between the States, the harmonisation of the tariff rates and of the excise duty rates of the former six colonies, and the establishment of the financial arrangements to distribute the surplus net customs and excise revenues among the States. This paper examines these four elements of the fiscal union. It provides, for the first time, a measure of the change in the level of tariff duties imposed on imports from outside the Commonwealth and in excise duties. The harmonisation of the customs duty rates increased the average rate of customs duty on dutiable imports from outside the Commonwealth by about 34 per cent, while the harmonisation of the excise duty rates maintained the rates at about the mid-point of these rates in the colonies. The four elements of fiscal union interacted and together they laid the foundations of assistance policy, commodity taxation and Commonwealth-State financial relations for the future Commonwealth of Australia.","Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Fac Business & Econ, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Lloyd, P (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Fac Business & Econ, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",pjlloyd@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,22,7,8,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

Using elements of Euclidean geometry, this paper proposes a new method for testing the trilemma and finds considerable evidence in support of it. Further tests indicate that, on average, policy configurations are not on the trilemma constraint, i.e. there is a degree of 'trilemma-ineffectiveness', which is costly for real output growth and price inflation. It is shown that these costs are associated with limited exchange rate stability and financial account openness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Using this estimated ACU index and an ACU deviation indicator, the main finding of this study based on the current trajectory of East Asian currencies relative to this regional ACU benchmark is that there is a formation of two contrasting groups of countries in the region one group of strong currencies and one group of weak currencies. We emphasize that this contrasting trajectory in East Asian intra-regional exchange rates implies disturbed competitive trading relationships in the region, which may result in wasteful beggar-thy-neighbor policies. As emphasized in other recent studies (e.g., Kawai and Takagi, 2012), the region needs a framework for exchange rate policy coordination that will promote intra-regional exchange rate stability. We suggest two important ways in which the region can capitalize on using an ACU index for surveillance purposes in the immediate term. One way is to assess over- and undervaluation of individual currencies from the regional ACU average. The other is to use it as a monitoring device for excessive flows of international capital within the region. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines the relative importance of these two mechanisms under two income distributions in team cooperation. In a repeated public good experiment, we use different combinations of homogeneous/heterogeneous endowments, strong/weak identity, and absence/presence of peer punishment. We find that without punishment, a strong identity can raise cooperation in homogenous and heterogeneous teams, but that the effect depends on the strength of the identity. When punishment is introduced, the impact of punishment depends on the strength of the identity-building activity and the effectiveness of punishment. Furthermore, we find no evidence of stronger cooperation or punishment in teams with strong identity. These findings provide important implications for management policy makers in organizations: ex ante income heterogeneity should be implemented in teams with caution, and the decision of whether identity or punishment is a more effective norm enforcement mechanism in teams is rather sensitive to their interaction and relative strengths.

The author uses firm-level panel data of Chinese listed companies to analyze the effects of the inner structure of pyramid on capital structure, and the differences in those effects between regions with different institutional environments. The results indicate that the longer the layers of a pyramid structure, the stronger its 'leverage effect', as well as the ultimate owner's motivation to expand debt financing. Thus the layers of pyramid structure have a significantly positive effect on capital structure. However, the chains within a pyramid structure have no significant effect on capital structure. Compared with regions with poor institutional environment, in regions with a better institutional environment the effect of the layers of pyramid structure on capital structure becomes smaller.","Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710072, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University,"Su, K (通讯作者)，Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710072, Peoples R China.",suk711@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71402141]; Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [14YJC790103]; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province [2014JQ9370]; Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province [13D211]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in Northwestern Polytechnical University [3102014RW0004],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province); Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in Northwestern Polytechnical University,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71402141), the Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China (No. 14YJC790103), Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province (No. 2014JQ9370), Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province (No. 13D211) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in Northwestern Polytechnical University (No. 3102014RW0004).",,41,3,3,3,33,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAY 6,2015,9.0,,,,,,,,201514.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2015-14,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CL4CB,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356899100001,0

We expand the Kuznets curve to an 'Obesity Kuznets curve'; as incomes rise, resources become available to buy more food. As such, people consume more calories and obesity rates increase. However, as incomes continue to rise, personal health becomes a more valued asset and people decrease their obesity levels (increasing their health levels).

Within this framework we propose a new value that extends the Shapley value to partition function form games, the so-called Rational Belief Shapley (RBS) value. We investigate the strategic foundation of the RBS value by constructing an implementation mechanism. This mechanism extends existing models of multilateral bargaining by allowing players a higher degree of freedom to form coalitions.

In many settings, however, the set of available consumption bundles does not take the form of a linear budget set. In this paper, we adjust the theory of revealed preferences to handle situations where the set of feasible bundles is finite. Such situations occur frequently in many real life and experimental settings. We derive the revealed preference conditions for consistency with utility maximization in this finite choice set setting. Interestingly, we find that it is necessary to make a distinction between the cases where the underlying utility function is weakly monotone, strongly monotone and/or concave. Next, we provide conditions on the structure of the finite choice sets for which the usual revealed preference condition (i.e. GARP) is still valid. We illustrate the relevance of our results by means of an illustration based on two experimental data sets that contain choice behaviour from children and young adults.","[Cosaert, Sam] Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, E Sabbelaan 53, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium; [Demuynck, Thomas] Maastricht Univ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",KU Leuven; Maastricht University,"Cosaert, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, E Sabbelaan 53, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium.",sam.cosaert@kuleuven-kulak.be; t.demuynck@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Cosaert, Sam/AAA-9395-2022","Cosaert, Sam/0000-0003-2934-597X; Demuynck, Thomas/0000-0003-2957-9223",,,,,52,7,8,2,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Under natural assumptions on type distributions and for any discount factor, we show that the unobservability of past negotiations leads to lower prices and faster trading. Unobservability, therefore, enhances the Coasian effect by fostering efficiency and diverting more of the surplus to the player who possesses private information. In addition, we show that the equilibrium is unique and is in pure strategies in the nontransparent regime; this stands in sharp contrast to the existing literature and allows for a better understanding of the Coasian effect and price observability.","[Kaya, Ayca] Univ Miami, Dept Econ, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Liu, Qingmin] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Miami; Columbia University,"Kaya, A (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Dept Econ, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",a.kaya@miami.edu,"刘庆敏, Liu qingmin/AAQ-9255-2020","Kaya, Ayca/0000-0002-4784-4070",,,,,27,10,14,1,15,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

Using the fact that there exist several countries with income-levels higher than Korea, we build a model in which heterogeneous firms in a low-income country decide on the optimal entry modes for serving high-income countries. By allowing firms to use subsidiaries, not only to serve the local market, but also export to other countries, our model shows that a firm's entry decision depends on its own productivity level and transportation costs between countries. Using Korean firm- and plant-level data, we categorize firms by their entry modes and use the logit model to link firms' entry modes with their productivity and transportation costs. Our empirical results are consistent with theoretical implications. We show that more productive firms engage in outward FDI in countries that incur high transportation costs from home. Among FDI firms, we find that under high transportation costs between foreign countries, more productive firms only engage in local sales, while firms with high productivity levels conduct local sales and export sales to third countries if transportation costs are low between foreign countries.","[Lee, Seung-Rae] Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Jae-Hong] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP); Kyung Hee University,"Park, JH (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",srlee@kiep.go.kr; jaehp@khu.ac.kr,,,,,,,26,6,6,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

However, despite growing policy concern over acute mismatches between qualification supply and qualification demand, few of these countries have national systems for generating and disseminating employment forecasts. In this paper, we outline a forecasting method that is parsimonious in its data requirements, making it suitable for the often data-constrained research environments of the Asia Pacific's developing economies. We apply the method to Vietnam, a rapidly growing transition economy. The method generates detailed labour market projections, while also making transparent the underlying macroeconomic, structural and policy shocks that determine the forecasts. A decomposition of forecast outcomes in terms of the individual contributions of these shocks facilitates transparency in forecasting, by clearly distinguishing and ranking factors responsible for generating each forecast outcome.","[Giesecke, James Andrew; Nhi Hoang Tran; Meagher, Gerald Anthony] Victoria Univ, Coll Business, Ctr Policy Studies, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia; [Pang, Felicity] Bank China, Macau Branch, Macau, Peoples R China",Victoria University; Bank of China,"Giesecke, JA (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Coll Business, Ctr Policy Studies, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.",James.Giesecke@vu.edu.au,"Tran, Nhi/JUF-6013-2023","Giesecke, James/0000-0002-7283-0551",Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) [CF 09 2252],Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID)(Australian Aid (AusAID)),"This paper is a product of a collaborative project with researchers from Vietnam's Institute of Labour Science and Social Affairs (ILSSA), a research arm of Vietnam's Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA).

Whilst this might directly lead to a substitution of workers by hours, there may also be a positive employment effect due to reduced costs.

For a panel of German plants (2001-2006) drawn from the IAB Establishment Panel, we are the first to analyse the effect of increased standard hours on employment. Using difference-in-difference methods we find that, consistent with theory, overtime plants showed a significant positive employment response, whilst for standard-time plants there is no difference between plants that increased standard hours and those that did not.

On the empirical front, the critique shows that econometric exercises prove that in the long-run exports and imports grow at an approximately equal rate. With respect to the theoretical consistency of the law, a model of an open economy is built to examine the role of external demand and supply factors in determining a country's exports considering the case of small and large economies. This distinction allows matching the results of the law with the demand approach in it and shows that the law is ineffective in small economies.","[Clavijo Cortes, Pedro Hugo] Catholic Univ, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Bogota, Colombia; [Ros Bosch, Jaime] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Cortes, PHC (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Bogota, Colombia.",phclavijo@ucatolica.edu.co; ros@nd.edu,,"Clavijo Cortes, Pedro Hugo/0000-0002-1021-6206",,,,,43,12,18,0,7,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, INST GEOGRAFIA",COYOACAN C P,"CIUDAD UNIV, FAC ECONOMIA, CIRCUITO INTEROR S-N, 1ER PISO, EDIFICIO B, COYOACAN C P, 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

Absent monitoring, workers produce low output, while at the same time receiving an information rent. To gain the works council's consent to the installation of a monitoring technology, firms need to compensate workers for the lost information rent. Hence, by making it more costly to produce high output, works councils can serve firms as an instrument to commit to low output levels.

We compare the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) model to three alternative demand structures: oligopolistic competition in prices, oligopolistic competition in quantities, and translog preferences. Our economy is characterized by two distortions: a labor distortion due to the misalignment of markups on goods and leisure, and an entry distortion due to the misalignment of the consumer surplus effect and the profit destruction effect of entry. The two distortions interact in determining the wedge between the market-driven and optimal level of product diversity.

Gate revenue sharing reduces incentives to invest in talent. Initially lower investments boost profits, because total costs go down, but investing less also shrinks revenues, which harms profits at higher levels of sharing. The league maximizes profits by setting a sharing rule, which balances these two effects. Gate revenue sharing decreases talent investments more strongly in leagues with heterogeneous rather than homogeneous local market sizes. As a result, the profit-maximizing level of sharing is higher for relatively homogeneous leagues. This implies that more balanced leagues are expected to share more gate revenues than less balanced leagues. It also explains why gate revenue sharing is widely used in the U.S. major leagues, while it is largely absent in European soccer.

A total of 14 manufacturing industries are considered, using two methods based on: (i) the Leontief (1951) model to measure the consumption of intermediate goods used in production; and (ii) the analysis of total factor productivity (TFP). The studies performed show that manufacturing trends have diverged in the two countries. In Mexico, an increased need for imported goods and services was offset by a reduction in domestic goods and service requirements, and an increase in the TFP of production. In the case of Brazil, the fact that manufactured goods markets are more isolated from foreign trade seems to have contributed to a weak productivity performance.","[Rangel, Armenio de Souza] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Commun & Arts ECA, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Freitas, Fernando Garcia] Brazilian Chamber Serv, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Freitas, Fernando Garcia] Brazilian Aluminium Assoc ABAL, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Rangel, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Commun & Arts ECA, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",armenio@usp.br; fernando.garcia.freitas@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,7,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,APR,2015,,115,,,,,181,198,,,,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CO9NA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359501300010,0

Students logically revise their beliefs in response to the information, and their subjective beliefs about future major choice are associated with beliefs about their own earnings and ability. We estimate a rich model of college major choice using the panel of beliefs data. While expected earnings and perceived ability are a significant determinant of major choice, heterogeneous tastes are the dominant factor in the choice of major. Analyses that ignore the correlation in tastes with earnings expectations inflate the role of earnings in college major choices.

From a methodological perspective, the present paper advocates the application of partially ordered set (POSET) theory as an alternative approach. Its main virtue is that it takes the ordinal nature of the data seriously and dispenses with the unavoidably subjective assignment of weights to incomparable properties, maintains a high standard of objectivity, and can be applied in various fields of economics. As an application, the POSET approach is then used to calculate new indices on the stringency of fiscal rules for 81 countries over the period 1985-2012 based on recent data by IMF (2012). The derived measures of fiscal rules are used to test their significance for public finances in a fiscal reaction function and compare the POSET with the composite index approach.

We used a global computable general equilibrium model, and evaluated the effectiveness of emission trading using welfare losses associated with climate mitigation for scenarios with and without emission trading, as measured by the Hicksian Equivalent Variation (HEV). We found that emission trading contributed to a reduction in the economic losses associated with climate mitigation for all technological assumptions, burden sharing schemes, and stabilization targets. The net global welfare losses in scenarios without emission trading ranged between 0.7% and 1.9%, whereas emission trading reduced the losses by 0.1% to 0.5%. The range depended on the assumptions in the burden sharing schemes, technological constraints, and stabilization targets. The percentage change in welfare gain from emission trading varied regionally, and was relatively high in low-income or middle-income countries (0.2% to 1.0% and -0.1% to 1.2%, respectively) compared to high-income countries (-0.1% to 03%). Some regions displayed negative values with regard to the effectiveness of emission trading, which might be due to the change in goods and service trades associated with emission trading. If the usage of carbon capture and storage was constrained, welfare loss became large and the effectiveness of emission trading ultimately increased. The use of a burden sharing scheme was a significant factor in changing the effectiveness of emission trading, and the per capita emission convergence in 2050 was more effective for emission trading than a per income convergence.

However, the few existing measures of marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for environmental quality improvements indicate low valuations by affected households. This paper argues that this seeming paradox is the central puzzle at the intersection of environmental and development economics: Given poor environmental quality and high health burdens in developing countries, why is MWTP seemingly so low? We develop a conceptual framework for understanding this puzzle and propose four potential explanations for why environmental quality is so poor: (1) due to low income levels, individuals value increases in income more than marginal improvements in environmental quality; (2) the marginal costs of environmental quality improvements are high; (3) political economy factors undermine efficient policymaking; and (4) market failures such as weak property rights and missing capital markets distort MWTP for environmental quality. We review the literature on each explanation and discuss how the framework applies to climate change, which is perhaps the most important issue at the intersection of environment and development economics. The paper concludes with a list of promising and unanswered research questions for the emerging sub-field of envirodevonomics.","[Greenstone, Michael] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Greenstone, Michael; Jack, B.

We analyze this inner conflict quantitatively, adopting two economic-psychological approaches: First, we note that the trade-off causes cognitive dissonance after making a choice that results in a wider desirability gap between the chosen and rejected alternatives. Second, the consumer surplus improves by 11.2% with a no-choice option for suspending judgment in the presence of cognitive dissonance. Third, individual characteristics such as gender and annual household income are significantly correlated with both cognitive dissonance and a preference for the no-choice option.

A key departure is that we consider a case where the authority relationship is defined only by the allocation of responsibility through contingent contracts. Within this framework, we show that the contractual arrangement that allocates responsibility asymmetrically often emerges as the optimal organizational form, which gives rise to the chain of command pertaining to hierarchical organizations.","Osaka Univ, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan",Osaka University,"Ishida, J (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan.",,"Ishida, Junichiro/D-1809-2012","Ishida, Junichiro/0000-0002-0674-0216","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25245031, 24530196] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,31,1,1,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

We study IFI loans to a credit-constrained LIC. The IFI's repayment policy is determined by the interplay of its concerns for the welfare of the loan recipient and its fiduciary responsibilities to creditor countries. If the IFI is unable to commit to either the size of future loans or the repayment terms on past loans, conditional loans are superior to unconditional loans. Thus, IFI altruism and the inability to commit are sufficient reasons to equip loans with conditions. Conditional loans produce an efficient allocation of resources, so altruism is not a fundamental reason that loans fail to increase welfare.","[Mourmouras, Alexandros] Int Monetary Fund, Asia & Pacific Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Rangazas, Peter] IUPUI, Dept Econ, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA",International Monetary Fund; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,"Rangazas, P (通讯作者)，IUPUI, Dept Econ, CA 518, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",prangaza@iupui.edu,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,10,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Prima facie, the imbalances seem a significant problem. However, acknowledging that would question mainstream economics' celebratory stance toward globalization. That tension prompted an array of theories which explained the imbalances while retaining the claim that globalization is economically beneficial. This paper surveys those new theories. It contrasts them with the structural Keynesian explanation that views the imbalances as an inevitable consequence of neoliberal globalization. The paper also describes how globalization created a political economy that supported the system despite its proclivity to generate trade imbalances.","AFL CIO, Washington, DC 20006 USA",,"Palley, TI (通讯作者)，AFL CIO, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",,,,,,,,28,9,12,1,16,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

We investigate the sources of this gap by looking in detail at the university admission process in the UK. We use a 50% random sample of administrative data covering all university applications in 2008 and find no evidence of universities discriminating against female applicants. What we find is that girls are less likely to apply for a bachelor's degree in Economics to start with, even if once they apply their likelihood of enrolling is the same as for boys. Girls are less likely to study Maths in high school and this may deter them from applying to study Economics at the university level. However, even among those who have studied Maths, females are less likely to apply than males, suggesting that differences in the choice of A level subjects cannot explain the whole gap.

We also find that, while changes in returns to general and specific human capital contributed to narrowing wage inequality in the 1990s and widening wage inequality in the 2000s, a significant fraction of the increase in wage inequality in the 2000s is attributable to composition effects arising from an increased share of educated and experienced workers, among whom wages are more dispersed.","[Yamada, Ken] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Bras Basah, Singapore; [Kawaguchi, Daiji] Hitotsubashi Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo 1868601, Japan",Singapore Management University; Hitotsubashi University,"Yamada, K (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Bras Basah, Singapore.",kenyamada@smu.edu.sg; kawaguch@econ.hit-u.ac.jp,"Yamada, Ken/GSM-8395-2022","Yamada, Ken/0000-0003-3030-4112; Kawaguchi, Daiji/0000-0002-0595-9443","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26245060, 23330079, 23330070, 25245041] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,45,11,11,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Using aggregated annual data from 1987 to 2012 in a simultaneous equations framework we show that the rapid increase in the urban residential housing price can be well explained by the forces of demand and supply, with income determining demand and cost of construction affecting supply. We find the income elasticity of demand for urban housing to be approximately 1, the price elasticity of demand to be approximately -1.1 and the price elasticity of supply of the total housing stock to be approximately 0.5. The resulting long-run effect of income on urban housing prices in elasticity terms is approximately 0.7, because the increase in income has shifted the demand curve outward more rapidly than the supply curve.","[Chow, Gregory C.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Niu, Linlin] Xiamen Univ, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Princeton University; Xiamen University,"Chow, GC (通讯作者)，Fisher Hall Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",gchow@princeton.edu,,,"Gregory C Chow Econometric Research Program of Princeton University; Natural Science Foundation of China [70903053, 71273007]",Gregory C Chow Econometric Research Program of Princeton University; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Address for Correspondence: Fisher Hall Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA.

In contrast to existing studies, we use generalized propensity score and continuous matching techniques to estimate the effects of differences in access to bank financing. We show that the response of sales to measure of access to external funds differs considerably between firms of different size. The largest effect of additional external funds is observed for small firms. Moreover, the relationship between debt and domestic/foreign sales is non-monotonic, displaying a pronounced inverse U-shape. Thus, an increase in debt financing may cause a decrease in exporting and domestic sales for some levels of indebtedness, while stimulating it for other levels.","[Damijan, Joze P.; Kostevc, Crt; Polanec, Saso] Univ Ljubljana, Inst Econ Res, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Damijan, Joze P.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS, Leuven, Belgium",University of Ljubljana; KU Leuven,"Kostevc, C (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Inst Econ Res, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",joze.damijan@ef.uni-lj.si; crt.kostevc@ef.uni-lj.si; saso.polanec@ef.uni-lj.si,,"Damijan, Joze/0000-0001-9150-1174",,,,,33,5,5,4,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2015,42.0,1,,,,,131,155,,10.1007/s10663-014-9251-5,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AZ4IK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348184600006,0

In response, we employ data on greenfield FDI that, in contrast to M&As, may be more clearly linked to skill upgrading. Our data also delineate greenfield FDI by sector, function and destination, allowing us to control for different motives and skill intensities for 17 developed countries for 2003-2005. We find that greenfield FDI in support services, e.g., back and front office services, induces polarized skill upgrading, benefitting high-skilled workers at the expense of medium-skilled workers, thereby polarizing wages.","[Davies, Ronald B.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Dublin, Ireland; [Desbordes, Rodolphe] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland",University College Dublin; University of Strathclyde,"Davies, RB (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Econ, Dublin, Ireland.",rondavies@gmail.com,"Davies, Ronald/AAT-4531-2021","Davies, Ron/0000-0002-9738-9256; Desbordes, Rodolphe/0000-0002-9190-7331",European Commission [FP7-PEOPLE-ITN-2008-211429],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"We thank the editor; two anonymous referees; seminar participants at Georg-August Universitat, Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat, Athens University of Economics and Business, University of Bayreuth; and conference participants at the 8th Danish International Workshop; the 4th GIST conference; the 2012 European Trade Study Group; the 2012 conference on Multinational Firms, Trade, and Innovation; the 2012 conference on Global Firms, Global Finance, and Global Inequalities; and the 2012 SIRE Workshop on Outsourcing and FDI.

A fundamental difference between these two types of economies concerns with the existence of sound economic institutions including in particular the institutions constraining government expropriation of private properties. In this paper, using a survey data set of private enterprises in China, we find that severer government expropriation in the form of higher informal levies, extralegal payments, and entertainment fees causes firms to diversify. We then provide two case studies to highlight the extra costs that China's private entrepreneurs need to bear for doing businesses, and how they can subsequently leverage their relations with government bureaucrats to diversify into various businesses.

We estimate a VAR model relating GDP, unemployment rates, saving rates and social spending. Our results suggest that social spending has significant distortionary effects in the labour markets as measured by its long-term effects on the unemployment rate, which translate into a detrimental effect on long-term output, this despite a positive, albeit small, effect on the gross savings rate. There are important policy implications of these results. If one considers the systems as they are, any further expansion in their generosity would have detrimental long-term effects. These detrimental effects, however, are neither an indictment of social spending nor evidence against extension of benefits. What they highlight is the need to carefully consider the financing mechanisms currently used and the need to align benefits and contributions in the pension component of social security and the need to find a tax revenue mix that is less distortionary for the unfunded benefits.","[Pereira, Alfredo M.] Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Andraz, Jorge M.] Univ Algarve, CEFAGE UALG Ctr Adv Studies Management & Econ, Fac Econ, P-8000139 Faro, Portugal",William & Mary; Universidade do Algarve,"Pereira, AM (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",ampere@wm.edu,"Andraz, Jorge/B-5858-2009","Andraz, Jorge/0000-0001-9209-3344; Pereira, Alfredo Marvao/0000-0003-1381-0937",,,,,18,2,2,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This paper analyzes two questions: (1) whether a certain level of initial productivity explains a firm's choice and (2) how the productivity of such a multinational firm changes over time after FDI. Using the longitudinal panel data on Japanese firms from 1980 to 2005, we trace firm-level decisions over decades. We find that the total factor productivity (TFP) does not explain a firm's choice for starting FDI in manufacturing, but it does in service sector. In contrast, the size and the profitability of firms motivate their FDI in the manufacturing sector, but these do not matter in the service sector. In addition, after FDI, we observe 1.3% annual growth rates of TFP in service, whereas firms in manufacturing show only 0.9% growth rates. To eliminate the selection bias, each multinational firm is paired with domestic firm(s) with similar ex-ante characteristics in the same industry.","Tokyo Gakugei Univ, Dept Econ, Tokyo 1848501, Japan",Tokyo Gakugei University,"Ito, Y (通讯作者)，Tokyo Gakugei Univ, Dept Econ, Tokyo 1848501, Japan.",yuki110@u-gakugei.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [22730189] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,24,4,4,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We show that the effects of an unexpected increase in government spending are not uniform across countries with higher spending leading to a depreciation of the real exchange rate in Brazil and Chile, whereas in Mexico, we observe an appreciation. The trade balance deteriorates in all three countries. We also report that an unexpected increase in taxes leads to recessionary impacts and improves the trade balance. Only in Mexico is there evidence of a real exchange rate depreciation.

It describes an architecture that supports continuous data harvesting and curation, a persistent registry and repository, a robust analytical engine that supports on-demand and standard reports, a rich gallery of interactive maps and links to social media to support citizen engagement. The fundamental difference in architectures derives from different goals. Historical knowledge economy indexes are designed to describe developing countries progress towards a knowledge economy.

We provide three main results for the case in which the exogenous cash-flow is not too large and the opportunity cost of budgets is positive but arbitrarily low. First, firms keep small budgets and markups are high most of the time. Second, the dispersion of markups and money left on the table across procurement auctions hinges on differences, both endogenous and exogenous, in the availability of financial resources rather than on significant private information. Third, we explain why the empirical analysis of the size of markups based on the standard auction model may have a bias, downwards or upwards, positively correlated with the availability of financial resources. A numerical example illustrates that our model is able to generate a rich set of values for markups, bid dispersion and concentration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Both his early teaching experience, and his background in mathematics exerted formative influences on his later work. No lesser figure than Schumpeter himself, whom he met while obtaining his academic teaching qualification at the University of Bonn, reportedly prophesized Schneider to become the new preceptor of Germany .This provides noteworthy evidence of both Schumpeter's deep knowledge of human nature, and of the ironic side of his Viennese wittiness: while praeceptor Germaniae was an honorary title awarded by historians but to a few distinguished scholars of the middle ages, the term praeceptor had come to denote the rather modest position of adjunct teacher in grammar schools by the 19 (th) century. Indeed, Erich Schneider was to dominate economics teaching during the first post-war decades in Germany through his four volume introductory textbook (1947-62), but he left little lasting imprint on economic theory. In essence, he worked on all 'big issues' of the 1930ies such as market forms or the theory of production, eventually ventured into management science, and became an ardent advocate of Keynesianism. However, he did not follow the trails of economic change and innovation as one might have expected given the academic guidance obtained from Schumpeter. The absence of mathematical language for the analysis of dynamic phenomena during his days must have kept the trained mathematician from delving into Schumpeterian matters. Thus, through all of his academic life, Erich Schneider stayed a loyal disciple of Schumpeter's, but cannot be considered a follower.","[Blind, Georg D.] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Pyka, Andreas] Univ Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany",University of Zurich; University Hohenheim,"Blind, GD (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.",georg.blind@aoi.uzh.ch,"Pyka, Andreas/IST-6329-2023","Pyka, Andreas/0000-0001-6207-6690; , Georg/0000-0001-9038-1799",,,,,77,0,0,1,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The results suggest that states most capable of fighting groups with territorial objectives experience the highest levels of terrorism. Under weak conditions, states always allocate their resources to deter groups from carrying out guerrilla attacks. Accordingly, when it is possible for both guerrilla and terrorist attacks to be optimal for a group, states allocate resources to ensure a terrorist campaign, even though this (mis)allocation facilitates more costly terrorist attacks than happen when facing a group that only uses terrorism.","Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Carter, DB (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",dbcarter@princeton.edu,,,,,,,33,12,15,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Stone-Lewbel (SL) price indices for commodity groups are constructed using information on the budget shares and the Consumer Price Indices (CPIs) of the goods comprising the commodity groups, which allows for household-level prices to be recovered. This study evaluates how susceptible are elasticities and marginal effects estimates from traditional parametric demand systems to the CPI used in the construction of the SL prices. To do this, three alternative regional CPIs are considered for the construction of the SL prices: monthly, quarterly and a constant (unity) price index. Elasticities and marginal effect estimates are computed for eight food commodity groups using the Exact Affine Stone Index (EASI) model as the parametric demand system and data from the United States Consumer Expenditure Survey. The estimates proved to be robust to the alternative regional CPIs considered in the construction of SL price indices, even to the absence of one. Hence, the results suggest that it is possible to accurately estimate a demand system even in the absence of price information.","[Castellon, Cesar E.] Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Boonsaeng, Tullaya; Carpio, Carlos E.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Clemson University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Carpio, CE (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",carlos.carpio@ttu.edu,,,,,,,22,14,14,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Some of these variables are prices, while others are from surveys. Causality tests, historical decompositions within a VAR and out-of-sample forecasts are among the tools used. This article concludes that monthly stock returns contain much more information about future economic conditions than the other variables. The spread between Moody's BAA and AAA bonds, the spread between the constant maturity 10-year government bond and the federal funds rate, as well as uncertainty in future economic conditions as measured by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Business Outlook Survey also provide information about future economic conditions. Notably, this article finds that monthly stock returns contain more information about future economic conditions than does the vix and that variables based on market prices provide more information than survey data. This result provides some support for the notion that market prices aggregate information.","[Cover, James Peery; Lee, Hye-Jin] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Culverhouse Coll Commerce & Business Adm, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Cover, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Culverhouse Coll Commerce & Business Adm, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",jcover@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,14,3,3,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The identification of this elasticity has been performed using the reform approved by Law 35/2006, which came into force in January 2007. The elasticities obtained suggest the existence of important efficiency costs, with significant regional differences. The average elasticity estimated for Spain as a whole is 0.676. However, this elasticity is highly dispersed throughout the Spanish administrative regions, which indicates the unequal power of distortion of the tax. Thus, households whose principal source of income is salary display an elasticity of 0.337, compared to 0.682 for households whose main income source comes from business or savings. Lastly, a positive correlation is also detected between elasticity and income level: an elasticity of 3.6 is reached for taxpayers with an annual gross income exceeding 100 000(sic).","[Felix Sanz-Sanz, Jose] Univ Complutense, Dept Appl Econ, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Arrazola-Vacas, Maria; Romero-Jordan, Desiderio] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Rueda-Lopez, Nuria] Univ San Pablo CEU, Dept Appl Econ, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; San Pablo CEU University,"Sanz-Sanz, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense, Dept Appl Econ, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",jfelizs@ccee.ucm.es,"romero-jordán, desiderio/L-4219-2014; romero-jordán, desiderio/AAZ-2424-2020; Arrazola, María/AAP-8781-2021; SANZ-SANZ, JOSE FELIX/H-8042-2015","romero-jordán, desiderio/0000-0002-5699-5364; Arrazola, María/0000-0002-4407-9510; SANZ-SANZ, JOSE FELIX/0000-0002-5633-8807",,,,,43,8,9,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The present study differs from prior research in several ways. First, a large longitudinal data-set is used; data for 50 states for the period 1980-2011 are examined. Second, the effects of both federal and state background checks, including state-mandated private sales background checks, are estimated. Finally, a fixed effects model that controls for both state-level and year-specific effects is used. Results suggest that states that require dealer background checks have lower gun-related murder rates than other states. In addition, after implementation of the Brady Act, gun-related murder rates fell. However, the results also suggest that, for the entire period in question, states with private sales background checks had higher gun-related murder rates than states with no such background checks. If one only looks the Brady Act period, however, then the private sales background check variable is insignificant. These results for private sales background checks are novel and contrary to the results of much prior research in this area.","Quinnipiac Univ, Dept Econ, Hamden, CT 06518 USA",Quinnipiac University,"Gius, M (通讯作者)，Quinnipiac Univ, Dept Econ, Hamden, CT 06518 USA.",Mark.gius@quinnipiac.edu,,,,,,,19,9,11,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The current increase in the number of companies reporting on CSR data is caused by many different factors, including stakeholder pressures, the economic crisis, growing awareness of sustainability issues as well as the appearance of more and more new reporting requirements initiated by national governments and stock exchanges. Despite the growing popularity of CSR reporting, it is still only a small percentage of companies that decide to regularly disclose their data on CSR activities. Therefore, the question is raised as to what factors influence the development of CSR reporting practices. The paper presents the results of the research, which aimed to answer the above question, highlighting especially the role of government in the process. The study was carried out using two web-based surveys. The questionnaires were distributed to respondents from different European Union member states. The first group of respondents consisted of specialists, consultants, researchers and academics specializing in the field of CSR reporting - 'experts' - and the second group consisted of CSR managers, employees involved in developing CSR reports - 'preparers'. The results suggest that report 'preparers' and external 'experts' have different views on some aspects, e.g., reasons to issue a CSR report. The survey also shows that there is a need for the greater participation of government in the development of sustainability reporting practices.","[Habek, Patrycja; Wolniak, Radoslaw] Silesian Tech Univ, Roosevelta St 26-28, PL-41800 Zabrze, Poland",Silesian University of Technology,"Habek, P (通讯作者)，Silesian Tech Univ, Roosevelta St 26-28, PL-41800 Zabrze, Poland.",patrycja.habek@polsl.pl; radoslaw.wolniak@polsl.pl,"Hąbek, Patrycja/T-3192-2018; Wolniak, Radoslaw/P-7146-2017","Hąbek, Patrycja/0000-0002-7545-1637; Wolniak, Radoslaw/0000-0003-0317-9811",National Science Centre Poland [DEC-2011/03/B/HS4/01790],"National Science Centre Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",This paper has been prepared under the project funded by the National Science Centre Poland awarded on the basis of a decision number DEC-2011/03/B/HS4/01790,,61,18,21,0,34,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

As well known, the major difference lies on the way non-convexities are considered in the computation of market prices. According to the classical marginal pricing theories, the resulting market prices are supposed to serve as the key signals around which capacity expansion revolves. Thus, the implementation of one or the other pricing rule can have a different effect on the investment incentives perceived by generation technologies, affecting the long-term efficiency of the whole market scheme. The objective of this paper is to assess to what extent long-term investment incentives can be affected by the pricing rule implemented. To do so, we propose a long-term capacity expansion model where investment decisions are taken based on the market remuneration. We use the model to determine the optimal mix in a real-size thermal system with high penetration of renewable energy sources (since its intermittency enhances the relevance of non-convexities), when alternatively considering the aforementioned pricing schemes.

Findings suggest that in the short run, investors react adversely to such events and that recalcitrant CEOs end up costing their shareholders dearly. Such scandals are more likely to occur among large firms, firms with insiders on the board and where the value of options granted to a firm's managers is substantial. However, firms with more cash flows are less likely to be mired in such scandals, and their stock returns are less likely to be affected. There is an increase in stock price volatility of affected firms in the days following the announcement of the scandal. A point of respite for investors is the damage being confined to the short run. The stock price performance of the firms affected by the scandals matches the performance of control firms in the long run post-announcement. However, the operating performance of the sample firms is better than their matched counterparts in the years after the scandal. We contribute to the extant literature by considering corporate scandal events that are the doings of a firm's CEO and not necessarily financially motivated.","[Jory, Surendranath R.; Saha, Amrita] Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Ngo, Thanh N.] E Carolina Univ, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Wang, Daphne] Univ Texas Pan Amer, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA",University of Sussex; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Wang, D (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Pan Amer, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.",dwang@utpa.edu,"Wang, Daphne/L-1007-2018; SAHA, AMRITA/L-7038-2016","Wang, Daphne/0000-0003-0938-6360; Jory, S R/0000-0002-8265-0001",,,,,42,19,27,2,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We characterize an idea by its market profitability and the degree of positive/negative externality that it imposes on the employing firm's profits. The innovation process consists of exploration and development. Exploring an idea internally grants the employee access to exploration support provided by the firm but reduces his appropriability of the idea. We demonstrate that ideas exhibiting weak externalities are explored and developed externally, whereas ideas with strong externalities are explored and handled internally. Moderate externalities are associated with internal exploration but subsequent external development. An increase in the firm's exploration support attracts internal exploration of a wider range of ideas but may increase the likelihood of subsequent external development. We further show that while the optimal level of exploration support rises with the firm's innovation appropriability, overall profits may decline. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This research seeks to examine the effect of size, legal form and share of the foreign capital in the ownership structure of the organisation on the implementation of diversity management. An empirical survey was carried out that examined the state of the implementation of diversity management in the Slovak Republic. Using non-parametric statistical methods and post-hoc testing by data analysis, the research survey revealed that the evaluated factors significantly influenced the attitudes of respondents towards the diversity management implementation. The respondents working in large business organisations generally perceive the diversity management concept more positively when compared with respondents working in smaller organisations. The respondents working in business organisations where the share of foreign capital in the ownership structure exceeds 80% are more positively inclined towards the implementation of diversity management. The legal form of the business organisation does not influence the attitudes of the respondents in any significant way. We recommend domestic business organisations and SMEs focus on the diversity issues, especially on supporting the diversified work teams. This can preferably be done by diversity training, using formalised HRM procedures and mentoring initiatives. Diversity management is not solely a domain of subsidiaries and large business organisations. The organisations are able to benefit from diversity management regardless of their size and country of origin.","[Lancaric, Drahoslav; Savov, Radovan] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Management, Nitra, Slovakia; [Cheben, Juraj] Metropolitan Univ Prague, Dept Int Business, Prague, Czech Republic",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Metropolitan University Prague,"Cheben, J (通讯作者)，Metropolitan Univ Prague, Dept Int Business, Prague, Czech Republic.",cheben@mup.cz,"Lancaric, Drahoslav/AAD-8710-2019; Cheben, Juraj/O-2699-2014","Cheben, Juraj/0000-0002-2624-8659; Savov, Radovan/0000-0002-4882-0978; Lancaric, Drahoslav/0000-0002-1262-6698",Juraj Dobrila University of Pula [RERO-SO9-552],Juraj Dobrila University of Pula,This work was supported by the Juraj Dobrila University of Pula [grant number RERO-SO9-552].,,57,7,9,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

All these criteria and indicators are periodically adjusted in new methodologies. In this context, universities face many challenges generated by the huge dynamism of the socio-economic environment. As learning organizations, universities have the capacity of continuous improvement through its systemic approach, common vision and team working. They become sustainable organizations seeking for excellence. In order to develop towards success, universities have built specific strategies of communication with stakeholders - students, parents, graduates, companies etc. All the relationships that resist in time with organizations, individuals and groups being considered high-quality relationships reflect the relational capital of the university. It is the real source of success. It is the reason which explains why two decisions implemented in two different universities, using the same resources do not generate the same result. Relationships cannot be copied. This paper reveals the importance of the relational capital in universities. It starts from the following statements: universities can develop only in the context of relationships - networkings, associations, consortia, bilateral agreements, multilateral contracts; leadership and management play a decisive role in continuing or ending a relationship; people build or destroy institutional relationships; in all these relationships, transfer of emotions take place. Therefore, the main research question is: What can universities do in order to better benefit from the relational capital? The main objectives of this paper consist of the following: identifying characteristics of the relational capital in universities; analysis of the students' and professors' perceptions in terms of investing the relational capital, as well as understanding the level of importance of the relational capital; identifying measures that universities need to take in the process of investing in the relational capital. Main outcome of the paper consists of a new approach of the relational capital in universities through the set of measures proposed in order to better benefit from the relational capital. Universities face scarce resources and many constraints of all kind in a context of challenges. In order to adopt proper strategies, or to implement them, higher education institutions must develop relationships with all stakeholders. This is not a simple process. The universities which have succeeded in an area, had invested in their capital relationship. This paper reveals what people can learn from others experience in terms of developing relationships. It proves the way of thinking of the students and professors. It shows that institutional development, including university one, is very much based on individual and group relationships. In fact, relational capital can be a competitive advantage.","Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest,"Lordache-Platis, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",magdalena.iordache-platis@drept.unibuc.ro,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,237,244,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600028,0

While policymakers are aware that these programmes come with allocative efficiency costs, they justify the programmes on the grounds that they insulate the domestic economy from unexpected price spikes in the international rice market. An interesting matter for policy evaluation is to quantify the insulation benefit that the programmes provide in circumstances of sudden severe import price spikes. To examine this question, we undertake a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) simulation in which the Philippines is subject to an external rice price shock. We find that the insulation benefit of the support programmes under a 2008-like event is worth approximately 0.10% of real consumption. However, the cost of insuring against these price spikes is significant. We estimate the annual cost of the rice market interventions at approximately 0.40% of real consumption.","[Mariano, Marc Jim M.] Monash Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Giesecke, James A.; Tran, Nhi H.] Victoria Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia",Monash University; Victoria University,"Mariano, MJM (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",marcjim.mariano@gmail.com,"Tran, Nhi/JUF-6013-2023","Mariano, Marc Jim/0000-0002-3792-7112; Giesecke, James/0000-0002-7283-0551",,,,,46,2,2,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Marketing effectiveness may be characterized as the function of improving the process where marketers go to market with the goal of optimizing their own marketing resources spent to achieve even better results for both of the short-and long-term strategic marketing objectives. Not only the improved visibility into marketing effectiveness has helped companies to better prioritize their efforts, but it also has improved the quality and precision of the marketing resources demanded by the sales force. Finding the appropriate key metrics should contribute to the evaluation of marketing effectiveness. Strategic marketing is included in strategic management, which helps to improve the company's market share. However, there is an increasing trend of creation effectiveness in companies and it is necessary to check returns of finance and search for efficiency of the funds put into marketing. Performance management can be defined as a system utilizing the information to introduce appropriate changes in the organizational culture, systems and processes to achieve optimal performance agreement targets, and the allocation of resource and information management on possible modifications of business strategy. The scientific objective of the paper is to look for the set of metrics, which is important from the marketing strategic point of view, and includes the specific performance group.

We analysed the CoP by considering its entire life cycle, starting from the motives for its establishment, through its active performance, up to the current stage, where the members need to decide whether the community will remain viable. Particular attention was paid to the group dynamics and issues that seemed relevant to the change in dynamics why a CoP maintain its vitality or dissipate. In the analysis, different motives bound the group together at various stages of the community's life cycle. Shared interest was a combining force. However, it was affected by motives and realisation of plans, the pace at which the CoP evolved and finally, the sense of communality. Thereby the life cycle analysis revealed three themes that explained the change in the group dynamics and the dispersal of the community: 1) differentiation and dispersal of interests, 2) growth that resulted in role differentiation and 3) inclusion of investors. The themes were all related to the fact that the case community operated with not only knowledge, but also a tangible product. Therefore, the tangibility of a problem to be solved seems to play a pivotal role in a CoP's operations and dynamics. As a result of a tangible objective in the case study, outside investors were included in the operations. Our interpretation is that if a CoP needs external funding to achieve its goals, it creates a new situation that significantly affects its operations, particularly the group dynamics. We conclude that a CoP's group dynamics and cohesion are reinforced by shared interests and weakened by goals set by external stakeholders. Such goals affect the members' roles, thus degenerating the CoP's original idea.","[Pohjola, Ilpo; Puusa, Anu] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Business, Joensuu, Finland",University of Eastern Finland,"Pohjola, I (通讯作者)，Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Business, Joensuu, Finland.",ilpo.pohjola@tiedepuisto.fi; anu.puusa@uef.fi,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,5,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,262,269,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600031,0

Neither individual and family background nor labour market characteristics appear to be strongly associated with the gender education gap. There is some evidence that the gender gap in upper secondary education reflects the rising share of single parent households which impacts boys' attainment more than girls'.

We obtain a deficit marginal cost (DMC) curve that is not limited to a small number of levels, such as the curve used currently in Brazil, which is limited to four levels. The marginal cost of deficit is an important exogenous parameter used in the model's chain to calculate the operation's marginal cost and short-term market pricing. The electric energy deficit is a temporary lack of continuity in meeting demand, which is usually predictable and involves prior notice to the consumer. The cause of this deficit may be a lack of investment and/or low water inflows that impact the production of hydroelectric power plants. In this study, the marginal cost of the deficit is obtained from restrictions on the provision of electricity for productive sectors and by calculating the corresponding impact on the gross domestic product. The proposed methodology can be used with data from the I-O matrix of any country to estimate its marginal cost of electric energy deficit.","[Vasconcelos, Paulo Sergio; Tapia Carpio, Lucio Guido] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, COPPE, Energy Planning Program, BR-21945 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Vasconcelos, PS (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, COPPE, Energy Planning Program, BR-21945 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",paulosergio@ppe.ufrj.br,"Carpio, Lucio Guido Tapia/H-5635-2013","Tapia Carpio, Lucio Guido/0000-0003-1998-1526; VASCONCELOS, PAULO SERGIO/0000-0002-0480-7587",,,,,30,12,12,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using auction experiments, this research evaluates consumer behaviour related to informational messages about honey that is produced locally, domestically and internationally. Results from 115 adult consumers show that consumers' demand for honey varies significantly based on the geographic location of the honey's production, product packaging and the information they have about the product. Consumers demonstrate greater demand for locally produced honey, especially when provided information about negative aspects of internationally produced honey that include adulteration. This shows that such negative media attention on specialty products offers small producers an opportunity to increase profitability by marketing themselves as a specialized niche alternative.","[Wu, Shang] Univ Delaware, Dept Econ, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Fooks, Jacob R.; Messer, Kent D.] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Delaney, Deborah] Univ Delaware, Dept Entomol & Wildlife Ecol, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University of Delaware; University of Delaware; University of Delaware,"Messer, KD (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",messer@udel.edu,"Messer, Kent/AAK-8811-2020",,Northeast Center for Risk Management Education [RME-M7604495],Northeast Center for Risk Management Education,This work was supported by the Northeast Center for Risk Management Education [grant number RME-M7604495].,,44,47,54,5,59,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We overcome these issues using the exogenous variation in siblings' household formation implied by the eligibility rules for a Spanish rental subsidy. Our results show that sibling effects are negative and that these effects can be explained by the presence of old or ill parents. Sibling effects turn positive for close-in-age siblings, when imitation is more likely to prevail.

However, few countries have implemented comprehensive policies that price this externality or devote serious resources to developing low-carbon energy sources. In many respects, the world is betting that we will greatly reduce the use of fossil fuels because we will run out of inexpensive fossil fuels (there will be decreases in supply) and/or technological advances will lead to the discovery of less-expensive low-carbon technologies (there will be decreases in demand). The historical record indicates that the supply of fossil fuels has consistently increased over time and that their relative price advantage over low-carbon energy sources has not declined substantially over time.

To this end, we developed an integrated input-output linear programming model for 2009 using the Supply and Use Tables and emissions data of the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology and Innovation. We simulated emissions targets for various potential scenarios in which the adopted policy design took account of sectoral composition in terms of emissions and available production technology. The results were directly affected by the high level of livestock emissions, counterbalancing this sector's economic importance for Brazil. In the short term, sectoral emissions targets associated with taxation policy or emission permits could be developed in order to create private incentives to mitigate emissions. In this sense, the results also show that different sectoral targets may be able to balance environmental benefits with the possible economic losses incurred by such policies.","[de Souza, Kenia Barreiro] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Econ, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [de Santana Ribeiro, Luiz Carlos] Univ Fed Sergipe, Dept Econ, Sao Cristovao, SE, Brazil; [Perobelli, Fernando Salgueiro] Univ Fed Juiz de Fora, Dept Econ & Finance, Juiz De Fora, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Sergipe; Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora,"de Souza, KB (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Econ, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",keniadesouza@gmail.com,"de Souza, Kenia Barreiro/AFI-9525-2022; Ribeiro, Luiz/U-9096-2019","de Souza, Kenia Barreiro/0000-0002-6306-2044; Ribeiro, Luiz Carlos/0000-0001-6374-3811",,,,,31,9,10,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

We first estimate relative TFP levels and TFP growth rates across manufacturing and service industries of Greece, Italy and Spain using an endogenous growth accounting model. Then, we estimate the TFP growth impact of entry regulation and public ownership, within a productivity convergence framework. The empirical results indicate that a reduction in the degree of entry regulation is associated with higher industry TFP growth. On the other hand, the TFP growth impact of public ownership, although negative, is not statistically significant. The econometric estimates show that technology transfer and technological catch-up are both important for higher productivity growth of south European industries.","[Dimelis, Sophia P.] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece; [Papaioannou, Sotiris K.] Ctr Planning & Econ Res, Athens, Greece",Athens University of Economics & Business,"Dimelis, SP (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece.",,"Papaioannou, Sotiris/AAM-3481-2020; Dimelis, Sophia P./AAI-7308-2021","Papaioannou, Sotiris/0000-0003-1862-9694; Dimelis, Sophia/0000-0003-4300-3570",,,,,43,7,8,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

However, this change did not happen all at once, instead there was a gradual shift over time as experimenting firms learned that they could sell lower quality loans into the market and other firms were forced to follow along or lose market share. Mortgages started from a position of a stable market with high-quality loans and then shifted over time to a market characterized by continually declining quality and then shifted again sharply back towards high quality, although now requiring government intervention for support. This same pattern was seen across a number of different characteristics of the market. This paper shows how and why the shift happened from an evolutionary perspective and discusses the implications of this kind of behavior for understanding this period and also for possible developments in the future.","[Dow, James P., Jr.] Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Finance Financial Planning & Insurance, Northridge, CA 91330 USA",California State University System; California State University Northridge,"Dow, JP (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Finance Financial Planning & Insurance, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.",james.dow@csun.edu,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Specifically, we focus our analysis on the effect of 1998-2006 changes in local immigrant density on contemporaneous changes in municipal spending in social services. To address the potential endogenous location of immigrants, we adopt an instrumental variables approach that uses the distribution of rental housing in 1991 to predict the location of immigrant inflows. The results indicate that (per capita) social spending increased less in those municipalities that recorded the largest increases in immigrant density.

The analysis focuses on access to credit, public services, and electricity. We find that relaxing loan collateral requirements is considered of prime importance, while access to bank loans is seen as problematic (equivalent to a 19 percentage point increase in the interest rate). Yet despite their widespread appeal to governments and donors, SME loans are found to have no discernible impact on perceived access to credit. Access to public services is hampered by cumbersome and time consuming procedures, often necessitating daylong trips to the capital for administrative procedures. Streamlining such procedures could yield annual savings of up to US $4700 per business. With regard to electricity, the biggest problems are installing new connections and the unreliability of supply. For benchmarking of concerns, we showed respondents vignettes describing hypothetical businesses facing a particular difficulty, and asked them to rate the gravity of the problem. Although we find some differences in response scales across socio-economic and ethnic groups, the qualitative conclusions about which problems are most important generally hold. This suggests that broad-based policy intervention aimed at easing a particular difficulty can be implemented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Researchers using the same paradigm seek answers to similar questions, and employ similar methods and concepts. In an article published in 2000, the author of this essay introduced the term system paradigm, which focuses on the systems functioning in a society. This study develops the theoretical considerations outlined in that earlier article on the basis of experience on post-socialist transition. The first part compares the socialist and capitalist systems, describing their main characteristics, and concludes that the capitalist system has become established in former socialist countries, except for North Korea and Cuba. The second part analyzes varieties of capitalism within a typology which classifies prevailing forms of politics and government. Three markedly different types are identified: democracy, autocracy, and dictatorship. Huntington wrote about the third wave of democratization. This study concludes the third wave has dried up: for the 47 post-socialist countries, only a tenth of the population live in democracy, while autocracy or dictatorship prevails in all other countries in this group. The third part of this essay applies the conceptual and analytical apparatus to Hungary, where capitalism exists, and autocracy is the prevailing politico-governmental form - here we can find important characteristics common to other capitalist countries or other autocracies. This finding is compatible with the observation that there are some, less fundamental, characteristics unique to Hungary, or Hungarica, which differ from the characteristics of all other countries.(1)","[Kornai, Janos] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kornai, Janos] Corvinus Univ, Budapest, Hungary",Harvard University; Corvinus University Budapest,"Kornai, J (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Kornai, J (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ, Budapest, Hungary.",janos.kornai@uni-corvinus.hu,,,By Force of Thought Foundation,By Force of Thought Foundation,"Let me express my gratitude here first of all to my wife, Zsuzsa Daniel, who encouraged me to write this study despite all hardships; she was the first reader of several earlier drafts, supporting my progress with several thoughtful suggestions.

Natural resources, labor, and physical capital are used in the final goods sector and in the accumulation of knowledge. Based on results in the calculus of variations, a direct proof of the existence of an optimal solution is provided. Analytical solutions for the planner case, balanced growth paths, and steady states are found for a specific CRRA utility and Cobb-Douglas production function. It is possible to have long-run growth where both energy resources are used simultaneously along the equilibrium path. As the law of motion of the technological change is not concave, reflecting the increasing returns to scale, so that the Arrow-Mangasarian sufficiency conditions do not apply, we provide a sufficient condition directly. Transitional dynamics to the steady state from the theoretical model are used to derive three convergence equations of output intensity growth rate, exhaustible resource growth rate, and renewable resource growth rate, which are tested based on OECD data on production and energy consumption.","[Manh-Hung Nguyen] Toulouse Sch Econ LERNA INRA, Toulouse, France; [Phu Nguyen-Van] CNRS, BETA, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67000 Strasbourg, France; [Phu Nguyen-Van] Univ Strasbourg, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67000 Strasbourg, France",INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Lorraine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Phu, NV (通讯作者)，CNRS, BETA, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67000 Strasbourg, France.;Phu, NV (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67000 Strasbourg, France.",nguyen-van@unistra.fr,"Nguyen-Van, Phu/U-7574-2019","Nguyen-Van, Phu/0000-0003-1330-9851; Nguyen, Manh Hung/0000-0003-1887-0226",,,,,38,4,4,2,27,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

However, when there are multiple players in an oligopoly market, the resulting multiple equilibria have made it difficult in previous studies to estimate the payoff functions of players in complete information, static and discrete games without using unreasonable assumptions. To overcome this difficulty, the present paper proposes a practical estimation method for an entry game with three players using a Bayesian approach. Some mild assumptions are imposed on the payoff function, and the average competitive effect is used to capture the entry effect of the number of firms. Our proposed methodology is applied to Japanese airline data from the year 2000, when there were three major airline companies, ANA, JAL and JAS. The model comparison is conducted to investigate the nature of strategic interaction among these Japanese airline companies.","[Onishi, Yuko; Omori, Yasuhiro] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Onishi, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.",,,"Omori, Yasuhiro/0000-0002-7896-6177","JSPS KAKENHI [25245035, 26245028]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25245035, 26245028, 25245033] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank Professor Yoshihiko Nishiyama, two anonymous referees and Tsunehiro Ishihara for providing useful comments and discussions through this research.

The output-inflation trade-off is of particular concern for oil exporters relative to non-oil commodity exporters due to the pass through of oil prices,into headline inflation which warrants fiscal reaction to crude oil revenue. This result is robust to several instruments satisfying the rule but with reduced efficiency for those instruments that impact potential output such as government investment and capital taxes. These rules are desirable for fixed exchange rate regimes but are unable to achieve the same degree of stability as when coordinated with inflation-targeting monetary policy. Even under optimal inflation-targeting regimes, the adoption of budget-balance tax-gap rules can produce reductions in macroeconomic volatility and welfare gains. (C) 2016 The Author.

We model inspections of live plant imports and producer responses to inspections using a state-dependent monitoring and enforcement model. We capture exporter abatement response to a set of feasible inspection policies from the regulator. Conditional on this behavioral response, we solve the regulator's problem of selecting the parameters for the state-dependent monitoring regime to minimize entry of infested shipments. We account for exporter heterogeneity, fixed penalties for noncompliance, imperfect abatement control and imperfect inspections at the border. Overall, we estimate that state-dependent targeting (based on historical interceptions) cuts the rate of infested shipments that are accepted by one-fifth, relative to uniformly allocated inspections.

The Longhai and Lanxin lines in China, linking the East and the West, were upgraded on October 21, 2000, improving freight efficiency between Eastern China and Xinjiang, the gateway from China to Central Asia. By employing a transaction-level export database, empirical results find that exports freighted on the upgraded rail lines increased in value by approximately 30%, compared with other freight modes. The results are robust by excluding specific observations with respect to the demand fluctuations and macroeconomic shocks, and including additional controls. The intensive margin, but not the extensive margin, played a major role in explaining the impact of railroad upgrades on exports. In addition, the project caused spatial reorganization in exporting activities. The share of Xinjiang exporters in the Central Asia market shrank, while Xinjiang's exports to other international markets expanded through better accessibility to the coast. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, migrant workers are treated differently from urban workers. In this paper we examine the labor market discrimination against rural migrants from the point of view of wage differentials using CHIP-2007 data. We apply Jann pooled method to deal with index number problem and use Heckman two step model to correct selection problem when decomposing the wage gap. The decomposition results show that a significant difference in wage gains persists between the two groups as late as 2007. In 2007 migrants only earned 49% of urban workers' income and 17% of the wage gap cannot be explained by observed factors. In detail, differences in educational attainment, work experience and distribution across industry, occupation, and ownership of enterprises account for most of the explained wage gap.

Introducing firm risk aversion has two impacts. Profits for the basic service can be backloaded to induce cheaper information revelation for this service: an Income Effect which reduces output distortions. The firm must also bear some risk to induce information revelation for the add-on. This Risk Effect reduces the level of the add-on but hardens information revelation for the basic service. The interaction between these effects has important implications for the dynamics of distortions, contract renegotiation, and the value of incomplete contracts.","[Arve, Malin] NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Martimort, David] Paris Sch Econ EHESS, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Paris School of Economics,"Arve, M (通讯作者)，NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",malin.arve@nhh.no; david.martimort@parisschoolofeconomics.eu,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB/TR-15]; ANR Polycripe; program Investissements d'Avenir of the French government [ANR-10-LABX-93-01],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); ANR Polycripe(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); program Investissements d'Avenir of the French government(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"Arve: NHH Norwegian School of Economics, Helleveien 30, 5045 Bergen, Norway (e-mail: malin.arve@nhh.no); Martimort: Paris School of Economics-EHESS, 48 Boulevard Jourdan, 75014 Paris, France (e-mail: david.martimort@parisschoolofeconomics.eu).

Under cultural conformity, ethnic identity is reduced by neighborhood integration, which weakens group loyalties and prejudices. On the contrary, under cultural distinction, ethnic minorities are more motivated in retaining their own distinctive cultural heritage the more integrated are the neighborhoods where they reside and work. Using data on ethnic preferences and attitudes provided by the Fourth National Survey of Ethnic Minorities in the UK we find evidence that might be consistent with intense ethnic and religious identity mostly formed as a cultural distinction mechanism.

It provides a theoretical analysis which shows that the incentive to provide such amenities is particularly strong, if institutional restrictions prevent local governments from adjusting their tax structure. The empirical analysis considers the case of Germany, where public subsidies to local theaters are shown to exert a compensating earnings differential for highly educated labor. Taking account of the institutional setting, our empirical results suggest that local jurisdictions in Germany are subject to a substantial fiscal incentive to subsidize cultural activities.","[Buettner, Thiess] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany; [Janeba, Eckhard] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, L7 3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Mannheim,"Buettner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.",thiess.buettner@fau.de; janeba@uni-mannheim.de,,"Buettner, Thiess/0000-0001-7490-0122",,,,,37,29,29,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

We test this idea by focusing on a key implication: income effects for individuals who choose to gamble are likely to be larger than for the general population. Using UK data on gambling wins, other windfalls and durable goods purchases, we show that winners display higher income effects than non-winners but only amongst those likely to be credit-constrained.

We argue that press freedom and media reach (in other words, communication infrastructure) are complementary factors that should be looked at together while analyzing a media sector's impact on economic development outcomes like corruption. Based on estimated marginal impacts, we conclude that press freedom, by itself, curbs corruption, even for countries with lower media reach. However, as reach increases, the beneficial impact of press freedom in curbing corruption is enhanced - thus proving the enabling effect of media reach on press freedom in particular and on improved governance in general.

That is, small and large sizes of the informal economy are associated with little growth and medium levels of the size of the informal economy are associated with higher levels of growth. We also observe that in high (low) income economies, informal economy size is positively (negatively) correlated with growth. Moreover, when we decompose growth into several components using a simple growth accounting framework, we find that informality is mainly associated with growth in TFP and that this association is different in high and low-income economies.","[Elgin, Ceyhun] Bogazici Univ, Dept Econ, Natuk Birkan Kat 2, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey; [Birinci, Serdar] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, 1925 4th St S,Hanson Hall 4-101, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Bogazici University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Elgin, C (通讯作者)，Bogazici Univ, Dept Econ, Natuk Birkan Kat 2, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey.",ceyhun.elgin@boun.edu.tr; birin001@umn.edu,"Elgin, Ceyhun/D-3123-2014; Birinci, Serdar/W-7599-2019","Birinci, Serdar/0000-0001-7323-1932; Elgin, Ceyhun/0000-0001-8796-2429",,,,,29,23,26,0,7,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

To do so, we introduce the following criterion: A mechanism respects improvements of school quality if each school becomes weakly better off whenever that school improves, i.e., becomes more preferred by students. We first show that neither any stable mechanism nor mechanism that is Pareto efficient for students (such as the Boston and top trading cycles mechanisms) respects improvements of school quality. Nevertheless, for large school districts, we demonstrate that any stable mechanism approximately respects improvements of school quality; by contrast, the Boston and top trading cycles mechanisms fail to do so. Thus, a stable mechanism may provide better incentives for schools to improve themselves than the Boston and top trading cycles mechanisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We argue that this policy is an optimal response to an increase in foreign debt rollover risk. In our model, reserves play a key role in endogenously reducing debt rollover crises (sudden stops) by allowing governments to be solvent in more states of the world. Using a dynamic multi-country environment with learning, we find that a relatively small unanticipated increase in rollover risk jointly accounts for (i) the outburst of sudden stops in the late 1990s, (ii) the increase in foreign reserves holdings, and (iii) the subsequent reduction of sudden stops in emerging economies. We also show that a policy of pooling reserves may substantially reduce reserves because mutual insurance across countries dampens rollover risk.

We hypothesize that the effect of remittances on support for democracy varies across classes (i.e., groups or subtypes) of individuals sharing similar but unobserved background characteristics. Using the Afrobarometer surveys, we try to find out whether the respondents fall into different hidden classes in such a way that the effect of remittances on the degree of support for democracy depends on the class. Our results support that remittances may be a curse for the degree of endorsement and support for democracy, depending on the class of individuals that we consider. The analysis of the probability of being in the remittance curse class indicates that the perception of national priorities plays an important role. People who attest that freedom and rights are the main national priorities have a lower probability of belonging to the remittances curse class than individuals who choose national priorities that are oriented towards the economic conditions of their country.

It also examines the association of WBP and FMU with industrial deregulation, trade liberalisation and labour regulations. Results of the econometric analysis suggest that WBP is negatively associated with both industrial deregulations and trade liberalisation, but there is no significant association of FMU with these reforms. Further, pro-worker amendments to selected provisions of Industrial Disputes,Act 1947, but not all, seem to enhance WBP to some extent.

Theory suggests that small differences in monetary incentives between committee members can leave deception a strategically optimal decision (Crawford and Sobel, 1982; Galeotti et al., 2013). At the same time, in natural environments social incentives can also play an important role in determining the way people share or withhold truthful information. Unfortunately, little is known about how monetary and social incentives interact to determine truth-telling. We investigate this issue by first building a novel model and then testing its equilibrium predictions using laboratory data. In the absence of social identity, the model's predictions are supported: there is more truthful communication between those who share monetary incentives than those who do not. We find that the effect of identity is asymmetric: sharing the same identity does not promote truth-telling but holding different identities reduces truthfulness. Overall, as compared to environments lacking social identity, committees with both monetary and social incentives exhibit truthful communication substantially less frequently.

By extending the directional analysis to the 4 x 4 case, this study investigates whether Japanese production managers' forecasts correctly predict turning points in production across different industries. This fills a gap in the literature that focused on predicting increase/decrease or acceleration/deceleration using directional analysis of the 2 x 2 case. It also illustrates its merit over the 2 x 2 case. This study shows that majority of the forecasts are not useful in predicting turning points in production; however, they are useful in predicting increase/decrease in production. Our findings suggest that the production managers' forecasts serve as early qualitative information of expansion and contraction on the Japanese economy and their accuracy does not differ by phases of business cycles.

To quantify such an effect, a theoretical model is developed for household electricity use, and then it is applied to the progressive pricing policy for electricity in Seoul, South Korea, to empirically derive the magnitude of the reduction in household electricity use. The results suggest that progressive pricing reduces the elasticity in demand for household electricity in the summer. That is, the progressive pricing policy has a curbing effect.

We apply the methodology of calendar-time portfolio analysis. This consists of simulating a portfolio that would include stocks depending on the recommendations issued by financial analysts. In order to measure abnormal (or excess') returns, the raw return of the portfolio is then compared to the evolution of the stock index and to the prediction of the Capital Asset-Pricing Model. Some of the portfolios we build earn a positive significant excess risk-adjusted return of 1.19% per month. Beyond the results that are in line with the literature, we provide two original results. First, sell' signals are informative, whereas buy' signals are not. We suggest that it is related to large (small) firms having more buy' (sell') recommendations and to the direction of the market trend over the period. Second, the fact that recommendation levels have more impact than recommendation changes is explained by the specific informational context on that market, which is that recommendations are systematically disclosed each month, whereas on other markets, recommendations are produced only when the analyst has some new information to disclose.","[Bellando, R.; Galanti, S.] Univ Orleans, CNRS, LEO, UMR 7322, Fac DEG Rue Blois BP 26739, F-45067 Orleans, France; [Ben Braham, Z.] Univ Carthage, DEFI, CNRS, LEO, Orleans, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Orleans; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Galanti, S (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, CNRS, LEO, UMR 7322, Fac DEG Rue Blois BP 26739, F-45067 Orleans, France.",sebastien.galanti@univ-orleans.fr,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, the determinants of the decision to enter competitions are still not fully understood. The aim of this paper is twofold. We first evaluate how participants update their beliefs after receiving feedback informing them of whether their performance is below or above the median performance. Second, we are interested in how men and women react to this information in terms of competitive entry. Our first result is that participants, and women in particular, react more strongly to the feedback they receive than would a Bayesian agent. As far as entry into competition is concerned, below-median participants adjust their entry decision according to the competition they expect to face, while above median participants do not. However, the behaviour behind these results is quite different for men and women: women mainly react to information on their own performance, while men seem to respond more to their beliefs over the competition they will face. Moreover, most of the effect of feedback and the information regarding the level of the competition on the decision to compete seems to operate via beliefs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We compare each structure in terms of its impact on network quality, consumer surplus and social welfare. To do so, we use a two-stage game under HS and a three-stage game under VS to derive Nash equilibrium network qualities, consumer surplus and social welfare, respectively. We highlight four distinct incentive effects that shape network quality under each structure, and we point out that, on balance, they tend to favor higher network quality under HS. However, intensity of transport service competition under each system also plays a critical role in shaping consumer surplus and social welfare. The best case for HS occurs when there is a moderate amount of price competition between the vertically integrated systems, while the best case for VS occurs when there is intense price competition between transport operators. Using computational analysis, we show that it is more likely that HS dominates VS on all three performance metrics.","[Besanko, David] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Cui, Shana] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China",Northwestern University; Beijing Jiaotong University,"Besanko, D (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",d-besanko@kellogg.northwestern.edu; csnjxl@gmail.com,,"Cui, Shana/0000-0002-3053-5239",,,,,44,11,12,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

In particular, the effect of living in an internally displaced persons camp on the choice of economic activities is analysed. Because individuals relocating away from camps may be different from those staying in them, a recursive bivariate probit procedure is used to control for selection on unobservables. The empirical procedure also relies on merging survey data with the micro-level dataset on conflict events. This allows us to incorporate conflict in the framework, but also to use a bivariate probit procedure to control for endogeneity (selection of households out of camps). This work contributes to literature on household labour allocation and economics of conflict. Results show that residing in a camp has varied effects on the choice of economic activities. Individuals in camps may be more inclined than those who choose to return home, to engage in certain economic activities. One of the key lessons that could be drawn from this paper is that internally displaced persons may possess important livelihood skills that post-conflict development interventions need to take advantage of, in order to fast-track recovery.","[Bozzoli, Carlos] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Santiago, Chile; [Brueck, Tilman] Int Secur & Dev Ctr ISDC, Berlin, Germany; [Muhumuza, Tony] United Nations Dev Programme UNDP Uganda, Kampala, Uganda",Universidad de Santiago de Chile,"Muhumuza, T (通讯作者)，United Nations Dev Programme, New York, NY 10017 USA.",tony.muhumuza@gmail.com,"Brück, Tilman/N-2522-2014","Brück, Tilman/0000-0002-8344-8948",European Commission; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"MICROCON, a five-year research programme funded by the European Commission for financial support.

The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) has been administered to all our experimental subjects, which makes our dataset one of the largest in the literature. We partition our subject pool into three groups depending on their CRT performance. Reflective subjects are those answering at least two of the three CRT questions correctly. Impulsive subjects are those who are unable to suppress the instinctive impulse to follow the intuitive - although incorrect - answer in at least two 2 questions. The remaining subjects form a residual group. We find that females score significantly less than males in the CRT and that, in their wrong answers, impulsive ones are observed more frequently. The 2D:4D ratio, which is higher for females, is correlated negatively with subjects' CRT score. We also find that differences in risk attitudes across CRT groups crucially depend on the elicitation task. Finally, impulsive subjects have higher social (inequity-averse) concerns, while reflective subjects are more likely to satisfy basic consistency requirements in lottery choices.

Compliance is highest among low-educated respondents older than 60 years. We use these policies as an instrumental variable to estimate the effect of financial literacy on financial assets. We find that one standard deviation increase in financial literacy determines an increase in household financial assets by 35% of a standard deviation (8,000 euros).

Our model builds on the literature based on heterogeneous firms in monopolistic competition with quality product differentiation. By letting the optimal level of ethical standards to be endogenously determined by each profit-maximizing firm, we analyse the link between heterogeneity in productivity and CSR intensity. The analytical results are confirmed by a numerical analysis. We then consider the need for external financing, finding that credit constraints may lead active firms to reduce the optimal CSR level whereas the reputational effect of CSR firms may help in dampening the reduction in firms' optimal CSR level. Finally, we find that policy interventions may lead to a higher level of the optimal CSR, when addressed to change firms' incentives and consumers' ethical awareness.","[Giallonardo, Luisa; Mulino, Marcella] Univ Aquila, DIIIE, Via G Gronchi 15, I-67039 Laquila, Italy",University of L'Aquila,"Giallonardo, L (通讯作者)，Univ Aquila, DIIIE, Via G Gronchi 15, I-67039 Laquila, Italy.",luisa.giallonardo@univaq.it; marcella.mulino@univaq.it,,,,,,,52,1,2,2,23,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The structure of a such a condition is discussed on both geometric and economic grounds. It is established that symmetry vector fields do commute (i.e. have vanishing Lie bracket) for additive and joint separability. The marginal utility of money is employed as a normalization of the expansion vector field (Mantovi, J Econ 110(1): 83-105, 2013) which results in the fundamental (expansion-) symmetry vector field. Finally, a characterization of symmetry vector fields is given in terms of their action on the distance function, and a pattern of complete response is discussed for additive preferences. Examples of such constructions are explicitly worked out.

In the previous literature it has been pointed out that, despite nonfundamentalness, structural VARs may still be good approximating models. I characterize nonfundamentalness as bias depending on the zeros of moving average filters. However, measuring the nonfundamental bias is not trivial because of the simultaneous occurrence of lag truncation bias. I propose a method to disentangle the bias based on population spectral density and derive a measure for the nonfundamental bias in population. In the application, I find that the SVAR exercises of Sims (2012) are accurate because the nonfundamental bias is mild. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Norms differ according to whether they allow or do not allow the punishment action to be a part of the strategies, and, in the case of the former, they further differ in terms of whether they encourage or do not encourage the punishment action. In such a framework, depending on the applied social norm, players are first given different reputations based on their employed strategies. Players then update their strategies accordingly after they observe the payoff differences among different strategies. Finally, over a longer horizon, the evolution of the social norms may be driven by the average payoffs of all members of the society. The strategy dynamics are articulated under different social norms. It is found that costly punishment does contribute to the evolution toward cooperation. Not only does the attraction basin of the cooperative evolutionary stable state become larger, but the speed of convergence to the CESS also becomes faster. These two properties are further enhanced if the punishment action is encouraged by the social norm.","[Yu, Tongkui; Li, Honggang] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Yu, Tongkui; Chen, Shu-Heng] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, AI ECON Res Ctr, Taipei 11605, Taiwan; [Yu, Tongkui] Southwest Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; National Chengchi University; Southwest University - China,"Chen, SH (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, AI ECON Res Ctr, Taipei 11605, Taiwan.",ytkui@swu.edu.cn; chen.shuheng@gmail.com; hli@bnu.edu.cn,,"Chen, Shu-Heng/0000-0003-4584-7646; Yu, Tongkui/0000-0001-7116-182X","National Science Foundation of China [70871013, 71201129]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [XDJK2012C067]; Education and Teaching Reform Fund of Southwest University [2012JY019]; Taiwan NSC [NSC 101-2410-H-004-010-MY2]","National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Education and Teaching Reform Fund of Southwest University; Taiwan NSC(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","We are grateful for comments and suggestions from Herbert Dawid, Beom Jun Kim, Zengru Di, and two anonymous referees.

Is capital regulation an answer?,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bank dividend policy; Regulatory hypothesis; Banking; Capital regulation,DISAPPEARING DIVIDENDS; NATIONAL CULTURE; POLICY; TAXES; RISK,"This paper is a contribution to the debate on how to regulate banks' dividend payout behaviour, a question that has attracted special attention of academicians as well as policy makers since the onset of 2007-08 financial crisis. In this paper, we examine whether common equity based capital regulation and more stringent risk based capital requirements force banks to restrict dividend payments. Common equity based capital regulation is likely to restrict bank dividends by limiting the sources of new capital for banks. Similarly more stringent risk based capital requirements are likely to force banks to retain profits to meet regulatory capital requirements. We use an international sample of 8689 banks from 58 countries over the pre-crisis period 1998-2007 for empirical analysis. Results show that banks paid lower dividends, were less likely to pay dividends and were less likely to pay excessive dividends in countries where regulators imposed common equity based capital regulation and more stringent risk based capital requirements for the banking industry during the pre-crisis period. We also extend our sample period from 1998 to 2012 and observe that regulatory capital requirements are less effective in restricting bank dividend payments during crisis period. From a policy perspective, we suggest that regulators can limit banks' options to raise new capital from non-common equity based sources and can impose more stringent risk based capital requirements to restrict banks from dividend over-payments in good times. While regulators can use blanket restrictions on sector wise dividend payments in bad times. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines the economic origins and the consequences of favoritism. We argue that favoritism is a mechanism for surplus diversion away from the society at large and toward the group. As it usually entails inefficiencies, favoritism highlights the role of frictions in economic exchange. Favoritism is easier to sustain in a small homogenous group and when there is heterogeneity across groups. Favoritism has negative effects on incentives to undertake investments and innovation. These predictions appear to be consistent with empirical evidence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

With a conventional production function involving labor, robots, and ordinary capital, an increase in robotic labor can have either a positive or a negative effect on wages. Alternatively, it is possible to estimate the aggregate production relationship without measuring capital or other fixed factors explicitly, using the procedure developed by Houthakker in the 1950s. Houthakker's method is based on the probability distribution of the productivity of the variable factor. Fitting different distributions to cross-sectional data on U.S. productivity, it is shown that if the elasticity of substitution between human and robotic labor is greater than about 1.9, the burgeoning of AI technologies will cause a decline in aggregate wages, other things equal. For the manufacturing sector, an even smaller human-robot elasticity of substitution is likely to result in declining wages of industrial workers as robots proliferate. (C) 2016 The Authors.

This paper studies the effects of a randomized intervention in rural Malawi that, over a six-month period, provided mothers of young infants with information on child nutrition without supplying any monetary or in-kind resources. A simple model first investigates theoretically how nutrition and other household choices including labor supply may change in response to the improved nutrition knowledge observed in the intervention areas. We then show empirically that the intervention improved child nutrition, household food consumption and consequently health. We find evidence that labor supply increased, which might have contributed to partially fund the increase in food consumption. This paper is the first to study whether non-health choices, particularly parental labor supply, might be affected by parents' knowledge of the child health production function. (C) 2016 The Authors.

In this paper we study the political fall-out from systemic financial crises over the past 140 years. We construct a new long-run dataset covering 20 advanced economies and more than 800 general elections. Our key finding is that policy uncertainty rises strongly after financial crises as government majorities shrink and polarization rises. After a crisis, voters seem to be particularly attracted to the political rhetoric of the extreme right, which often attributes blame to minorities or foreigners. On average, far-right parties increase their vote share by 30% after a financial crisis. Importantly, we do not observe similar, political dynamics in normal recessions or after severe macroeconomic shocks that are not financial in nature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It points to three sources of failure. The first is a failure to recognize the systems nature of infrastructure and the implication of this for the appropriate tools of analysis that should be employed in infrastructure assessments. The second is a preoccupation with income and expenditure flows rather than balance sheets in reporting public- as well as private-sector infrastructure accounts. This has had profound and in many cases perverse implications for the ownership, funding, and operation of infrastructure. The third is inadequate governance of infrastructure programmes to overcome the significant commitment problems that afflict both private- and public-sector providers of infrastructure. The paper describes a set of responses that recognize the systems nature of infrastructure, the importance of balance sheets, and the need for commitment mechanisms in the private and public sectors to promote the efficient provision of infrastructure.","[Helm, Dieter] New Coll, Oxford, England; [Mayer, Colin] Said Business Sch, Oxford, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Helm, D (通讯作者)，New Coll, Oxford, England.",dieter.helm@new.ox.ac.uk; colin.mayer@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,14,12,12,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We extend the model by incorporating country-level heterogeneity in terms of production technology, population, and productivity endowment. By calibrating the model to Japanese and Korean data in order to assess the expected outcome of the potential Korea-Japan FTA, we find that when the two countries have the same population size, Japan receives greater benefits from the FTA because its relatively more capital-intensive production allows for quicker output adjustment upon trade liberalization. When we take into account that Japan's population is 2.5times that of Korea, however, the results show that Korea enjoys a greater surplus because of the market size effect.","[Hong, Gihoon] Pusan Natl Univ, San 30 Jangjeon Dong, Busan 609735, South Korea; [Oh, Soo Hyun] Korea Inst Int Econ Policy, 370 Sicheongdaero, Sejong Si 339007, South Korea",Pusan National University; Korea Institute for International Economic Policy (KIEP),"Hong, G (通讯作者)，Pusan Natl Univ, San 30 Jangjeon Dong, Busan 609735, South Korea.",gh9x@pusan.ac.kr; socialplanner@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,11,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

The value of the subsidy ranged from $ 4000 to $ 9000 (2004 US$) depending on the area of residence. Using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we measure the effects of the policy on childbearing and migration in and out of the subsidized areas. Our estimates for migration suggest that the policy significantly increased the net inflow of females into the subsidized areas. This effect is driven roughly equally by a decrease in the outflow from and an increase into the subsidized areas. Our estimated effects on fertility are in line with previous results from the literature; we find that a $ 1000 increase in fertility subsidies leads to a 0.108% increase in the chance of bearing a child for all age groups (21 to 45).

We study the structural differences between the children network of friends reported by children and the one elicited asking their parents. We find that the parent-reported network has a bias that is consistent with the following explanation: parents expect peer effects on school achievement to be stronger than what they really are. Thus, parents of low-performing students report their children to be friends of high performing students.

A new product launch is a multiple criteria decision-making problem, which involves evaluating different criteria or attributes in a strategy selection process. The purpose of this paper is to develop a qualitative and quantitative approach for the selection of a new product launch strategy. The current study proposes an integrated approach, integrating analytic network process, the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution and multi-choice goal programming, which can be used to determine the best launch strategy for marketing problems. The advantage of this integrated method is that it enables the consideration of both tangible (qualitative) and intangible (quantitative) criteria as well as both more/higher is better (e.g., benefit criteria) and less/lower is better (e.g., cost criteria) in the launch strategy of a new product selection problem.

By using three waves of a nationwide survey of private firms in 2002, 2004 and 2006 from China, we provide robust evidence that Chinese private entrepreneurs with access to preferential loans from state-owned banks when their businesses first started are more likely to participate in donation and anti-poverty programs organized by the government, and the effects of such loans are more pronounced for small firms and firms in regulated industries. Furthermore, we find that this reciprocal relationship between local governments and private entrepreneurs is a personal relationship rather than an institutional relationship, which declines in importance in areas with better legal institutions and in regions with change of local leadership. Finally, there is evidence that Chinese private entrepreneurs' charitable behaviors are also motivated by political returns and other individual characteristics.

Economic growth, AD club effect and free trade agreement participation are shown to constrain AD use by China. Compared to India, AD use by China is also more sensitive across industries.

We present a theory of agricultural origins of cultural divergence, where we claim that the advent of farming in a core region was characterized by collectivist values and eventually triggered the out-migration of individualistic farmers towards more and more peripheral areas. This migration pattern caused the initial cultural divergence, which remained persistent over generations. Using detailed data on the date of adoption of Neolithic agriculture among Western regions and countries, the empirical findings show that the regions which adopted agriculture early also value obedience more and feel less in control of their lives. The findings add to the literature by suggesting the possibility of extremely long-lasting norms and beliefs influencing today's socioeconomic outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, this research is unsatisfactory as regards the actual classifications of the legal systems of the world. It is the aim of this paper to fill this gap and to develop a more robust taxonomy of legal systems. This taxonomy is based on a new dataset of 156 countries that is subsequently analysed with tools of network analysis. Applying cluster optimisation, this paper finds that the world's legal systems can be divided into four clusters. It displays those clusters in a map, akin to the Inglehart-Welzel cultural map. It is suggested that those findings have important implications, not only for our understanding of the legal world, but also for the feasibility of legal transplants and harmonisation.","[Siems, Mathias M.] Univ Durham, Durham Law Sch, Durham DH1 3HP, England",Durham University,"Siems, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Durham Law Sch, Durham DH1 3HP, England.",siems@fulbrightmail.org,"Siems, Mathias/HLX-0417-2023","Siems, Mathias/0000-0001-5872-945X",,,,,62,19,20,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Financial deregulation and low interest rates are the key factors that, after 1991, boosted prices but at the same time limited rent growth. These factors are a one-off and not a guide to the future. The decline in home-ownership rates requires a more nuanced debate.","[Stapledon, Nigel] Univ New South Wales, Ctr Appl Econ Res, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Stapledon, N (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Ctr Appl Econ Res, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",nigel.stapledon@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,24,3,4,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

The government is willing to actualize a socially optimal equilibrium using a lump-sum tax and government debt linked to public investments, subject to the budget constraint under the golden rule of public finance. A socially optimal fiscal policy states that a deterministic rate of return on government bonds sets the marginal product of public capital. Moreover, public investments optimally adjust the ratio of private capital to public capital to equate the rates of return on such capital. The presence of stochastic disturbances results in a disparity between the optimal marginal products of the two types of capital, as reported in previous empirical studies. This disparity significantly affects the socially optimal growth rate in response to investment risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We argue that this divergence has to do with labor market institutions when account is made of their interactions with the magnitude and nature of the shocks from the Great Recession and the Eurozone debt crisis. New macro and micro evidence is provided highlighting the importance of these interactions in explaining cross-country differences in labor market adjustment to shocks. Having identified the labor market institutions responsible for this increasing unemployment divergence, we consider what can be done at the EU level to promote institutional convergence. In particular, we discuss a positive conditionality approach that could operate also in good times, and not only under recessions, when conditionality is strong, but some reforms may backfire.

Distinction is made between the wages paid and the hours worked in regular and in undeclared types of activity. Calibrating the model on the US economy, we show that a greater size of UDW implies lower average employment, higher volatility of employment and lower volatility of regular wages. These volatilities are affected by the steady-state ratio between the minimum value of the regular wage that can be accepted by a worker and the maximum value that can be paid by a firm in the Nash bargaining process, which occurs when a labor match is realized. The greater the ratio, the higher the volatility of employment and the lower the volatility of wages. We demonstrate that, due to a social stigma attached to UDW, an increase in undeclared hours raises this ratio by reducing the numerator less than the denominator. This suggests that the introduction of UDW may improve the ability of RBC models to match the empirical volatilities of labor market variables.","[Ciccarone, Giuseppe] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Rome, Italy; [Giuli, Francesco] Roma Tre Univ, Dept Econ, Rome, Italy; [Marchetti, Enrico] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, Via Gen Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Roma Tre University; Parthenope University Naples,"Marchetti, E (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, Via Gen Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy.",giuseppe.ciccarone@uniroma1.it; francesco.giuli@uniroma3.it; marchetti@uniparthenope.it,"Marchetti, Enrico/AAE-8357-2021","Marchetti, Enrico/0000-0002-9168-7922","Sapienza University of Rome; Roma Tre University; University of Naples Parthenope; Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita' e della Ricerca","Sapienza University of Rome; Roma Tre University; University of Naples Parthenope; Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita' e della Ricerca(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","We thank F.

Given the well documented causal links between schooling and labor productivity, it is surprising that past studies show that civil conflicts reduce educational attainment, but generally not earnings of individuals. Using variation in the degree of Cambodians' exposure to civil conflicts during primary school age, we find that disruption to primary education during civil conflicts decreases educational attainment and earnings, increases fertility, and has negligible effects on health of individuals several decades later. Our findings suggest that the effect of conflict on schooling disruption has adverse consequences on long-term labor productivity and economic development.

But, will people rely on excuses to get out of having to act on costly punishment intentions, as they do with other costly pro-social acts? And how may the answer to this question depend on whether the punisher is the victim of a norm violation or an independent third party? We conduct an experiment and find that third parties punish reluctantly: although they indicate a preference to punish, they choose to avoid the opportunity to punish when they can do so without explicitly revealing that this is their preference. In contrast, second parties, who have been directly wronged, are resolute punishers they actively seek out the opportunity to punish, even misrepresenting random outcomes in order to ensure that punishment is implemented.

However, few studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms of the market reaction to Internet news. This paper uncovers the underlying mechanisms by examining the market reaction to Internet news mentioned in the daily Investment Focus and Announcement Interpretation in the column of Ahead of Stock Market. The empirical results show a significantly positive abnormal return and excessive trading volume on the event date. The cumulative abnormal return of Announcement Interpretation completely reverses within 50 trading days, which supports the PPH. The cumulative abnormal return of Investment Focus partially reverses within 50 trading days, which supports the IDH. By partitioning each sample into high information and low information subgroups, the empirical results further suggest that the PPH and IDH are not mutually exclusive. Taken together, the results provide some explanations for the market reaction to Internet news. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Given this development, it is interesting to analyse the profitability of quality labels for the accommodation owners and managers. In particular, this article calculates the profitability of a rural tourism quality label. Through the use of the hedonic price approach, the market valuation of the quality label for rural self-catering cottages is obtained. This valuation is subsequently compared with the expenses incurred by establishments in achieving the quality label. In order to address the usual methodological problems associated with the endogeneity, prior to application of the hedonic approach, the propensity score matching is used. The results indicate that possessing a quality label has a positive impact on the profitability of rural tourism.","[Bilbao, Celia] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Oviedo, Spain; [Valdes, Luis] Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo; University of Oviedo,"Bilbao, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Oviedo, Spain.",cbilbao@uniovi.es,,"Bilbao-Terol, Celia/0000-0001-7532-813X",,,,,35,12,12,2,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Participation is driven both by the material incentives and heterogeneous preferences for leisure of each skill class, and by an endogenous social norm. Results for optimal redistributive taxation show that when the social norm enters as a benefit or cost for participants, participation taxes are generally lower than in its absence. Multiple participation equilibria can occur, and an engineered shift from a low- to a high-participation equilibrium can be Pareto-improving in the long run.","[Boadway, Robin W.] Queens Univ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Martineau, Nicolas-Guillaume] York Univ, Glendon Coll, Toronto, ON M4N 3M6, Canada",Queens University - Canada; York University - Canada,"Boadway, RW (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",boadwayr@econ.queensu.ca; ngmartineau@glendon.yorku.ca,,,,,,,26,0,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

This approach has been quite successful in stabilizing staple food prices, but comes at a high cost, and with potential risks of unmanageable stock accumulation. Based on a rational expectations storage model representing the Indian wheat market and its relation to the rest of the world, we analyse the cost and welfare implications of this policy, and unpack the contribution of its various elements. To analyse alternative policies, we assume that social welfare includes an objective of price stabilization and assess optimal policies corresponding to this objective.

Among others, a replacement of Value-at-Risk (alpha = 0.99) by Expected Shortfall (alpha = 0.975) for the quantification of market risk is recommended. While this increases capital requirements for heavy tailed risks, its consequences for model risk related to the estimation process have not been explored. Hence, the aim of this paper is to analyze how both risk measures react to different sources of model risk in order to better understand the impact of the intended change in risk measures. Our results show that the Expected Shortfall (alpha = 0.975) is more sensitive towards regulatory arbitrage and parameter misspecification. We find that this is based on a trade-off between a model's ability to better capture the heavy tailed behavior of risks and a higher vulnerability to model risk. These new aspects should be taken into account in the regulatory decision for Expected Shortfall (alpha = 0.975). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a model of offshoring and NGO-firm interactions in which offshoring to a low-regulation country allows a monopolist to implement a dirty technology undesired by consumers. Consumers can reduce the incentive for dirty production by financing an NGO monitoring the firm. NGO emergence and offshoring can arise as joint and interacting outcomes. For a range of trade costs, NGO emergence allows firms to capture gains from globalization, which would otherwise be unattainable. Somewhat paradoxically, NGO emergence can be at the expense of consumers possibly leading to welfare losses through offshoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The reform is undertaken in a life-cycle economy with individual heterogeneity and uninsurable idiosyncratic labor risk. The optimal NIT consists of a 22% rate and a transfer equivalent to 11% of per-capita GDP. The ex-ante average welfare gain is a 2.1% annual increase of individual consumption. I show that a NIT outperforms a flat tax reform (income tax plus deduction) by a considerable margin.

We find that inequality is reduced the higher the capital tax rate is and that low tax rates are Pareto-improving.

The results show that expenditure on health care and income are non-stationary and cointegrated. After controlling for cross-sectional dependence and unobserved heterogeneity among different countries, we find that the income elasticity of health care is less than 1, indicating that health care is a necessity and not a luxury. Government expenditure and out-of-pocket expenditure turn out to be important determinants of health care expenditure. Among non-monetary factors, results show that old age dependency and female education seem to have significant bearings on health care expenditures. Policy recommendations suggest that government should increase spending on health care in emerging economies since higher incomes may not automatically translate into higher health care spending by the people of these countries.","[Pattnayak, Sanja Samirana; Chadha, Alka] Indian Inst Management Tiruchirappalli, Truchurappalli, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Tiruchirappalli,"Pattnayak, SS (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management Tiruchirappalli, Truchurappalli, India.",samirana@gmail.com,,,,,,,54,3,3,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In his 1965 book, he managed to solve the problematic elements contained in the static part of the theory. Abandoning the original assumptions and introducing new specifications, he tried to demonstrate the logical consistency of all systems of equations. The real issue was posed by the dynamic part of the theory. Economic dynamics is a process of structural change and not the quiet path of some sort of steady-state process. The attempt proposed by Graziani in the 1960s to turn the static general equilibrium into a dynamic one produced an interesting result. Graziani's dynamic approach in many respects has the same logical structure as the endogenous growth literature that flourished in the 1980s and 1990s. Graziani's contribution is relevant not only from the point of view of the historical analysis of the evolution of economic ideas, but, most importantly, it can contribute to clarifying the roots of the new approach to economic growth.","[Pomini, Mario] Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, Econ, I-35100 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Pomini, M (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, Econ, I-35100 Padua, Italy.",mario.pomini@unipd.it,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,1,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

How should we quantitatively measure them? What are their determinants? This study explores the main factors influencing residential energy-saving behaviours based on a bottom-up multivariate statistical approach using data from the recent French PHEBUS survey. Firstly, we assess energy-saving behaviours on a one-dimension scale using IRT. Secondly, we use linear regression with an innovative variable selection method via adaptive lasso to tease out the effects of both macro and micro factors on the behavioural score. The results highlight the impact of five main attributes incentivizing energy-saving behaviours based on cross-variable analyses: energy price, household income, education level, age of head of household and dwelling energy performance. In addition, our results suggest that the analysis of the inverted U-shape impact of age enables the expansion of the energy consumption life cycle theory to energy-saving behaviours.

Using a GARCH model, we find that Australia experienced more volatility than many commodity exporting developing countries over the periods 1865-1940 and 1960-2008. We conduct cointegration tests to assess the commodity price shock inequality nexus. A single equation error correction model suggests that commodity price shocks increase the income share of the top 1, 0.05, and 0.01 percent in the short run. The very top end of the income distribution benefits from commodity booms disproportionately more than the rest of the society. The short run effect is mainly driven by wool and mining and not agricultural commodities. A sustained increase in the price of renewables (wool) reduces inequality whereas the same for non-renewable resources (minerals) increases inequality. We expect that the initial distribution of land and mineral resources explains the asymmetric result.","[Bhattacharyya, Sambit] Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Williamson, Jeffrey G.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Williamson, Jeffrey G.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Sussex; Harvard University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Bhattacharyya, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Jubilee Bldg, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",s.bhattacharyya@sussex.ac.uk,"Bhattacharyya, Sambit/F-6814-2011","Bhattacharyya, Sambit/0000-0001-5932-6943",,,,,51,11,12,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The mechanisms of homeostasis were originally conceived as strictly automatic and as pertaining only to the state of an organism's internal environment. In keeping with this concept, homeostasis was, and still is, often explained by analogy to a thermostat: upon reaching a previously set temperature, the device commands itself to either suspend the ongoing operation (cooling or heating), or to initiate it, as appropriate. This traditional explanation fails to capture the richness of the concept and the range of circumstances in which it can be applied to living systems. Our goal here is to consider a more comprehensive view of homeostasis. This includes its application to systems in which the presence of conscious and deliberative minds, individually and in social groups, permits the creation of supplementary regulatory mechanisms aimed at achieving balanced and thus survivable life states but more prone to failure than the fully automated mechanisms. We suggest that an economy is an example of one such regulatory mechanism, and that facts regarding human homeostasis may be of value in the study of economic problems. Importantly, the reality of human homeostasis expands the views on preferences and rational choice that are part of traditionally conceived Homo economicus and casts doubts on economic models that depend only on an invisible hand mechanism.

We argue that a viable European fiscal union can be constructed without joint liability for public debt or a centralized government with a large common budget. Such a fiscal union should combine elements of market discipline with stabilization in case of asymmetric shocks. Our proposal addresses the shortcomings of most other reform designs, which fail to offer a solution for insolvent or non-cooperative euro countries. We suggest a design which combines limited fiscal insurance with an orderly procedure to restructure the debt of insolvent member states. We show that fiscal insurance and a sovereign insolvency procedure are no contradiction but, on the contrary, are mutually reinforcing. Effective fiscal insurance helps to limit the stability risks involved in the implementation of an insolvency regime for sovereigns. And vice versa, a well-defined insolvency procedure reduces the risk that a fiscal capacity motivated as an insurance against transitory asymmetric shocks degenerates into a permanent transfer system. Moreover, we show that both elements promote the functioning of the European banking union and the new European fiscal governance.","[Dolls, Mathias; Fuest, Clemens; Heinemann, Friedrich; Peichl, Andreas] ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Fuest, Clemens; Peichl, Andreas] Univ Mannheim, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Heinemann, Friedrich] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); University of Mannheim; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Dolls, M (通讯作者)，ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.",dolls@zew.de; fuest@zew.de; heinemann@zew.de; peichl@zew.de,"Peichl, Andreas/D-7829-2018",,,,,,59,14,14,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

We find that there are some limitations in the current estimation of these lines, but show that statistically superior methods lead to lines that are relatively robust and confirm the $1.25 using 2005 PPPs and suggest $1.67-1.71 using 2011 PPPs (or close to the $1.90 proposed by the World Bank if we follow the World Bank's approach of adjusting inflation rates in some countries); they also roughly confirm the current shape of the proposed 'weakly relative' poverty line. Using the new absolute line based on 2011 PPPs would lead to substantially lower poverty in our estimation. The extent of the decline depends on whether and how one treats China, India, and Indonesia differently from other countries in the 2005 and 2011 PPPs. More seriously, we note that the dependence on successive ICP rounds creates conceptual and empirical problems that have become worse over time so that we suggest that it would be best to consider alternatives to the current reliance on ICP rounds and the resulting PPPs. As a short-term solution we propose to fix the international poverty line in national currencies using either the 2005 or 2011 level; in the medium term, we argue for global poverty measurement based on internationally coordinated national poverty measurement.","[Klasen, Stephan; Krivobokova, Tatyana; Lahoti, Rahul] Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Greb, Friederike] Food & Agr Org, Rome, Italy; [Pasaribu, Syamsul Hidayat] Bogor Agr Univ, Bogor, Indonesia; [Wiesenfarth, Manuel] German Canc Res Ctr, Heidelberg, Germany",University of Gottingen; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Bogor Agricultural University; Helmholtz Association; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ),"Klasen, S (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",sklasen@uni-goettingen.de,"Pasaribu, Syamsul Hidayat/AFV-9895-2022","Pasaribu, Syamsul Hidayat/0000-0002-6645-1221; Krivobokova, Tatyana/0000-0002-6389-2312; Lahoti, Rahul/0000-0001-6148-0835",German Ministry of Economic Development and Cooperation; German Research Foundation as part of the institutional strategy of the so-called Excellence Initiative,German Ministry of Economic Development and Cooperation; German Research Foundation as part of the institutional strategy of the so-called Excellence Initiative,"Funding from the German Ministry of Economic Development and Cooperation and from the German Research Foundation as part of the institutional strategy of the so-called Excellence Initiative is gratefully acknowledged.

For example, what forms of discrimination are possible? Can discrimination be justified? What mode of discrimination is expected? Does discrimination necessarily result in the elimination of polarization? How effective are the different modes of discrimination in inducing efforts (revenue)? How do the most widely studied contests based on an all-pay-auction and on a lottery compare under different modes of discrimination? Applying a contest-design approach, we examine four alternative types of discrimination that can be selected by a contest designer who maximizes the contestants' efforts (his revenue). Our survey focuses on the leading principles of the separate and joint effective application of the alternative modes of direct, overt covert and head starts-discrimination that are assumed to be exercised under the widely studied family of (logit) contest success functions (CSFs). Whereas direct discrimination refers to differential taxation of the contested prize subject to a balanced-budget constraint, overt, covert and head starts-discrimination relate to structural discrimination that involves the parameters of the CSF. While the direct mode of discrimination is legally feasible, the structural modes of discrimination are more subtle and more difficult to implement and, sometimes, may even involve legal barriers.","[Mealem, Yosef] Netanya Acad Coll, Netanya, Israel; [Nitzan, Shmuel] Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Nitzan, S (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel.",nitzans@biu.ac.il,,,,,,,58,23,23,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

The article analyses the political economy of both types of 'defensive modernization' from the viewpoint of institutional economics. We argue that initial reforms in German states gave way to a transformation process which drove a wedge between the interest of the monarchs and the landed nobility. Liberal reformers established a political bargain with the nobility which made capitalist institutions acceptable for the power holders. Later on, reformers established a 'market preserving federalism' which gave capitalism a further boost. By contrast, the dependence of the Austrian Emperor on the multiethnic nobility weakened the power of the central state. The transformation process in the Habsburg Empire remained dependent on the personal interests of the dominant coalition, which either delayed capitalism or sought to combine capitalism with protectionism on its own behalf. As a result, capitalist dynamics took up speed in Germany but were delayed in Austria.","[Wegner, Gerhard] Univ Erfurt, Fac Econ Law & Social Sci, Erfurt, Germany",University of Erfurt,"Wegner, G (通讯作者)，Univ Erfurt, Fac Econ Law & Social Sci, Erfurt, Germany.",gerhard.wegner@uni-erfurt.de,,,,,,,59,3,3,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

The method is empirical and as we find informality to be endogenous to credit constraints, an instrumental variable approach is estimated. Further, to address the possibility of reverse causality, an instrument for the informality variable is required; not registered with Inland Revenue (tax office) is the chosen instrument variable. The findings reveal that as the probability of a firm operating in the formal sector increases, there is greater access to external credit. The causality relationships are tested providing a strong platform for the formalization of polices to reduce the informality of the MSE sector. These are discussed in the context of the research findings.","[Wellalage, Nirosha Hewa; Locke, Stuart] Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Dept Finance, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Waikato,"Wellalage, NH (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Dept Finance, Hamilton, New Zealand.",nirosha@waikato.ac.nz,"Hewa Wellalage, Nirosha/H-7776-2014; Locke, Stuart/C-3727-2015","Hewa Wellalage, Nirosha/0000-0002-3316-3813; Locke, Stuart/0000-0002-1117-2698",,,,,64,34,37,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The socially optimal combinations of emission tax and privatization will damage the environment most, but Cournot yields lower environmental damage and social welfare than those under Bertrand.

Using data from a survey carried out during the academic year 2011/12, we show that the level of satisfaction of the students varies according to their field of study, finding that students in Engineering and Science are comparatively less satisfied than those in other disciplines. Also, expectations about whether having a university degree will be enough to obtain a job are associated with their level of satisfaction. Moreover, alcohol consumption is positively associated with their level of satisfaction.

We find that individual demographic factors and socioeconomic status, such as gender, age, income and education, are strong predictors of their attitudes. For example, income and education are positively associated with favourable attitudes towards the impact of multinational corporations (MNCs) on local businesses while age is negatively associated with individual attitudes towards MNCs. In addition, hierarchical ordered logit model results show that approximately 8% of total variations in individual attitudes around our sample mean are not explained by differences in personal traits. Instead, they are due to country-level heterogeneity such as, but not limited to, different degrees of openness or different aggregate income.","[Daniels, J.; Wang, M.] Marquette Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA; [Wong, M.

The cognitive load manipulation is designed to reduce the subject's cognitive resources that are available for deliberation on a choice. In our experiment, subjects are placed under a high cognitive load (given a difficult number to remember) or a low cognitive load (given a number that is not difficult to remember). Subsequently, the subjects play a one-shot game then they are asked to recall the number. This procedure is repeated for various games. We find that the relationship between cognitive load and strategic sophistication is not persistent across classes of games. This lack of persistence is consistent with recent findings in the literature. We also find that the relationship between cognitive load and actions is different from the relationship between cognitive load and beliefs. This suggests that actions and beliefs may not be as closely related as standard game theory would predict. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A misspecified model allows for the fact that an agent may not be able to distinguish between new and redundant information, and may have an incorrect model of how others process this information. When individuals significantly overestimate the amount of new information, beliefs about the state become entrenched and incorrect learning occurs with positive probability. When individuals sufficiently overestimate the amount of redundant information, beliefs fail to converge and learning is incomplete. Learning is complete when agents have an approximately correct model of inference, establishing that the correctly specified model is robust to perturbation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Their entire testing protocol and ensuing results rest upon claims that all the variables contain a unit root. We raise several critical issues and revisit the order of integration of the series as well as their cointegration and Granger causality properties through a 'pure replication' and a 'reanalysis'. Contrary to Bal and Rath (2015), when we repeat their estimated model with their specification of the Ng and Perron (2001) unit root test on their data, we find that their oil price series (ROL) is level stationary (negative replication Type 1), a result which makes all their subsequent results biased and misleading. Our reanalysis confirms that ROL is 1(0), linearly as well as nonlinearly. We also find that the basic bivariate model proposed by Bal and Rath (2015) fails to produce statistically robust and stable cointegrating patterns.

Expansion of the railroad network may have affected all counties directly or indirectly-an econometric challenge that arises in many empirical settings. However, the total impact on each county is captured by changes in that county's market access,'' a reduced-form expression derived from general equilibrium trade theory. We measure counties' market access by constructing a network database of railroads and waterways and calculating lowest-cost county-to-county freight routes. We estimate that county agricultural land values increased substantially with increases in county market access, as the railroad network expanded from 1870 to 1890. Removing all railroads in 1890 is estimated to decrease the total value of U.S. agricultural land by 60%, with limited potential for mitigating these losses through feasible extensions to the canal network or improvements to country roads.","[Donaldson, Dave] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago,"Donaldson, D (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,"National Science Foundation [1156239]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1156239] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","For helpful comments and suggestions, we thank Larry Katz, anonymous referees, and many colleagues and seminar participants at Boston University, Brown, Chicago, Colorado, Dartmouth, EIEF, George Mason, George Washington, Harvard, LSE, NBER, Northwestern, Santa Clara, Simon Fraser, Stanford, Stanford GSB, Toronto, Toulouse, UBC, UCL, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Merced, UC San Diego, Warwick, and the ASSA and EHA conferences (including our discussants, Gilles Duranton and Jeremy Atack).

I develop a two-country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model wherein firms make state-dependent decisions on entry and exit in the export market, and where price adjustments are staggered across firms and time. My model reveals that, when an aggregate shock has significant effects on optimal export prices, such as a shock to domestic productivity or monetary policy, it generates large responses in the number of exporters. These movements in turn amplify responses along the intensive margin of trade and international transmission of the shock. I trace this result to the micro-level price rigidities in my model. Because staggered price changes delay intensive margin adjustments among incumbent exporters following aggregate shocks, they permit sizable shifts in the profitability of export participation. Whereas such shifts are virtually eliminated in models of exporter entry and exit with flexible prices, here they are sufficient to induce quantitatively important movements along the extensive margin of trade.

We demonstrate that in these matching markets with slot-specific priorities, branches' choice functions may not satisfy the substitutability conditions typically crucial for matching with contracts.

Suppose that new potential employees were able to assess the expected pay-offs of current workers. Then they may modify their approach to work in order to follow the employee type that earned the highest expected pay-off. We show that the definition of the scheme needs to take into consideration the effects produced on the evolution of the motivation of new generations. In particular the desirability and success of a P4P scheme strongly depend on the way incentives are allocated to the members of a team, on the power of the quality-related financial incentive and on the economic and social context in which the scheme is introduced. The analysis is in part motivated by the introduction in UK in 2004 of a P4P scheme for family practitioners in the UK (Quality and Outcomes Framework, QOF) and of a new system of assessing the quality of academic research completed in 2014 (Research Excellence Framework, REF).

'Opportunist' ones care only about the spoils of the office, and 'militant' ones have ideological preferences on the policy space. Opportunist politicians review their affiliations and may switch parties, seeking better election prospects. In this framework, we compare a winner-take-all system, where all the spoils of office go to the winner, to a proportional system, where the spoils of office are split among the two parties in proportion to their vote shares. We study the existence of short term political equilibria and the dynamics and stability of policies and of party membership decisions. In the long run, it is possible that proportional systems see opportunist politicians spread over all parties, but this situation is unstable in winner-take-all systems.","[Laslier, Jean-Francois] CNRS, Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; [Goktuna, Bilge Ozturk] Galatasaray Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Paris School of Economics; Galatasaray University,"Laslier, JF (通讯作者)，CNRS, Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",jean-francois.laslier@ens.fr,"Laslier, Jean-Francois/K-1539-2019; Goktuna, Bilge Ozturk/G-5903-2018; Laslier, Jean-Francois/GSJ-2634-2022","Goktuna, Bilge Ozturk/0000-0003-2992-4648; Laslier, Jean-Francois/0000-0001-8334-1350",,,,,46,0,0,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

If they cannot also identify the individual producer, exporters have diminished incentives to produce high quality goods. To raise the quality of traded experience goods, previous international literature has proposed consolidation of export firms and the imposition of export quotas, policies that may be appropriate for tiny Taiwan but not a colossus like China. We contribute to this literature in three ways. First, we explicitly model the way in which consumers of experience goods rely on the reviews of previous buyers (who in turn rely on the reviews of buyers before them...) when deciding whether to purchase an experience good. Second, we endogenize the price of any given quality. Third, we assume that firms may exercise market power. As we show, once the small country assumption is dropped, policies advocated in the literature such as the merger of exporters or the imposition of export quotas can have adverse consequences on the profits of domestic exporters and on the welfare of all consumers. On the other hand, the unilateral imposition of minimum quality standards will increase the profits of domestic exporters while improving the welfare of all consumers. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We build a model where an unequal distribution of land quality in the presence of trade opportunities conferred differential gains from trade across regions, fostering predatory behavior by groups residing in the poorly endowed territories. We show that in such an environment it was mutually beneficial to institute an economic system of income redistribution featuring income transfers in return for safe passage to conduct trade. A commitment problem, however, rendered a merely static redistribution scheme unsustainable. Islam developed a set of dynamic redistributive rules that were self-enforcing, in regions where arid lands dominated the landscape. While such principles fostered the expansion of trade within the Muslim world, they limited the accumulation of wealth by the commercial elite, shaping the economic trajectory of Islamic lands in the pre-industrial era.

We use a unique data set of coal-, lignite-, gas- and biomass-fired power plants from 2003 through 2010 that provides an unbalanced panel of 1459 observations; the results are also checked against a balanced panel with a smaller number of observations. Although we find intra-group differences within energy generation technology, natural gas fired power plants clearly have the highest efficiency. Furthermore, the analysis points to significant savings potentials for CO2 and fuel-input, and derives policy conclusions for the ongoing electricity sector reformation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using a Kaldorian framework of endogenous productivity growth, we find that Kaldor-Verdoorn effects in the economy have become more predominant over time, especially in the post-reform (1994-2010) period. Our estimated Kaldor-Verdoorn coefficients, measured as the employment elasticity of output growth, for both formal sector and total employment have dropped dramatically over time, suggesting that India has leapfrogged into a high-productivity regime without the broad-based expansion of labour-intensive production that has been characteristic of fast-growing economies in East Asia. We examine some explanations for why these Kaldor-Verdoorn effects have become pronounced over time and are not convinced that wage pressure has been one of the reasons. A shift in the composition of demand towards higher-productivity sectors, however, does appear to be an important part of the explanation. We also find mixed evidence that forces of international competition have generated pressures to adopt more capital-intensive techniques of production.","[Tejani, Sheba] New Sch, Grad Program Int Affairs, New York, NY USA",The New School,"Tejani, S (通讯作者)，1 Parade Ground Rd, Pune 411001, Maharashtra, India.",shebatejani@gmail.com,,,,,,,54,13,13,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We find output and interest rate respond significantly to oil price shocks. Further analysis reveals that the positive response of output to oil price shocks is attributed to the influences of oil price shocks on exports. The oil price shocks have both longer and deeper effects on the exports of state-owned enterprises than on those of foreign investment enterprises.

Within such an intellectual context, this paper attempts to expand the evolutionary targeting framework to facilitate the process of inclusive industrial development. We present a unitary industrial development trajectory which is used as a narrative to articulate the evolutionary paths of Taiwan and Malaysia in making their respective sectoral changes (from informal to formal, and then to high technology sectors) endogenous. Building on both cases, we elucidate how the organization of subsistence farming contributes to development, and hence paves the way for new industrial takeoff. In this regard, the targeting programs that focus on the Schumpeterian segment are improved upon to offer support for (re)organization of the informal sector. This study, therefore, proposes a new analytical grid theorizing the current observations in inclusive development studies. It thus explicitly acknowledges the importance of transforming the informal sector to achieve inclusive development.","[Wong, Chan-Yuan] Univ Malaya, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, Fac Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Wong, CY (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, Fac Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",wongcy111@gmail.com,"WONG, CHAN YUAN/C-1044-2010",,University of Malaya [FL025/2012],University of Malaya(Universiti Malaya),The author is grateful to referee and editor for their helpful comments and suggestions that led to improvement of the paper.

This framework explicitly models the consumption of durables and nondurables and implements a high complementarity between energy and the usage of durables and capital. The model predicts energy price elasticities of various consumption variables that fall within reasonable agreement with empirical estimates. Convex costs in energy production produce energy price and energy supply dynamics that tallies well with empirical behavior. Our analysis confirms in a theoretical setting recent observations that not all energy price shocks are the same.

We develop standard Ak growth models that display transitional dynamics, contrary to general belief, once the complete credit markets assumption is relaxed. The mechanism is that credit constraints make individual productivity differences persist, which in turn leads to the persistence of income inequality. The dynamics of inequality is jointly determined with the dynamics of aggregate capital. The economy thus passes through a transitional period of inequality, individual and aggregate capital dynamics before it converges to a long-run balanced growth path. The application of the model to the analysis of intergenerational mobility and inequality dynamics suggests substantial economic and policy significance. In particular, introducing credit constraints to the Barro Ak model, public investment could have an indirect impact on growth via its effect on inequality and mobility. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

There was a boom, followed by a bust. The plunge in oil price triggered a prolonged bust in the energy sector. Which firms will benefit, and which will be squeezed out due to this persistent oil price decline? A new equilibrium is about to evolve under these conditions. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model that accounts for recent features in the energy sector. In particular, we focus on the shale energy companies and illustrate a trend toward a boom in external borrowing, overleveraging, and, now, a high risk of insolvency. With the use of a new method, called nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), we show dynamic paths toward two equilibria: either a tight oligopoly or extensive competition, with the shakeout of some firms. This is also tracked by studying leveraging and overleveraging by groups of firms. We further undertake an empirical analysis using a vector error correction model (VECM), which helps identify the short- and long-term effects of those new challenges on the stock performance of the energy companies. The main finding is that large-cap companies are less dependent on the fluctuation in oil price than are mid- and small-cap firms and are more likely to survive the shakeout. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Borrowing constraints result in sub-optimal choices for consumption and investments in human capital. We analyze optimal linear income taxes and education subsidies. The optimal income tax is shown to be positive-even in the absence of any redistributional concerns. A redistributive income tax relaxes borrowing constraints by redistributing resources from the unconstrained to the borrowing constrained stages of the life cycle. The income tax thus alleviates preexisting non-tax distortions in the capital market. Human capital is subsidized on a net basis in the absence of redistributional concerns. Education subsidies help to relax credit constraints and to reduce distortions from explicit and implicit taxes on human capital formation. When redistributional concerns are present, education is subsidized more if this helps to alleviate distortions on labor supply, but is subsidized less if education subsidies have a very regressive incidence. Simulations demonstrate that optimal income taxes are substantially higher when credit constraints are present. Education is generally subsidized on a net basis, and the more so if credit constraints are more severe.","[Jacobs, Bas] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Tinbergen Inst, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Jacobs, Bas] Erasmus Univ, CESifo, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Yang, Hongyan] Helmut Schmidt Univ Hamburg, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Tinbergen Institute; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Yang, HY (通讯作者)，Helmut Schmidt Univ Hamburg, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany.",bjacobs@ese.eur.nl; h.yang@hsu-hh.de,,,Dutch Organisation for Sciences (NWO Vidi) [452-07-013]; German Research Council (CRC) [597],Dutch Organisation for Sciences (NWO Vidi); German Research Council (CRC),"The authors thank the editor, Andreas Haufler, two anonymous referees, Dan Anderberg, Dirk Schindler, Bernd Genser, Mathias Kifmann and seminar participants at the University of Konstanz, the International Public Finance Conference in Cape Town, the Association for Public Economic Theory Conference in Galway, and the European Economic Association Conference in Barcelona for useful comments and suggestions.

We look at one particular channel, which operates through the change in the structure of electricity generation in favor of cheaper sources of energy, such as natural gas. We look at the potential impact of this structural change on electricity prices and ultimately on manufacturing output using subsector and state-level manufacturing output data. We first document that electricity prices relative to oil and gas are more important to the manufacturing sector, with a one-standard deviation reduction in those prices leading to a 2.8% increase in manufacturing output. This elasticity, together with estimated decreases in electricity prices on the back of the reform, could increase manufacturing output by up to 3.6%, and overall real GDP by 0.6%. Larger effects are possible in the long run if increased efficiency in the electricity sector leads to further decreases in electricity prices. There can also be larger effects stemming from output in the services sector which we find to also respond statistically significantly to electricity prices; and from the endogenous response of unit labor costs, which decrease with lower electricity prices.

I explain how institutionalists can benefit from these and suggest areas for joint research under the methodological umbrella of ABM.","[Graebner, Claudius] Univ Bremen, Inst Inst & Innovat Econ iino, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Gräbner, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Inst Inst & Innovat Econ iino, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",graebnerc@uni-bremen.de,,"Grabner-Radkowitsch, Claudius/0000-0003-4065-4722",,,,,61,26,26,2,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Each sender is responsible for a single project and observes its return. Exactly one project will be implemented. Both senders share some common interests with the principal, but have own-project biases. Under simultaneous communication, all equilibria are shown to be partition equilibria, but all the equilibria can no longer be ranked ex ante in terms of Pareto efficiency. The payoff of the principal depends on both the total conflict between the agents and the asymmetry in the own-project biases. In the equilibrium preferred by the principal, the agent with a smaller bias always has veto power to determine which alternative is implemented and weakly more messages. In any given equilibrium, decreasing the own-project bias of one agent improves the precision of communication by both agents. Finally, sequential communication and simple delegation are shown to be essentially outcome-equivalent to simultaneous communication. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We endogenously derive micro-dynamics of consumption behavior as a result of the increase in the number of income classes. The different degrees of inertia in the adjustment of consumption levels to income changes affect firm selection and the dynamics of market structure, which is ultimately responsible for different regimes of macro-economic growth. We find, first, that higher heterogeneity in consumption preferences amplifies and accelerates market dynamics, leading to a swift shift from a Malthusian to a Kaldorian growth pattern. Second, consumption smoothing mainly affects the timing of such a take-off. Inertia in consumption delays the occurrence of a Kaldorian engine for growth.","[Lorentz, Andre] Univ Technol Belfort Montbeliard, BETA UMR CNRS 7522, Belfort, France; [Ciarli, Tommaso; Savona, Maria] Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Valente, Marco] Univ Aquila, Pisa, Italy; [Valente, Marco] St Anna Sch Adv Studies, LEM, Pisa, Italy",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Technologie de Belfort-Montbeliard (UTBM); Universite de Lorraine; University of Sussex; University of L'Aquila; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Lorentz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Belfort Montbeliard, BETA UMR CNRS 7522, Belfort, France.",andre.lorentz@utbm.fr; T.Ciarli@sussex.ac.uk; M.Savona@sussex.ac.uk; marco.valente@univaq.it,"Valente, Marco/G-8781-2012; Lorentz, Andre/J-4326-2015","Valente, Marco/0000-0001-5378-4898; Lorentz, Andre/0000-0002-1403-1460",,,,,68,30,30,1,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Focusing on the post 2008 recession period, the subsequent greater rise in male unemployment can mostly be explained by a less cyclical response of flows between employment and unemployment for women, especially the entry into unemployment. Across gender and country, the inactivity rate is generally not sensitive to the state of the economy. However, a flows based analysis reveals a greater importance of the participation margin over the cycle. Changes in the rates of flow between unemployment and inactivity can each account for around 0.8-1.1 percentage points of the rise in US male and female unemployment rates during the latest downturn. For the UK, although the participation flow to unemployment similarly contributed to the increase of the female unemployment rate, this was not the case for men. The countercyclical flow rate from inactivity to employment was also more significant for women, especially in the US, where it accounted for approximately all of the fall in employment, compared with only 40% for men.

Controlling for the complexity of a legal case, we find that judges also tend to decrease their effort when the ex ante probability of appeal is low. Thus, our empirical evidence indicates an inefficiency in the appellate review system because trial judges allocate their effort to cases not exclusively according to case complexity, but particularly according to the ex ante probability of being reviewed.","[Berlemann, Michael; Christmann, Robin] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Inst Polit Econ & Empir Econ, Hamburg, Germany",Helmut Schmidt University,"Christmann, R (通讯作者)，Helmut Schmidt Univ, Inst Polit Econ & Empir Econ, Hamburg, Germany.",christmann@hsu-hh.de,,,,,,,7,5,5,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Firm-level growth is the result of idiosyncratic productivity improvements with a continuous arrival of new potential producers. A firm enters a market if it is profitable to incur the marginal cost to reach the first consumer and pays an increasing marketing cost to reach additional consumers. I calibrate the model using data on the cross section of firm sales and bilateral trade, as well as the rate of incumbent firm exit. The calibrated model predicts that a firm's growth is inversely related to its initial size, and that the distribution of growth rates of small firms is heavily skewed to the right. These predictions are confirmed by looking at the growth of sales of U.S. firms and Brazilian exporters to the United States.

This paper proposes a theory of domestic sovereign default based on distributional incentives affecting the welfare of risk-averse debt and nondebtholders. A utilitarian government cannot sustain debt if default is costless. If default is costly, debt with default risk is sustainable, and debt falls as the concentration of debt ownership rises. A government favoring bond holders can also sustain debt, with debt rising as ownership becomes more concentrated. These results are robust to adding foreign investors, redistributive taxes, or a second asset.","[D'Erasmo, Pablo] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Mendoza, Enrique G.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Mendoza, Enrique G.] PIER, Surrey, England",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia; University of Pennsylvania,"D'Erasmo, P (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA USA.;Mendoza, EG (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Mendoza, EG (通讯作者)，PIER, Surrey, England.",pablo.derasmo@phil.frb.org; egme@sas.upenn.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [1325122, 1324740]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1324740] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1325122] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We acknowledge the generous support of the National Science Foundation under awards 1325122 and 1324740.

This allows us to determine how the sign of the optimal taxes on capital and labor depend on the nature of the shocks and the degree of heterogeneity among consumers' income, as well as on the way in which the tax revenue is used to provide lump-sum transfers to consumers. When shocks affect primarily labor income and heterogeneity is small, the optimal tax on capital is positive.

However, there is mounting empirical evidence that the volatility of asset price or return is far from constant. This article, in contrast to studies that use parametric approach for option pricing, employs nonparametric kernel regression to deal with changing volatility and, accordingly, prices options on stock index. Specifically, we first estimate nonparametrically the volatility of asset return in the GBM based on the Nadaraya-Watson (N-W) kernel estimator. Then, based on the N-W estimates for the volatility, we use Monte Carlo simulation to compute option prices under different settings.

Moreover, I show how this gap evolves over the test score distribution and how the least favorably endowed students fare. My results suggest that the educational system of Switzerland, relative to the German system, enhances the performance of immigrants' children substantially.

We develop a simple model of policymaking with common agency that embeds endogenous transactions costs and institutions, so that the two are allowed to influence each other over time. Our approach seeks to go beyond attributing the crisis to either complex finance or regulatory/government failures, since such explanations generate necessary but not sufficient conditions for a financial crisis. Instead, we focus on the central role of rising transactions costs. We document the increasing presence of such costs in the U.S. financial sector since 1980, along with how changes in transactions costs coevolved with regulatory and institutional innovations over the past 30 years. We argue that such transactions costs amplified an ever-greater disconnect between market prices and their economic fundamentals, and increased financial fragility to the point that the system became vulnerable to the 2007/08 financial crisis.","[Lim, Jamus Jerome] World Bank, MSN MC2-204,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Lim, Jamus Jerome] Santa Cruz Inst Int Econ, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Tan, Terence] Genesis Law Corp, Singapore, Singapore",The World Bank,"Lim, JJ (通讯作者)，World Bank, MSN MC2-204,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Lim, JJ (通讯作者)，Santa Cruz Inst Int Econ, Santa Cruz, CA USA.",jlim@worldbank.org,,"Lim, Jamus/0000-0002-7665-9173",Research Support Budget Grant [P131352],Research Support Budget Grant,"The research for this paper was completed when the second author was a consultant at the World Bank, and was funded in part by Research Support Budget Grant P131352.

The research question addressed in this paper is whether or not it is a good idea to quit or take a hiatus from the group. We begin with a discussion of the framework for understanding why groups are formed and why they may be difficult to keep together. We then discuss differences between groups in the decade of the 1960s versus today. We argue that there is something unique about the output of the group even with the changes in the structure of contracts, compensation, and consumer focus on the artist that explain the resilience of the rock band as an organizational form within which to create music. We compare the charting success of bands that have members leave the group with the charting success of the members who left the group. We identified the groups in five representative years: 1965, 1975, 1985, 1995, and 2005. We then analyzed the entire Billboard Hot 100 charting careers of those groups and the artists who quit those groups. Our main finding is that when charting success is divided equally among members, going solo pays off-there is a clear economic rationale because solo acts have greater average charting success than the original bands they started in. The other ensuing side projects: duos, collaborations, and other groups are not as lucrative as the original bands. These findings are valid for members of charting groups from each of the 5 years examined. Despite the difficulties in keeping a rock band together, there are fewer band breakups today and remaining with the group generally results in a longer and more productive charting career. Thus, the rock group remains an important organization for producing contemporary music. However, there remains a compelling incentive to go solo. Superstars may benefit from solo projects, but for the average, non-superstar group member, in many circumstances it is better for the band to stay together if the income is divided equally.","[Phillips, Ronnie J.] Colorado State Univ, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Strachan, Ian C.] West Texas A&M Univ, Canyon, TX USA",Colorado State University; Texas A&M University System; West Texas A&M University,"Strachan, IC (通讯作者)，West Texas A&M Univ, Canyon, TX USA.",rphillip@me.com; ianstrachan23@gmail.com,"Phillips, Ronnie/AAF-6854-2020; Phillips, Ronnie J./IQS-0259-2023","Phillips, Ronnie J./0000-0002-5678-3599",,,,,40,7,8,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Taking this into account, we construct a new class of models of status goods, which refutes many important results in the conventional models without assuming market powers. Specifically, relative consumption effect normally leads to under-consumption of status goods, which is the opposite of the conventional result. Generally speaking, status goods may be over- or under-consumed, depending crucially on a widely overlooked factor in the literature - the elasticity of marginal status. More competition tends to support overconsumption and is not necessarily welfare-enhancing.

Additionally, prior research has yet to examine the value effects of a diverse board in the presence of a gender/ethnic minority CEO. Using the KLD social ratings database, we examine 13000 firm-years and provide robust evidence that board diversity increases firm value. However, we also show that any value added via board diversity is nullified when a diverse board operates in the presence of a female and/or minority CEO. Results suggest that a significant portion of the value in board diversity may come from gender/ethnic differences between the board members and the CEO. One implication of our study is that when hiring a CEO or electing directors relative gender/ethnic make-up is important.","[Borghesi, Richard; Chang, Kiyoung] Univ S Florida, Coll Business Adm, Sarasota, FL 34243 USA; [Mehran, Jamshid] Indiana Univ, Sch Business & Econ, South Bend, IN 46615 USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; Indiana University System; Indiana University South Bend,"Borghesi, R (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Coll Business Adm, Sarasota, FL 34243 USA.",borghesi@usf.edu,,,,,,,8,8,14,8,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

By analyzing thirty waves of the Survey of Family Income and Expenditure in Taiwan (1980-2009), it finds that the curvature systematically follows the bifocal' variation, indicating a perceptible break in consumption behavior.

Not in the short run if the tax is stated as a proportion of profits and the firm is a profit maximizer. But what if the firm wishes to pursue a strategy other than profit maximization, say revenue maximization subject to a profit constraint? Under such a condition the firm's reaction to a tax or tax increase might be a price rise that captures part of the foregone profits. We show that firms which operate at a point on their demand curve that differs from profit maximization have an incentive to raise price in response to the tax - and that high cost firms have a greater incentive to raise price than do low cost firms. Our empirical analysis of the US beer industry confirms this finding, and sheds light on the Krzyzaniak-Musgrave analysis of the 1960s which suggested that the corporation income tax produced significant short-run shifting.","[Aronson, J.

The result from the state-dependent pricing model estimated from macro data is closer to, both, micro price evidence, and surveys on frequency of price changes in Poland The difference is explained by a selection effect being present in the model with state-dependent price stickiness, only.

While a small number of recent studies have examined empirically the economic determinants of the likelihood of a pair of countries having a PTA, this study explains empirically the timing of all PTA formations and enlargements from 1950 through 2006 using duration analysis. Our main and novel goal is to predict (in- and out-of-sample) a substantive share of these 1,560 PTA events using a parsimonious model with mainly economic variables, taking selection dynamics into account. Our analysis reveals that we can predict correctly in-sample the actual year of entry into force for 26% of the 1,560 bilateral PTA formations/enlargements in the period 1950-2006 among 10,518 pairings of 146 countries using only a few economic and political variables. Moreover, we can predict correctly in-sample 57% of these PTA events within a 10-year window leading up to the event using this model. The model also performs well out-of-sample for the near term (82%), but not if the out-of-sample period is very long. We conclude with an evaluation of the model's ability to predict the timing of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the European Union's formation and enlargements, and the model's ten most likely post-2006 PTA events.

The aim of ongoing changes in education systems is to establish competitive and efficiently operating education institutions. It is therefore very important to develop a method for the evaluation of the educational outcomes. One of the proposed ways to achieve this is the application of nonparametric method in operations research called data envelopment analysis (DEA). In this paper we apply 2-stage DEA analysis to assess the educational outcomes of 27 selected countries. We use the share of public expenditure on education to total government expenditure as an input in DEA analysis. As outputs in DEA analysis we use the results of 4 international student assessments (grade 8 PISA 2012, grade 8 TIMSS 2011, grade 4 PIRLS 2011, grade 4 TIMSS 2011) and innovation output index 2012. Out of 27 evaluated countries, 8 countries (namely Canada, Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland) are efficient. Consequently, we use stratification method for partitioning the evaluated countries info different frontier levels. For each inefficient country it is then possible to calculate the local efficiency targets.","[Bohm, Patrik; Bohmova, Gabriela] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Böhm, P (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",patrik.bohm@fpedas.uniza.sk; gabriela.bohmova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Bohmova, Gabriela/P-4706-2016; Bohm, Patrik/P-4697-2016","Bohmova, Gabriela/0000-0001-6416-4352; Bohm, Patrik/0000-0002-3210-1055",[VEGA 1/0696/16]; [VEGA 0787/14],;,This contribution was undertaken as parts of the research project VEGA 1/0696/16 and VEGA 0787/14,,20,7,7,0,5,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,230,237,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800030,0

This paper aims to shed light particularly on the role played by income distribution, together with standard economic indicators such as unemployment and inflation, in the consolidation of supranational institutions. The empirical analysis also controls for financial market shocks, including domestic bond yields and stock market returns. The additional contribution is to analyze whether the sensitiveness of trust has been strengthened during the recent crisis, associating binary dummies to explanatory variables. The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: a) income inequality negatively affects trust in the EC and the EP in normal times; in crisis times, this relation is strengthened and extended to the ECB for one of the two indexes of trust considered; b) inflation and unemployment significantly affect trust in all European Institutions after the crisis.","[Bonasia, Mariangela; Canale, Rosaria Rita] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ & Business, Econ Policy, Via Gen Parisi, Naples, Italy; [Liotti, Giorgio] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Polit Sci, Econ, Via Rodino 40, Naples, Italy; [Spagnolo, Nicola] Brunel Univ London, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Parthenope University Naples; University of Naples Federico II; Brunel University,"Bonasia, M; Canale, RR (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ & Business, Econ Policy, Via Gen Parisi, Naples, Italy.;Liotti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Polit Sci, Econ, Via Rodino 40, Naples, Italy.;Spagnolo, N (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ London, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",bonasia@uniparthenope.it; rorita.canale@uniparthenope.it; giorgio.liotti@unina.it; nicola.spagnolo@brunel.ac.uk,"Canale, Rosaria Rita/B-5828-2013; Liotti, Giorgio/AAE-7404-2020","Canale, Rosaria Rita/0000-0003-4375-3881; Liotti, Giorgio/0000-0002-2520-0899",,,,,41,5,5,2,19,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Bitcoin network operation is carried out at high costs of electrical energy consumption, which, will over time be reflected in the price of transactions. Low transaction prices, which is one of the main arguments of Bitcoin promoters, are only possible with continuous issuance of new bitcoins to circulation. Bitcoin's - prove of work - is the most energetically demanding method from all currently existing methods securing cryptoplatforms. Halving mechanism which reduces the rewards of miners create pressure to decrease hash rate, which is a reflection of the rate of network security. The pressure to decrease hash rate is for now overrun by the increasing efficiency of mining devices. The future will therefore probably bring us fundamental questions: What will it mean for Bitcoin network, if the real costs of running the network will be reflected in costs of transaction? How will Bitcoin network be able to compete with other cryptocurrencies, whose operation is carried out at a much lower cost?

This study examines the connection between the Lucas Paradox and the Resource Curse between the developed and developing countries in the ASEAN based from Solow's neoclassical model and the Cobb Douglas production function. The study would like to state if a connection exists between the two phenomena and determine how they affect each other and if the Lucas Paradox and the Resource Curse exists in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. Developing countries are all rich in natural resources, specifically have high human capital and high human capital investments. This research also proves that an increase in education directly affects human capital stock and that age is positively related to human capital as different age groups increase human capital. It was also confirmed that human capital stock depends upon the distribution of the population between urban and rural sectors. While on the other hand the effect of the Capital per Effective worker hypothetically increases the overall Income per Effective worker but seems to be lacking in the developing countries thus proving the Lucas Paradox and the Human Capital Resource Curse are present and are interconnected with each in countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. The lack of investments in human capital discourages capital to flow from developed to developing countries which results to slow economic growth.","[Cale, Iana Justine Vea C.; Camaro, Peter Jeff C.; Melendres, Kristel P.; Rosete, Marie Antoinette L.] Univ Santo Tomas, Manila, Philippines",University of Santo Tomas,"Cale, IJVC (通讯作者)，Univ Santo Tomas, Manila, Philippines.",ijvcale@gmail.com; peterjeffchan@gmail.com; kpmelendres@gmail.com; antoinette_rosete@yahoo.com,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,181,199,,,,,,19,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389416500017,0

The results show the complexity of reform impacts in transition countries. They show that institutional and economic reforms led to positive economic effect and significant impacts on other dimensions of human development. We find some positive economic impacts from infrastructure sectors reforms. However, not every reform measure appears to generate positive impacts.

We estimate a gravity model of trade using a Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator, and estimate trade potential using in-sample, out-of-sample and counterfactual approaches. We compare trade potential using these three methods for Silk Road country trades with China. Next, we compare the estimated trade potential to actual trade, and find that most Silk Road countries are underperforming in their trade with China. However, trade performance against potential improved for most countries over the years 1990-2013. Our results suggest that China's former Silk Road trading partners have yet to realize the full potential benefits of China 's economic growth but that the gap may be narrowing.","[Cinar, E.

Then one of the pillar of the Schengen system free movement of people and labour within common market thus became one of the main reasons for so called Brexit. As the migration crisis displayed, borderland regions are those spaces, where many different problems come up due to the concentration of refugees in unfavourable conditions. Moreover, impacts on labour markets on both borderland as well as in core and peripheral areas will perhaps be immense. Schengen area's rules became suddenly very important due to the fact, that migrants have to be controlled on external borders of the Schengen area. These borders failed to fulfil its protective function. Some states thus tended to control their borders, including those states having their borders inside of the Schengen area. In spite of the fact, they acted in accord with EU conventions, they have been unjustly criticized by EU politicians. Because of that, a question has raised, whether the Schengen Phenomenon is suitable and functioning system, bringing plenty of benefits to EU citizens, or just a fiction.

That is why municipalities are trying to support the availability of these services.

This analysis reflected the results of a questionnaire survey carried out by the author in the years 2004 and 2014.

Evidence from a variety of robustness checks-controlling for observables, focussing on strictly exogenous elections, regression discontinuity estimates-confirms the central hypothesis: public officials deliberately relax graduation requirements to increase popular support for the incumbent in the months prior to national elections.

In this context this paper proposes to analyze the impact of volatility on market linkages for a homogenous commodity. The methodology is based on the cointegration framework. More specifically, Threshold Vector Error Correction Models (TVECM) with two regimes are estimated. Unlike other studies, the regime switch is triggered by the level of volatility and not by trade. The empirical study is done on rapeseed, corn, feed barley and protein pea French markets over 2006-2013. Empirical results show that in a high volatility regime, price deviations from the long term equilibrium are corrected faster and the price equilibration process after a price shock takes less time. Moreover, it appears that the information in the reference (producer) price becomes more relevant for commodities with (without) a futures market when the volatility rises. Nonetheless, these results are more pronounced with an ex ante than an ex post volatility measure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using longitudinal individual-level data from large-scale household surveys, together with precise measures of local ground tremors obtained from a US Geological Survey database, we identify the effects of earthquakes, exploiting the quasi-random spatial and temporal nature of their distribution. Affected individuals experience short-term economic losses but recover in the medium run (after 2-5 years), and even exhibit income and welfare gains in the long term (6-12 years). The stocks of productive assets, notably in farms, get reconstituted and public infrastructures are improved, seemingly partly through external aid, allowing productivity to recover. These findings tend to discount the presence of poverty traps and exhibit the potential long-term benefits from well-designed post-disaster interventions in contexts where disasters primarily affect physical assets.

However, the main theoretical predictions related to this issue are not always fulfilled in the empirical analysis; according to the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, there seems to be unanimous support for its effects in advanced countries whose production is relocated but not at all for recipient economies of the same. Additionally, there is a lack of empirical evidence in countries specialized in unskilled-labour tasks which are, at the same time, economies with higher relative wages in a global framework such as the Spanish economy. In this sense, the aim of this article is to analyse the effects of material offshoring in the relative composition of employment in the Spanish manufacturing industry during the period 1990-2007. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of immigrant labour and the temporary employment rate due to its increasing relevance in the Spanish economy during the period analysed. Using a generalized methods of moments (GMM) approach, our results suggest that, as opposed to most developed countries, offshoring in Spain has favoured the demand for bluecollar workers. In addition, we confirm that the increase in immigration and the increasing use of temporary contracts have enlarged the share of low-skilled workers.","[Gonzalez-Diaz, Belen; Gandoy, Rosario] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Spanish & Int Econ Econometr & Econ Hist & I, Toledo, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"González-Díaz, B (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Spanish & Int Econ Econometr & Econ Hist & I, Toledo, Spain.",belen.gonzalez@uclm.es,"Juste, Rosario Gandoy/AAI-4061-2020; Gonzalez Diaz, Belen/H-1236-2016","Juste, Rosario Gandoy/0000-0002-0203-4816; Gonzalez Diaz, Belen/0000-0002-4396-2440",Consejeria de Educacion y Ciencia of the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha [PPII10-0154-9251]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF),Consejeria de Educacion y Ciencia of the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)),This study is part of a research project financed by the Consejeria de Educacion y Ciencia of the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha [PPII10-0154-9251] and has been part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).,,55,3,3,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A power law is a plausible model for the size distribution of a pool of all wars and a sample of wars in many years, although the log-normal distribution is a plausible alternative model that we cannot reject. The random growth of conflicts could generate both types of distribution. We study the growth rates of battle deaths and random growth cannot be rejected for most of the distribution, although the results also reveal a clear decreasing pattern; the growth of deaths declines faster if the number of initial deaths is greater.","[Gonzalez-Val, Rafael] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Anal Econ, Fac Econ & Empresa, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Gonzalez-Val, Rafael] Univ Barcelona, IEB, Fac Econ & Empresa, Barcelona, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Barcelona,"González-Val, R (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Anal Econ, Fac Econ & Empresa, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",rafaelg@unizar.es,"Gonzalez Val, Rafael/B-8992-2015","Gonzalez Val, Rafael/0000-0002-2023-5726","Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2013-45969-P, ECO2013-41310-R]; DGA (ADETRE research group); FEDER",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); DGA (ADETRE research group); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government),"This work was financially supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [project numbers ECO2013-45969-P and ECO2013-41310-R], the DGA (ADETRE research group), and FEDER.",,34,8,8,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

This paper uses mine-mouth prices and transportation prices paid by regulated coal-fired power plants in the U.S. coal market during the time period 2009-2010 to study how coal mines and transportation companies practice price discrimination against electricity plants. Power plants with heterogeneous demand for coal are perfectly identified based upon their ability to market flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum, which is a byproduct produced from scrubbing SO2 emissions. Because sulfur is the raw material for FGD gypsum byproduct production, gypsum sellers are anticipated to have a more inelastic demand for high-sulfur coal. Results indicate that coal mines and transporters charge higher prices to gypsum sellers in comparison to non-sellers for transactions originating at the same mine during the same month of the same year. Coal-fired power plants capable of selling FGD gypsum byproducts are estimated to pay a 10.3-39.6 cent/MMBtu price premium for coal. Coal mines and transportation companies each capture a relatively equal share of the associated rents. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In a simple model, we identify forces that lead firms to either suboptimally patent too early or too late in equilibrium, and we determine conditions so that stronger patents induce earlier or later equilibrium disclosure. Then, by solving an infinite multistage patent game with a more explicit structure, we describe innovation growth, and derive detailed predictions that can be used for policy experiments. As an application, we calibrate our multistage game using summary statistics from the seeds breeding industry. We find that weaker patent rights may result in welfare gains of 46% relative to the status quo. The gains are achieved because weaker patents reduce competition, thus leading firms to postpone patenting.","[Hopenhayn, Hugo A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Squintani, Francesco] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Warwick,,,,"Squintani, Francesco/0000-0001-5632-5267",,,,,51,13,21,8,72,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The Finnish economy has traditionally been very dependent on relatively small number of export industries like wood processing industry, heavy metal industry and electro-technical industry. Because of our especially big need for imported energy (oil, coal, gas and electricity) lots of exports revenues are required for keeping the trade balance in surplus in order to finance our high standard of living and social welfare. The global economic collapse of 2008 hit Finnish economy and industry especially hard and the followed prolonged international economic depression has effected the Finnish economic and industrial structure dramatically. The main challenge is nowadays to define, how to restart the economy and industry and the main problem is to find out, how much we can do in Finland to help ourselves and how many of the critical factors are given outside.","[Imppola, Jorma] Seinajoki Univ Appl Sci, Sch Business & Culture, Kampusranta 11, FI-65101 Seinajoki, Finland",Seinajoki University of Applied Sciences,"Imppola, J (通讯作者)，Seinajoki Univ Appl Sci, Sch Business & Culture, Kampusranta 11, FI-65101 Seinajoki, Finland.",jorma.imppola@seamk.fi,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,741,749,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800092,0

The endogeneity of the market structure and the trade unionism of the labor market interact and jointly determine the equilibrium unemployment, firm size, number of firms, economic growth, and distribution of income between workers and firms. We show that unionization governs the distribution of income between workers and firms and the unemployment rate, but it does not give rise to any growth effect on the economy. In addition, unionization discourages potential entrants and hence decreases the equilibrium number of firms. These results echo the empirical observation in the sense that unionization raises unemployment and alters the distribution of income between workers and firms, but it does not give rise to a significant, real impact on the firms' investment and the economy-wide growth.","[Ji, Lei] SciencesPo OFCE, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Ji, Lei] SKEMA Business Sch, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Chang, Juin-Jen] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Huang, Chien-Yu] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China",SKEMA Business School; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Huang, CY (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",lei.ji@skema.edu; jjchang@econ.sinica.edu.tw; hqy@swufe.edu.cn,"Chang, Juin-Jen/ABD-9235-2022",,,,,,55,6,7,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Using the panel data methods, on the sample of 21 affluent OECD countries in the period from 1980 to 2011, it is observed that the increase in labour productivity as well as preferences of voters to parties that advocate greater redistribution, contrary to common perception, not necessarily lead to reduction in income inequality. Increasing dominance of big capital in the field of technological progress changes the conventions about contribution of workers to labour productivity. The result is a weakening of workers' bargaining power in relation to employers as well as increase in gap between labour productivity growth and real wage growth, which both lead to increase in income inequality. In comparison with the other political parties, it seems that the right-wing parties are more efficient in using voters' support to implement their concept of the welfare state, which contributes to maintaining the high market-generated income inequality. Such situation could be explained that de jure power of the government depends on election results, whereas de facto power depends on the support of so-called globally oriented super elites.","[Josifidis, Kosta; Supic, Novica; Glavaski, Olgica] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Mitrovic, Radmila Dragutinovic] Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade 11001, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; University of Belgrade,"Josifidis, K; Supic, N; Glavaski, O (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.;Mitrovic, RD (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade 11001, Serbia.",,"Supic, Novica/Q-8905-2019; Mitrovic, Radmila Dragutinovic/AAZ-5903-2020; Supic, Novica/ABF-9244-2022","Mitrovic, Radmila Dragutinovic/0000-0003-2566-4666; Supic, Novica/0000-0002-9526-7255; Glavaski, Olgica/0000-0001-6628-2301","Ministry of Education and Science, Republic of Serbia [47010]","Ministry of Education and Science, Republic of Serbia","The first version of this paper was presented at theist HenU/INFER Workshop on Applied Macroeconomics, organized by the School of Economics of Henan University (HenU) and the International Network for Economic Research (INFER) (March 18th to 19th 2015, Henan, China).

We derive the equilibrium relationship between agents' risk aversion and ability and the power of incentives (payment scheme) in a market where many heterogeneous principals and agents are endogenously matched. The equilibrium matching between principals and agents depends on the traits and is critical in determining the contract choice. Using confidential data from the National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS), we find evidence of matching between agricultural workers and the riskiness of their jobs (crops they harvest) based on workers' risk aversion and no matching based on ability. When controlling for matching, we find strong evidence that high risk-averse workers choose hourly rates and low risk-averse workers choose piece rates. We also found that high ability types choose piece rates and low ability types choose hourly rates but the evidence is weaker.

Keynesian Models traditionally argue that a rise in import decrease the net export and hence aggregate demand as a basic source of economic growth, which implies a negative causal relationship from import to national income. Contrarily, Endogenous Growth Models put forward that imports play a positive and promoting role in a rise in real national income via technology transfer. Accordingly, imports transfer new technologies embodied in capital and intermediate goods and thus spur production productivity especially in developing countries. Consequently, Endogenous Growth Models advocate the import-led economic growth while Keynesian Models assert import-led economic shrinkage. The aim of this paper is to test these arguments concerning with the impacts of import on Turkish economy. We use time series techniques based on Johansen co-integration and Granger causality tests and Innovation Accounting Techniques for the quarterly data from 2002 to 2014. Empirical findings indicate that there is a strong causality relationship from the imports towards economic growth, supporting the argument of Endogenous Growth Models. Thus, sustainable growth rates in Turkey need outward-looking policy including not only exports but also import and policy covering the measures supporting steadily financing of imports.","[Karahan, Ozcan] Balikesir Univ, Bandirma Fac Econ & Adm Sci, TR-10200 Bandirma, Turkey; [Colak, Olcay] Usak Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Usak, Turkey",Balikesir University; Usak University,"Çolak, O (通讯作者)，Usak Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Usak, Turkey.",okarahan@balikesir.edu.tr; olcay.colak@usak.edu.tr,"Çolak, Olcay/AAL-4548-2021; KARAHAN, OZCAN/D-9357-2018","Çolak, Olcay/0000-0002-0794-8449; KARAHAN, OZCAN/0000-0002-1179-2125",,,,,21,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-40322-9; 978-3-319-40321-2,CONTRIB ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,93,104,,10.1007/978-3-319-40322-9_6,0.0,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8CB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392198500006,0

We find that recent changes in U.S. and European standards have both increased the rate of technology adoption and affected the direction of technology adoption.

The reason may lie in the inappropriate application of the economic theory conclusions by the authors of economic policies and, likewise on the economic theory part, assuming that it draws inadequate conclusions for the current economic reality. The answer to the question of whether either of the above causes is relevant may be demonstrated in the phenomenon of market structures and their changes stimulated, inter alia, by the reality of economic integration. On the basis of a logical consideration of facts supported by graphic analysis, the following conclusion can be drawn: The changes in the economic reality on the part of the dominant oligopolies as well as on the part of the competitive fringe have not yet changed the conclusions formulated by the economic theory for the reality of the 1960s. Reviewing these theoretical economic conclusions and their adequacy for the current economic reality and the decision on whether the current economic policy should follow them are crucial. However, the example of the application of economic policy by the European Union and the Czech Republic - support for SMEs with the aim to increase the competition level-cannot be used for an a priori statement of inadequacy, neither on the application part nor on the economic policy formulation part. Problems in economic development may, however, be caused by the entity called the extent of thing.

The research questions are: Which of these seven main approaches are the most appropriate theories for the retail industry? Is it possible to find a final answer which applies generally?

Hereby, during the discussion of results, some possible ways are shown, in which direction the world of leadership models in the European retail trade could possibly move.","[Lancaric, Drahoslav] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Management, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Hurter, Michael] Baumax, Klosterneuburg, Austria",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Lancaric, D (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Management, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",drahoslav.lancaric@uniag.sk; huerter-michael@t-online.de,"Lancaric, Drahoslav/AAD-8710-2019",,Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-15-0552]; VEGA project [1/0930/15],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency); VEGA project(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the contract No. APVV-15-0552 and VEGA project 1/0930/15.,,23,0,0,1,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1145,1153,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800142,0

A two-sector overlapping generations model is developed to analyze China's social security reforms. It is shown that if the government does nothing to reform the system, maintaining the current replacement and contribution rates, social security debt will be explosive. Various reforms are considered, including adjusting the replacement rate while keeping the contribution rate constant, increasing the contribution rate while maintaining the current replacement rate, increasing the retirement age with the contribution rate being unchanged, increasing the retirement age with the replacement rate being unchanged, and switching to a fully-funded system by using government assets to pay the implicit social security debt.

The advantage of this kind of financing is the fact that projects are financed by individuals and anyone can actually raise money, if they have a good project. The idea for such original way of raising money has spread all over the world in recent years. It has been accepted well in Croatia as well, and there is a series of Croatian projects which have been realized thanks to this way of financing. Specific for this way of financing is the fact that the money is raised / invested through crowdfunding platforms, i. e. internet sites. First of all, attracting investments depends on the ability of a project initiator to make a good campaign and successfully present their project to potential investors, thus encouraging them to finance the project. The goal of this paper is to inform potential project initiators about this alternative way of financing, crowdfunding platforms where financial resources are raised, and how to use the crowdfunding to realize an idea, encourage creativity, innovations and entrepreneurship.","[Lubar, Helena Milicevic] Minist Finance, Tax Adm, Reg Off Slavonija & Baranja, Branch Off Osijek, Zupanijska 4, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Krizanovic, Katica] Univ JJ Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Delic, Anamarija] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Lubar, HM (通讯作者)，Minist Finance, Tax Adm, Reg Off Slavonija & Baranja, Branch Off Osijek, Zupanijska 4, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",helena.milicevic.lubar@gmail.com; katica.krizanovic@gmail.com; adelic@efos.hr,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,7,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,1051,1059,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600104,0

Following this tone, whereas the concept of smart cities (SCs) has gained increasing popularity in the recent literature, the reality says that citizen knowledge on the opportunities of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to improve their experience in globalised public spaces is likely to be scarce. This research paper analyses Spanish citizens' knowledge and attitudes towards SCs and the dimensions that should be included in the concept to define their experience globally. With respect to this latter, the concept of SC gathers six key characteristics according to some authors: (1) governance, which comprises aspects of political participation, public services and its performance, (2) mobility, or those aspects related to local and international accessibility and availability, (3) environment, in terms of natural conditions, (4) economy, in reference to factors all around national and international markets, (5) people, that is, the level of qualification and education of citizens, and (6) living, or quality of life. Around this goal, aspects related to the potential use of interactive technologies to engage citizens in urban development strategies are also considered. The research findings provide valuable data, insights and recommendations for further actions to help those responsible people in the design and implementation of policies and actions worldwide. In particular, special attention is paid to the contributions of the study to the previous literature devoted to improve the use and attractiveness of ICTs in public spaces.","[Luis Vazquez-Burguete, Jose; Sahelices-Pinto, Cesar; Lanero-Carrizo, Ana; Gutierrez-Rodriguez, Pablo] Fac Business & Econ, Campus Vegazana S-N, Leon 24071, Spain; [Purificacion Garcia-Miguelez, Maria] Fac Law & Labour Sci, Campus Vegazana S-N, Leon 24071, Spain",,"Sahelices-Pinto, C (通讯作者)，Fac Business & Econ, Campus Vegazana S-N, Leon 24071, Spain.",jose-luis.vazquez@unileon.es; cesar.sahelices@unileon.es; ana.lanero@unileon.es; pablo.gutierrez@unileon.es; mpgarm@unileon.es,"Gutiérrez-Rodríguez, Pablo/ABC-1022-2020; Vazquez-Burguete, Jose Luis/A-2056-2008; García-Miguélez, María-Purificación/L-1848-2014; Gutiérrez-Rodríguez, Pablo/ITT-3959-2023","Gutiérrez-Rodríguez, Pablo/0000-0001-5407-4265; Vazquez-Burguete, Jose Luis/0000-0003-0804-027X; García-Miguélez, María-Purificación/0000-0001-6609-3607; Gutiérrez-Rodríguez, Pablo/0000-0001-5407-4265",,,,,23,2,2,0,5,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2332,2341,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800290,0

From 1921 onward, Keynes embarked upon investment in these derivatives mainly-but not exclusively-in the commodity markets, showing a true fascination for this method of speculation. This type of financial investment he pursued mainly in the 1920s, with only a few operations undertaken during the 1930s. The option markets in which Keynes traded were metals-in particular copper, lead, spelter and, especially, tin. Besides metals, Keynes dealt in options also in other commodity markets, such as rubber and linseed oil, and sparingly in ordinary stocks and government securities. In this paper we offer a reconstruction of Keynes's speculative activity in commodity options, drawing on the archival material kept in the Keynes Papers held at King's College, Cambridge. This reconstruction is, to the best of our knowledge, entirely new to the literature and aims to provide an analysis of this particular aspect of Keynes's investment behaviour, investigating his capacity to predict market trends and offering a preliminary assessment of his performance.","[Marcuzzo, Maria Cristina] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy; [Sanfilippo, Eleonora] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Cassino,"Marcuzzo, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Stat, Viale Regina Elena 295, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",cristina.marcuzzo@uniroma1.it,"Marcuzzo, Maria Cristina/AAK-8514-2020",,,,,,22,12,12,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Using a large data set of torrent downloads observed on three popular P2P networks, we find evidence of a sales displacement effect on box office revenues. However, although statistically significant, the economic significance of this displacement appears relatively small. To establish causality, we make use of the state-day-level panel data structure permitting the use of film fixed effects to help mitigate the endogeneity between film revenues and downloads. To further assist identification, we propose a downloading cost function that considers other states' downloading activities as a proxy for the number of peers in the download swarm; the US DVD release date as a supply shock to P2P networks; and the substantial structural progression within the Australian internet service provision industry that occurred over the sample period. We observe that the release gap between the US and Australian markets is a key contributor to piracy early in a film's theatrical life. This finding provides a partial explanation for the industry's move towards coordinated worldwide releases.","[McKenzie, Jordi] Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Walls, W.

They contribute to the modernization of regions especially in countries undergoing social and political transformation. These include some countries in Central and Eastern Europe (for e.g. Poland, Lithuania), as well as in Southern Europe (e.g. Croatia). SEZs have existed in Poland since 1995; today there are 14 active zones and the permission for their operation has been extended to 2026. The SEZs are believed to have considerably contributed to the economic development of many Polish regions and their successes have been internationally recognized. Their high standing in the fDi Global Free Zones of the Year 2015 ranking (and its previous editions) seems to prove that. Therefore, the main goal of the paper is to present the wealth of experience from SEZs development in Poland. In order to give the full picture their development and outcomes have been described in both quantitative and qualitative terms. In case of the former, data concerning the number of jobs created, the value of investments made in SEZs, and the increase of SEZs' area have been analysed. As far as the qualitative aspects of SEZ development in Poland are concerned, the paper emphasizes their importance for transfer of modern technology and innovations as well as for the emergence of regional sectoral specialization, which contributes to the increase in the competitiveness of the hosting regions. Furthermore, the cluster structure of SEZs has been briefly described. In order to fulfil the main objective of the paper a review of the literature as well as an analysis of reports by governmental agencies, legislative acts, documents and information published by the Ministry of Economy have been carried out. In addition, data provided by the particular SEZs has been analysed. Research findings indicate the factors that determined the Polish SEZs' success as well as highlight activities that directly contribute to the ever-increasing attractiveness of SEZs in Poland. Some of the key determinants behind the successful emergence and operation of SEZs originate from a range of incentives and exemptions for investors, further changes in the law that facilitate their functioning and the significant activity of authorities managing the SEZs. The results of the research can serve as potential guideposts for other countries.","[Miklinska, Joanna; Klopott, Magdalena] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Ul Morska 81-87, PL-81225 Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Miklinska, J (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Ul Morska 81-87, PL-81225 Gdynia, Poland.",j.miklinska@wpit.am.gdynia.pl; m.klopott@wpit.am.gdynia.pl,"Klopott, Magdalena/X-7818-2018; Miklinska, Joanna/R-3338-2018","Miklinska, Joanna/0000-0003-1450-9273",,,,,13,1,1,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,943,951,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600094,0

Potential candidates differ in their abilities, which determines their effectiveness in office and their opportunity cost. They consider the wage when deciding whether to enter as candidates, and if they do, how hard to campaign. The remuneration for the official that maximizes ordinary citizens' expected utility is a function of the proportion of competent voters who are better informed about the quality of the candidates and are not influenced by the campaign. I use the data on U.S. governor salaries over six decades to evaluate some implications of the model. Specifically, the proportion of the state's population with a bachelor's degreea proxy for the proportion of competent votersis negatively correlated with the governors' salaries when controlled for other factors.","[Mirhosseini, Mohammad Reza] No Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, 515 Zulauf Hall, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA",Northern Illinois University,"Mirhosseini, MR (通讯作者)，No Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, 515 Zulauf Hall, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.",mirhosse@uiuc.edu,,,,,,,9,1,1,0,2,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

J,"Mocetti, S",,,,"Mocetti, Sauro",,,Dynasties in professions and the role of rents and regulation: Evidence from Italian pharmacies,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Intergenerational mobility; Professions; Regulation; Rents; Regression discontinuity design,MOBILITY,"This paper provides causal evidence concerning the role of rents in explaining dynasties in professions. It focuses on the Italian pharmacist labor market, and exploits discontinuities (established by law) in the relationship between the number of pharmacies that should serve a city and the population. Using a regression discontinuity design, it shows that a reduction in rent, proxied by the pharmacy-to-population ratio, has a significant and negative impact on the propensity of pharmacists' children to follow their parents' career. In contrast, pharmacy rents do not affect the career choices of non-pharmacists' children, who face higher entry barriers (i.e. they do not inherit the family business). Further evidence shows that rents and lower exposure to competition are associated with stronger family ties also among other professions and within firms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
