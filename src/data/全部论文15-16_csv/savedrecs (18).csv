As customer needs and competitor responses change, performance may depend on the ability for firms to recognize and react to market shifts. Using survey data from beef farmers in Illinois, we examine the role market orientation, organizational learning, and innovativeness play on satisfaction with performance. We use a structural equation model to find that market-oriented and innovative firms are more satisfied with their performance while controlling for structural and demographic variables. Results also show that while market-oriented firms are more innovative, human capital resources moderate the ability to exploit innovations. We also find that an increase in experience correlates with less organizational learning.","[Micheels, Eric T.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Bioresource Policy Business & Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada; [Gow, Hamish R.] Massey Univ, Coll Business, Sch Econ & Finance, Agribusiness, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand",University of Saskatchewan; Massey University,"Micheels, ET (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Bioresource Policy Business & Econ, 3D14 Agr,51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada.",eric.micheels@usask.ca; h.r.gow@massey.ac.nz,"Micheels, Eric/R-2700-2019","Micheels, Eric/0000-0001-6974-6423",,,,,90,12,13,2,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

While numerous studies suggest that gender differences in agricultural productivity are a result of female farmers having limited access to resources, few studies investigate the role of agricultural interventions in alleviating the constraints to input use and subsequently the gender gap in productivity. This study investigates whether there are gendered gains in agricultural productivity from participating in an input subsidy program and if these gains help reduce the gender gap. Using nationally representative data that is disaggregated at the plot level, this study analyzes the large-scale voucher-based Farm Input Subsidy Program in Malawi. Focusing on the total value of output per hectare, relationships are identified using weighted estimators, where the weights are constructed from propensity scores, and spatial fixed effects, to address the unobservable factors that may confound the relationship between program participation and productivity. The findings suggest that participation in the program improves agricultural productivity for both male and female farmers but it does not provide disproportionate help to female famers to overcome gender disparities in agricultural productivity. This suggests that female farmers face additional constraints to productivity apart from nonlabor input use.","[Karamba, R.

The aim of the research was to build a model describing the amount of precipitation and droughts for forecasting crop yields in the future. In this study, the authors analysed a non-standard mixture of gamma and one point distributions as the model of rainfall. On the basis of the rainfall data, one can estimate the parameters of the distribution. The parameter estimators were constructed using the method of the maximum likelihood. The obtained rainfall data allow confirming the hypothesis of the adequacy of the proposed rainfall models. Long series of droughts allow one to determine the probabilities of adverse phenomena in agriculture. Based on the model, the yields of barley in the years 2030 and 2050 were forecasted which can be used for the assessment of other crops productivity. The results obtained with this approach can be used to predict decreases in agricultural production caused by the prospective rainfall shortages. Th is will enable decision makers to shape effective agricultural policies in order to learn how to balance the food supplies and demands through an appropriate management of the stored raw food materials and the import/export policies.","[Bojar, Waldemar; Knopik, Leszek] Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Management, Bydgoszcz, Poland; [Zarski, Jacek; Kusmierek-Tomaszewska, Renata] Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Agr & Biotechnol, Bydgoszcz, Poland",Bydgoszcz University of Science & Technology; Bydgoszcz University of Science & Technology,"Kusmierek-Tomaszewska, R (通讯作者)，Univ Technol & Life Sci, Fac Agr & Biotechnol, Ul Bernardynska 6, PL-85029 Bydgoszcz, Poland.",rkusmier@utp.edu.pl,"Kuśmierek-Tomaszewska, Renata/T-3162-2018; Żarski, Jacek/AAI-6411-2021; Bojar, Waldemar/AAW-9040-2021; Bojar, Waldemar/GRR-7274-2022","Kuśmierek-Tomaszewska, Renata/0000-0002-2333-376X; Żarski, Jacek/0000-0002-5098-4242; Bojar, Waldemar/0000-0002-8231-9378;",FACCE JPI - MACSUR project [FACCE JPI/04/2012]; NCBiR,FACCE JPI - MACSUR project; NCBiR,"The paper was prepared within the framework of the FACCE JPI - MACSUR project titled: 'A detailed climate change risk assessment for European agriculture and food security, in collaboration with the international projects' - Contract No. FACCE JPI/04/2012; a portion of the P100 PARTNER (UTP) project is financed by the NCBiR.",,43,3,3,0,18,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Based on nationally representative data at the village level, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants of voting participation, focussing on the effect of election quality. The findings show that competitiveness, vote buying and manipulation are the key determinants significantly affecting village turnouts. The results are robust to alternative specifications. Design/methodology/approach - As discussed, the authors take three measures for villagers' willingness to vote, e.g. raw turnout (RT), voluntary turnout (VT) and direct turnout (DT). The authors include four types of elements which affect the willingness to participate, the electoral quality, procedure and implementation, individual rationality, village social structure and villages' level of modernization. The causal mechanism of elements and turnout can be written as: Turnout = f (election quality and procedure, individual rationality, mobilization structure, modernization). Findings - Competitiveness, vote buying and manipulation affect village turnout at significance level. More competitive elections tend to attract high participation of voting, and the effects on VT are the largest ones in magnitude, comparing with RT and DT, as well as manipulation. Village voters do not like to be fooled by nominal voting. If they recognize that elections are likely to be manipulated by township government, the turnout rates drop drastically. The effect associated with manipulation is larger than those associated with competitiveness and vote buying, indicating intervention from up-level government might block the improving process of election massively. Originality/value - It is the first paper that address the effect of election quality on vote participation.","[Zhang, Tonglong] Tianjing Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hou, Linke] Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China",Tianjin Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shandong University,"Zhang, TL (通讯作者)，Tianjing Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",,"Hou, Linke/AAF-5549-2020; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023; ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022","Hou, Linke/0000-0001-9160-1060;",State Key Program of National Science Foundation of China [71033003]; Youth Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China [11CGL058]; Youth Team Funding of Shandong University [IFYT1223]; Creation Boosting Plan for Excellent Researcher of Tianjin Normal University [52wx1302],State Key Program of National Science Foundation of China; Youth Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Youth Team Funding of Shandong University; Creation Boosting Plan for Excellent Researcher of Tianjin Normal University,"The authors would like to thank a number of people who have helped the authors in the efforts to design the survey form, collect and clean the data, and develop the preliminary draft of this paper.

Over the past decade, the number of public and private sector initiatives in this space has increased substantially, with over 140 deployments worldwide in 2015. While there is substantial potential for such services to address farmers' and traders' information and credit market constraints, economic research suggests that the impacts of such services on agricultural adoption, behavior and welfare is mixed. While this can, in part, be explained by the degree of the information asymmetry and the presence of other market failures in different contexts, research from other disciplines provides additional insights into these findings. In particular, work in the domain of human-computer interaction (HCI) focuses heavily on users' interaction and experience with a given technology, thus explaining why users may not fully engage with ICT-based agricultural interfaces. Furthermore, sociological and anthropological approaches study the provision of information and trust and how these may be altered by ICT platforms. Drawing upon these disciplines, we suggest that future ICT for agriculture initiatives should first seek to better understand the information and complementary market failures in a given context, in order to better understand whether information is a binding constraint. Second, even if information is missing, the information services provided should be of high quality and from a trusted source, which can be a challenge with some ICT platforms. Finally, such services should be delivered via platforms that build upon local ICT access and usage, paying particular attention to the gender digital divide.","[Aker, Jenny C.] Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Aker, Jenny C.] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Ghosh, Ishita; Burrell, Jenna] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Informat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Tufts University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Aker, JC (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA.;Aker, JC (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",Jenny.Aker@tufts.edu,,,,,,,108,170,193,14,142,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The evolution of EU rural development policy has generated both increasing complexity and increased transaction costs. However, this policy evolution also creates opportunities for improvement of policy process management. The paper considers these opportunities in the case of Rural Development Programmes (RDPs) under Pillar 2 of the CAP. We examine the influence of transaction effects on RDP performance, based on direct experience of RDP review and planning in England and Malta, where qualitative evidence of transaction benefits' is identified. Benefits occur when exchange processes are designed in ways that generate positive returns beyond the immediate transaction, which can outweigh short-term costs. We conclude that more attention to these aspects of policy design is warranted in future rural development programming and evaluation.","[Dwyer, Janet; Powell, John] Univ Gloucestershire, CCRI, Cheltenham, Glos, England; [Dwyer, Janet] Univ Gloucestershire, Rural Policy, Cheltenham, Glos, England",University of Gloucestershire; University of Gloucestershire,"Dwyer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gloucestershire, CCRI, Cheltenham, Glos, England.;Dwyer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gloucestershire, Rural Policy, Cheltenham, Glos, England.",Jdwyer@glos.ac.uk,,"Dwyer, Janet/0000-0002-2332-9832",,,,,39,5,6,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Households' demands are modeled as a two-stage Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System, which is then estimated by means of a consistent two-step estimator introduced in Tauchmann (2010) and not previously used in studies of this type. This procedure allows consistent imposition of the traditional parameter restrictions that utility maximisation requires in the context of a censored model. Our results show that the welfare loss and the increment in the tax bill increase with income. We also show that expenditure on food and non-alcoholic beverages grows less than proportionately with income. Consequently, households with lower income experience a greater welfare loss relative to their income levels. In short, the 2012 VAT reform in Spain, focusing on this expenditure group, can be considered as regressive.","[Garcia-Enriquez, Javier; Echevarria, Cruz A.] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Bilbao, Spain",University of Basque Country,"García-Enríquez, J (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Bilbao, Spain.",javier.garcia@ehu.eus,"Echevarria, Cruz/E-6557-2019; Garcia-Enriquez, Javier/A-5945-2015","Echevarria, Cruz/0000-0003-2795-1917; Garcia-Enriquez, Javier/0000-0002-2160-0369","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-35820, ECO2013-40935]; Basque Government [DEUI-IT-793-13, DEUI-IT-783-13]; University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU [UFI 11/46 BETS]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Basque Government(Basque Government); University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU,"The authors wish to thank the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through Projects ECO2012-35820 and ECO2013-40935, the Basque Government, through grants DEUI-IT-793-13 and DEUI-IT-783-13 (MACLAB Research Group), and the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, through grant UFI 11/46 BETS.",,45,3,5,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Two spread measures-the futures-spot and futures-futures-are matched with deliverable stocks on the first Friday of delivery. To account for grade and location aggregation issues, the futures-spot spreads are measured using the lowest spot bid and highest futures price. Storage in the presence of backwardation is pervasive both in terms of the percentage of observations and the magnitude of the stockholdings. The Working curve emerges most clearly in KCBT wheat and soybeans. Convenience yield is also supported by the negligible holdings of delivery shipping certificates in backwardations. Overall, the results show that the Working curve does indeed still work today.

Bellemare, Barrett, and Just present a theoretical and empirical approach to the estimation of willingness to pay for food price stabilization that accounts for the covolatility of prices, making a significant contribution to the literature. However, in the course of applying their model to data from rural Ethiopia, the authors make an empirical assumption in the treatment of zero-valued income households that produces a distortion in the distribution of household budget shares. This comment identifies the consequences of this assumption for the estimated relationship of poor and wealthy households' willingness to pay for food commodity price stabilization, and shows the results one would obtain under a different, distribution-preserving treatment of zero-valued income. The key finding is that the distributional benefit incidence of food price stabilization found in Bellemare, Barrett, and Just (2013) is reversed when the budget share of marketable surplus is calculated over observed, as opposed to mean, household income where available.","[McBride, Linden] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY USA",Cornell University,"McBride, L (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY USA.",lem247@cornell.edu,,,,,,,12,7,10,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Our results identify which regulations can adversely affect trade providing useful information to policy-makers involved in negotiations on trade frictions. While SPS measures do not seem to obstruct exports, technical barriers have a varying impact on trade.

The purpose of this paper is to empirically analyze the structural characteristics in food consumption demand of outgoing rural migrant workers. Design/methodology/approach - The food consumption of rural migrant workers is estimated using a quaids approach by the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator to reveal the determinants of the food consumption of outgoing rural migrant workers in urban China based on a sample of 876 of outgoing rural migrant workers from the 2007-2009 household survey conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Findings - The results show that the GMM estimator is consistent compared with the SUR estimator; the conditional expenditure elasticities of grain foods, livestock products, edible oils and vegetables by outgoing rural migrant workers are 0.877, 1.081, 0.787 and 0.958, respectively; the unconditional expenditure elasticities of grain foods, livestock products, edible oils and vegetables are 0.634, 0.782, 0.569 and 0.693, respectively; the conditional Marshallian own-price elasticities of grain foods, livestock products, edible oils and vegetables are -1.004, -1.019, -0.645 and -1.021, respectively. Practical implications - First, the differences in food consuming patterns between rural residents and outgoing rural migrant workers should be emphasized in ensuring China's food security for the policymakers. Second, how to ensure the supply for the increase in the consumption demand of livestock products in urban areas should be a major focus of China's food security strategy. Originality/value - In total, 876 households of outgoing rural migrant worker from the 2007-2009 household survey conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics of China are used; compared the GMM estimator with the SUR estimator in the estimate of the QUAIDS model; it sheds light on the structural characteristics in food consumption demand of outgoing rural migrant workers.","[Han, Xinru; Chen, Yongfu] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Chen, YF (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",chenyf@cau.edu.cn,"Han, Xinru/AAN-6411-2020","Han, Xinru/0000-0002-1673-7803",,,,,73,18,22,7,58,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

We develop a dynamic portfolio model of water supply that hedges against the supply risks from all potential water sources, by taking into account the size of water reserves, uncertainties of water flows as well as differences in supply costs. The optimal portfolio shares for an existing water supply system are derived and compared with the observed contributions to total water stock, revealing unexploited hedging opportunities between various naturally occurring water sources as well as a general over-reliance on manufactured water. The optimal solution implies that future supply augmentations should target natural sources of water ahead of manufactured water.

Such a Green Paradox could occur if fossil fuel resource owners exploit their resources more rapidly due to the expectation of stricter climate policies in the future. This article shows that the emergence of the Green Paradox is less plausible if exploration activities are taken into account. An extraction model that incorporates exploration investments finds that an increasing cash flow tax is effective in dealing with climate change depending upon the specific formulation of the tax scheme. For example, the higher the initial tax level, the more effective is the tax scheme in mitigating climate change and hence a Green Paradox can be avoided. A very low growth rate is also beneficial for the climate as it leads to a small temporal redistribution of extraction to earlier periods. A very high growth rate leads to faster extraction; however, it also coincides with a significant decrease in total emissions that is inconsistent with a Green Paradox.","[Oesterle, Ines] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Oesterle, Ines] Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney; Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited,"Österle, I (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",i.osterle@econ.usyd.edu.au,,,Valentina Bosetti,Valentina Bosetti,"This study is drawn from research that I conducted during a visitorship at Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, Corso Magenta 63, Milan; I am grateful for the support of Valentina Bosetti of this institution.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors used survey data collected from broiler producers in Louisiana, USA. The authors estimated several duration models that either considered event dependence or heterogeneity or both. Findings - Results from the conditional frailty model indicated that large farms adopt BMPs earlier, farmers who have been in broiler farming profession for a long time are late to adopt BMPs and more informed farmers, through contact with extension agents and education, are early adopters of BMPs. Research limitations/implications - The limitation of this study is that the authors did not validate the robustness of the conditional frailty model using a more rigorous approach, such as empirical simulation method. Practical implications - Many farmers do not adopt a new technology immediately after it becomes available. Duration models help to understand why farmers wait and how long they wait before adopting a new technology. In case of correlated events, where farmers adopt more than one technology, it is important to know the driving factors behind multiple technologies adoption.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors conduct a survey-based experiment to measure farmers' positional concerns, and employ econometric models to examine the determinants of the degree of positional concern and how the positional concern affects household expenditures on visible goods. Findings - The authors find that Chinese farmers have strong positional concerns for income, and high-income households are more concerned with relative position. Furthermore, there is a significant difference between males and females with respect to correlation between degree of positionality and household expenditures on visible goods. For females, there is a positive correlation between degree of positionality and household expenditures on clothes, restaurants, and mobile phones, respectively. For males, there is a positive correlation between degree of positionality and household expenditures on mobile phones. Social implications - The government policy thus should pay attention to the positional goods, and the relevant consumption tax by increasing the prices of visible goods could be considered or suggested in the future even in the rural areas. Originality/value - This paper provides complementary evidence on Chinese farmers' positional concerns, and how the degree of positional concern relates to household expenditures on visible goods.","[Yang, Xiaojun] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Xian, Peoples R China; [Qin, Ping] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jintao] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Renmin University of China; Peking University,"Yang, XJ (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Xian, Peoples R China.",xjyang@nsd.pku.edu.cn,,"Xu, Jintao/0000-0001-5588-2942",Word Bank; Ford Foundation; Swedish Agency for International Development and Cooperation (Sida); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [13XNK011]; Rights and Resources Initiatives,Word Bank; Ford Foundation; Swedish Agency for International Development and Cooperation (Sida); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China; Rights and Resources Initiatives,"Financial support from the Word Bank, Rights and Resources Initiatives, the Ford Foundation, the Swedish Agency for International Development and Cooperation (Sida) to the Environmental Economics Unit at the University of Gothenburg, Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China (13XNK011) are gratefully acknowledged.

The exchange rate response is found to vary with whether the boom is generated by an increase in global demand or an increase in domestic supply, and the response varies over time as the boom moves through investment and production stages. Also, the exchange rate response depends on the mix of resident and nonresident investment funds, the share of the investment domestically sourced and the distribution of windfall income and its expenditure. A key result is the absence of a simple relationship between the terms of trade and the exchange rate.","Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Freebairn, J (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia.",j.freebairn@unimelb.edu.au,"freebairn, john/O-6199-2015","freebairn, john/0000-0002-1480-4953",,,,,18,6,6,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

In part, this is due to the concern that using money as a mode of contribution may not capture the potential contribution of low-income households. To address this limitation, respondents in this study were provided with the option of contributing towards the management of invasive plants in labour terms if they were unwilling to contribute in monetary terms. The results show that the existing practice of using dollar values to estimate willingness to contribute may disproportionately exclude the concerns of some groups within the community. The analysis also indicates that allowing respondents to express their willingness to contribute in labour increases their participation in environmental decision-making processes and hence increases the estimated value of forest ecosystem services. This study contributes to the limited empirical literature on the development of nonmarket valuation surveys, particularly choice experiments, in low-income countries in general and rural areas in particular.","[Rai, Rajesh K.] SANDEE, Lalitpur, Nepal; [Scarborough, Helen] Deakin Univ, Fac Business & Law, Warrnambool, Vic, Australia",Deakin University,"Rai, RK (通讯作者)，SANDEE, Lalitpur, Nepal.",scars@deakin.edu.au,"Scarborough, Helen/R-9280-2019; Kumar, Rajesh/ABA-6489-2020; Rai, Rajesh Kumar Kumar/E-3572-2019","Rai, Rajesh Kumar Kumar/0000-0002-2275-815X",South Asian Network for Development and Environment Economics (SANDEE),South Asian Network for Development and Environment Economics (SANDEE),"The authors would like to thank the South Asian Network for Development and Environment Economics (SANDEE) for financial support to conduct this study.

Given annual domestic consumption of ca. 700PJ/a, 2P reserves rapidly shifted from 14 to 72years supply. Profit-maximising firms sought to speed up commercialisation of reserves through the development of three liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants at Gladstone. In this article, we present forecasts of Australia's east coast interconnected gas system with daily resolution using our dynamic partial equilibrium model. Modelling results show the rapid development of LNG plants combined with restrictive CSG development policies in NSW may result in unserved load from 2016. Relaxing development constraints or delaying construction of one LNG terminal by 1year could have avoided the risk of Unserved Load events in the domestic gas market. Lessons can be learned from this CSG-LNG boom scenario. Facilitating new gas supplies is the most efficient way of alleviating the impacts of the CSG-LNG boom on domestic markets in the medium term. In the long-term, Australian policymakers may consider the merits of a National Net Benefits Test to maximise welfare through appropriate coordination - as is done by policymakers in the USA - as opposed to protecting local industries through domestic gas reservation policies'.","[Simshauser, Paul] AGL Energy Ltd, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Nelson, Tim] AGL Energy Ltd, Econ & Sustainabil, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Simshauser, Paul; Nelson, Tim] Griffith Univ, Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Simshauser, P (通讯作者)，AGL Energy Ltd, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",psimshauser@agl.com.au,"Simshauser, Paul/H-1244-2015; Nelson, Tim/H-4450-2018","Simshauser, Paul/0000-0003-1857-550X; Nelson, Tim/0000-0003-4846-3787",,,,,21,24,24,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

In this study we investigate the association between parental employment and parental time spent eating with their children. Using data from the 2001/02 German Time Budget Survey, we explore associations between time spent eating with children and labor force participation in Germany. We find that parental labor force participation is negatively associated with time spent eating with children. Each additional hour of work per day by the mother is associated with a 2.4 minute decrease in the amount of time the mother spends eating with her children. For paternal hours of work, we find that the more time a father spends working, the less time the child spends eating with the father or with both parents. Overall, we find evidence of mother inter-gender time substitution and some amount of time/food away from home substitution. Understanding how parents allocate their time, where they are most likely to eat, and what drives these decisions is an important endeavor since parents play a critical role in shaping and reinforcing their children's eating practices.","[Chen, Susan E.] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Moeser, Anke] Univ Giessen, Inst Agr Policy & Market Res, Giessen, Germany; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Norwegian Agr Econ Res Inst, Oslo, Norway; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Justus Liebig University Giessen; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Korea University,"Chen, SE (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",sechen@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,41,4,6,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

We enhance these statistical criteria with the additional criterion of microfoundation (step 3), which is to select the size distribution that comes with a dynamic micromodel of size dynamics. A numerical performance test of step 1 shows that our generalization is able to correctly rule out the distribution hypotheses unjustified by the data at hand. We then illustrate our approach and demonstrate its usefulness with a sample of commercial cattle farms in Namibia. In conclusion, the framework proposed here has the potential to reconcile the ongoing debate about size distribution models in empirical data, the two most prominent of which are the Pareto and the log-normal distribution.","[Engler, John-Oliver] Univ Luneburg, Dept Sustainabil Sci, Sustainabil Econ Grp, Luneburg, Germany; [Engler, John-Oliver; Baumgaertner, Stefan] Univ Luneburg, Dept Econ, Luneburg, Germany; [Baumgaertner, Stefan] Univ Luneburg, Dept Sustainabil Sci, Sustainabil Econ, Luneburg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg; Leuphana University Luneburg; Leuphana University Luneburg,"Engler, JO (通讯作者)，Univ Luneburg, Dept Sustainabil Sci, Sustainabil Econ Grp, Luneburg, Germany.",engler@leuphana.de,"Baumgärtner, Stefan/A-9597-2012","Baumgärtner, Stefan/0000-0001-8314-8462",,,,,72,3,3,2,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The dynamics of commodity prices in both sectors are partly interdependent, but are also shaped by independent determinants and have rarely been studied. We analyze organic food markets and their interdependencies with conventional markets in the context of wheat markets in Germany, which have been subject to a number of fundamental changes during the last two decades. Based on institutional market characteristics, we suggest a flexible Markov-switching asymmetric time series model. We find a pronounced temporal sequence of market phases that differ in their asymmetric dynamics and the extent to which the organic price is influenced by the conventional price.

A bio-economic model is developed with a dynamic and multi-scale perspective. It combines biodiversity dynamics, farming land-uses selected at the micro level and public policies at the macro level based on financial incentives for land-uses. The public decision-maker identifies optimal subsidies or taxes with respect to both biodiversity and budgetary constraints. These optimal policies are then analysed through their private, public and social costs. The model is calibrated and applied to metropolitan France at the small agricultural region scale, using common birds as biodiversity metrics. First results relying on optimality curves and private costs stress the bioeconomic trade-off between biodiversity and economic scores. In contrast, the analysis of public costs suggests that accounting for biodiversity can generate a second benefit in terms of public budget. Social costs defined as the sum of private and public costs also show possible bio-economic synergies.","[Mouysset, Lauriane] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Mouysset, Lauriane] AgroParisTech, Paris, France; [Doyen, Luc; Pereau, Jean-Christophe] Univ Bordeaux IV, CNRS, Gretha, Bordeaux, France; [Jiguet, Frederic] Museum Natl Hist Nat, F-75231 Paris, France",University of Cambridge; AgroParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Bordeaux; Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN),"Mouysset, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",lauriane.mouysset@agroparistech.fr,"Doyen, Luc/GXH-3424-2022","Doyen, Luc/0000-0001-8272-6187; pereau, jean christophe/0000-0003-0761-6994","ANR - Agence Nationale de la Recherche - under the Systerra program - Ecosystems and Sustainable Development [ANR-08-STRA-007]; FRB - Fondation pour la Recherche en Biodiversite; GDF-Suez; MOBILIS program Modeling for scenarios and sustainable management of biodiversity, farming and forestry facing climate change","ANR - Agence Nationale de la Recherche - under the Systerra program - Ecosystems and Sustainable Development(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); FRB - Fondation pour la Recherche en Biodiversite; GDF-Suez; MOBILIS program Modeling for scenarios and sustainable management of biodiversity, farming and forestry facing climate change","This work was carried out with the financial support of both the ANR - Agence Nationale de la Recherche - under the Systerra program - Ecosystems and Sustainable Development, project ANR-08-STRA-007, FARMBIRD and the FRB - Fondation pour la Recherche en Biodiversite - and GDF-Suez, with the MOBILIS program Modeling for scenarios and sustainable management of biodiversity, farming and forestry facing climate change.",,46,10,10,3,62,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

Rural SMEs play an important part in sustainable rural development, post-transformation processes, as well as in the integrated development of formal and informal rural institutions in the Czech economy. The research design is based on a questionnaire survey conducted with a sample of 1144 randomly selected Czech rural SMEs. There was applied a one-way error model expressed either by the fixed effects (FE) model and the random effect (RE) model with the error term consisting of two components: a time-invariant component and a remainder component that is assumed to be uncorrelated over time. It was also attempted to rule out the individual location effects in the econometric model by using the location variables (location dummies). The results also show that the success of the rural SMEs in the Czech Republic is mostly related to its manager and enterprise characteristics. The most significant determinants of rural enterprise's competitiveness are location within a region with competitive situation, the enterprise size, the enterprise age, and the fact whether the enterprise has some form of innovation. The results might have significant implications for both academics and stakeholders and can be used as a basis for the targeted rural enterprise policies in the Czech Republic and in the post-transitional Eastern and Central Europe.","[Abrham, Josef; Vosta, Milan; Slajs, Jan] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Strielkowski, Wadim] Charles Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Charles University Prague,"Abrhám, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, 4 Winston Churchill Sq, Prague 13000 3, Czech Republic.",abrham@vse.cz,"Strielkowski, Wadim/J-6112-2017; Abrhám, Josef/AAL-8271-2021; Strielkowski, Wadim/I-4374-2019","Strielkowski, Wadim/0000-0001-6113-3841; Abrhám, Josef/0000-0003-2484-8439; Strielkowski, Wadim/0000-0001-6113-3841",Norwegian Financial Mechanism [CZ09],Norwegian Financial Mechanism,"This paper was elaborated within the framework of Institutional support of the University of Economics, Prague and Czech-Norwegian Research Programme (CZ09) supported from the Norwegian Financial Mechanism 2009-2014.",,35,37,38,1,37,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

We test Day's conjecture that crop yield skewness becomes negative as nitrogen rates increase and determine how well a linear response stochastic plateau (LRSP) production function matches the pattern of observed skewness using four long-term nitrogen experiments. Stillwater wheat is consistent with Day's conjecture, but the skewness for Lahoma and Altus wheat yields as well as Altus cotton yields are not. The LRSP assumes normal random effects and can explain only a small part of observed skewness, so a new LRSP with skew-normal random effects is introduced, which comes closer to explaining the observed skewness and should increase the accuracy of nitrogen rate recommendations.

These plans were created by the author of this paper and published in the Statistical Papers. These new plans were compared with the corresponding Dodge-Romig LTPD plans for the inspection by attributes from the economic point of view. From the results of the numerical investigations, it follows that under the same protection of consumer the LTPD plans for the inspection by variables are in many situations more economical than the corresponding Dodge-Romig attribute sampling plans (saving of the inspection cost is 80% in any cases).

Dairy products are the export pillars of Czech agrarian foreign trade, and the dairy industry was one of the most important recipients of public support on innovations from the Rural Development Programme (RDP). The core of this research is an analysis of sixteen projects, supported under RDP sub-measure I.1.3.2 from 2007 to September 2013. Data from the representative sample of approved projects have been converted into a set of questions and answers to enable them to be evaluated, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The dataset is analysed by means of a counterfactual analysis, descriptive statistics, and correlation analysis. The results show that innovations, and public support of innovations, enabled dairies to stabilise their profits, and to increase their competiveness, during the period of economic crisis. There were five types of innovation trends in the Czech dairy industry in recent years: (i) The processing and efficient use of by-products (whey, buttermilk); (ii) The production of new products with health benefits; (iii) Improved processing of dairy products with particular focus on long-life products having better sensory parameters; (iv) Improved efficiency of transport and storage of milk and dairy products; (v) Improved wastewater treatment. The real innovative effect was, however, very limited because individual companies were not looking for their own new added value, but were more focused on the implementation of already-existing innovations.","[Spicka, Jindrich] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Strategy, Prague 13067, Czech Republic; [Smutka, Lubos; Selby, Richard] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Spicka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",jindrich.spicka@vse.cz,"Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015; Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013; Selby, Richard/M-8765-2019","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333; Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0001-5699-9544;","Socio-economic practices of sustainable development in the new industrialization; Government of the Russian Federation [074-U01]; University of Economics, Prague [MF/F3/4/2013]; National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics (ITMO) St Petersburg, Russia","Socio-economic practices of sustainable development in the new industrialization; Government of the Russian Federation; University of Economics, Prague; National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics (ITMO) St Petersburg, Russia","This paper was prepared with financial support from the project Socio-economic practices of sustainable development in the new industrialization.

However, there is a production deficit and new technologies to reduce the deficit are not widely adopted. Although poor adoption by farmers' is often linked to constraints such as access to information, farmers' perceptions of the technologies are also important. We apply an advanced discrete choice experiment to evaluate farmers' preferences for rice production practices. Specifically, we generate willingness to pay (WTP) estimates using willingness to pay space (WS) and compare these with values from the indirect or preference space (PS) method. Our modelling also accounts for the effects on WTP estimates of farmers' stated attribute importance (SAI) information. Empirical results from WS and PS models reveal that on average, farmers value higher yields and are negatively affected by higher risk of crop failure and labour requirements. Comparing the performance of the two models, we find the WS model provides a superior fit to our data and reduces the likelihood of producing implausible WTP estimates. Further, SAI inclusion did not produce much variation in our WTP estimates.","[Coffie, Rebecca Owusu; Burton, Michael P.; Gibson, Fiona L.; Hailu, Atakelty] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Coffie, RO (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.",rebecca.owusu@research.uwa.edu.au,"Owusu, Rebecca/AAB-5049-2020; Owusu, Rebecca/ABA-9408-2021; burton, michael/A-9541-2009; Hailu, Atakelty/AAB-7606-2020","Owusu, Rebecca/0000-0001-9369-4117; Owusu, Rebecca/0000-0003-0683-0278; Hailu, Atakelty/0000-0002-1024-7520; burton, michael/0000-0003-4213-4093; Dempster, Fiona/0000-0002-7989-3483",Australian government under the Australia Development Scholarship scheme,Australian government under the Australia Development Scholarship scheme(Australian Government),The Australian government under the Australia Development Scholarship scheme funded this research.,,33,21,21,1,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

There are conflicting hypotheses regarding the impacts that farmland preservation could have on farmers' management decisions with respect to investment or disinvestment, and there is a lack of evidence in the literature regarding the nature of such impacts. To address this issue, this article uses a farm-level panel data set to estimate the impacts of the Greenbelt policy on farm exit and on farm investment. The Greenbelt policy is found to have influenced both farm exit and farm investment decisions, with the impact varying depending on location within the Greenbelt. In particular, the results indicate evidence of a negative impact on farm investment, which is contrary to one of the objectives of the Greenbelt policy.","[Li, Na] Univ Toronto, Dept Nutr Sci, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Vyn, Richard J.] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [McEwan, Ken] Univ Guelph, Ridgetown Campus, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Guelph; University of Guelph,"Vyn, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",rvyn@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

In this paper we develop a conceptual framework which undertakes such an integration at the firm and regional levels. We call this the General Equilibrium with Individual Spatial Heterogeneity and Externalities (GEISHE) model. We use the model to study the effect of spatial heterogeneity in emission intensity on the spatial distribution of production under a uniform emission standard. This model suggests that the introduction of an emission restriction can have differential effects on the spatial patterns of production, depending on local production intensity. We also present empirical analysis of intraprovincial movement of production for the Canadian dairy industry using 1996 and 2006 Census data. Ceteris paribus, areas that had higher dairy production intensities in 1996 also tended to experience higher declines in their dairy cow populations between 1996 and 2006, which is consistent with the GEISHE model. These results suggest that environmental pressure may change the patterns of comparative advantage within a supply managed industry, even if relocation of production across provincial boundaries is not permitted. Expression of environmental comparative advantages seems to be taking place within provinces.","[Rajsic, Predrag; Fox, Glenn] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Rajsic, P (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",prajsic@uoguelph.ca; gfox@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,36,3,3,2,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Design/methodology/approach - This study uses the provincial-level panel data and employs the fixed-effects instrumental variable regression technique to investigate empirically the impact of FDI on urban-rural income inequality in China. Findings - The study finds that while FDI has directly contributed to reducing urban-rural income inequality through employment creation, knowledge spillovers and contribution to economic growth, FDI has also contributed to increasing urban-rural income inequality through international trade. Practical implications - The study has some policy implications. First, as the study finds that FDI not only contributes to reducing urban-rural income inequality through employment creation, knowledge spillovers and contribution to economic growth, but also contributes to increasing urban-rural income inequality through international trade, therefore, apart from improving local economic and technological conditions to attract more FDI inflows, China should re-design FDI policies by shifting away from encouraging export-oriented FDI to encouraging FDI flows into the industries and sectors in line with China's overall economic structural adjustments and industrial upgrading. Second, policies should focus on increasing investment in infrastructure development and in public education, which not only can reduce urban-rural income inequality but also can attract more FDI inflows. And finally policies should be designed to accelerate urbanisation development by focusing on urban-rural integrated development, household registration system reform and proper settlement of rural migrants in urban areas, thus reducing urban-rural income inequality. Originality/value - The paper makes two major contributions to the literature. First, the paper adopts the fixed-effects instrumental variable regression technique to deal with the endogeneity issues in estimating the impact of FDI on urban-rural income inequality, producing more consistent estimates. Second, the paper investigates not only the direct impact of FDI on urban-rural income inequality through the effects of employment creation, knowledge spillovers and contribution to economic growth, but also the indirect impact of FDI on urban-rural income inequality through its activities in international trade, adding new empirical evidence to the sparse literature on the impact of FDI on income inequality in China.","[Chen, Chunlai] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Chen, CL (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",chunlai.chen@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,55,22,22,2,71,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The findings reveal that, although higher output prices serve as an incentive to improve global crop supply as expected, output price volatility acts as a disincentive. Depending on the crop, the results show that own-price supply elasticities range from about 0.05 to 0.40. Output price volatility, however, has negative correlations with crop supply, implying that farmers shift land, other inputs, and yield-improving investments to crops with less volatile prices. Simulating the impact of price dynamics since 2006, we find that price risk has reduced the production response of wheat in particular-and to a lesser extent, rice-thus dampening price incentive effects. The simulation analysis shows that the increase in own-crop price volatility from 2006-2010 dampened yield by about 1-2% for the crops under consideration.","[Haile, Mekbib G.; Kalkuhl, Matthias; von Braun, Joachim] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Haile, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany.",mekhaile@uni-bonn.de,"von Braun, Joachim/AAA-7044-2020","von Braun, Joachim/0000-0001-6571-4838; Haile, Mekbib/0000-0002-5480-531X; Kalkuhl, Matthias/0000-0003-4797-6628",Bayer CropScience AG; European Commission; Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany,Bayer CropScience AG(Bayer AG); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany,"The authors acknowledge financial support from Bayer CropScience AG, the European Commission, and the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany for a research project at ZEF that works on related topics.

This article takes a unique approach to reconstruct the cash and asset balances using detailed household transaction data on farm households in rural India and generates monthly and seasonal ICRISAT panel data for the period 1976-1983. We have found that households-irrespective of their landholding status-cope with temporary shocks quite well by using crop inventory, currency, and capital assets, rather than livestock, as buffer assets. The importance of portfolio adjustments in smoothing consumption is also confirmed by the use of a system of equations in which both portfolio and production decisions are made endogenous. It is concluded that not only the level but also the diversification of household assets are important for buffering consumption. As an extension, we have explored the monthly ICRISAT panel data for the period 2009-2012 in the same villages and have found a similar pattern in household portfolio responses to income shocks.","[Imai, Katsushi S.; Malaeb, Bilal] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Imai, KS (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Katsushi.Imai@manchester.ac.uk,"Imai, Katsushi Imai/I-3595-2015","Imai, Katsushi Imai/0000-0001-7989-8914",,,,,29,1,1,2,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The analysis relies on a flexible moment-based specification of a stochastic production function in a multinomial endogenous switching regression framework to correct for the selection bias stemming both from observed and unobserved heterogeneity. A quantile moment approach is used to estimate the cost of risk. After controlling for the effects of unobserved heterogeneity and several observable variables on maize production and downside risk functions, estimation results show that the adoption of SIPs increases food security and reduces downside risk exposure and the cost of risk. We estimate greater food security and larger reduction in downside risk from simultaneous adoption of both crop diversification (maize-legume intercropping and rotations) and minimum tillage, suggesting that there are complementary benefits from these practices. We find most of the cost of risk comes from exposure to downside risk. Our findings imply that in dealing with production risks development agents should encourage the adoption of agronomic and resource-management practices along with other risk mitigation and food security improving strategies.","[Kassie, Menale] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Nairobi, Kenya; [Teklewold, Hailemariam; Marenya, Paswel; Jaleta, Moti; Erenstein, Olaf] CIMMYT, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Kassie, M (通讯作者)，Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Nairobi, Kenya.",m.kassie@cgair.org,"Kassie, Menale/ADT-2906-2022; Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022","Kassie, Menale/0000-0002-6754-2432; Erenstein, Olaf/0000-0002-7491-5786",Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR); Australian International Food Security Research Centre (AIFSRC) through International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT)-led Sustainable Intensification of Maize-Legume Cropping Systems in Eastern and Southern Africa (SIMLESA) program; Adoption Pathways Project; CGIAR research programme on maize,Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res); Australian International Food Security Research Centre (AIFSRC) through International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT)-led Sustainable Intensification of Maize-Legume Cropping Systems in Eastern and Southern Africa (SIMLESA) program; Adoption Pathways Project; CGIAR research programme on maize(CGIAR),"Menale Kassie is with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), Nairobi, Kenya.

The results show a wide spread in the effective subsidy levels, to where some producers might not be receiving any subsidies at all (i.e., they actually pay close to their full actuarially fair premium), while others only pay a small fraction of their actuarially fair premium. More importantly, the results show that shrinkage estimators such as the one used by the RMA have the unintended negative consequence of disproportionally subsidizing farmers who are less effective in managing risk. Producers whose farms exhibit higher downside yield variability receive much more generous subsidies than those with lower levels of yield variability.","[Ramirez, Octavio A.] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Carpio, Carlos E.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Collart, Alba J.] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Mississippi State, MS USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Mississippi State University,"Ramirez, OA (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",,,,,,,,16,3,4,0,15,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

Adoption can be contentious because of the assignment of wealth and political influence that accompany the transition to exclusive property rights. This paper studies how the early involvement of harvesters in policy implementation designed to address the commons' inefficiency may foster perceived legitimacy and lessen political opposition to the establishment of individual property rights. We demonstrate that it is optimal for a manager facing industry strife and reform delay to allow firms to self-select into the property rights regime. The strategic interaction of harvesters leads to an equilibrium characterized by the global adoption of property rights. Thus, by providing harvesters with a choice between management systems, policy makers can reduce the transaction costs associated with the need to create political consensus, while ensuring an outcome similar to the top-down implementation of market-based management. Evidence is provided from a recent policy change in Maryland fisheries in which the provision of a choice resulted in the overwhelming adoption of individual transferable quotas and the end of the race to fish.","Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Holzer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",jholzer@umd.edu,"Holzer, Jorge G/A-8128-2015","Holzer, Jorge/0000-0001-8978-3459",,,,,39,4,6,2,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

A formal welfare economics framework is developed to calculate the combined individualistic and distributional impacts of a tax-subsidy. Distributional characteristics of foods targeted by a tax tend to be concentrated in lower-income households. Further, consumption of fruit and vegetables tends to be concentrated in higher-income households; therefore, a subsidy on such foods increases regressivity. Aggregate welfare changes that result from a fiscal food policy are found to range from an increase of 1.41 per cent to a reduction of 2.06 per cent according to whether a subsidy is included, the degree of inequality aversion, and whether substitution among foods is allowed.","[Tiffin, Richard; Salois, Matthew] Univ Reading, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Tiffin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England.",j.r.tiffin@reading.ac.uk,,"Tiffin, Richard/0000-0002-4455-5572",Medical Research Council [G0701865] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0701865] Funding Source: UKRI,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,38,8,9,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

We find that while small grocery/convenience stores show a mitigating effect on adult food insecurity across different samples of households, the effects of large supermarkets/grocery stores and supercenters vary.

The cotton para-statal company (CMDT) has made a virtue out of this recommending diversification for these regions. Following the world price spike in 2010, the Malian government responded with a substantial price increase for cotton in 2011 of 38% to rejuvenate the Malian sector. This article looks at the impact of this price policy in the cotton economy and the potential of new cereal technology and marketing strategy to raise incomes and facilitate the diversification. Given the importance of the marketing decision of selling later after the recovery of cereal prices from the harvest collapse, a discrete stochastic programming model was developed for three-stage decision making. Then, the recent changes in the cotton economy and government fertilizer subsidies were analyzed along with the introduction of the new technology marketing of sorghum. Cotton and maize continue to dominate the economy but the combined sorghum technology marketing increases farmers' incomes by 16% to 21% and eases the return to normal cotton prices, after the 2011 price spike, as well as the removal of the fertilizer subsidies.","[Coulibaly, Jeanne Y.] World Agroforestry Ctr, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Sanders, John H.; Preckel, Paul V.; Baker, Timothy G.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF); Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Coulibaly, JY (通讯作者)，World Agroforestry Ctr, United Nations Ave,POB 30677, Nairobi 00100, Kenya.",J.Coulibaly@cgiar.org,"Preckel, Paul/A-9365-2009","Preckel, Paul/0000-0002-7406-7238",,,,,27,8,12,1,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

This Australian state has seen an unprecedented inflow of investments into the extraction of this previously unexploited unconventional natural gas over the last decade. We analyse census data to study income and employment effects associated with the CSG boom, exploiting the quasi-experimental conditions provided by CSG extraction areas (treatment regions) and regions without this development (control regions). Findings show that treatment regions have higher income growth than control areas during 2001-2011 for families residing locally and for individuals present on census night. Employment in the mining sector also shows higher growth as has non-mining employment in some areas. We include comparisons between CSG areas with no major mining history (the Surat basin) and CSG areas where mining was important before the CSG boom (the Bowen basin), to better understand boom effects in areas with different initial mining industry importance in their economies. Local job multipliers are also analysed for Surat basin CSG areas, where positive impacts (job spillovers) are restricted to construction and professional services jobs, while agricultural jobs have decreased.","[Fleming, David A.; Measham, Thomas G.] CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Fleming, David A.; Measham, Thomas G.] CSIRO Minerals Flagship, Black Mt Labs, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Fleming, DA (通讯作者)，CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",david.fleming@csiro.au,"Measham, Thomas/A-5210-2010; Fleming, David/H-2442-2012","Measham, Thomas/0000-0003-4549-5361; Fleming, David/0000-0003-1070-5381",CSIRO Minerals Down Under Flagship; Gas Industry Social and Environmental Research Alliance (GISERA),CSIRO Minerals Down Under Flagship(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Gas Industry Social and Environmental Research Alliance (GISERA),"The authors wish to thank Andrew Reeson, Jim West and Karin Hosking for helpful comments on earlier versions of this manuscript.

There is a shift in demand pattern, significant changes in the supply chain, greater competition due to opening up of the domestic and external markets and fuller integration with rest of the economy. These developments have impacted traditional agriculture and its institutional underpinning. Latter are being transformed and new institutions are coming into existence. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper discusses the changes in economy and the agricultural sector, explores institutional responses in terms of various producer organizations in the two countries, and examines their adequacy for the coming phase of agricultural development in China and India. Findings - The co-existence of various farmer organizations will sustain for a long period in both China and India. Overall, they have benefitted agriculture producers, and more particularly the surplus generating farmers. However, the incompatibility between these and the vast and growing small farm sector is not disappearing. Next set of institutional reforms should address this critical question of reaching the unreached. Originality/value - China and India are the world's two largest countries in terms of population as well as agricultural population. They share a lot of common features.

The purpose of this paper is to explain why rural residents are increasingly becoming religious, by analysing the inherent relationship between their risks and religious choice, and conducts a preliminary investigation of the common characteristics of rural believers and the determinants of their religious choice. Design/methodology/approach - The authors applied a logit model to test the determinants of rural residents' religious choice. The authors used sample survey data collected in 2008 from the rural area of Songxian County, Henan Province. Findings - The results suggest that age, sex, political status, health risks, and social security have a significant effect on rural residents' religious choice. On this basis, the authors have discussed the inherent logic of disease-related religious practice. From these results, the paper points out that lack of basic public services such as medical care due to the government's withdrawal from these fields has increased the health risks of rural residents, triggering a  revival of religious belief in rural China. Originality/value - This paper has improved on previous research in two ways. First, it analyses the relationship between health risk and religious choice, shedding light on the underlying causes of the religious revival in rural China. Second, the methodology involves an analysis of household survey data, thus filling the gap created by less-rigorous quantitative analysis in rural China-based religious research.","[Jiang, Jinqi] Shenyang Agr Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shenyang 110161, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Fengtian] Renming Univ China, Sch Agr & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Shenyang Agricultural University; Renmin University of China,"Jiang, JQ (通讯作者)，Shenyang Agr Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shenyang 110161, Peoples R China.",jiangjinqi812@163.com,"jiang, jinqi/Q-1800-2016",,,,,,30,1,1,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The following quantitative methods were applied on the regional FADN data (panel data of 100 regions): the Malmquist productivity index, the Welsh two-sample t-test, and the linear regression analysis. The article put emphasis on the investment activity and investment subsidies allocated in the sample of regions. The results reveal that regions with a positive change in the production efficiency have a significantly higher average milk yield, maize yield, long-term debt ratio, income level, and investment activity than the regions with a negative change in the production efficiency. On the contrary, investment subsidies per livestock unit do not significantly differ between the progressive and other regions. Investment subsidies are slightly higher in the regions with a negative change in the production efficiency and continuously help them to mitigate the drop in technical efficiency.","[Spicka, Jindrich; Machek, Ondrej] Univ Econ, Dept Strategy, Fac Business Adm, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Spicka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Winston Churchil Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",spicka.vse@gmail.com,"Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013; Machek, Ondrej/L-4203-2018","Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0001-5699-9544; Machek, Ondrej/0000-0003-3955-7853","internal research project of the University of Economics, Prague [MF/F3/4/2013]","internal research project of the University of Economics, Prague","The support for this paper came from the internal research project of the University of Economics, Prague Measuring the economic efficiency in the agri-food sector using productivity indices, the project No. MF/F3/4/2013.",,27,20,20,0,22,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - Using a system of simultaneous equations in a three-stage least squares model instrumented with carbohydrates, fats, proteins and farm income the authors found generally that the greatest impact on nutrition would be from changes in temperature. Findings - The authors do not find that modest changes in precipitation affect nutrient intake, but extreme events such as drought do. Furthermore, the authors found a strong income effect and this income effect is opposite the heating effect. This may suggest that large swings in nutrient intake brought about by climate change may be countermanded by equivalent increases in income. The authors also found that in terms of general measures of elasticity that market effects, especially in the price of meats, can impact carbohydrate, fat and protein intake as much as global warming. Originality/value - The authors believe that three aspects of this manuscript will make it interesting. First, in the short term, poorer households would be the most vulnerable and sensitive to climate change. However, in the long term, all households in rural China appear able to deal with changing climatic conditions through adaptation. Second, the authors do not find evidences to prove the existence of a poverty nutrition trap in rural China. Third, the results also indicate that, the nutrition intake of households in rural China is more prone to gradual changes, rather than extreme events.","[Zhou, Li] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Turvey, Calum G.] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY USA",Nanjing Agricultural University; Cornell University,"Zhou, L (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",ZHOULI@NJAU.EDU.CN,,,"National Natural Sciences Foundation [71203094]; National Social Science Foundation in China [11ZD155, 10zd031]; W.I.

Preference measurement has in turn opened the door to two area of inquiries: preference heterogeneity as an explanation of fundamental choices concerning savings and investment; and endogenous preference mutations as an explanation for the surprising success or failure of policies and interventions. These new insights and measures allow economics to expand beyond its traditional reliance on variation in prices and incomes as the primary explanators of economic behavior. Drawing on recent work on technology adoption in the face of risk and uncertainty, as well as work on the evolution of hope and aspirations that shape what farmers want, this article articulates frontier issues in agricultural development economics where the tools and perspectives of behavioral economics promise new and important insights.","[Carter, Michael R.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Carter, Michael R.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Carter, Michael R.] Ginanni Fdn, San Jose, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Carter, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Carter, MR (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Carter, MR (通讯作者)，Ginanni Fdn, San Jose, CA USA.",mrcarter@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,41,12,16,2,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

While these models only focus on the central tendency of the response variable, quantile regression provides more detailed insight by modelling different points of the conditional distribution as a function of covariates. Based on data from the German agricultural census, this article contributes to the agricultural economics literature by modelling conditional quantiles of farmland rental rates semi-parametrically using Bayesian geoadditive quantile regression. Our results stress the importance of using semi-parametric regression models, as several covariates influence rental rates in an explicit non-linear way. Moreover, our analysis allows us to uncover potential heterogeneities of the estimated effects across the conditional distribution of rental rates. By explicitly modelling and visually presenting the spatial effects, we also provide additional insight into the spatial structure of German farmland rental rates.","[Maerz, Alexander; Klein, Nadja; Kneib, Thomas; Musshoff, Oliver] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"März, A (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",amaerz@gwdg.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Kneib, Thomas/0000-0003-3390-0972; Klein, Nadja/0000-0002-5072-5347",German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The authors thank two anonymous referees and the editors of the European Review of Agricultural Economics for their helpful comments and suggestions.

The present article assesses the impact of vinery landscape and high-quality wine production on regional tourism flows in Tuscany, an important tourist region in Italy and renowned for its enchanting countryside. Thus, vinery landscape and high-quality wine production have been included as explanatory variables in our model for tourism flows. This model has been estimated for both international and domestic markets for the whole region of Tuscany. Estimation results confirm that land areas devoted to the production of these superb Tuscan wines, in the particular case of Siena including the Brunello di Montalcino, play an important role in explaining international tourism flows. In this context, we estimate climate-change-induced impacts on vinery landscape and quality wines in the tourism sector. These are estimated to cause a loss in the tourism revenues of nearly 15 and 20 million Euros a year, respectively, for 2020 and 2050, for the Tuscany region. Such losses are quite significant, and reiterate the urgency to identify and implement adequate policy options so as to moderate such land use changes, and respective negative welfare impacts.","[Nunes, Paulo A.

The emerging theoretical and empirical literature suggests that trade has an important role in determining firms' heterogeneity: increased openness to trade induces a reallocation effect that increases within-industry efficiency, thereby linking firms' decisions to export and adopt newer (and cleaner) technology. We argue that this framework provides the following empirically-relevant predictions: there is an inverse relationship between firm productivity and pollution emissions per unit output; exporting firms have lower emissions per unit output; and larger firms have a lower emission intensity. To examine these implications empirically, we have assembled a uniquely detailed dataset of the U.S. manufacturing industry for the years 2002, 2005, and 2008 by matching facility-level air emission data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency with the facility's economic characteristics contained in the National Establishment Time Series database. The strategy is to first estimate a facility-level total factor productivity parameter as a plant-specific fixed effect. We then investigate how this estimated productivity parameter correlates with emission intensity on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis. Our empirical findings support the hypotheses suggested by the conceptual model. For each criteria air pollutant considered, we find a significant negative correlation between estimated facility productivity and emission intensity. Conditional on a facility's estimated productivity and other controls, exporting facilities have significantly lower emissions per value of sales than non-exporting facilities in the same industry. We also find that plant size is negatively and significantly related to emission intensity for all pollutants.","[Cui, Jingbo] Wuhan Univ, Inst Adv Study, Econ & Management Sch, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Lapan, Harvey] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Moschini, Giancarlo] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Chair Sci & Technol Policy, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Moschini, Giancarlo] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Wuhan University; Iowa State University; Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Moschini, G (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Chair Sci & Technol Policy, Ames, IA 50011 USA.;Moschini, G (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",moschini@iastate.edu,,,,,,,45,76,85,3,69,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

However, most conservation efforts are incentive-based and voluntary, and neither reward landowners for contiguity nor do they select based on contiguity. Thus, achieving optimal contiguity of conserved parcels is unlikely. Using lab and artefactual field experiments, this paper evaluates two mechanisms in the context of reverse auctions for achieving optimal contiguity: network bonuses and spatial targeting. Results suggest that spatial targeting alone improves the aggregate environmental and social welfare outcomes, while network bonuses alone result in worse outcomes. The interaction of the bonus effect and the targeting effect is positive. If a program was already using a competitive auction environment with bonuses, adding spatial targeting could reduce welfare loss.","[Fooks, Jacob R.; Higgins, Nathaniel; Hellerstein, Daniel; Lynch, Lori] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Ames, IA USA; [Messer, Kent D.; Duke, Joshua M.] Univ Delaware, Newark, DE 19716 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Delaware,"Fooks, JR (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, Ames, IA USA.",jacob.fooks@ers.usda.gov,"Messer, Kent/AAK-8811-2020; Duke, Joshua/ABB-9392-2021","Duke, Joshua/0000-0002-9895-1191",USDA Economic Research Service [58-6000-7-0089],USDA Economic Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"Jacob R.

This study employs a contingent valuation method to estimate French consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for eco-labeled fresh seafood products. We exploit original data from a survey carried out in 2010, where 626 participants responded to a double-bounded dichotomous choice model, through an ascending or descending bid system. Controlling for shift and anchoring effects in random effect probit models, we significantly improve estimation of WTP and its determinants for the three species studied (monkfish, lobster, sole), in particular when using heterogeneous anchoring. We show that WTP is positively correlated to respondents' income, and also to their environmental concern, to living alone, to living far from the coast, and to trusting NGOs or public institutions more than producer organizations to implement an eco-label. We also show that the mean price premiums do not differ between species. Finally, on average, the maximum premium consumers accepted to pay is approximately 10% of the product price.","[Salladarre, Frederic] IUT Univ Rennes 1, CREM CNRS, LEMNA, Campus Beaulieu,Ave Gen Leclerc,CS,44202, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Brecard, Dorothee] Univ Toulon & Var, LEAD, Campus Porte Italie,70 Ave Roger Devoucoux, F-83000 Toulon, France; [Lucas, Sterenn] Agrocampus Ouest, Ctr Rennes, UMR SMART Lereco, Pole Halieut, 65 Rue St Brieuc,CS,84215, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Salladarre, Frederic; Ollivier, Pierrick] Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Inst Econ & Management Nantes IAE, Chemin Cens Tertre,BP 52231, F-44322 Nantes 3, France",Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulon; Universite de Rennes; Institut Agro; Agrocampus Ouest; Nantes Universite,"Salladarré, F (通讯作者)，IUT Univ Rennes 1, CREM CNRS, LEMNA, Campus Beaulieu,Ave Gen Leclerc,CS,44202, F-35042 Rennes, France.;Salladarré, F (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Inst Econ & Management Nantes IAE, Chemin Cens Tertre,BP 52231, F-44322 Nantes 3, France.",frederic.salladarre@univ-rennes1.fr,"Brécard, Dorothée/HJO-8652-2023","Brecard, Dorothee/0000-0002-0715-0234; Lucas, Sterenn/0000-0002-9492-8330",,,,,72,32,34,2,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The study finds that higher land slope and higher variance of rain, as transaction-cost-increasing natural effects, lead to smaller hazelnut land holdings. High slope and weather variation can increase the costs of monitoring the laborers, make moving inputs or output up and down harder, limit the use of machinery, and reduce contractual performance of labor contracts. For farm production functions, land is a complex input with measurable interactions with nature. Contrary to common production theory approaches that take natural properties of land as given, the study develops a production function that incorporates natural properties, such as, slope and rain variance. The study utilizes two separate data sets for the estimations. The first data set explores the characteristics of hazelnut farmers, while the second one analyzes the regional characteristics of hazelnut farms.","[Demir, Ibrahim] Univ S Carolina, Dept Hlth Serv Policy Res & Management, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Demir, I (通讯作者)，Univ S Carolina, Dept Hlth Serv Policy Res & Management, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",demiri@mailbox.sc.edu,"Demir, Ibrahim/S-4902-2018",,,,,,56,9,9,2,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The research was conducted by measuring the electrical activity of the brain through the electroencephalography (EEG) and the software platform for analysing facial expressions. The research objective was the recognition of consumer emotions during the tasting of eight kinds of blank samples of wine. Using the interdisciplinary research, we identified facial expressions (happiness, sadness, disgust, neutral emotions, anger and surprise) that were captured immediately after tasting each type of test wines and the electrical activity in the brain based on which we have identified the valence of consumers. The achieved results confirm that neuro-marketing can be a useful tool that will help manufacturers and sellers to off er products that truly and not only in appearance satisfy customers.

Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, two alternative preference uncertainty treatment approaches are proposed to estimate consumers' WTP theoretically and they are applied to China's WSS improvement program from a payment card method, which depends on how consumers' certainty level about their valuation is. Furthermore, four regression models are presented to investigate the determinants of consumers' WTP. Findings - Theoretically, the alternative approaches that proposed in this research can remove overestimation bias from traditional CVM method but with lower estimation efficiency. In addition, the empirical results of the uncertainty adjusted models show that the expected WTP to improve drinking WSS is from 0.55 to 0.56 Renminbi yuan/ton, which are lower than the estimates from the conventional standard CVM models. Consumers' preferences for their concerns about WSS, attitudes toward WSS improvement programs, trusts in implement authorities and their knowledge of WSS have significant effects on the WTP for improving drinking WSS and on respondents' uncertainty too. Originality/value - Theoretically to the authors' knowledge, it is the first attempt to compare alternative approaches to treat respondent uncertainty using numerical certainty scale combined with payment card format valuation questions in CVM. Empirically it is the first study at this large scale that investigates consumers' WTP for improving drinking WSS incorporating with respondent uncertainty in China. In addition, to assess consumer preferences for improved drinking water safety and the sources of uncertainty, information on consumers' attitudes toward WSS are considered at the first time.","[Wang, Jia] Suzhou Inst Ind Technol, Econ Trade & Management Dept, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Ge, Jiaoju] Harbin Inst Technol Shenzhen, Sch Econ & Management, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Ge, JJ (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol Shenzhen, Sch Econ & Management, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",jiaoge@hitsz.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71402039],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors would like to thank the editors and the anonymous reviewers at first.

Some market intermediaries have responded by requiring that their suppliers abide by restrictive production practices. We examine the economic effects of such restrictions and apply this analysis to limitations on the use of antibiotics in U.S. pork production. Results from conceptual and simulation analyses show that, in the absence of demand growth, less pork is sold due to higher costs in the restricted segment, and both pork consumers (on average) and producers are harmed. Demand growth of between 6-11% from adding new consumers who will consume the restricted (antibiotic-free) product but not the conventional product is needed to return consumer surplus to the level in the base case, and between 2-4% demand growth was required to return producer surplus to base. When restricted and conventional products are modeled using a vertical differentiation framework, results depend importantly on the ease with which consumers can switch to a seller who offers their desired product type. Significant distributional impacts among consumers are present when switching costs are prohibitive.","[Saitone, Tina L.; Sexton, Richard J.; Sumner, Daniel A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Sexton, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rich@primal.ucdavis.edu,"Sumner, Dawn Y/E-8744-2011",,,,,,38,36,42,0,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The multi-dimensionality of the problem follows from two decision makers having four possible choices in each period: the farm operator and spouse can be working fully on the farm or having supplementary outside occupation. Transitions are modelled by five logit models. The most flexible model has a high number of parameters. Overall, the results indicate that transitions have mainly been directed towards the state where both partners work off the farm. An increasing livestock reduces the probability of moving to states with substantial off-farm labour participation. Increasing farm size tends to have the opposite effect. Recent on-farm investments come out with ambiguous effects. Having children seems to motivate operators to withdraw from off-farm labour and spouses to stay in or enter off-farm employment.","[Biorn, Erik] Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Bjornsen, Hild-Marte] Norwegian Agr Econ Res Inst, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Biorn, E (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",erik.biorn@econ.uio.no,,,,,,,21,4,4,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

Although the best-worst scaling technique has been widely used in many fields, the literature has largely overlooked the phenomenon of consumers' adoption of processing strategies while making their best-worst choices. We examine this issue in the context of consumers' trust in institutions to provide information about a new food technology, nanotechnology, and its use in food processing. Our results show that approximately half of the consumers used position as a schematic cue when making choices. We find the position bias was particularly strong when consumers chose their most trustworthy institution compared to their least trustworthy institution. In light of our findings, we recommend that researchers in the field be aware of the possibility of position bias when designing best-worst scaling surveys. We also encourage researchers who have already collected best-worst data to investigate whether their data shows such heuristics.","[Campbell, Danny; Erdem, Seda] Univ Stirling, Econ Div, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Campbell, D (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Econ Div, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",danny.campbell@stir.ac.uk,"Erdem, Seda/B-7225-2014; Campbell, Danny/E-1873-2011","Campbell, Danny/0000-0001-7467-2318",Rural Economy and Land Use Programme of the UK Research Councils [RES-229-31-0003]; Department of Economics at the University of Manchester,Rural Economy and Land Use Programme of the UK Research Councils; Department of Economics at the University of Manchester,"Danny Campbell and Seda Erdem are academic staff in the Economics Division, Stirling Management School, University of Stirling, UK.

To ensure a long-term flow of ecosystem services without compromising agricultural activities, restoring the environment requires a balance between public and private benefits and costs. Information about private benefits generated by environmental assets can be utilized to identify conservation opportunities on private lands, evaluate environmental projects, and design effective policy instruments. We use a spatio-temporal hedonic model to estimate the private benefits of native vegetation on rural properties in the state of Victoria, Australia. Specifically, we estimate the marginal value of native vegetation on private land and examine how it varies with the extent of vegetation on a property and across a range of property types and sizes. Private benefits of native vegetation are greater per unit area on small and medium-sized properties and smaller on large production-oriented farms. Native vegetation exhibits diminishing marginal benefits as its proportion of a property increases. The current extent of native vegetation cover is lower than the extent that would maximize the amenity value to many landowners. There is scope for improved targeting of investment in the study region by incorporating private benefits of environmental projects into environmental planning processes. Landowners with high marginal private benefits from revegetation would be more willing to participate in a revegetation program. Targeting these landowners would likely provide higher value for money because such projects could be implemented at lower public cost.","[Polyakov, Maksym; Pannell, David J.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Pandit, Ram] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia; [Tapsuwan, Sorada] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org CSIRO Ecosyst Sci, Wembley, WA, Australia; [Park, Geoff] Nat Decis Pty Ltd, Newstead, Vic, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Polyakov, M (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia.",maksym.polyakov@uwa.edu.au,"Pannell, David/B-4476-2008; Tapsuwan, Sorada/G-5869-2010; Polyakov, Maksym/G-1523-2010","Pannell, David/0000-0001-5420-9908; Polyakov, Maksym/0000-0002-0193-6658; Tapsuwan, Sorada/0000-0002-8160-3828; Pandit, Ram/0000-0003-4053-5694",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions; Australian National Environmental Research Program's Environmental Decisions Hub; CSIRO Water for Healthy Country Flagship,Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions(Australian Research Council); Australian National Environmental Research Program's Environmental Decisions Hub; CSIRO Water for Healthy Country Flagship,"Maksym Polyakov is a research assistant professor and David J.

Analysis indicates that much of Sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing major changes in farm land ownership patterns. Among all farms below 100 hectares in size, the share of land on small-scale holdings under five hectares has declined except in Kenya. Medium-scale farms (defined here as farm holdings between 5 and 100 hectares) account for a rising share of total farmland, especially in the 10-100 hectare range where the number of these farms is growing especially rapidly. Medium-scale farms control roughly 20% of total farmland in Kenya, 32% in Ghana, 39% in Tanzania, and over 50% in Zambia. The numbers of such farms are also growing very rapidly, except in Kenya. We also conducted detailed life history surveys of medium-scale farmers in each of these four countries and found that the rapid rise of medium-scale holdings in most cases reflects increased interest in land by urban-based professionals or influential rural people. About half of these farmers obtained their land later in life, financed by nonfarm income. The rise of medium-scale farms is affecting the region in diverse ways that are difficult to generalize. Many such farms are a source of dynamism, technical change, and commercialization of African agriculture. However, medium-scale land acquisitions may exacerbate land scarcity in rural areas and constrain the rate of growth in the number of small-scale farm holdings. Medium-scale farmers tend to dominate farm lobby groups and influence agricultural policies and public expenditures to agriculture in their favor. Nationally representative Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from six countries (Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zambia) show that urban households own 5-35% of total agricultural land and that this share is rising in all countries where DHS surveys were repeated. This suggests a new and hitherto unrecognized channel by which medium-scale farmers may be altering the strength and location of agricultural growth and employment multipliers between rural and urban areas. Given current trends, medium-scale farms are likely to soon become the dominant scale of farming in many African countries.","[Jayne, T.

In particular, pest resistance build-up and secondary pest outbreaks have caused concern regarding the sustainability of this benefit. This paper analyses the effects and impact dynamics of Bt cotton adoption in China. Using six unique waves of panel data collected between 1999 and 2007, we show that the benefits of Bt cotton continue 10years after it has been commercialised, albeit with evidence of a decline in the benefit since the early adoption period. Importantly, we also show that the benefit has been shared by both Bt and non-Bt cotton adopters.","[Qiao, Fangbin] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jikun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resource Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jikun] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Caiping] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China","Central University of Finance & Economics; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Peking University; Central University of Finance & Economics","Qiao, FB (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China.",fangbin.qiao@gmail.com,"Zhang, Caiping/AAQ-5944-2020",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273290, 71333013]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors acknowledge the financial support of this study from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71273290 and 71333013).,,26,10,11,0,50,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

This study surveyed all households in Kuangjiaqiao Village, Changde, Hunan Province, China over a four-year period, from 2007 to 2010. Using basic regression models for cross-sectional analysis and advanced models to consider lag effects, this study identifies the dominant factors influencing farmers' crop insurance decisions. Results indicate farmers developed a dynamic adaptive process toward the new crop insurance. Farmers initially made relatively arbitrary decisions that were significantly influenced by community insistence or pressure to conform. Then, farmers gradually established more rational decision-making mechanisms in which yield volatility, education, and engagement experience became statistically significant. The focus on the initial stages of the crop insurance program from this study helps improve our understanding of the demands within this rapidly growing market in China.","[Wang, Ming; Ye, Tao; Shi, Peijun] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resources Ecol, Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management, 19 XinJieKouWai Ave, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Ye, T (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resources Ecol, Acad Disaster Reduct & Emergency Management, 19 XinJieKouWai Ave, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",wangming@bnu.edu.cn; yetao@bnu.edu.cn; spj@bnu.edu.cn,,"Shi, Peijun/0000-0002-2968-7331",China 973 project [2012CB955404]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41321001],China 973 project(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Financial support from the China 973 project (2012CB955404) and National Natural Science Foundation of China project (41321001) are greatly appreciated.

Two major consequences of these reforms were declining fertiliser marketing margins and distances between farmers and fertiliser dealers. We quantify the effects of these changes on commercial fertiliser use and maize production in Kenya by estimating fertiliser demand and maize supply response functions using nationwide household survey data. Our results indicate that between 1997 and 2010, the estimated 27% reduction in real fertiliser prices that can be attributed to falling marketing margins associated with market reforms led to a 36% increase in nitrogen use on maize fields and a 9% increase in maize production resulting from both yield and acreage effects. On the other hand, decreasing distances to fertiliser retailers from the perspective of a given household did not appear to raise fertiliser use or maize supply, although a comparison across households using average distances over the panel indicate that those closer to retailers do apply more fertiliser on their maize fields.","[Sheahan, Megan] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Ariga, Joshua] Int Fertiliser Dev Ctr, Off Programs, Muscle Shoals, AL 35661 USA; [Jayne, T.

We consider three types of world commodity price indices, each containing different commodities and weighting criteria. Results reveal a long-run relationship between world agricultural commodity and consumer food prices in over half of the member states. Consumer prices in different member states and categories of member states respond differently to specific world price indices, suggesting that there are disparities in the structure and the efficiency of their food markets. The eurozone founders generally have lower transmission elasticities. This should be taken into account when predicting the impacts of extreme world price volatility and consumer food price rises, prompting governments to pay attention to the most vulnerable households.","[Garcia-German, Sol; Bardaji, Isabel; Garrido, Alberto] Tech Univ Madrid, Res Ctr Management Agr & Environm Risks, Madrid 28040, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"García-Germán, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Madrid, Res Ctr Management Agr & Environm Risks, Madrid 28040, Spain.",sol.garciagerman@upm.es,"BARDAJI, ISABEL/AAS-3286-2020","GARCIA-GERMAN, SOL/0000-0002-0392-1695","ULYSSES project, EU 7th Framework Programme [312182 KBBE.2012.1.4-05]","ULYSSES project, EU 7th Framework Programme","This publication has been funded under the ULYSSES project, EU 7th Framework Programme, Project 312182 KBBE.2012.1.4-05.

Responding to the economic crisis, the companies cut off investments, wages and reduced personnel. However, the companies have to adapt their business strategies to cope with the crisis. This paper conducts a strategic assessment of the Greek agricultural cooperatives during the first half of 2013 using in-depth interviews with cooperative executives in order to illustrate how they have responded to the crisis and also to investigate their strategic options for the upcoming period. The results of the analysis show that agricultural cooperatives have chosen the retrenchment and cost-cutting strategies by restraining their activities while they appear eager to export their production. In addition, the cash shortage forced them to count exclusively on their members to finance any new economic activity. According to the cooperatives' executives, their adaption strategies exclude abandoning the activities and selling the equipment and their real estate properties, while they involve exports, the experienced personnel and marketing investments. These results could provide helpful directions not only for the agricultural cooperatives' management boards but also for the food industry businesses operating under a severe economic situation such as the present Greek economic crisis.","[Kontogeorgos, Achilleas] Univ Patras, Dept Business Adm Food & Agr Enterprises, G Seferi 2,PO 30100, Agrinion, Greece; [Chatzitheodoridis, Fotios; Loizou, Efstratios] Technol Educ Inst Western Macedonia, Div Agr Econ, Dept Agr Technol, Florina, Greece",University of Patras,"Kontogeorgos, A (通讯作者)，Univ Patras, Dept Business Adm Food & Agr Enterprises, G Seferi 2,PO 30100, Agrinion, Greece.",akontoge@upatras.gr,"Loizou, Efstratios/CAC-9240-2022; Loizou, Efstratios/S-4313-2019; Chatzitheodoridis, Fotios/E-3450-2017; Loizou, Efstratios/AAJ-9792-2021","Loizou, Efstratios/0000-0002-9779-0226; Chatzitheodoridis, Fotios/0000-0003-2008-1023; Loizou, Efstratios/0000-0002-9779-0226; Kontogeorgos, Achilleas/0000-0002-4186-0379",,,,,36,10,11,0,23,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

We conduct the first study drawing upon appropriate statistical methods to examine the presence of publication bias in the health economics literature measuring health inequalities of self-reported health. We test for other biases including the effect of precision estimates based on meta-regression analysis (MRA). We account for a set of biases in estimates of income-related health inequalities that rely on concentration index-related methods and self-reported health measures.

LML techniques overcome the most relevant limitations associated to mainstream parametric stochastic and nonparametric frontier models. LML allows deriving farm-level frontier parameter estimates. The relevance of using localized estimates is evidenced by the observed heterogeneity in production technologies. Technical efficiency scores derived from the LML approach [0.905] are higher than those of the DEA model under CRS [0.808] and SFA [0.804] and close to DEA-VRS [0.917] ratings.

This approach is shown to be more robust and avoids the simplifying assumptions embedded in cost-of-carry valuation which fully accounts for the non-negativity constraint on inventory. Unlike the cost-of-carry approach, the options-based approach does not treat the convenience yield as an exogenous factor. This offers a more natural measure of implied convenience yields in commodity trading strategies. We test the relationship between convenience yields and inventory levels for a number of liquidly traded base metals using both methods. Our results show that the relationship between convenience yields and inventory levels is strongly defined under the options-based approach in line with market beliefs. This result is consistent with other studies that have used the options-based approach in other nonmetals commodity markets.","[Omura, Akihiro] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Griffith Business Sch, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [West, Jason] Bond Univ, Fac Business, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Bond University,"Omura, A (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Griffith Business Sch, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",akihiro.omura@griffithuni.edu.au,,"West, Jason/0000-0003-3271-3155",,,,,35,10,10,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

A major problem that can hinder the effectiveness of no-take reserves is the incidence of illegal fishing, which has created significant ecological and economic losses in global fisheries. We construct a bioeconomic model to explore the connection between the effects of no-take reserves and illegal fishing activities in relation to the level of regulatory control of illegal activities in the reserve and fished areas. Our parameterised model shows that the effects of no-take reserves on both the extent of illegal fishing and the fish biomass critically depend on illegal fishing regulations and the scale and patterns of fish dispersal. In a fishery where illegal fishing can only be partially controlled, increasing the size of the no-take reserve may result in a lose-lose situation in which the level of illegal fishing effort increases and the total biomass decreases. Our results further show that when the pattern of fish dispersal is density dependent, imposing a stricter control on illegal fishing in either reserves or fished areas increases the aggregate level of illegal fishing.","[Yamazaki, Satoshi; Hoshino, Eriko] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Hoshino, Eriko] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Resosudarmo, Budy P.] Australian Natl Univ, Indonesia Project, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Resosudarmo, Budy P.] Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; Australian National University; Australian National University,"Yamazaki, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",satoshi.yamazaki@utas.edu.au,"Yamazaki, Satoshi/J-7538-2014; Resosudarmo, Budy/K-1129-2017; Hoshino, Eriko/N-7557-2013","Yamazaki, Satoshi/0000-0003-1279-2706; Resosudarmo, Budy/0000-0003-2273-9765; Hoshino, Eriko/0000-0001-7110-4251",University of Tasmania,University of Tasmania,"The authors would like to acknowledge the University of Tasmania for funding support for this study.

Local extensionists have encouraged technological innovation as a means of improving farmers' livelihoods, and this has led to increasing input use and an intensification of agricultural production. This paper applies contrasting quantitative and qualitative methodologies to analyse the effects of such changes at the level of the overall economy of Lebanon and also to explore the impacts on rural households. A computable general equilibrium (CGE) model simulates shocks in which agricultural output increases due to different types of intensification. The results are contrasted at local level through the use of qualitative case study analysis carried out in the Hermel district of northeast Lebanon. Quantitative simulations indicate that, while agricultural intensification has a positive effect overall on the Lebanese economy, the effects on rural households and the income of farmers are negative. The case-study interviews demonstrate that, at local level, agricultural trade liberalisation, increased agricultural output and greater volatility of commodity prices have resulted in farmers opting for lower input use and more secure market forms of production.","[Hamade, Kanj] Lebanese Univers, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agron & Vet Sci, Greater Beirut, Lebanon; [Malorgio, Giulio] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Midmore, Peter] Aberystwyth Univ, Sch Business & Management, Aberystwyth SY23 3AL, Dyfed, Wales",University of Bologna; Aberystwyth University,"Midmore, P (通讯作者)，Aberystwyth Univ, Sch Business & Management, Aberystwyth SY23 3AL, Dyfed, Wales.",pxm@aber.ac.uk,,,,,,,56,2,2,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Analysing price dynamics before and after periods of promotional discounting results show post-sale prices are typically lower than pre-sale prices, contrary to the disguise hypothesis. We do, however, find evidence of exaggeration of the discount, which may potentially explain why prices fall after discounts, although the evidence is not sufficiently widespread for this to be the sole cause. Results parallel the competition authority's view of supermarket promotions and point to the useful contribution that retail price microdata might play in keeping prices in check in countries where highly concentrated retail sectors raise similar concerns.","[Lan, Hao] Univ E Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Lan, Hao] Univ E Anglia, Ctr Competit Policy, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Lloyd, Tim; Morgan, C.

Economic and social-cultural heterogeneity have, however, long been documented as detrimental to collective capacity to provide public goods. In particular, women are often underrepresented in local leadership and decision-making processes, as are young adults and minority ethnic groups. While democratic principles dictate that broad civic engagement by women and other groups could improve the efficiency and effectiveness of local governance and increase public goods provision, the empirical evidence on these hypotheses is scant. This article develops a theoretical model highlighting the complexity of constructing a fair schedule of individual contributions, given heterogeneity in costs and benefits that accrue to people depending, for instance, on their gender, age, ethnicity, and education. The model demonstrates that representative leadership and broad participation in community organizations can mitigate the negative impacts of heterogeneity on collective capacity to provide public goods. Nationally representative household survey data from Malawi, combined with geospatial and administrative information, are used to test this hypothesis and to estimate the relationship between collective capacity for public good provision and community median estimates of maize yields and household consumption expenditures per capita. The analysis shows that similarities between the leadership and the general population in terms of gender and age, and active participation by women and young adult in community groups, alleviate the negative effects of heterogeneity and increase collective capacity, which in turn improves agriculture productivity and welfare.","[McCarthy, Nancy] LEAD Analyt Inc, Washington, DC 20008 USA; [Kilic, Talip] World Bank, Living Stand Measurement Study Surveys & Methods, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"McCarthy, N (通讯作者)，LEAD Analyt Inc, 5136 Nebraska Ave NW, Washington, DC 20008 USA.",nmccarthy@leadanalyticsinc.com,,"Kilic, Talip/0000-0002-3642-3123",,,,,51,18,24,0,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

An Analysis at Regional and Global Scales,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Biodiversity; computable general equilibrium; EU agricultural policy; regional intensification,LAND-USE; EMISSIONS,"This paper analyses the effects of introducing biodiversity-targeted ecological focus area (EFA) requirements on all farms with arable land in the EU by quantifying their global, regional, economic and environmental impacts in a mutually consistent way. To capture these impacts, different spatial scales need to be considered - ranging from on-farm decisions regarding the EFA in the EU, to supply response around the world. In order to address this challenge, we combine the supply side of the CAPRI model, which offers high spatial, farm and policy resolution in the EU, with the GTAP model of global trade and land use. Both models are linked through a multi-product, restricted-revenue function for the EU crop sector. The results predict improved environmental status in the high-yielding regions of the EU. However, output price increases lead to intensification in the more marginal areas of the EU where little or no additional land is taken out of production. The decrease in arable land in the EU is partially compensated by an increase of crop land, as well as increased fertiliser applications, in other regions of the globe. Thus, the improvement of environmental status in the EU comes at the price of global intensification, as well as the loss of forest and grassland areas outside the EU. Overall, we find that every hectare of land that is taken out of production in the EU increases greenhouse gas emissions in the rest of the world by 20.8tonnes CO2 equivalent.","[Pelikan, Janine] Thunen Inst Market Anal, Braunschweig, Germany; [Britz, Wolfgang] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Bonn, Germany; [Hertel, Thomas W.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Ctr Global Trade Anal, Purdue, IN USA",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; University of Bonn; Purdue University System; Purdue University,"Pelikan, J (通讯作者)，Thunen Inst Market Anal, Braunschweig, Germany.",janine.pelikan@ti.bund.de,"Britz, Wolfgang/I-3046-2014","Britz, Wolfgang/0000-0002-8532-3823; Pelikan, Janine/0009-0009-6957-1200",,,,,23,20,20,2,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

This has been a welcome development, as it is an efficient way of securing water for the environment in the basin. However, the question of how to best manage water holdings held by the government is as yet unresolved. In particular, the question of whether and how should the CEWH engage in water markets is still grappling the government and academia alike. This paper addresses that question by evaluating total benefits to a range of water users, including the environment, under a variety of hydro-climatic conditions. This is approached through running simulations based on environmental benefit function that varies with prevailing hydro-climatic conditions. The findings indicate that the benefits are greater when CEWH actively participates in annual water allocation market and that such participation enables the CEWH to secure most water when it is needed the most by the environment. This suggests that policy should encourage the CEWH to further explore opportunities to engage with the water markets to the benefit of communities and the environment in the MDB.","Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Ancev, T (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",tiho.ancev@sydney.edu.au,,"Ancev, Tihomir/0000-0002-3521-7782",,,,,27,15,15,1,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Findings - In China, there is a need for better tools for targeting the poor or malnourished. In India, more effective state-level policies should be better understood by the central government and disseminated to less successful states.

It is thus generally beneficial, at the landscape scale, to apply eradication or containment controls early if not immediately upon discovery. However, an individual property owner only has incentives to consider the costs and benefits of control on his/her own property rather than potential landscape-scale damages. Bioinvasions will therefore generally be under-controlled in a landscape of independent owners operating under a laissez-faire system. A mechanism is thus needed to induce early cooperative contributions to control costs from beneficiaries who would, without them, be invaded later. We develop a spatially-explicit, integrated model of invasion spread and human behavior to examine how different degrees of spatial cooperation affect patterns of invasion spread and the total costs and damages imposed. We compare individual laissez-faire, cooperative control by adjacent neighbors, and cooperative control by groups including more distant but nearby neighbors. As expected, private laissez-faire control decisions tend to under-control the invasion relative to socially optimal control under most circumstances. But a reasonably high fraction of first best payoffs can be achieved with only a modest geographical reach of cooperation. We also find that less extensive cooperation is needed to control invasions whose costs and damages otherwise lead to the largest externalities (circumstances with costs that are relatively low compared with damages). This suggests that even small amounts of cooperation to control bioinvasions can provide large social benefits.","[Wilen, James E.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,,epanchin-niell@rff.org,,"Epanchin-Niell, Rebecca/0000-0002-1454-5453",National Science Foundation [NSF DGE 0114432]; USDA's Program of Research on the Economics of Invasive Species [58-7000-7-0088],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); USDA's Program of Research on the Economics of Invasive Species,"Rebecca S.

We present a forest planning optimisation model where land use is governed by forest owners maximising the returns to both timber harvest and carbon sequestration. By varying carbon prices, we model efficient trade-offs between the two forest activities along a modified production possibility frontier for four distinct wood supply regions in New Zealand. Results show that while more productive regions such as the Central North Island (CNI) and Northland have a greater capacity as a carbon sink, it is the less productive regions that have a comparative advantage in carbon sequestration in terms of a lower cost of wood production revenue foregone. However, moderate increases in carbon uptake can be achieved in the CNI at low opportunity cost by subtle changes in forestry management. The implication for policy-makers is that initial increases in carbon sequestration will be achieved at the lowest cost to society by favouring high volume timber production in some productive woodland areas and/or by more carbon farming in less productive areas.","[Hale, Todd; Kahui, Viktoria; Farhat, Daniel] Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Hale, T (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin, New Zealand.",viktoria.kahui@otago.ac.nz,,"Farhat, Daniel/0000-0003-3402-8442",,,,,40,7,7,1,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The finding helps to identify the importance of China soybean futures in the perspective of portfolio selection for international futures traders. If China soybean futures market is no longer a price taker after the subprime crisis, traders need to include it as a separate category in their portfolio. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity-generalized error distribution (EGARCH-GED) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity-generalized error distribution (GARCH-GED) models to test spillover effects between Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) and Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) soybean futures. The authors divide daily samples into three subperiods based on the subprime crisis. Three research questions -whether China is still the price taker, the importance of Chinese soybean futures in international futures portfolio selection, and the influences of subprime crisis on soybean futures volatility relationship -are examined by comparing estimation results through time and different contracts. Findings - The spillover effect from CBOT soybean futures to DCE No. 1 soybean futures becomes weaker through time. China is no longer a soybean futures price taker after the subprime crisis. The authors also find the shocks of bearish news on DCE soybeans are greater than those of bullish news. Potential volatility of DCE in long positions is bigger than that in short positions. Practical implications - China is the largest soybean importer. DCE is a very important futures market for non-genetically modified soybeans. It is necessary for both international and domestic futures traders to understand the changes in international soybean futures price relationship and take corresponding strategies. It is also important for market to realize that DCE soybean futures are to a less degree price taker after the subprime crisis. Originality/value - The paper applies EGARCH-GED and GARCH-GED models to identify changes in spillover effects before, during, and after the subprime crisis. Different from other studies, this paper finds after the subprime crisis, China is no longer the soybean futures price taker. This paper also compares the spillover effects of non-genetically modified soybean futures (No. 1 soybean futures) with genetically modified soybean futures (No. 2 soybean futures).","[Liu, Bruce Jianhe; Wu, Xin] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yubin] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jingjing] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Zhang, Shu] Ind & Commercial Bank China, Jinhua Branch, Jinhua, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; China Agricultural University; University of New Mexico; Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC),"Wang, YB (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",wyb@cau.edu.cn,"wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022; WANG, JINGYI/GSJ-1241-2022","Wang, Jingjing/0000-0001-7589-0368","Chinese National Funds of Social Science [11BJY033, 12CJY022]; Ministry of Agriculture - Chinese Statistics of Agricultural Industrialization Development [NCF20144047]; Zhejiang colleges' creative team project of industrial development and public financial policy research [CCJFH104]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LY14G030013]; CSC funds [201208110234, 201208330282]",Chinese National Funds of Social Science; Ministry of Agriculture - Chinese Statistics of Agricultural Industrialization Development; Zhejiang colleges' creative team project of industrial development and public financial policy research; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); CSC funds,"This paper is sponsored by Chinese National Funds of Social Science (11BJY033 and 12CJY022), the Ministry of Agriculture - Chinese Statistics of Agricultural Industrialization Development (NCF20144047).

Outcomes of these processes are therefore a function of the risk preferences of various stakeholders. Our objective is to investigate the risk preferences regarding plants with novel traits among the lay public and regulatory professionals. We investigate how framing and perceptions affect risk preferences. In particular, we test how the concept of provenance, for example, whether technology is being provided by a public university versus a multinational corporation, might affect respondents' risk choices. We conducted a modified Asian disease experiment to test for Tversky and Kahneman's (1981) prospect theory, adapting the choice task to the context of new technology in agriculture. We found that framing manipulations yielded different results for both experts and laypersons: positive framing induced risk aversion more so than negative framing induced risk seeking. While framing has a strong impact on all respondents, the provenance effect is weak and inconsistent across results.","[Lubieniechi, Simona; Hesseln, Hayley; Smyth, Stuart] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada; [Phillips, Peter] Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, 101 Diefenbaker Pl, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5B8, Canada",University of Saskatchewan; University of Saskatchewan,"Smyth, S (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 51 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada.",simona.lub@usask.ca; hayley.hesseln@usask.ca; peter.phillips@usask.ca; stuart.smyth@usask.ca,,,,,,,70,3,3,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Government policy significantly influences demand for native seed and prioritizes use of native plants to improve reclamation success. However, existing native seed supplies are inadequate for current reclamation needs. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) seeks to implement policies that will increase the quantities supplied. We conduct laboratory market experiments to analyze the effect of different policies BLM might implement on price, quantity traded, and earnings, especially in light of BLM's role in the market as largest buyer. Four treatments are examined, combiningforward (production-to-demand) or spot (advance production) delivery and constant (seller unit earnings are constant and known) or variable demand (seller unit earnings randomly adjusted without notice) under big buyer influence (four sellers, two small buyers, one big buyer). A fifth competitive treatment (four sellers, four buyers) with forward contracting and constant demand provides a benchmark by which to gauge big buyer effects on market outcomes. Results provide evidence that adoption of forward contracting or reduction in BLM's demand variability would increase seller earnings and native seed production.","[Mock, Betsy; Hansen, Kristiana; Coupal, Roger; Menkhaus, Dale] Univ Wyoming, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 1000 East Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",University of Wyoming,"Hansen, K (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 1000 East Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",kipero7@gmail.com; kristi.hansen@uwyo.edu; coupal@uwyo.edu; menkhaus@uwyo.edu,,,Wyoming Reclamation and Restoration Center,Wyoming Reclamation and Restoration Center,"The authors would like to thank Zak Griffith for technical support; native grass seed producers in the Big Horn Basin of Wyoming for their time and input; and Chris Bastian, Amy Nagler, Tanya Skurski, Pete Stahl, participants at the 2014 Western Agricultural Economics Association Annual Meeting, and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

Building on a recent World Bank flagship report, this article introduces a concise framework for describing the main benefits from new information and communication technologies. They promote greater inclusion in the broader economy, raise efficiency by complementing other production factors, and foster innovation by dramatically reducing transaction costs. The article reviews the recent literature on corresponding technology impacts in the rural sector in developing countries. Digital technologies overcome information problems that hinder market access for many small-scale farmers, increase knowledge through new ways of providing extension services, and they provide novel ways for improving agricultural supply chain management. While there are many promising examples of positive impacts on rural livelihoods-or digital dividends-these have often not scaled up to the extent expected. The main reason is that technology can always only address some, but not all of the barriers faced by farmers in poorer countries.","[Deichmann, Uwe] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Goyal, Aparajita] World Bank, Africa Reg Poverty Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Mishra, Deepak] World Bank, South Asia Reg Macroecon & Fiscal Management Glob, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank; The World Bank; The World Bank,"Deichmann, U (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",udeichmann@worldbank.org,,,World Bank's Knowledge for Change Program,World Bank's Knowledge for Change Program,"We are grateful to Jenny Aker, Andrew Dabalen, Pablo Fajnzylber, Hans Hoogeveen, Will Martin, Pierella Paci, Eija Pehu, Parmesh Shah, and Maximo Torero for useful comments.

Securing nutrient loads with a higher level of resilience is costly, with marginal costs of resilience generally declining with lower loads. We find that the main trade-off dimension is between cost of conservation investments and ecosystem service objectives, as opposed to pronounced mean-variance or between-nutrient objectives trade-offs.

Stringent limits on the area of cropland that individuals may own means that farmers need a well-functioning rental market to consolidate land parcels, grow their farm enterprises, adopt new technology and increase incomes. This research investigates the efficiency and equity impacts of the rental market in rural Vietnam and attempts to identify transaction costs impeding the market. A generalised ordered logit model with shifting thresholds allowing transaction costs to impact lessors and lessees differently was specified and estimated using data extracted from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Surveys. The findings show that rental transactions reduced imbalances in factor endowments, transferring cropland to households that were relatively land-poor but more willing and able to farm. However, the market is constrained by transaction costs that affect lessors and lessees differently. It is recommended that government should complete its land registration program and relax restrictions on the use of wetlands to grow crops other than rice. It should also improve access to all-weather roads as this encourages participation on both sides of the rental market, whereas better access to communications infrastructure was found to promote only the supply side.","[Hoang Trieu Huy] Hue Univ, Econ & Dev Studies, Hue, Thua Thien Hue, Vietnam; [Lyne, Michael] Lincoln Univ, Agribusiness & Markets, Canterbury, New Zealand; [Lyne, Michael] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Kwa Zulu, South Africa; [Ratna, Nazmun] Lincoln Univ, Global Value Chains & Trade, Canterbury, New Zealand; [Nuthall, Peter] Lincoln Univ, Land Management & Syst, Canterbury, New Zealand",Hue University; Lincoln University - New Zealand; University of Kwazulu Natal; Lincoln University - New Zealand; Lincoln University - New Zealand,"Huy, HT (通讯作者)，Hue Univ, Econ & Dev Studies, Hue, Thua Thien Hue, Vietnam.",hoangtrieuhuy@hce.edu.vn,"Lyne, Michael C/V-8732-2018; Ratna, Nazmun/W-3606-2018","Lyne, Michael/0000-0002-4530-1195; Ratna, Nazmun/0000-0002-7565-2834",,,,,37,24,30,4,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

To answer this question, this study examined the impact of weak formal tenure lease arrangements on tenants' investment and the productivity of sugarcane in Ba province, Fiji. After controlling for potential endogeneity in the choice of lease tenure using instrumental variables (IV), it was shown that tenants under insecure lease tenure (expiring in 0-5years) achieve significantly lower yields of sugarcane, by 6.5-11 tonnes per hectare, and plant smaller areas of new sugarcane, by 0.14-0.25 hectares on average, than do tenants under secure lease tenure. Insecure lease tenure also negatively affects chemical fertiliser use, although this impact is not statistically significant.

There is no consensus, however, about the types of technologies that are best suited for smallholder farmers in Africa. While some consider natural resource management (NRM) technologies as most appropriate, others propagate input intensification with a stronger role of the private sector. In the public debate, these two strategies are often perceived as incompatible. Environmental non-governmental organizations in particular consider low-external input strategies as the only sustainable form of agriculture, a view that has considerable influence on policymakers and the international donor community. Most existing research studies on smallholder innovation focus on the adoption of individual technologies, so that comparisons between different types of technologies in the same context are not easily possible. We use representative data from maize-producing households in Kenya and a multivariate probit model to analyze the adoption of different types of technologies simultaneously. Results indicate that NRM technologies and strategies that build on external inputs are not incompatible.

The share of nonwhite residents in a tract is positively correlated with the number of TRI-reporting firms, and an inverse-U-shaped relationship characterizes the number of TRI-reporting firms and a tract's median income. Even after controlling for factor prices and other covariates that might drive firm location decisions, entrants that report to the TRI are more likely to locate in areas with a higher share of nonwhite residents. Firms that report to the TRI are also more likely to enter areas with a low share of college graduates. In contrast, the number of entrants from industries that do not have TRI reporters is negatively related to the percentage of nonwhite residents in a tract. Firms in these non-reporting industries are also more likely to enter areas with a high share of college graduates. Polluters appear to agglomerate, raising concerns about both chemical releases being concentrated in certain tracts, and also affecting nonwhite-dense areas disproportionately. The strength of these effects often depend on an urban/rural classification, with rural areas experiencing the most pronounced concerns. Moreover, TRI-reporting firms are less likely to exit the market relative to their peers that operate in the same industry but do not need to file TRI reports, suggesting that releases may affect a region in the long run.","[De Silva, Dakshina G.] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England; [Hubbard, Timothy P.] Colby Coll, Dept Econ, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; [Schiller, Anita R.] Univ Dundee Nethergate, Sch Social Sci, Ctr Energy Petr & Mineral Law & Policy, Dundee, Scotland",Lancaster University; Colby College; University of Dundee,"De Silva, DG (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England.",d.desilva@lancaster.ac.uk,,"De Silva, Dakshina/0000-0001-8820-1955; Schiller, Anita Ryu/0000-0002-7771-2589; Hubbard, Timothy/0000-0002-9290-0246",,,,,41,8,12,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

We find consumer WTP for products with single-country and multicountry supply chains are statistically different, meaning that simplifying a multicountry label by listing only the country where the ingredients are grown or only the country where the ingredients are processed can result in different consumer values.

Many believe that better access to institutional credit, spanning microcredit as well as commercial and agricultural banks, can help rural households smooth risks, and access inputs and other technology to modernize agriculture and improve farm/nonfarm linkages. We use recently augmented household panel data spanning over 20 years in Bangladesh to examine the effects of rural credit expansion (both microcredit and formal bank channels) on outcomes for agricultural households. We find that microcredit has benefited households with lower landownings, raising agricultural income from activities such as livestock rearing that require less land, as well as nonfarm income diversification for all households, but with the strongest effect for landless or near-landless households. We do not find effects of microcredit on crop income, but do, however, find that reported supply-side credit constraints significantly lower crop income. Borrowing by both men and women has contributed to nonfarm income growth for marginal farmers, but only men's borrowing has contributed to nonfarm income growth among higher landowning groups.","[Khandker, Shahidur R.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Koolwal, Gayatri B.] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); The World Bank,"Koolwal, GB (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",koolwalg@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,41,43,4,68,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Results revealed that consumers are mostly indifferent between products labeled generically as local and as local: from within 160 km, implying that the 160-km radius fits perception of local of the representative consumers. Additionally, consumers are willing to pay significantly more for home-province products over products generically labeled local. We also found significant positive WTP for enhanced bovine spongiform encephalopathy tested beef as well as for grass- over grain-fed beef. Nous avons realise, a l'aide de la methode des choix discrets, un sondage national sur le consentement a payer des consommateurs pour du bOEuf local portant la mention de la distance et autres descriptifs sur la provenance.

This leadership role has endured for many decades and accelerated in response to the AAEA-USDA Task Force review of the agricultural productivity accounts ( Gardner et al. 1980). It is against this backdrop of vigorous intellectual leadership that an external review committee has examined the data sources, methodology, ongoing research, documentation, and reporting of the ERS agricultural productivity accounts. Our recommendations are many and some are substantial. Two of the most important recommendations address overarching concerns of documentation and efficiency, two more consider website communication of methods and data, and four focus on the renewal and construction of the state-level accounts.","[Shumway, C.

In the former case, the impacts on both efficiency types are analysed by means of structural equationmodeling (SEM), in the latter by seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). We compare estimation results of the two approaches based on a dataset on single factor irrigation water use efficiency obtained from a survey of 360 farmers in the Guanzhong Plain, China. The main methodological findings are that SEM allows identification of the most important dimension of irrigation water efficiency (technical efficiency) via comparison of their factor scores and reliability. Moreover, it reduces multicollinearity and attenuation bias. It thus is preferable to SUR. The SEM estimates show that perception of water scarcity is the most important positive determinant of both types of efficiency, followed by irrigation infrastructure, income and water price. Furthermore, there is a strong negative reverse effect from efficiency on perception.","[Tang, Jianjun] Queens Univ Belfast, Gibson Inst Land Food & Environm, Ctr Publ Health, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Folmer, Henk] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Dept Agr Econ, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Folmer, Henk] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Groningen, Netherlands",Queens University Belfast; Northwest A&F University - China; University of Groningen,"Tang, JJ (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Gibson Inst Land Food & Environm, Ctr Publ Health, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland.",j.tang@qub.ac.uk,"Jianjun, Tang/AAF-6942-2019","Jianjun, Tang/0000-0002-6994-2093",Medical Research Council [MC_CF023241] Funding Source: researchfish,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,20,13,16,3,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Increased labor migration in developing countries that lack adequate social security systems and institutionalized care for the elderly is a phenomenon that is important to understand. When their adult children go away to work, it is not clear what effect there will be on left-behind elderly parents.

This sample comprises a subset of households which include both elderly individuals (above 60 years old) and their grown (working-aged) children in order to estimate the impact of adult child migration on the health of elderly parents in rural China. Findings - This study finds that adult child migration has a significant positive impact on the health of elderly family members.

We develop an experiment to examine the revenue stream to universities from licensing plant-based innovations. In the experiment we asked subjects to bid for access for a patented input that would be used to produce a differentiated product; treatments were employed to solicit bids that were financed by fees, royalties, and a combination of the two mechanisms under exclusive and nonexclusive contracts. The literature studying the economics of downstream duopoly competition in quantity suggests that revenues for the innovator would be greatest under a nonexclusive contract that uses fees and royalties. In our experiment we allow more than two firms to obtain access to the patent in the nonexclusive treatments, and our empirical results suggest that innovator revenues are greatest when royalties are used alone in a nonexclusive contract.","[Rickard, Bradley J.; Yan, Jubo] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Richards, Timothy J.] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness & Resource Management, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA",Cornell University; Arizona State University,"Rickard, BJ (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 450C Warren Hall,137 Reservoir Rd, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",bjr83@cornell.edu,"Yan, Jubo/AHB-4482-2022","Yan, Jubo/0000-0002-5333-8465; Richards, Timothy/0000-0001-8832-9609",Agriculture and Food Research Initiative from USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2011-02736],Agriculture and Food Research Initiative from USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture,"The authors gratefully acknowledge valuable input provided by two anonymous reviewers and by Editor Awudu Abdulai, and would like to thank seminar participants at Oklahoma State University, Grenoble Applied Economics Laboratory at the University Pierre Mendes-France, the University of Guelph, and the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano for helpful comments and discussions.

The central idea of this research is that only the largest and most efficient firms are capable of exporting. However, the empirical evidence has confirmed that a large number of SMEs is also involved in internationalisation. Given this context, the aim of the paper is to analyse the influence of collaborative networks between firms and institutions as an alternative mechanism to the small size of the majority of the firms in the agri-food industry. To this end, there was used a longitudinal panel between 1994 and 2012 comprising a sample of 342 Spanish firms involved in the business sectors of the food, meat, drink and tobacco industries, and a dynamic Heckman-Probit model was implemented. The first stage studies the positive influence of collaborative networks in firms' decision to export and the second stage analyses the effect of cooperation mechanisms on export intensity. The results show a positive effect of business cooperation networks in both stages suggesting that SMEs can overcome the barrier of their small size in their internationalisation process through other mechanisms, such as collaborative networks.","[Serrano, Raul; Acero, Isabel; Fernandez-Olmos, Marta] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Business Adm, Campus Rio Ebro,Maria de Luna S-N, Zaragoza 50018, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Acero, I (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Business Adm, Campus Rio Ebro,Maria de Luna S-N, Zaragoza 50018, Spain.",iacero@unizar.es,"Serrano, Raul/H-7441-2015; Acero, Isabel/H-6626-2015","Acero, Isabel/0000-0001-5068-8438; Fernandez Olmos, Marta/0000-0002-5623-2391",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; FEDER [ECO2012-36290-C03-01]; Regional Government of Aragon and FSE (Compete Research Group) [S125]; University of Zaragoza [JIUZ-2014-SOC-04],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Regional Government of Aragon and FSE (Compete Research Group); University of Zaragoza,"Support by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and FEDER (Project ECO2012-36290-C03-01), the Regional Government of Aragon and FSE (Project S125: Compete Research Group) and the University of Zaragoza (Project JIUZ-2014-SOC-04).",,78,13,13,1,32,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

When biomass prices are raised exogenously, we find that the subregional models overestimate the supply, the land use, and the beneficial environmental aspects of perennial biomass crops. Multi-market price feedbacks tied to realistic policy parameters predict high threshold absolute prices for biomass to enter production, resulting in intensified production of biomass from annual grain crops with damaging environmental impacts. Multi-market feedbacks also predict regional specialization in energy biomass production in areas with lower yields of food crops.

Some types of negative shocks, for example weather-related agricultural losses and vector-borne diseases, are expected to occur more frequently as a result of climate change. In this paper we measure the role of household- and location-specific characteristics in conditioning behavioural responses to a wide range of idiosyncratic and covariate shocks. We use data from 8,000 rural households in 25 developing countries, compiled in the global database of the Poverty Environment Network. We employ a hierarchical multinomial logit model to identify the importance of characteristics observed at different levels of aggregation on a set of strategies aimed at coping with economic shocks. Results indicate that in response to idiosyncratic shocks, households tend to deplete financial and durable assets, whereas covariate and thus often climate-related shocks predominantly result in reduced consumption. Households in sites characterised by high asset wealth tend to cope with shocks in a more proactive way than those in sites with average or below average asset wealth, but the role of asset types in conditioning shock responses varies across regions. Our findings have implications for rural development and climate change adaptation strategies.","[Boerner, Jan] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Boerner, Jan; Wunder, Sven] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Shively, Gerald] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Shively, Gerald] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, As, Norway; [Wyman, Miriam] Auburn Univ, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",University of Bonn; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Börner, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",jborner@uni-bonn.de,"Börner, Jan JB/I-2139-2015; Wunder, Sven/ABE-7773-2020; Börner, Jan/ABF-8775-2021","Wunder, Sven/0000-0002-9422-0260; Börner, Jan/0000-0003-3034-5360","ESRC/DFID; Danida; CIFOR; CIM/GIZ; Bureau of Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, US Agency for International Development through the BASIS Assets and Market Access Collaborative Research Support Program; ESRC [ES/E021816/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/E021816/1] Funding Source: researchfish","ESRC/DFID(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Danida; CIFOR(CGIAR); CIM/GIZ; Bureau of Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, US Agency for International Development through the BASIS Assets and Market Access Collaborative Research Support Program(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","Jan Borner is with the Center for Development Research (ZEF), University of Bonn, Walter-Flex-Str. 3, 53113 Bonn, Germany, and also with the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), Rio de Janeiro-RJ, Brazil, as is Sven Wunder.

Finally, we simulate noiseless data based on our state-contingent specification of technology. Our state-contingent estimator recovers technology parameters and other economic quantities of interest without any error.

The results show that higher demand-specific factors decrease the probability of exit and increase the probability of ownership change. The effect of physical productivity on the probability of exit or ownership change is generally insignificant. Also, firms with higher demand-specific factors have higher probability to expand, whereas average firm-level physical productivity turns out to be an insignificant determinant of firm expansion. Since demand specific factors all favor large companies, this could expedite industry concentration process already well under way and could raise new concerns over contract growers' income and consumers' welfare.","[Vukina, Tomislav; Zheng, Xiaoyong] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",North Carolina State University,"Vukina, T (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",tom_vukina@ncsu.edu,,,"National Institute of Food and Agriculture, USDA, Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, USDA, Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program","Any opinions and conclusions expressed herein are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the U.S. Census Bureau.

The study finds no significant difference in terms of catastrophic health payments and health payment-induced poverty before and after NCMS reimbursement. The out-of-pocket payments (OOP) are concentrated disproportionately among the poor even after the insurance reimbursement. This heavy burden of OOP payments has become a poverty trap for the poor.

While it imposes no additional assumptions on the model, the Maximum Likelihood estimator has small sample properties superior to those of the Pseudo Maximum Likelihood approach. We provide a proof that is crucial for applying our estimator to the model with normal harvests and possibly unbounded prices, thereby eliminating an inconsistency in the empirical storage model literature. Applying our Maximum Likelihood estimator to a series of annual sugar prices from 1921 to 2009 provides new evidence for the empirical relevance of the standard storage model. Our results imply a cutoff price at which discretionary stocks go to zero, which is higher than the price obtained by applying the Pseudo Maximum Likelihood estimator to the same data. The implied frequency of stockouts is lower, and price correlations, skewness, and kurtosis implied by the model closely match those seen in the annual sugar price data. We find the price of sugar to be highly responsive to small changes in consumption. When inventories are not available to buffer the effects of negative supply shocks on consumption, prices must increase sharply to induce the consumption changes needed to clear the market. Our results show why production shocks are not necessarily aligned with price spikes; the same production shock can give rise to very different price responses, depending on whether or not there are sufficient stocks to buffer its impact.","[Bobenrieth H, Eugenio S.

We find that the markets experienced price explosiveness only approximately two percent of the time and, when bubbles do occur, they are generally short-lived and small in magnitude. The correspondence between observed price spikes and bubbles is rather low, with a large portion of the price explosiveness occurring during downward price movements. Commodity index trader positions do not significantly affect the probability of a positive bubble occurring in grain futures markets, which directly contradicts the argument (the Masters Hypothesis) that waves of index investment distorted underlying supply-and-demand relationships and led to a series of massive bubbles in agricultural futures markets. In addition, commodity index trader positions tend to reduce negative bubble occurrence, while general speculative activity as measured by Working's T reduces the probability of a positive bubble. There is some evidence that the positions of noncommercial traders have a direct effect on positive bubble occurrence, but the effect declines when accounting for the composition of other traders in the market. Overall, speculation has little effect or negative effects on price explosiveness. Finally, positive bubbles are more likely to occur in the presence of low inventories, strong exports, a weak U.S. dollar, and booming economic growth, whereas negative bubbles are more likely to occur with large inventories, weak exports, and stagnant economic growth.","[Etienne, Xiaoli L.] W Virginia Univ, Div Resource Management, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Irwin, Scott H.; Garcia, Philip] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",West Virginia University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Etienne, XL (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Div Resource Management, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",xiaoli.etienne@mail.wvu.edu,"Irwin, Scott H./AAN-1996-2020; Etienne, Xiaoli/GQB-5494-2022; Irwin, Scott H./CAA-2702-2022","Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Etienne, Xiaoli/0000-0003-4519-9028",,,,,63,50,53,0,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Our article explains this experimental behavior by using a dynamic adoption model with Bayesian learning, in which forward-looking farmers take account of future impacts of their learning from both their own and their neighbors' experiences with the new technology. We apply the analysis to a panel of U.S. soybean farmers surveyed from 2000 to 2004 to examine their adoption of the genetically modified (GM) seed technology. We compare the results of the forward-looking model to that of a myopic model, in which farmers maximize current benefits only. Results suggest that the forward-looking model fits data better than the myopic model does. And potential estimation biases arise when fitting a myopic model to forward-looking decision makers.","[Ma, Xingliang] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Shi, Guanming] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Ma, XL (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",xingliang.ma@cgiar.org,,,,,,,25,15,26,3,36,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The identified threshold is consistent with previous evidence on poverty traps based on modeling herd stock dynamics. The approach contributes to an emerging literature that seeks to identify poverty traps through testing the implications of the posited behavioral mechanism behind the trap, as opposed to directly modeling asset dynamics.

Design/methodology/approach - Combinations of four types of traceability information, including farming, slaughter and processing, distribution and sales, and government certification, with price were randomly designed. To identify consumer preferences for these attribute combinations of traceable pork, 215 consumers in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province were investigated using a real choice experiment and the mixed logit model. Findings - Significant heterogeneity was observed in consumer preferences for traceable pork. The information of farming, slaughter and processing, distribution and marketing, and government certification could significantly improve consumer utility. Moreover, consumers had the highest preference for government certification information. Originality/value - Although numerous studies have been performed on consumer preferences for food safety attributes using a real choice experiment, almost none of them focus on Chinese consumers. Therefore, this study is an attempt to fill this gap. The conclusions of this study can serve as a reference for the Chinese government in developing safe food consumption policies. Although Chinese consumers have cried out for improvement of pork safety, they have different preferences for traceability information; thus, the government must promote traceable food step-by-step, using consumer preferences as a starting point.","[Wu, Linhai] Jiangnan Univ, Food Safety Res Base Jiangsu Prov, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Wu, Linhai; Wang, Hongsha] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Dian] Soochow Univ, Sch Dongwu Business, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Dian] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Food Sci & Technol, Wuxi, Peoples R China",Jiangnan University; Jiangnan University; Soochow University - China; Jiangnan University,"Wu, LH (通讯作者)，Jiangnan Univ, Food Safety Res Base Jiangsu Prov, Wuxi, Peoples R China.",wlh6799@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273117]; Study of food safety consumption policy in China, a project of National Soft Science [2013GXQ4B158]; Central University Basic Research Funds [JUSRP51325A, JUSRP51416B]; Study of food safety consumption policy: the case of traceable pork, a project of the six top talents in Jiangsu Province [2012-JY-002]; Research on Chinese food safety risk control, a project of college innovation team of Jiangsu Province social science [2013-011]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Study of food safety consumption policy in China, a project of National Soft Science; Central University Basic Research Funds; Study of food safety consumption policy: the case of traceable pork, a project of the six top talents in Jiangsu Province; Research on Chinese food safety risk control, a project of college innovation team of Jiangsu Province social science","This paper was supported by Study of multiple simulation experiment on traceable food consumption policy based on consumer preferences: the case of pork, a project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Approval No. 71273117), and Study of food safety consumption policy in China, a project of National Soft Science (Project Approval No. 2013GXQ4B158), and Central University Basic Research Funds (Project Approval No. JUSRP51325A and JUSRP51416B), and Study of food safety consumption policy: the case of traceable pork, a project of the six top talents in Jiangsu Province (Project Approval No. 2012-JY-002), and Research on Chinese food safety risk control, a project of college innovation team of Jiangsu Province social science (Project Approval No. 2013-011).",,61,14,18,1,59,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

While the existence of asymmetric price-cost pass-through has been documented in many markets, possible causes for such a phenomenon have not been investigated empirically. Using consumer panel data in the coffee retail sector in France, we structurally estimate a demand model allowing for asymmetric consumer responses to positive and negative retail price changes. According to the demand estimates, we indeed find significant evidence that consumers react differentially to positive and negative price movements, in that demand is less elastic to price increases than to price decreases. Then, using counterfactual simulations within an equilibrium model of demand and supply side behaviour, we investigate empirically the extent to which the existence of the estimated demand asymmetries contributes to asymmetric responses of equilibrium prices of imperfectly competing firms, given upstream negative and positive cost shocks. We do so by simulating positive and negative costs shocks, given the estimated demand model with asymmetric demand responses. We compare those changes in prices to changes in prices resulting from the same magnitude of cost shocks under a counterfactual demand structure without demand asymmetries. Our findings suggest that not allowing for asymmetries in demand implies similar magnitudes of simulated price-cost pass-through rates from positive and negative cost shocks. When we allow for demand asymmetries, however, a positive cost shock is passed through to retail prices to a greater degree than a negative cost shock of the same magnitude. Our findings imply that the shape of the demand curve could explain observed asymmetric price transmission of cost shocks in the context of imperfectly competitive markets.","[Bonnet, Celine] Univ Toulouse Capitole, INRA, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Villas-Boas, Sofia B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; INRAE; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Bonnet, C (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse Capitole, INRA, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",cbonnet@toulouse.inra.fr,"Villas-Boas, Sofia B/B-6241-2009","Villas-Boas, Sofia/0000-0001-8443-4364","European Commission, Directorate General Research-Unit E Biotechnologies, Agriculture, Food [KBBE-265601-4-TRANSFOP]","European Commission, Directorate General Research-Unit E Biotechnologies, Agriculture, Food","This article is part of the 'Transparency of Food Pricing' (TRANSFOP) project funded by the European Commission, Directorate General Research-Unit E Biotechnologies, Agriculture, Food.

Because the relative price swings have occurred only recently, traditional approaches to demand analysis that rely on historical data series may be less useful than is typically the case. Employing one of the largest and longest-running choice experiments, we analyze data on 110,295 choices made by 12,255 consumers observed over a year-long time period coinciding with historically high meat prices. Our findings reveal nonlinear demands for meat products, with demand being more inelastic at higher prices. Ground beef, steak, and pork chop demands are more sensitive to changes in chicken breast price than the reverse. Moreover, cross-price elasticities between disaggregate meat products shrink as prices rise. Consumers' incomes significantly affect demand interrelationships. Higher income consumers are more likely to choose steak and chicken breasts and are less likely to choose ground beef, chicken wings, and deli ham than are lower income consumers. High-income consumers tend to be less responsive to ownprice changes and more responsive to cross-price changes than lower income consumers. This analysis provides estimates of structural demand parameters that help explain current meat expenditure patterns, and the results have implications for the assumption of linearity often invoked in policy analyses.","[Lusk, Jayson L.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Tonsor, Glynn T.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Kansas State University,"Lusk, JL (通讯作者)，OSU, 411 Ag Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",jayson.lusk@okstate.edu,,,Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station; Willard Sparks Endowment at Oklahoma State; Agricultural and Food Research Initiative Competitive Program of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [2015-67023-23134],Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station; Willard Sparks Endowment at Oklahoma State; Agricultural and Food Research Initiative Competitive Program of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA),"The project was partially supported by the Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station, the Willard Sparks Endowment at Oklahoma State, and the Agricultural and Food Research Initiative Competitive Program of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), grant number 2015-67023-23134.",,69,38,54,3,45,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

The analysis reveals a remarkable stability in the number of farms in the period, as well as in the structure of land distribution across farm sizes, with a persistence of a dual agricultural structure. Land distribution, as measured by the GINI index, has changed very little and is still very high. The number of large farms is increasing significantly in time, while the number of farms with area below 500 ha changed little in the 1970-2006 period. Medium-sized and large farms, although heavily outweighed in numbers, account for the highest share of annual crop production currently, and their share in crop (annual plus permanent) production value increased between 1980 and 2006, while the same share decreased for smaller farms. We conclude that the observed stability will probably reduce in the future, as economic forces will likely change the balance in favor of an increase in the number of large farms. This is an issue of obvious political importance, especially considering the importance of the smaller farms for employment in agriculture.","[de Souza Ferreira Filho, Joaquim Bento; de Freitas Vian, Carlos Eduardo] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Ferreira, JBD (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.",jbsferre@usp.br,"Vian, Carlos Eduardo de Freitas/D-3245-2012","Vian, Carlos Eduardo de Freitas/0000-0001-8212-9112",,,,,23,7,11,2,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

In this article, I document global and regional changes in aggregate agricultural land use, per capita land use, and average farm sizes. The spatial distribution of global farming land has changed dramatically, with developed countries substantially reducing their share of global agricultural land, and land-abundant developing countries substantially increasing their share. In per capita terms, we see a rather different pattern, with average farm sizes increasing in rich and more commercialized agricultural systems, and generally declining or staying constant in poorer and less commercialized systems. These outcomes are the result of complex processes that are not always well understood.

Our results show that the incidence of attribute non-attendance varies across the treatments in general, with significant difference in attribute non-attendance rates between respondents exposed to the mitigation strategies (Honesty Priming and Cheap Talk) and the baseline group. We also find that the low willingness to pay values for the honesty priming task appear to correspond with the lowest attribute non-attendance rates reported for all the attributes (especially price) and might reflect a more realistic valuation of the attributes.","[Bello, Muhammad; Abdulai, Awudu] Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Abdulai, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany.",aabdula@food-econ.uni-kiel.de,"Abdulai, Awudu/AAI-3517-2021",", Awudu/0000-0003-4618-2789",,,,,45,43,45,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

However, auctions only succeed if enough farmers choose to bid so that the auctioneer can evaluate numerous projects for targeted funding. A 2014 conservation auction to allocate payments for practices that reduce phosphorus runoff in Northwest Ohio experienced very thin bidding. According to a follow-up survey, auction participation was deterred by the perceived complexity of the bidding process and the need to negotiate with renters. Due to low participation, the actual conservation auction made payments for phosphorus reduction that were surprisingly costly at the margin. Applying a farmer behavioral model to the Western Lake Erie Basin, we simulate participation choice and cost-effectiveness of environmental outcomes in reverse auctions and uniform payment conservation programs. Results reveal that when perceived transaction costs of bid preparation are high, reverse auctions can be less cost-effective than spatially targeted, uniform payment programs that attract higher participation.","[Palm-Forster, Leah H.] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Swinton, Scott M.; Lupi, Frank; Shupp, Robert S.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University of Delaware; Michigan State University,"Palm-Forster, LH (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",leahhp@udel.edu,"Lupi, Frank/N-3939-2019","Lupi, Frank/0000-0003-2287-2259; Palm-Forster, Leah/0000-0001-8191-0310",NSF Long-term Ecological Research Program at the Kellogg Biological Station [DEB 1027253]; Great Lakes Protection Fund through The Nature Conservancy; Michigan State University AgBioResearch; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1027253] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF Long-term Ecological Research Program at the Kellogg Biological Station(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Great Lakes Protection Fund through The Nature Conservancy; Michigan State University AgBioResearch; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),"Leah H.

By using French hog farm data, we estimate a system of equations including a feed price function, input demand functions, and an output supply function based on a technology approximated by a combined generalized Leontief-Quadratic form. Our results suggest that the marginal costs are over-estimated when the adjustment of the feed unit prices to a change in farm size is not controlled for. More specifically, the cost economies for large farms (enjoying the highest profits) arise primarily from lower feed prices, with technological scale economies having little impact. In contrast, farms with no hired labor exhibit technological scale economies and reach higher price-cost margins compared to larger farms.","[Duvaleix-Treguer, Sabine; Gaigne, Carl] INRA, AGROCAMPUS OUEST, SMART, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Gaigne, Carl] Univ Laval, CREATE, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",INRAE; Universite de Rennes; Institut Agro; Agrocampus Ouest; Laval University,"Duvaleix-Tréguer, S (通讯作者)，INRA, AGROCAMPUS OUEST, SMART, F-35000 Rennes, France.",sabine.treguer@agrocampus-ouest.fr,,"Gaigne, Carl/0000-0002-1540-234X; Duvaleix, Sabine/0000-0002-2663-5659",,,,,32,8,8,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Few have explored methods of using online survey tools to improve data quality for consumer willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates. This article determines the impact of using a validation question (VQ) approach that asked survey respondents to select a particular answer on improving online survey data quality across six countries. Results show that survey data quality is a common problem in online surveys across countries and the severity of this problem differs significantly. Using VQs might detect the respondents who are less careful in answering survey questions, thus providing less reliable answers. The econometric models for respondents who correctly answer VQs (pass VQs) perform significantly better than the models for respondents who incorrectly answer VQs (fail VQs). The WTP estimates for respondents who pass and fail VQs differ significantly; and in general the WTP estimates for respondents passing VQs have smaller variances than those for all respondents and for respondents failing VQs.","[Gao, Zhifeng; House, Lisa A.; Xie, Jing] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Gao, ZF (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",zfgao@ufl.edu; lahouse@ufl.edu; jxie@ufl.edu,"Gao, Zhifeng/AFD-7759-2022; House, Lisa/V-5724-2017","Gao, Zhifeng/0000-0003-2984-8278; House, Lisa/0000-0002-1901-6550",,,,,40,61,70,1,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Our approach is to characterize the entire distribution by farmer age and farmer experience rather than using young versus old and beginning versus established farmer categories. We also use a linked-farms longitudinal approach to show trends over time in farmland expansion and contraction. We find that farms operated by older beginning farmers tend to be smaller and do not tend to grow over time. Our results show that it is mostly young farmers as opposed to all beginning farmers who rapidly expand their farm operations after entering agriculture. Our findings inform policy makers about the strategies that young and beginning farmers use to start their businesses and expand over time, and suggest more effective approaches for targeting loan programs to both young and beginning farmers.","[Katchova, Ani L.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Ahearn, Mary Clare] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),,katchova.1@osu.edu,"Katchova, Ani/B-1309-2019","Katchova, Ani/0000-0002-7307-4073",,,,,31,39,48,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Specifically, we use newly available micro-scale grid cell data to test whether a location's corn and total agricultural cultivation rose in response to the capacity of ethanol refineries in their vicinity. Based on these data, acreage in corn and overall agriculture not only grew in already-cultivated areas but also expanded into previously uncultivated areas. Acreage in corn and total agriculture also correlated with proximity to ethanol plants, though the relationship dampened over the time period. A formal estimation of the link between acreage and ethanol refineries, however, must account for the endogenous location decisions of ethanol plants and areas of corn supply. We present historical evidence to support the use of the US railroad network as a valid instrument for ethanol plant locations. Our estimates show that a location's neighborhood refining capacity exerts strong and significant effects on acreage planted in corn and total agricultural acreage. The largest impacts of ethanol plants were felt in locations where cultivation area was relatively low. This high-resolution evidence of ethanol impacts on local agricultural outcomes can inform researchers and policy-makers concerned with crop diversity, environmental sustainability, and rural economic development.","[Motamed, Mesbah; Williams, Ryan] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC USA; [McPhail, Lihong] Commod Futures Trading Commiss, New York, NY USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Motamed, M (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC USA.",mmotamed@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,37,31,37,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The modeling procedure also accounts for the spatial variations in the land use measures' costs and in the effects on species and grassland types. The procedure's main novelty is that it considers variations of the costs and impacts on species and grassland types that arise from different timings of the land use measures. Considering the spatial and the temporal dimension of land use measures makes the modeling procedure spatiotemporally explicit.

The analysis was undertaken in a context where India is showing high commodity concentration in agricultural trade. The econometric analysis employed is panel corrected standard errors (PCSE) estimation technique. The results indicated evidence of a greater degree of imperfect competition either through price discrimination across destinations or through imperfect exchange rate pass-through. The analysis of exchange rate effects showed that the local currency price stabilization by the Indian exporters were more prominent than the amplification of exchange rates. The analysis of the asymmetric effects of exchange rates on export prices showed that in most cases the depreciation of Indian rupee had a greater impact than the appreciation. Moreover the results showed that the exchange rate pass-through is sensitive to the kind of exchange rate index utilised. In our analysis we found that the commodity specific exchange rate better predicts the pricing to market behaviour in most cases.,"[Varma, Poornima] Indian Inst Management, Ctr Management Agr, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Issar, Akash] Indian Inst Management, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad,"Varma, P (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Ctr Management Agr, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India.",poornimav@iimahd.ernet.in,,"Issar, Akash/0000-0002-6349-2896",,,,,26,3,3,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The authors used fixed-effected regression approach to analyze the determinants of these services. Findings - The results show that in the aftermath of increased investment and policy attention at the national level, the proportion of villages providing RSWC services in rural China increased significantly from 1998 to 2011. However, half of all villages in rural China still did not provide RSWC services as of 2011. Based on econometrics analysis, the authors show that villages that are richer, more populous, and villages with more small hamlets are more likely to provide RSWC services. Originality/value - The analyses are based on primary survey data and the first to quantify trends in waste management services in the beginning of the twentieth century. The authors believe that the results will have significant policy implications for China in its continuing quest for better waste management policy.","[Wang, Aiqin] Northwest Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Peoples R China; [Wang, Aiqin] Ctr Expt Econ, Xian, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yaojiang; Gao, Qiufeng] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chengfang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Johnson, Natalie] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, REAP, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Northwest University Xi'an; Shaanxi Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Stanford University; Stanford University","Shi, YJ (通讯作者)，Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Peoples R China.",shiyaojiang7@gmail.com,"Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023; li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023; ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022","Wang, Aiqin/0000-0002-2243-9677",111 Project [B16031]; fundamental research funds for the central universities [2016CBZ011],"111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project); fundamental research funds for the central universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support by the 111 Project, Grant No. B16031 and the fundamental research funds for the central universities (No. 2016CBZ011).",,30,7,8,1,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

J,"Wang, ZY; Sun, SZ",,,,"Wang, Zhiyang; Sun, Sizhong",,,Transportation infrastructure and rural development in China,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,China; Rural development; Infrastructure investment; Transportation infrastructure,GROWTH,"Purpose - The infrastructure investment is one important source of economic growth in China in the past three decades. However it is not clear to what extent such investment affects development in rural area. The purpose of this paper is to explore this impact both conceptually and quantitatively, and draw policy implications from the empirical exercise. Design/methodology/approach - The authors first describe the conceptual link between the transportation infrastructure and rural development, which motivates the empirical model. Then by utilizing an autoregressive distributed lag model, the authors estimate both the short- and long-run impacts of the transportation infrastructure on rural development, in terms of cereal yield and per capita net income of rural households. Findings - The authors find that investment in transportation infrastructure positively affects rural development in China. In terms of cereal yield, a 1 percent increase in the road infrastructure (road length) leads to around 0.05 percent increase in cereal yield in the short- ,and around 0.19 percent increase in the long-run. In terms of the per capita net income of rural households, a 1 percent increase in the road infrastructure results in around 0.14 percent increase in the short-, and its long-run impact is not statistically significant. The positive impacts lend supports to promote investment in the transportation infrastructure. To this end, in addition to the government funding, the participation of private capital can also be promoted through a number of channels, such as the build-operate-transfer, public-private partnership, and establishment of infrastructure investment bank. Originality/value - This study evaluates the impacts of transportation infrastructure on rural development in China. Despite of the importance of infrastructure and rural development, there is a lack of study on the interaction between them. This paper intends to fill in this gap. In addition, implications drawn in this exercise can benefit policy makers not only in China, but also in other developing countries.","[Wang, Zhiyang] Jimei Univ, Coll Finance & Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Sun, Sizhong] James Cook Univ, Coll Business Law & Governance, Townsville, Qld, Australia",Jimei University; James Cook University,"Wang, ZY (通讯作者)，Jimei Univ, Coll Finance & Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",jeffwzy@163.com,,"Sun, Sizhong/0000-0001-8430-915X",Fujian Social Science Program [2013B197],Fujian Social Science Program,"The authors thank participants of the Joint Conference of Chinese Economics Society Australia and Rural Development Institute of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing on December 11-12, 2014 for their comments and suggestions.

Many developing country governments-including Ghana, the case study of this article-have resumed support for agricultural mechanization, typically in the form of subsidies for tractor purchase and establishment of private-sector-run agricultural mechanization service centers (AMSECs). The aim of this article is to assess the impact of Ghana's AMSEC program on various farm household outcomes, using data from surveys that were conducted with 270 farm households. A two-stage propensity score matching and difference-in-difference estimation procedure is used to estimate the impacts of the program, employing different definitions of treatment, model specifications, and matching algorithms to assess sensitivity of the estimator to different assumptions. The results indicate that the AMSEC program has had a mixed impact on different outcome indicators. For example, whereas the program has contributed to improving availability of mechanization services, reducing drudgery, and raising yield, it has had no impact on the change in the prices paid by farmers for the services used and the change in the amount of area plowed. Implications of the results on labor-mechanization substitution and for raising and sustaining productivity further are drawn.","[Benin, Samuel] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Davis, CA 95616 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Benin, S (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 1107 Alice St, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",s.benin@cgiar.org,"zou, kai/KBC-1945-2024",,,,,,31,69,75,12,63,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Conservation efforts in these post-frontier zones seek to protect the remaining forest fragments and promote sustainable agricultural practices that absorb labor, meet market demand, and generate ecosystem services. Assessments of these efforts often find that rates of sustained uptake are disappointingly low and that impacts are difficult to discern, but this could be due to the short-time frames of both the efforts themselves and their evaluation. We investigate the impacts of participation in an internationally sponsored farmer association that for 15 years promoted sustainable agricultural practices in the heavily deforested state of Rondonia, Brazil. Using data from a georeferenced four-period panel survey of farmers in combination with remote sensing data on land use spanning the life of the association, we apply matching methods to estimate the impacts of participation. We find that membership resulted in more diversified production systems, including more land allocated to agroforestry. Members also deforested less of their farms, but this difference is not statistically significant after we control for selection bias in membership.","[Sills, Erin O.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Caviglia-Harris, Jill L.] Salisbury Univ, Econ & Finance Dept, Salisbury, MD 21804 USA",North Carolina State University; University System of Maryland; Salisbury University,"Sills, EO (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Resources, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",sills@ncsu.edu,,"Sills, Erin/0000-0001-8289-0489; Caviglia-Harris, Jill/0000-0001-7860-4857",,,,,80,7,8,1,72,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

A stochastic dynamic simulation model and a stochastic dynamic programming model are developed to: (A) identify the combination of control options that is optimal for blackberry (Rubus anglocandicans) in Australian natural ecosystems, (B) assess whether an integrated control strategy is superior to chemical-only strategies, (C) evaluate the net benefits of biological control (a rust and grazing by goats), and (D) determine how changes in model parameters affect the optimal control strategy. The results indicate that, while an integrated strategy combining chemical and nonchemical control methods may be optimal in certain circumstances, it is not necessarily superior to a chemical-dominant strategy in all cases. The results show that grazing goats for control of blackberry can be optimal despite uncertainty about its effectiveness. Policy makers need to be aware of the trade-offs between choosing more effective control options that may impose environmental and health risks versus less effective control strategies that are safer to the environment and human health. Bien que la lutte contre les mauvaises herbes en agriculture ait fait l'objet de nombreuses etudes economiques, peu d'entre elles se sont penchees sur les mauvaises herbes dans les ecosystemes naturels.

Our aim is to assess the modeling approach by comparing the scenario results with observations from the evaluation reports for rural development, supplemented with expert interviews and findings from the literature. For this purpose, an ex-post scenario is developed for Germany that models the effect of the Pillar II measures in 2006. We observe a moderate impact, namely, an increase in agricultural income (5%) and agricultural land use (0.15%), particularly grassland, and a substitution of arable land with grassland. This effect leads to a total increase in agricultural production, particularly of beef, and to an increase in total greenhouse gas emissions and total nitrogen surplus for Germany. Greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient surpluses per ha, however, are reduced. We observe that farm investment programmes displace private investment. The evaluation reports confirm the moderate impact and our major results, as does the comparison with other literature. However, the conclusions about agri-environment measures and their impact on income differ. The most important difference between our results and the evaluation reports and majority of the present literature is that we also quantify the joint effect between the whole economy and policy measures, with some contradictory effects.","[Schroeder, Lilli Aline; Gocht, Alexander] Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst Rural Studies, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany; [Britz, Wolfgang] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; University of Bonn,"Schroeder, LA (通讯作者)，Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst Rural Studies, Bundesallee 50, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.",lilli.schroeder@ti.bund.de,"Britz, Wolfgang/I-3046-2014","Britz, Wolfgang/0000-0002-8532-3823; Schroeder, Lilli Aline/0009-0002-8988-0851",European Union within the Seventh Framework Program project CAPRI-RD; European Union within the RURAGRI ERA-NET Framework project TRUSTEE; Federal Ministry of Education and Research in Germany (BMBF),European Union within the Seventh Framework Program project CAPRI-RD; European Union within the RURAGRI ERA-NET Framework project TRUSTEE; Federal Ministry of Education and Research in Germany (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"Lilli Schroeder and Alexander Gocht are both from the Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute of Rural Studies, Bundesallee 50, 38116 Braunschweig, Germany.

As a consequence, extrapolation from past data reaches its limits, and a process-based analysis of farmer adaptation is required. Simulation of changes in crop yields using crop growth models is a first step in that direction. However, changes in crop yields are only one pathway through which climate change affects agricultural production. A meaningful process-based analysis of farmer adaptation requires a whole-farm analysis at the farm level. We use a highly disaggregated mathematical programming model to analyze farm-level climate change adaptation for a mountainous area in southwest Germany. Regional-level results are obtained by simulating each full-time farm holding in the study area. We address parameter uncertainty and model underdetermination using a cautious calibration approach and a comprehensive uncertainty analysis. We deal with the resulting computational burden using efficient experimental designs and high-performance computing. We show that in our study area, shifted crop management time slots can have potentially significant effects on agricultural supply, incomes, and various policy objectives promoted under German and European environmental policy schemes. The simulated effects are robust against model uncertainty and underline the importance of a comprehensive assessment of climate change impacts beyond merely looking at crop yield changes. Our simulations demonstrate how farm-level models can contribute to a process-based analysis of climate change adaptation if they are embedded into a systematic framework for treating inherent model uncertainty.","[Troost, Christian; Berger, Thomas] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Econ & Social Sci Trop & Subtrop, Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Troost, C (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Econ & Social Sci Trop & Subtrop, Stuttgart, Germany.",,"Chekalin, Vyacheslav/S-6391-2017","Troost, Christian/0000-0003-4626-7117",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [FOR-1695],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors thank JunJie Wu and one anonymous referee for their careful reading and most helpful comments.

The findings suggest that the impacts of off-farm income are uniformly positive across the unconditional quantile regression and significantly increase food consumption expenditures for all quantiles, except for the 25th quantile. In addition, we found that schooling, experience, and location of the household increase the food expenditures of rural households. Most importantly, this article argues that female-headed rural households in which the female works off the farm tend to have significantly lower food expenditures.","[Mishra, Ashok K.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Mishra, Ashok K.] Louisiana State Univ AgCtr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Mottaleb, Kh.

We analyse the impact of Bt cotton on environmental efficiency in Pakistan, using farm survey data and a doubly heteroskedastic stochastic production function framework. Negative environmental and health effects of chemical pesticide use are quantified with the environmental impact quotient. Bt-adopting farms have higher cotton yields, while using lower pesticide quantities and causing less environmental damage. Bt farms are both technically and environmentally more efficient than non-Bt farms. Bt adoption increases environmental efficiency by 37%. Achieving the same reduction in negative environmental and health impact without Bt would cost conventional cotton farmers US$ 54 per acre in terms of foregone yields and revenues (7% of total revenues). Extrapolating this shadow price of the technology's health and environmental benefits to the total Bt cotton area in Pakistan results in an aggregate value of US$ 370million. These benefits are in addition to the profit gains for Bt-adopting farmers. Our results suggest that Bt technology can contribute to sustainable agricultural development.","[Abedullah; Kouser, Shahzad] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Qaim, Matin] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany",University of Agriculture Faisalabad; University of Gottingen,"Abedullah (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",abedullah@yahoo.com,"Kouser, Shahzad/ABD-7680-2020; Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016","Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763",Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan,Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan),"Abedullah and Shahzad Kouser are Assistant Professors in the Institute of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of Agriculture Faisalabad, Pakistan.

This study contributes to this knowledge gap by assessing the impact of the farmers' pension payments on farm production and the labour allocation using the Old Age Farmers' Pension program in Taiwan as a case study. In particular, this study quantified the effect of pension payments on the labour allocation of the farm operator and other family members, hired labourers, as well as on the farm production. A unique sample of 465 dairy farms was drawn from the Agricultural Census survey in Taiwan in 2010. The data set was compiled using the national administrative profile of the pension program in Taiwan in order to access an objective pension status for all recipients of the payments. By estimating an endogenous treatment effect model, it was found that the pension payments decreased the amount of the on-farm work of the farm operator. In contrast, it increased the on-farm labour use of the family members. Moreover, the availability of the pension program decreased the size of farm operation and the farm productivity.","[Chang, Hung-Hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Wang, Jiun-Hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioind Commun & Dev, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Mishra, Ashok K.] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Chang, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 1 Roosevelt Rd,Sec 4, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",hunghaochang@ntu.edu.tw,,"chang, hung-hao/0000-0003-2296-134X; Wang, Jiun-Hao/0000-0001-7861-0341",,,,,19,4,4,0,21,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The examination considers over 180 hedonic wine price models developed over 20 years, covering many countries. The research identifies that the relation between the price of wine and its sensory quality rating is a moderate partial correlation of +0.30. This correlation exists despite the lack of information held by consumers about a wine's quality and the inconsistency of expert tasters when evaluating wines. The results identify a moderate price-quality correlation, which suggests the existence of strategic buying opportunities for better informed consumers. Strategic price setting possibilities may also exist for wine producers given the incomplete quality information held by consumers. The results from the meta-regression analysis point to the absence of any publication bias, and attribute the observed asymmetry in estimates to study heterogeneity. The analysis suggests the observed heterogeneity is explained by the importance of a wine's reputation, the use of the 100-point quality rating scale, the analysis of a single wine variety/style, and the employed functional form. The most important implication from the analysis is the relative importance of a wine's reputation over its sensory quality, inferring that producers need to sustain the sensory quality of a wine over time to extract appropriate returns. The reputation of the wine producer is found not to influence the strength of the price-quality relationship. This finding does not contradict the importance of wine producer reputation in directly influencing prices.","[Oczkowski, Edward] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia; [Doucouliagos, Hristos] Deakin Univ, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia",Charles Sturt University; Deakin University,"Oczkowski, E (通讯作者)，Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia.",eoczkowski@csu.edu.au,"Oczkowski, Eddie/AAY-3706-2020","Oczkowski, Eddie/0000-0003-2071-7116; Doucouliagos, Hristos/0000-0001-5269-3556",,,,,81,97,101,2,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The effect of the R&D investments is measured by a knowledge stock constructed using a gamma distribution with lags ranging from 7 to 15 years. The relationship between the total factor productivity in agriculture, the domestic knowledge stock and the foreign R&D spillovers approximated by the imports of agricultural technologies is examined using an error correction model. Whereas the estimates confirm that domestic research plays a positive role in agricultural productivity, the results for the foreign R&D spillovers are rather weak. Furthermore, there is little evidence that either length of time or the functional form of weights plays a major role in assessing the dependence of the productivity on R&D investments; however, the models with the knowledge distribution lags longer than 7 years perform better.","[Ratinger, Tomas] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Ctr Technol, Prague 16000 6, Czech Republic; [Kristkova, Zuzana] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Ratinger, T (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republ, Ctr Technol, Struhach 27, Prague 16000 6, Czech Republic.",ratinger@tc.cz,,"Ratinger, Tomas/0000-0003-1379-2177; Smeets Kristkova, Zuzana/0000-0003-3100-7945","CZERA project of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports [LM 2010010]; Czech Science Foundation [P402/11/P678]","CZERA project of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports; Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic)","The results of this paper are part of a research grant from the CZERA project of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (2010-2015, LM 2010010) and the Czech Science Foundation (P402/11/P678): Evaluation of Research and Development Effects on the Economic Growth of the Czech Republic with the Use of a Computable General Equilibrium Model.",,33,11,11,3,27,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

WTP estimations take into account social interaction and nonpayment effects. Results indicate that without information about the nutritional benefits of the two iron bean varieties, consumers are willing to pay a large premium for the RIB variety, but not for the WIB variety. The nutrition information provided has a significantly positive effect on the premium for each of the iron bean varieties. Results also indicate that the effects of how the information is framed on this premium are not statistically significant. However, providing the nutrition information three times versus once significantly increases consumer demand for the WIB variety.

This article explores market price behavior using cointegration analysis and estimates the effects of production and trade shocks through multimarket model simulations. We show that market prices in the capital city, Juba, of both maize and sorghum are cointegrated with import parity prices of these cereals sourced from Uganda, consistent with observed trade flows. Model simulations, using econometrically estimated demand parameters, suggest that private sector imports of maize and wheat would greatly mitigate the potential fall in consumption in the case of a decline in domestic cereal production. Other simulations indicate that if total imports of cereals are reduced by one-third (still more than two times the levels of food aid in 2013) because of disruptions to private market flows, domestic prices of cereals could rise by 45% or more. The article concludes that whatever measures are taken involving national food security reserves, it is crucial that government policy serves to maintain incentives for private sector imports to avoid destabilizing market supplies, domestic prices, and ultimately, food consumption of the poor.","[Dorosh, Paul A.; Rashid, Shahidur; van Asselt, Joanna] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Dorosh, PA (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",p.dorosh@cgiar.org,,"Van Asselt, Joanna/0000-0002-0090-6166; Rashid, Shahidur/0000-0001-6719-2201; Dorosh, Paul/0000-0001-6049-6018",,,,,38,8,9,1,71,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Reconsidering a recent claim that, in systems that penalise violation of thresholds, learning opportunities induce riskier decision-making, I find no incentive for ambiguity seeking. But opportunity to benefit from learning may indeed induce riskier decisions, an effect that diminishes and eventually disappears as penalties become larger. A recent claim that a rational regulator of pharmaceutical drugs would be ambiguity preferring - a claim that has obvious applicability to a broader set of treatments - is then examined. Ambiguity-tolerant patients may indeed prefer a menu of ambiguous treatments and opportunity to learn and switch, rather than a single treatment with known risk. But the source of ambiguity matters. Patient heterogeneity, prior to and independent of policy, generates ambiguity for individuals and motivates preference for a menu of treatments. However, expanding the menu does not justify approving treatments that are generally riskier. Finally, I challenge the perennial claim that the regulator of risks to human health and safety should seek to maximise expected value.","[Randall, Alan] Univ Sydney, Econ & Agr & Environm, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Randall, Alan] Ohio State Univ, Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University of Sydney; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Randall, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Econ & Agr & Environm, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.;Randall, A (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",randall.3@osu.edu,"Randall, Alan/N-4153-2019","Randall, Alan/0000-0003-1028-5903",,,,,23,1,1,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Design/methodology/approach - Using data from China Health and Nutrition Survey for the period of 1991-2009, the authors document gender patterns of school enrollments of children aged between 7 and 18 years. The authors estimate the impact of phone and internet access on school enrollments of children using a probit model. Findings - The results indicate that the spread of phone and internet access both contribute to an increase in enrollment of females. Naturally, the gender gap in enrollments is not simply shaped by technology, and social norms also play an important role. Consequently, the results also show that enrollment of females is lower in the communities where pro-son preference is stronger, holding technology and other factors constant. Originality/value - The authors conclude that promoting further development of telecommunications services may result in narrowing the school enrollment gender gap in rural China. This conclusion is valuable in setting governmental policies as well as guiding the actions of NGOs.","[Gu, Hejun; Ozturk, Ugur Aytun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ozturk, Ugur Aytun] Soka Univ, Fac Int Liberal Arts, Tokyo, Japan",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Soka University,"Ozturk, UA (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",aytunozturk@gmail.com,"Ozturk, Ugur Aytun/AAX-5791-2021; Ozturk, Ugur/JBJ-8614-2023","Ozturk, Ugur Aytun/0000-0003-4811-4704;","National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH [R01-HD30880, DK056350, R01-HD38700]; Fogarty International Center; China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Carolina Population Center; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71003053, 71473128]","National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Fogarty International Center(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC)); China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Carolina Population Center; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This research uses data from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS).

Numerical investigations confirm that under the same protection of consumer, the AOQL plans for inspection by variables are in many situations more economical than the corresponding Dodge-Romig AOQL attribute sampling plans. The dependence of the saving of the inspection cost on the input parameters of acceptance sampling (the average outgoing quality limit, the lot size and the process average proportion defective) is analysed in the paper.

This paper evaluates economic efficiency of vegetable farms in Nepal using a non-parametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach. The results show evidence to suggest that vegetable farms in Nepal have a considerable potential for improving the vegetable production efficiency with a greater access to improved seed, agricultural credit, and training and extension services. Some policies options with regard to the vegetable production technology, and support services for farmers in general and women farmers in particular, are suggested to increase the farm efficiency. While some of these support services are currently available, we suggest that a more focus be given to creating the improved market access, to the women focused extension, and to training packages for the sustainable production. These support services can lead to increases in the farm income and to reduce poverty.","[Shrestha, Rudra Bahadur; Huang, Wen-Chi] Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Pingtung 91201, Taiwan; [Gautam, Shriniwas] AVRDC World Vegetable Ctr, Bangkok, Thailand; [Johnson, Thomas Gordon] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",National Pingtung University Science & Technology; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Huang, WC (通讯作者)，Natl Pingtung Univ Sci & Technol, Pingtung 91201, Taiwan.",wenchi@mail.npust.edu.tw,"Huang, Wen-Chi/B-4136-2014","Huang, Wen-Chi/0000-0003-4427-9325; Gautam, Shriniwas/0000-0002-4802-8032","district agriculture development offices, the Government of Nepal","district agriculture development offices, the Government of Nepal","The authors are grateful to the reviewers for providing valuable comments and suggestions; the vegetable farmers for providing the information; and the district agriculture development offices, the Government of Nepal for providing supports to this study.",,58,26,29,1,32,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Secondly, the cost difference increases the quality difference, the market size difference and the profit difference.

The extant knowledge of trust in food brands, and in particular the empirical investigation of brand trust, is relatively underresearched in food economics. Research examining institutional trust has been carried out in sociology, marketing, and political science, while a limited number of studies to date have investigated the degree of consumer trust in food. This paper extends previous research on consumer trust in the context of food by developing a conceptual framework based on insights from the trust literature that explores the drivers and outcomes of consumer confidence in food quality and food safety. The conceptual framework is tested with a Structural Equation Model using survey data from a sample of Canadian consumers of fresh chicken. Model results indicate that both trust in the food industry (i.e., food companies and food retailers) and brand trust bolster consumer confidence in credence attributes. Furthermore, personal traits, such as risk aversion and ethically motivated behavior, moderate the relationship between brand trust and consumer confidence in credence qualities.","[Lassoued, Rim; Hobbs, Jill E.; Micheels, Eric T.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Bioresource Policy Business & Econ, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada; [Di Zhang, David] Univ Saskatchewan, Edwards Sch Business, Dept Management & Mkt, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A7, Canada",University of Saskatchewan; University of Saskatchewan,"Lassoued, R (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Bioresource Policy Business & Econ, 51 Campus Dr 3D34, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A8, Canada.",rim.lassoued@usask.ca; jill.hobbs@usask.ca; eric.micheels@usask.ca; zhang@edwards.usask.ca,"Lassoued, Rim/AAY-8263-2021; Micheels, Eric/R-2700-2019","Lassoued, Rim/0000-0002-7435-9935; Micheels, Eric/0000-0001-6974-6423; Hobbs, Jill/0000-0003-0357-6817","Consumer and Market Demand (CMD) network; Alliance for Food and Bioproducts Innovation (AFBI) program, Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture","Consumer and Market Demand (CMD) network; Alliance for Food and Bioproducts Innovation (AFBI) program, Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture","Funding for this research from the Consumer and Market Demand (CMD) network and the Alliance for Food and Bioproducts Innovation (AFBI) program, Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture, is gratefully acknowledged.",,71,8,9,4,87,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

This study is the first in the literature to evaluate the WASDE corn projections relative to futures adjusted forecasts throughout the forecasting cycle using a lengthy evaluation period (1980/81-2012/13). We find that WASDE projections provide lower RMSEs relative to futures adjusted forecasts for 9 of the 16 forecast periods, 4 of which are statistically different. Encompassing tests show that WASDE projections often provide incremental information not present in the futures adjusted forecasts. Composite forecasts based on futures adjusted forecasts and WASDE projections reduced the RMSEs over all forecast periods by an average 12-16%. Favorable average trading profits may be generated for some forecast months using WASDE projections. Overall, our results suggest that WASDE projections of the U.S. corn season-average price provide useful information to the market and could enhance the efficiency of the agricultural sector.","[Hoffman, Linwood A.] ERS, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Etienne, Xiaoli L.] W Virginia Univ, Div Resource Management, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA; [Irwin, Scott H.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Colino, Evelyn V.] Adm & Turismo Univ Nacl Rio Negro, Escuela Econ, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Toasa, Jose I.] Interamer Fdn, Representat Belize Guatemala & Panama, Washington, DC 20004 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); West Virginia University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Hoffman, LA (通讯作者)，ERS, USDA, Room 7-187B,1400 Independence Ave,SW, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",lhoffman@ers.usda.gov,"Irwin, Scott H./AAN-1996-2020; Etienne, Xiaoli/GQB-5494-2022; Irwin, Scott H./CAA-2702-2022","Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Etienne, Xiaoli/0000-0003-4519-9028",,,,,46,29,33,3,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

We use data on fruit and vegetable consumption frequency and different food retail availability measures, for example the number of food stores, food surface area, and a dispersion measure based on store numbers, store types, and food area surface, from several data sources in France. We also employ different types of geographic units when measuring the food retail environment and instrumental variable model specifications to test the robustness of our results, which indicate that fewer but larger retail outlets increase the odds of consuming the recommended level of fruit and vegetables.

While controlling for a wide range of educational, demographic, and other locational factors, we examine how long-term weather conditions and specific rainfall shocks influence a household's decision to engage in, and their earnings from, the off-farm labor market. We find that rural households engage in off-farm work as a long-term strategy to deal with the effects of anticipated weather conditions on their farming operations. The analysis does not reveal major short-term adjustments in off-farm engagement as a result of specific, unexpected rainfall shocks; these households do however rely on remittance income and petty agricultural wage labor under these circumstances. Holding other factors constant, and conditional on participation, households in areas with a more productive local agriculture tend to earn more from off-farm work especially in the informal/business sector than their counterparts in regions with a less productive agriculture. As expected, a vibrant local economy in the form of public investment increases the probability of off-farm participation.","[Mathenge, Mary K.] Egerton Univ, Tegemeo Inst Agr Policy & Dev, Nairobi, Kenya; [Tschirley, David L.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Egerton University; Michigan State University,"Mathenge, MK (通讯作者)，Egerton Univ, Tegemeo Inst Agr Policy & Dev, Kindaruma Lane,Ngong Rd,POB 20498-00200, Nairobi, Kenya.",mmathenge@tegemeo.org; tschirle@msu.anr.edu,,,,,,,36,21,25,5,59,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

This paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, high-rise housing complexes present complications in that the vertical dimension is important in purchase decisionsyet the spatial econometric literature has focused exclusively on two dimensions. We introduce a three-dimensional (3-D) spatial weights matrix to capture the potential for within project correlation among housing units located on different floors within a project. Second, a significant proportion of the world's population lives in urban high-rise buildings but the literature has, for the most part, completely ignored such markets. Test statistics support the use of a 3-D weight matrix; our application of the hedonic methodology to a dense, vertical housing market shows that it can be used to value amenities located within or adjacent to housing complex amenities. In our empirical example, though, we observe little difference in marginal valuation of amenities under a 3-D weight matrix relative to a standard 2-D weight matrix.","[Liu, Lu] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Jakus, Paul M.] Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Liu, L (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 555 Liu Tai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",liulu@swufe.edu.cn; paul.jakus@usu.edu,,"Jakus, Paul/0000-0001-9261-3709","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China [JBK140132]; Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, Utah State University, USA [8680]","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, Utah State University, USA","Supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China (JBK140132).

Indeed, it now represents the most prominent farm policy instrument, accounting for more government spending than any other farm commodity program. The 2014 Farm Bill further expanded the crop insurance program and introduced a number of new county-level revenue insurance plans. In 2013, over $123 billion in crop value was insured under the program. Crop revenue insurance, first introduced in the 1990s, now accounts for nearly 70% of the total liability in the program. The available plans cover losses that result from a revenue shortfall that can be triggered by multiple, dependent sources of risk-either low prices, low yields, or a combination of both. The actuarial practices currently applied when rating these plans essentially involve the application of a Gaussian copula model to the pricing of dependent risks. We evaluate the suitability of this assumption by considering a number of alternative copula models. In particular, we use combinations of pair-wise copulas of conditional distributions to model multiple sources of risk. We find that this approach is generally preferred by model-fitting criteria in the applications considered here. We demonstrate that alternative approaches to modeling dependencies in a portfolio of risks may have significant implications for premium rates in crop insurance.","[Goodwin, Barry K.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Goodwin, Barry K.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Hungerford, Ashley] USDA, ERS, Washington, DC USA",North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Goodwin, BK (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",barry_goodwin@ncsu.edu,"Chekalin, Vyacheslav/S-6391-2017",,,,,,35,70,88,7,95,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

First, we construct a series of the production-weighted average nominal rate of assistance for the whole sector. Then, we compute a measure of the level of assistance received by the Agriculture sector relative to that received by the Manufacturing sector, the Relative Rate of Assistance. Our results show that, from the time of Federation until the 1990s, the economy-wide pattern of industry assistance discriminated persistently and heavily against the Agriculture sector. The policy of protection all round' pursued by the Country/National Party did not prevent this discrimination. In particular, producers of exportables, such as wool and wheat, were heavily discriminated against. Both the intersectoral bias and the differences in assistance among agricultural producers lowered the incomes of the Agriculture sector and the national income.","[Lloyd, Peter; MacLaren, Donald] Univ Melbourne, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Lloyd, P (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",pjlloyd@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,28,11,11,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

This article analyses the impact of sales below cost on the negotiation outcomes in intermediate goods markets. Assuming that consumers have a sufficiently strong preference for one-stop shopping, we model below-cost pricing as the result of a profit-maximising cross-subsidisation strategy of a multi-product retailer. We find that below-cost pricing improves the supplier's bargaining position vis-a-vis the retailer. Correspondingly, the supplier of the loss-leader benefits from the retailer's below-cost pricing strategy, though the retailer is better off under a ban of sales below cost. These results disprove the often expressed fear that retailers use sales at a loss to squeeze wholesale prices.","[von Schlippenbach, Vanessa] Deutsch Inst Wirtschaftsforsch DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [von Schlippenbach, Vanessa] Univ Dusseldorf, DICE, Dusseldorf, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"von Schlippenbach, V (通讯作者)，Deutsch Inst Wirtschaftsforsch DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",vschlippenbach@diw.de,,,,,,,29,3,3,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

Three cases are considered: a benchmark consisting of a disease-free field, an identical field with the disease present but no resistant variety with which to replant, and an identical field with the disease present and a resistant variety with which to replant. We determine general decision rules and then apply the model to the case of Pudricion del Cogollo, a major disease threat to the Colombian oil palm industry. In the application, we compare the optimal rotation length between the three scenarios and determine the optimal level of control in each period for the disease scenarios. The singular solution involves complete control of the disease, and in the absence of a resistant variety, the presence of the disease increases the rotation length. With these solutions, we then determine the value of developing a resistant variety. This value depends heavily on the age distribution of the current trees and decreases as the average tree age decreases. The value further declines when the resistance variety has negative attributes such as higher replanting and maintenance costs than the original variety.","[Grogan, Kelly A.] Univ Florida, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Grogan, KA (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",kellyagrogan@ufl.edu,,"Mosquera, Mauricio/0000-0002-0637-7779",,,,,57,3,3,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

As a result, regressions of total caloric production on futures prices produce estimates of the supply elasticity that are biased downwards by up to 75%. Regressions of the world's growing area on futures prices have a much smaller bias of about 20% because although yield shocks are partially predictable, this predictability has a relatively small effect on land allocation. We argue that the preferred method for estimating the crop supply elasticity is to use regressions of growing area on futures prices and to include the realized yield shock as a control variable. An alternative method for bias reduction is to use instrumental variables (IVs). We show that the marginal contribution of an IV to bias reduction is small-IVs are not necessary for futures prices in supply analysis.","[Hendricks, Nathan P.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Janzen, Joseph P.] Montclair State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, Montclair, NJ 07043 USA; [Smith, Aaron] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Kansas State University; Montclair State University; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Hendricks, NP (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",nph@ksu.edu,,"Hendricks, Nathan/0000-0001-7301-8314",,,,,21,11,18,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The substantial regional differences will induce changes in agricultural interregional trade pattern. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the climate change impacts on China's agricultural interregional trade pattern. Design/methodology/approach - The paper will use the computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to assess the impacts of climate change on the PRC's agricultural interregional trade flows. The CGE model consists of seven Chinese regions and the rest of the world and six commodities. Findings - The results indicate that northwest, south, central, and northeast PRC will see increases in the outflows of agricultural products in 2030 and 2050. Conversely, outflows from east, north, and southwest PRC will decrease. Agricultural products handling and transportation facilities need to be repositioned to address the changes in agricultural trade flows. Originality/value - Studies on the impacts of climate change on the PRC's agriculture have been increasing. To the best of our knowledge, however, no previous studies have assessed the impacts of climate change on the PRC's agricultural interregional trade flows. This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature.","[Xin, Xian] China Agr Univ, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Lin, Tun; Wan, Guanghua] Asian Dev Bank, Manila, Philippines; [Liu, Xiaoyun] China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yongsheng] State Council, Res Dev Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; Asian Development Bank; China Agricultural University,"Xin, X (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",xinxian@cau.edu.cn,"Yang, Tian/JFB-1008-2023",,ADB [43068],ADB,This paper is part of the research work funded by ADB (Project No. 43068).,,19,0,0,3,61,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

From the beginning, but especially over the past 150 years, innovation has transformed agriculture and in doing so has contributed to the transformation of whole economies. The consequences have been profoundly important for lives and livelihoods, generally favourable, but almost always with some undesirable consequences for at least some people. Economic and policy issues arise because agricultural research is subject to various market failures, because the resulting innovations and technological changes have important economic consequences for net income and its distribution among individuals and among factors of production, and because the consequences are difficult to discern and attribute among causes. These issues have been studied by economists and documented in the literature on the economics of innovation in agriculture that began as such in the 1950s, around the time of the creation of the Australian Agricultural Economics Society. Members of that nascent society were early contributors to this emerging field of study and have played disproportionately significant roles in it over the ensuing decades.","[Alston, Julian M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Alston, Julian M.] Univ Calif Davis, Robert Mondavi Inst Ctr Wine Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Alston, Julian M.] Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Pardey, Philip G.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Pardey, Philip G.] Int Sci & Technol Practice & Policy InSTePP Ctr, St Paul, MN USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Alston, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Alston, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Robert Mondavi Inst Ctr Wine Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Alston, JM (通讯作者)，Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",julian@primal.ucdavis.edu,,"Pardey, Philip/0000-0002-8012-1341",,,,,63,11,11,2,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Composite density forecasts are constructed using linear and logarithmic combinations of the individual forecasts and several weighting schemes. Density forecasts are evaluated on predictive accuracy (sharpness), goodness of fit (calibration), and their economic value in a hedging simulation. Logarithmic combinations using equal and mean square error weights outperform all individual density forecasts and are modestly better than linear composites. Comparison of the outlook forecasts to the best composite demonstrates the usefulness of the composite procedure, and identifies the economic value that more accurate expected price probability distributions can provide to producers.","[Trujillo-Barrera, Andres] Wageningen Univ, Mkt & Consumer Behav Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Garcia, Philip; Mallory, Mindy L.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL USA",Wageningen University & Research; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Trujillo-Barrera, A (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Mkt & Consumer Behav Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands.",andres.trujillobarrera@wur.nl,,,,,,,38,4,4,4,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

In the estimation, annual price data for rice, wheat, and maize for a panel of developed and developing countries that are observed over the period of 1960-2007 are used. The results from a common factor framework to those that do not account for common factors are then compared.

In Indonesia, the world's leading palm oil producer, in addition to large companies, smallholder farmers are increasingly engaged in the oil palm sector. Smallholder oil palm cultivation may contribute to income gains and socio-economic development. However, land-use decisions by smallholders are not well understood. Without appropriate policies, negative social and environmental consequences can also occur. To improve the knowledge base, we use data about present and past land-use decisions from a survey of farm households in Sumatra. Employing duration models, we analyse the determinants and dynamics of oil palm adoption among smallholders. We find that independently operating farmers are currently driving growth rates in the oil palm sector. Smallholder adoption decisions are mainly attributable to regional and village level factors. While the current adoption primarily occurs outside of contracts, previous contractual ties between companies and other farmers in the same village play an important role for individual decisions. Beyond initial adoption, we also analyse later expansion decisions. While expanding the oil palm area subsequent to initial adoption is common among all types of adopters, those without previous contracts are found to expand significantly faster. We conclude that the concessions the government has allocated to palm oil companies in the past have initiated oil palm adoption in the small farm sector, but that the ensuing land-use dynamics are mostly beyond government control. Some wider implications are discussed.","[Euler, Michael; Schwarze, Stefan; Qaim, Matin] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany; [Siregar, Hermanto] Bogor Agr Univ IPB, Fac Econ & Management, Bogor, Indonesia",University of Gottingen; Bogor Agricultural University,"Euler, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Gottingen, Germany.",meuler@gwdg.de,"Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016; Schwarze, Stefan/P-7696-2019; Siregar, Hermanto/GPP-6687-2022","Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763; Schwarze, Stefan/0000-0002-1672-1246; Siregar, Hermanto/0000-0003-0913-6820; Euler, Michael/0000-0003-3697-8177",German Research Foundation (DFG) [CRC 990],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This study was financed by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in the framework of the EFForTS Project (CRC 990).

We formulate four approaches to producer compensation within the context of the Ontario Tobacco Transition Program, where producers would have suffered losses in the absence of compensation. The approaches range from providing zero compensation to providing compensation based on the entire value of the tobacco quota. The Canadian government chose the latter and compensated producers for the termination of the tobacco quota program based on an approach that far exceeded other possible compensation approaches.","[Schmitz, Andrew; Haynes, Dwayne J.] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Schmitz, Troy G.] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, Polytech Campus,Mail Code 2080,235K San Tan Hall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Arizona State University,"Schmitz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",aschmitz@ufl.edu; Nygator3@ufl.edu; Troy.Schmitz@asu.edu,,,,,,,27,3,3,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Existing evidence on the incidence of subsidies on cash rental rates is mixed. Identification is obscured by unobserved or imprecisely measured factors that tend to be correlated with subsidies, especially land quality and time-varying factors like commodity prices and adverse weather events. A problem that has received less attention is the fact that subsidies and land quality on rented land may differ from owned land. Since most farms possess both rented and owned acreage, farm-level measures of subsidies, land values, and rental rates may bias estimated incidence. Using a new, field-level data set that, for the first time, precisely links subsidies to land parcels, we show that this bias is considerable: where farm-level estimates suggest an incidence of 42-49 cents of the marginal subsidy dollar, field-level estimates from the same farms indicate that landlords capture just 20-28 cents. The size of the farm and the duration of the rental arrangement have substantial effects. Incidence falls by 5-15 cents when doubling total operated acres, and the incidence falls by 0.1-0.8 cents with each additional year of the rental arrangement. Low incidence of subsidies on rents combined with the farm-size and duration effects suggest that farmers renting land have monopsony power.","[Kirwan, Barrett E.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Roberts, Michael J.] UHERO, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Kirwan, BE (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",bkirwan@illinois.edu,,"Kirwan, Barrett/0000-0003-1994-2789; Roberts, Michael/0000-0002-1741-7780",Sea Grant at the University of Hawaii Manoa,Sea Grant at the University of Hawaii Manoa,"Barrett E.

Capturing the relationship between yield and weather factor(s) is the basis of index insurance, but remains a challenge for weather index schemes. Meanwhile, composite weather index insurance is needed by farmers when their agricultural activities involve several risks, but is rarely studied. We aim to design a composite weather index insurance model and evaluate its efficiency in hedging yield risk by using the case of rice production in China. We divide the whole growth cycle of rice into six stages on the basis of agronomic knowledge, and use the average value of each weather factor in each stage to design a weather index. Then, the efficiency of composite weather index insurance is evaluated by mean-semivariance and value-at-risk methods. First, we find that subdivision of the growth cycle helps to better capture the subtle relationship between rice yield and weather factors. Second, composite weather index insurance evidently reduces yield risk. Our findings help further adoption of weather index insurance in agricultural fields.","[Shi, Hong] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Zhihui] Australian Natl Univ, RSFAS, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Zhejiang University; Australian National University,"Shi, H (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",shi-hong919@126.com,,,,,,,33,17,20,10,93,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

It also determines if agricultural productivity growth in Canada has recently slowed down as indicated by earlier studies. The paper uses the stochastic frontier approach that incorporates inefficiency to decompose TFP growth into technical change (TC), scale effect (SE), and technical efficiency change. The results indicate that productivity changes were mainly driven by TCs for crops, while the productivity changes in livestock was mainly driven by SEs and technical progress. Though change in technical efficiency is mainly positive (except for New Brunswick and Nova Scotia), its contribution to productivity growth was very little for the provinces. We also found that over the entire period, the productivity growth rates for the crop subsector are on average higher for the Prairie provinces than for the Eastern and Atlantic provinces. On the other hand, the productivity growth rates in the livestock subsector are on average higher in the Eastern and Atlantic provinces than in the Prairie region with the exception of Manitoba. Finally, we found that though there is some evidence of a recent decline in productivity growth for the crops subsector, there is no such evidence in the livestock subsector. Dans le present article, nous examinons l'ecart de croissance de la productivite totale des facteurs (PTF) entre les provinces canadiennes dans les secteurs des cultures et de l'elevage pour la periode 1940-2009. Nous tentons egalement de determiner si la croissance de la productivite agricole au Canada a ralenti comme l'ont indique des etudes anterieures. Nous avons utilise le modele de frontiere stochastique qui inclut l'inefficience afin de decomposer la croissance de la PTF en divers elements tels que le progres technologique, l'effet d'echelle et l'efficience technique. Selon les resultats de notre etude, les ecarts de productivite dans le secteur des cultures sont principalement determines par le progres technologique tandis que dans le secteur de l'elevage, ils sont determines par l'effet d'echelle et le progres technologique. Bien que l'ecart d'efficience technique soit principalement positif (a l'exception du Nouveau-Brunswick et de la Nouvelle-Ecosse), sa contribution a la croissance de la productivite compte pour peu dans les provinces. Au cours de cette meme periode, le taux de croissance de la productivite du sous-secteur des cultures a ete en moyenne plus eleve dans les provinces des Prairies que dans les provinces de l'Est et de l'Atlantique. En revanche, le taux de croissance de la productivite du sous-secteur de l'elevage a ete plus eleve dans les provinces de l'Est et de l'Atlantique que dans les provinces des Prairies, a l'exception du Manitoba. Finalement, bien qu'il existe des signes de ralentissement recent de la croissance de la productivite dans le sous-secteur des cultures, il ne semble pas en exister dans le sous-secteur de l'elevage.","[Darku, Alexander Bilson] Univ Lethbridge, Prentice Inst Global Populat & Econ, 4401 Univ Dr W, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada; [Darku, Alexander Bilson; Malla, Stavroula; Tran, Kien C.] Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, 4401 Univ Dr W, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada",University of Lethbridge; University of Lethbridge,"Darku, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Lethbridge, Prentice Inst Global Populat & Econ, 4401 Univ Dr W, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.;Darku, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Lethbridge, Dept Econ, 4401 Univ Dr W, Lethbridge, AB T1K 3M4, Canada.",alexander.darku@uleth.ca; s.malla@uleth.ca; Kien.tran@uleth.ca,"Darku, Alexander B/E-8516-2017","Tran, Kien C./0000-0003-3155-341X",CAIRN Network,CAIRN Network,"We would like to thank a coeditor, B.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper phases in three empirical steps: analyzing highly disaggregated agri-food export data of China to 213 countries or economies and attempting to find some stylized facts; consecutively decomposing China's agri-food export volume into three trade margins and calculating each of them; based on an extended heterogeneity firm and trade model with the quality margin being introduced, investigating the source and pattern of China's agri-food export growth and the role of relevant determinants. Findings - The paper reveals that the relative quality upgrading explains most of the increase along the intensive margin, to which the relative price decrease has a negligible negative contribution. Simultaneously, the heterogeneity across products does matter, since the authors find that the relative quality improvement and relative product price decline are more prominent for the differentiated products with larger quantity expansion along the intensive margins. Originality/value - With quality upgrading dynamically, the authors attribute China's long-term agri-food export growth to the quantity penetration along the intensive margin. With the relative product price distinction reflecting factor costs and productivity differences across industries, the comparative quality upgrading in differentiated products might correlate with their upward production productivity.","[Tian, Dongwen; Hu, Na; Wang, Xin; Huang, Li] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",Beihang University,"Tian, DW (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",dwtian@buaa.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71173007]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [YWF-11-03-Q-475],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This paper is a partial fruit for project Decomposition of the export growth pattern of China -based on an extended heterogeneous firm trade model supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (71173007), and supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (YWF-11-03-Q-475).

Over the period to 2040, total energy use is projected to grow by almost 40 per cent, while the share of fossil fuels in the energy mix falls. Nonetheless, these fossil fuels remain the dominant sources of energy, with oil, coal and gas each accounting for around one quarter of global energy needs by 2040. Increasingly, modern renewables are projected to replace fossil fuels, especially in the power sector. Around 93 per cent of the projected increased primary energy demand comes from non-OECD countries, with two-thirds coming from developing Asia, led by China. By 2025, China could account for almost a quarter of global energy use, doubling its share since the turn of the century. After 2025, India and other Asian countries surpass China as the main centres of energy demand growth. The IEA's WEO 2014 concludes that even taking into account ambitious policy measures announced as of mid to late 2014, energy growth projections place the world on a path consistent with a long-term temperature increase of 3.6 degrees. Urgent action is required if the world's energy systems are to be steered towards lower greenhouse gas emissions.","Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Cronshaw, I (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",ian.cronshaw@gmail.com,,,,,,,3,50,52,6,133,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The results from a propensity score matching analysis reveal that farmers who joined before the incentive significantly improved their farm performance, as measured in gross margins and yields, while farmers who joined after the incentive did not significantly benefit from the extension programme.

Besides ethical concerns, two of the key criticisms relate to insensitivity to scope and order effects. We examine the expectation that the presence of order effects in stepwise disclosure procedures affects the degree of scope sensitivity. We use data from a CV exercise asking farmers in Southern Spain to value two different levels of guarantee of water supply for irrigation in a context of water scarcity. We find that despite order effects being present, they do not affect the existence or the degree of sensitivity to scope. We conclude that, in the light of the mixed evidence found in the literature and the results of our study, it does not seem justified to ascribe order effects and their connection with sensitivity to scope to study design alone (e.g. step-wise versus advanced disclosure, top-down versus bottom-up). The nature of the environmental good under valuation also matters. Our study of irrigation water as a common-pool resource suggests that, when clear private benefits also exist, these appear to override any good cause dumping effect' that might arise from the public good component.","[Martin-Ortega, Julia] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Dundee, Scotland; [Berbel, Julio] Univ Cordoba, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain",James Hutton Institute; Universidad de Cordoba,,aza-ecosur@gmail.com,"Mesa-Jurado, M.

There are variations of total factor productivity (TFP) growth across states and fluctuations over time within each state and territory. However, overall, there is a clear movement towards slower TFP growth across the sample period.

This article addresses this gap by establishing the economic impact associated with a hypothetical greenhouse gas environmental regulatory regime across major dairy producing counties in the United States. In doing so, the article makes three important contributions to the literature. First, it develops a comprehensive pollution index based on Environmental Protection Agency methodologies, which contrasts with previous studies that rely on partial measures based only on surplus nitrogen stemming from the over-application of fertilizer. Second, the article uses a directional output distance function, an approach that has not been employed previously to evaluate polluting technologies in the U.S. dairy sector. Third, the article incorporates a four-way error approach that accounts for unobserved county heterogeneity, time-invariant persistent technical efficiency, time-varying transient technical efficiency, and a random error. The results indicate that regulating greenhouse gas emissions from dairy farming would induce a 5-percentage point increase in average technical efficiency. In addition, the economic costs of implementing this hypothetical regulatory framework exhibit significant spatial variation across counties in the United States.","[Njuki, Eric; Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Bravo-Ureta, Boris E.] Univ Talca, Agr Econ, Talca, Chile",University of Connecticut; Universidad de Talca,"Njuki, E (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",eric.njuki@uconn.edu,,"Njuki, Eric/0000-0002-1000-4609","Agricultural Food Research Initiative, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, USDA [2011-67024-30912]; NIFA [579068, 2011-67024-30912] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","Agricultural Food Research Initiative, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, USDA; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","Eric Njuki is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of Connecticut.

As a key component of wheat handling in the Canadian grain industry, grading of wheat for value-added blending has historically been accomplished by visual identification. As of 2008 in Canada, visual identification was eliminated for all primary classes of wheat and replaced by an alternative system of wheat declaration. Given the high costs of testing each truck and railcar for quality assurance, the declaration system must rely on incentives and trust as there is now considerable potential for accidental or opportunistic misrepresentation throughout the grain supply chain. This research attempts to identify cost-effective handling strategies and policies so as to maintain the integrity of the supply chain under the new declaration system. An agent-based simulation model is developed to capture the effects of individual heterogeneity as well as behavioral adaption to the declaration system within the modern wheat supply chain. The simulated results are used to identify superior testing strategies for handlers, along with the relative risks and costs associated with each of the testing strategies. L'introduction de nouvelles generations de produits agricoles a accru le besoin de segregation fiable et efficace des produits issus de certaines activites du secteur agricole canadien. Le classement du ble destine a la preparation de melanges a valeur ajoutee, etape cle de la manutention du ble au sein de l'industrie cerealiere canadienne, s'effectuait par le passe a l'aide d'un systeme d'identification visuelle.

Compte tenu des couts substantiels lies a la verification des camions et des wagons pour l'assurance de la qualite, le nouveau systeme de declaration doit reposer sur des mesures incitatives et la confiance etant donne qu'il existe dorenavant un potentiel eleve d'accident ou de fausse declaration accidentelle ou opportuniste de la part des acteurs de la chaine d'approvisionnement des grains.

The purpose of this paper is to address the roles of trade and stock management in achieving food security in these countries, such as the impacts of trade on consumer and producer prices and incomes of farmers and others and implications for food security, and the impact of stock management on price stability, availability, access and nutrition. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on secondary data and literature on these issues. It compares the policy tools of trade and stock management used in India and China for food security purpose, in terms of long-term efficiency, in order to provide better understanding on how to achieve food security through public interventions. Findings - Although stock is an important tool for food security, it is likely to be costly if used for price support and redistribution purposes. Trade might provide cheap food to enhance access to food, the impact on domestic producers and the volatility in world market may lead to serious problems. A carefully designed policy combining stock management and trade may help achieving food security. Research limitations/implications - This paper relies on existing literature of current issues and policies, and tries to conduct comparative study on India and China, the two largest countries in the world. The scale and depth of the study are restricted by authors' knowledge, hence may not be adequate in addressing those important issues. Practical implications - Both India and China are undergoing policy review regarding food security, under pressures in domestic market and from multi-nation negotiations. This study may provide better understandings of the issues related to policy reform and trade negotiation. Originality/value - Though a large portion of factual materials are adopted from existing literature and statistics, the analyses are those of authors.","[Dev, S.

The authors investigated efficiency using both the input and output-oriented models with the assumption of a variable return to scale. They looked for causes of inefficiency and made recommendations for inefficient agricultural sectors. The results show that, in average, the EU agricultural sectors performed efficiently, as evidenced by the relatively high value of the average input and output efficiency. The efficiency of the EU agricultural sectors had changed over the past few years, and in both models the efficiency has generally decreased over time. As the main source of inefficiency was labelled the input total utilised agricultural area and as the strength with a positive impact on efficiency, there was labelled the crop output. By calculating the optimal values for the input and output variables for inefficient agricultural sectors, it has been found that for the efficient production of a given quantity of outputs, it was necessary to reduce the value of the in put total labour in average by 6.18%, the total utilised agricultural area in average by 14.45% and the total assets in average by 5.93%. In case of the output-oriented model for efficient use of a given quantity of inputs, the agricultural sectors should produce up to 111.85% of their crop output and 113.41% of their animal output.","Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Kocisová, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",kristina.kocisova@tuke.sk,"Kocisova, Kristina/AAA-5401-2020","Kocisova, Kristina/0000-0003-0784-441X",Slovak Scientific Grant Agency [VEGA 1/0446/15],Slovak Scientific Grant Agency(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),Supported by the Slovak Scientific Grant Agency as part of the research project VEGA 1/0446/15.,,32,43,43,0,19,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

These findings offer an explanation for the rise over time in U.S. farm wages. Concomitants of the agricultural transformation, including growth in the non-farm economy, falling birth rates, and an increase in rural education, accelerate the transition of rural Mexicans out of farm work. Higher U.S. farm wages and increased border enforcement slow the transition, but the combined impact of these offsetting variables is relatively small. A diminishing farm labor supply has far-reaching implications for farmers, farm labor organizers, rural communities, and agricultural workers.","[Charlton, Diane; Taylor, J.

This article develops an economic and econometric analysis of the dynamics of food demand. The model builds on duality and the benefit function. The research involves the specification and estimation of dynamic price-dependent demands as representations of marginal benefits. Applied to US aggregate data over the period 1948-2010, the analysis uncovers strong statistical evidence of demand dynamics, especially for food. We find that the negative effect of food consumption on the marginal benefit of food becomes much stronger in the long run. We also find that, while food and service are always complements, the strength of this complementarity relationship increases sharply in the longer run.","[Chavas, Jean-Paul] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Chavas, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jchavas@wisc.edu,,,"Graduate School at the University of Wisconsin, Madison","Graduate School at the University of Wisconsin, Madison","I would like to thank the Editor and three anonymous reviewers for useful comments on an earlier draft of the article.

We invited customers of a local supermarket who had selected a bottle of wine to purchase to participate in a valuation experiment. Integrating their original wine choice into the experiment, each participant evaluated six alternative wines, generating a rich set of data on willingness to pay and consumer characteristics. The data from the experiment allow us to compare standard shelf price-based wine attribute valuation estimates with estimates using WTP data and an increasing amount of information about individual consumers. The full model employs individual fixed effects to estimate WTP parameters without bias from consumer sorting or supply side influences. Our WTP estimates for wine attributes differ markedly from previous attribute value estimates. Consumers in our sample display clear and stable preferences for wine varieties, but less clear preferences for appellations. Our results suggest caution is needed in using market prices to estimate parameters of the consumer valuation function for product attributes.","[Gustafson, Christopher R.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Lybbert, Travis J.; Sumner, Daniel A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Sumner, Daniel A.] Univ Calif Davis, Agr Issues Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Gustafson, CR (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Agr Econ, 314A Filley Hall, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA.",cgustafson6@unl.edu,"Sumner, Dawn Y/E-8744-2011; Gustafson, Christopher/L-4248-2019","Gustafson, Christopher/0000-0001-6894-9456",,,,,50,29,35,1,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Yet the evidence for the effectiveness of programs that combine extension with matching grants is quite thin. We add to this evidence by evaluating the Uruguayan Livestock Program (ULP), a program that promoted the adoption of intensive management practices by small and medium-sized cattle producers by offering extension from private providers combined with matching grants for investments. Using inverse probability weighting as applied to an eight-year panel data set of cattle producers, we find that the ULP had large impacts on net sales and production of calves, but that program impacts on production and sales translated into modest net economic impacts overall. We examine the mechanisms that may have driven ULP impacts, and conclude that program impacts were likely caused by improved management practices rather than by loosening liquidity constraints on producers.","[Mullally, Conner] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Maffioli, Alessandro] Inter Amer Dev Bank, Competitiveness & Innovat Div, Washington, DC USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Inter-American Development Bank,"Mullally, C (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",connerm@ufl.edu,,"Mullally, Conner/0000-0001-5551-332X",,,,,30,6,6,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

We investigate whether these so called food deserts play a role in childhood obesity using a statewide panel data set of Arkansas elementary schoolchildren. We use fixed-effects panel data regression models to estimate the average food desert effect. We next compare children who left (entered) food deserts to children who were always (never) in food deserts and homogenize samples for those whose food desert status changed as a result of a change in residence and those whose status changed only as a consequence of the entry or exit of a supermarket. We present evidence that exposure to food deserts is associated with higher z-scores for body mass index. On average, this is in the neighborhood of 0.04 standard deviations. The strongest evidence and largest association is among urban students and especially those that transition into food deserts from non-deserts. Our food desert estimates are similar in magnitude to findings reported in earlier work on diet and lifestyle interventions targeting similarly aged schoolchildren. That said, we are unable to conclude that the estimated food desert effect is causal because many of the transitions into or out of food deserts result from a change in residence, an event that is endogenous to the child's household. However, there is evidence that food deserts are a risk indicator and that food desert areas may be obesogenic in ways that other low-income neighborhoods are not.","[Thomsen, Michael R.; Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Univ Arkansas, Div Agr, Food Policy Econ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Oslo, Norway; [Alviola, Pedro A.] Univ Philippines Mindanao, Sch Management, Mindanao, Philippines; [Alviola, Pedro A.] Univ Philippines Mindanao, Coll Sci & Math, Mindanao, Philippines; [Rouse, Heather L.] Arkansas Ctr Hlth Improvement, Hlth Policy Res, Little Rock, AR USA; [Rouse, Heather L.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Coll Med, Ctr Appl Res & Evaluat, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Korea University; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Mindanao; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Mindanao; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences,"Thomsen, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Div Agr, Food Policy Econ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",mthomsen@uark.edu,,"Alviola IV, Pedro/0000-0002-5519-5787; Rouse, Heather/0000-0002-0305-6259","Agriculture and Food Research Initiative from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2011-68001-30014]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2014S1A3A2044459]; Arkansas Biosciences Institute; NIFA [579813, 2011-68001-30014] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",Agriculture and Food Research Initiative from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Arkansas Biosciences Institute; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),This work was funded by the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant No. 2011-68001-30014 from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

We use panel data from the Rural Incomes and Livelihoods Surveys merged with a novel set of climatic variables based on geo-referenced historical rainfall and temperature data to explore the changing effects of these practices with climatic conditions. We estimate the impacts on maize yields, and also on the exhibition of very low yields and yield shortfalls from average levels, as indicators of resilience, while controlling for household characteristics. We find that minimum soil disturbance and crop rotation have no significant impact on these yield outcomes, but that legume intercropping significantly increases yields and reduces the probability of low yields even under critical weather stress during the growing season. We also find that the average positive impacts of modern input use (seeds and fertilisers) are significantly conditioned by climatic variables. Timely access to fertiliser emerges as one of the most robust determinants of yields and their resilience. These results have policy implications for targeted interventions to improve the productivity and the resilience of smallholder agriculture in Zambia in the face of climate change.","[Arslan, Aslihan] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Agr Dev Econ Div ESA, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [McCarthy, Nancy] LEAD Analyt Inc, Washington, DC USA; [Kokwe, Misael] FAO, Zambia Country Off, Climate Smart Agr, Lusaka, Zambia",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Arslan, A (通讯作者)，Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Agr Dev Econ Div ESA, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.",aslihan.arslan@fao.org,"Chekalin, Vyacheslav/S-6391-2017",,European Commission as part of project on Climate Smart Agriculture in Zambia,European Commission as part of project on Climate Smart Agriculture in Zambia,"The authors wish to acknowledge financial support from the European Commission as part of a project on Climate Smart Agriculture in Zambia.

Further trade liberalization would reduce emissions by cutting agricultural production but would not change production methods. Imposing a carbon tax would lead both to a reduction in output and the extensification of production.

To evaluate how, in this context, economic choices may alter crop yields, we first construct different fertilizer price scenarios to 2050 based on an econometric relation with oil and gas prices. Other possible scenarios, such as the continuation of historical trends, are also considered. The resulting changes in fertilizer price range between +0.8% and +3.6% per year over the 2005-2050 period. These scenarios are tested in a global land-use model incorporating an endogenous representation of the land-fertilizer substitution. We find that the supply-side response to rising fertilizer prices could lower crop yields in 2050 from -6% to -13%, with a corresponding increase in global cropland area ranging between 100 and 240 Mha if the demand for food and nonfood products has to be met.

Ruminations on Future Meat Demand in the Context of Global Warming,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,Climate change; elasticities; emissions intensities; meat demand; taxation,FOOD; CONSUMPTION; URBAN; MODEL,"This Address considers a range of issues relating to the contribution of meat consumption and livestock production to global warming, given the need highlighted by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) to reduce global GHG emissions by over 50% by 2050. The IPCC Climate Change 2014 report recognised that demand oriented measures may also contribute to GHG mitigation. The paper reviews a number of studies which examine demand-led mitigation potentials, and concludes that such estimates ignore the market effects of changes in meat consumption habits or demand oriented policies. A simple partial equilibrium model of beef, poultry, pig and ovine meats is developed for the major regions of the world to explore the impact of a range of scenarios which might reduce meat consumption and GHG emissions. These include emissions taxation, long-term trends in reduction of red meat consumption in developed economy regions, and supply side improvements in livestock emissions intensities. The paper discusses problems associated with many published demand elasticities suitable for incorporation into a market model, problems of selection from widely varying published estimates and their appropriateness for longer-run projections. The dearth of published supply elasticity estimates is also highlighted. The modelling concludes that economic and population growth to 2050 without any mitigation measures will lead to a 21% increase in per capita meat consumption and a 63% increase in total consumption and GHG emissions by 2050. However, the mitigation projections from the scenarios explored only generate a 14% reduction in cumulative emissions from the baseline 2050 projections, insufficient to meet the CCC target.","Harper Adams Univ, Agr & Food Econ, Newport TF10 8NB, Shrops, England",Harper Adams University,"Revell, BJ (通讯作者)，Harper Adams Univ, Agr & Food Econ, Newport TF10 8NB, Shrops, England.",bjrevell@harper-adams.ac.uk,,,,,,,73,38,45,4,96,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Instead of being treated as a binary attribute, three levels of USDA organic are considered: 100% organic, at least 95% organic, and made with organic ingredients (at least 70% organic). For local production, three levels are also included in the analysis: cross-state region (the Ohio Valley), state boundary (state-proud logos), as well as sub-state regions. Stated-preference data collected from a choice experiment in a mail survey in Kentucky and Ohio are used. Results from the study confirm positive willingness-to-pay for both organic and local attributes. However, consumers were willing to pay comparatively more for jam produced locally in regions smaller than the border of a state compared to organic jam. Furthermore, substitution and complementary effects between food attributes were investigated. The study found strong substitution effects between organic and local production claims, an issue that has thus far received minimal treatment in the existing literature on organic and local food willingness-to-pay studies. The results indicate a large degree of overlapping values in the willingness-to-pay for these two food attributes. In addition, the small farm attribute considered in the study also appears to be a substitute for organic and local attributes, which confirms the previous belief that one of the many reasons consumers purchase organic or local products is to support small or family-owned farms.","[Meas, Thong; Hu, Wuyang] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Meas, Thong] Nuppun Inst Econ Res, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Meas, Thong; Hu, Wuyang; Batte, Marvin T.; Woods, Timothy A.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Agr Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Ernst, Stan] Ohio State Univ Extens, Columbus, OH USA",Huazhong Agricultural University; University of Kentucky; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Hu, WY (通讯作者)，Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",wuyang.hu@uky.edu,,,"National Research Initiative of the US Department of Agriculture, Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service [2005-35618-15646]; Fred N.

The model is applied to the case of a hypothetical outbreak in Canada to capture changes in producer profits, consumer price, and government costs due to the outbreak and sums these to measure changes in total economic welfare of the beef industry.

Rural tourism could contribute to the rural sustainable development through small local businesses valorising the natural, cultural and ethnographic resources. However, most of them need the financial support from private creditors (banks). The survey-based research conducted among banks' representatives has identified several strengths of small rural ventures, such as the small scale and the associated risks, the endurance to external shocks, the openness to market opportunities, as well as some of their weaknesses: e.g. a poor management experience, seasonality etc. We have also identified the actions necessary to be performed by these firms to attract financial resources from the banks' side, i.e. the diversification of income sources, the association and the adherence to recognized brands and maintaining a reasonable leverage ratio. It was found that the bank's size does not matter, but the nature of the bank's capital does: the private domestic banks are more willing to finance such businesses. The banks' involvement in co-financing the EU projects could be a way to foster and strengthen the rural businesses.","[Badulescu, Daniel; Badulescu, Alina] Univ Oradea, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Econ, Oradea 410087, Romania; [Giurgiu, Adriana] Univ Oradea, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Int Business, Oradea 410087, Romania; [Istudor, Nicolae] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Agrifood & Environm Econ, Dept Agrifood & Environm Econ, Bucharest, Romania",University of Oradea; University of Oradea; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Badulescu, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oradea, Fac Econ Sci, Str Univ 1, Oradea 410087, Romania.",dbadulescu@uoradea.ro,"GIURGIU, Adriana/AAL-1789-2021; Istudor, Nicolae/AAW-2872-2020; Badulescu, Daniel/O-4877-2017; Badulescu, Alina/B-6477-2015; Badulescu, Alina/AAC-4228-2020","Badulescu, Daniel/0000-0001-8653-0149; Badulescu, Alina/0000-0002-0090-9340; Istudor, Nicolae/0000-0002-4581-4548",,,,,27,18,19,7,86,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

We develop a novel database of SPS treatments affecting United States exports of nine fresh fruits and vegetables and a formal econometric model to investigate the traderestricting nature of these measures. The results suggest that SPS treatments generally reduce trade, but the actual restrictiveness of these measures diminishes as U.S. exporters accumulate treatment experience and vanishes when exporters reach a certain threshold.","[Grant, Jason H.; Peterson, Everett; Ramniceanu, Radu] Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Grant, JH (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",,,,"U.S. Dept. of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA); Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station; Hatch Program of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture","U.S. Dept. of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA); Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station; Hatch Program of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture","Funding by the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is gratefully acknowledged.

The focus of the re search was put on the evaluation of both the state of the BI, and the relevant business information systems and software for agriculture. There was a survey among 135 agricultural entrepreneurs from various regions in the Czech Republic. The survey results are presented by the descriptive statistics and frequency tables. There is an examination of the relationship between the agricultural enterprise structure and the use of the BI. Dependencies among the examined characteristics were sought by the means of the analysis of qualitative variables. With 95% probability, it could be claimed that the type of production, the size of farmed land, the number of employees and the level of financial subsidies have no significant impact on using the BI, the expert and analytical systems in agricultural enterprises.","[Tyrychtr, Jan; Ulman, Milos] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat Technol, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic; [Vostrovsky, Vaclav] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Software Engn, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Tyrychtr, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",tyrychtr@pef.czu.cz; ulman@pef.czu.cz; vostrovsky@pef.czu.cz,"Ulman, Milos/F-4374-2017; Tyrychtr, Jan/A-1873-2017; Vostrovsky, Vaclav/H-8249-2018","Ulman, Milos/0000-0001-9556-7672; Tyrychtr, Jan/0000-0001-9952-2180; Vostrovsky, Vaclav/0000-0003-4228-0859","Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague [20141040]","Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague","The results and knowledge included herein have been obtained owing to the support from the Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Economics and Management, Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague, grant No. 20141040, Nove metody pro podporu ridicich pracovniku v zemedelstvi.",,36,13,14,1,39,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

By far the largest share of model development and analysis has been sponsored by government and conducted in the public sector, but in more recent years, there has been some shift into the private sector.

Applying time series methods to a sample of 259 monthly observations over the 1990(9)-2012(3) period we find substantial and significant long-term partial elasticities for domestic food price inflation with respect to world food commodity prices, the exchange rate and oil prices (the latter indirectly via a relationship with world food commodity prices). Domestic demand pressures and food chain costs are found to be less substantial and significant over our data period. Interactions between the main driving variables in the system tend to moderate rather than exacerbate these partial effects.

However, the determinants of a farm's entry and exit decisions in the insurance market have received relatively little attention. Turnover in the insurance book of business is an important issue in most private and public crop insurance plans. Moreover, insurance markets in the EU are still largely under-investigated. We investigate empirically the determinants of crop insurance participation in Italy. We show that the participation rate is high for large firms and that it is negatively correlated with crop diversification, which is itself a form of insurance. High premiums tend to inhibit both entry and exit from the insurance market. Larger and wealthier farms are more likely to adopt insurance and renew coverage over time. We discuss implications of our results for public intervention and the private industry. In particular, we demonstrate that the decision to drop coverage by an insured grower may differ significantly from the corresponding decision to enroll in an insurance programme by an uninsured farmer.

The study uses a mediation analysis framework to map the pathways through which institutional credit relates to agricultural GDP relying on a control function approach to tackle the problem of endogeneity. The findings from the analysis suggest that over this period, all the inputs are highly responsive to an increase in institutional credit to agriculture. A 10% increase in credit flow in nominal terms leads to an increase by 1.7% in fertilizers (N, P, K) consumption in physical quantities, 5.1% increase in the tonnes of pesticides, 10.8% increase in tractor purchases. Overall, it seems quite clear that input use is sensitive to credit flow, whereas GDP of agriculture is not. Credit seems therefore to be an enabling input, but one whose effectiveness is undermined by low technical efficiency and productivity.","[Narayanan, Sudha] Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India",,"Narayanan, S (通讯作者)，Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Bombay 400065, Maharashtra, India.",sudha@igidr.ac.in,"narayanan, sudha/AER-4494-2022","narayanan, sudha/0000-0003-1048-2341","Department of Economic Analysis and Research (DEAR), NABARD","Department of Economic Analysis and Research (DEAR), NABARD","This study was funded by the Research and Development (R&D) fund of the Department of Economic Analysis and Research (DEAR), NABARD.

We develop a microeconomic Agricultural Household Model, which can model the production, consumption, and nonfarm labor supply decisions of agricultural households in rural China in a theoretically consistent fashion. Based on this theoretical model, we derive an empirical specification, which we econometrically estimate using the Hausman-Taylor method and a large longitudinal farm household data set. The empirical results significantly differ between regions, but are generally consistent with the results of our theoretical comparative static analysis, for example, that the SLCP significantly decreases agricultural production. While the SLCP only increases nonfarm labor supply and total consumption in some regions, these effects could not be observed in others. The recent reduction of the SLCP compensation payment rates generally had negligible effects on agricultural production and off-farm work and only very small effects on household consumption.","[Liu, Zhen] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Business, 1 Wenyuan Rd, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Henningsen, Arne] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",Nanjing Normal University; University of Copenhagen,"Liu, Z (通讯作者)，Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Business, 1 Wenyuan Rd, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zhenliu_cn@yahoo.com,"Henningsen, Arne/I-8113-2013","Henningsen, Arne/0000-0002-6720-0264",Economics and Development Research Centre of the Chinese State Forestry Administration; National Science Foundation of China [NSFC: 71403125]; Chinese Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [SK2014005],Economics and Development Research Centre of the Chinese State Forestry Administration; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,"This work was supported by the Economics and Development Research Centre of the Chinese State Forestry Administration, the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC: 71403125), and the Chinese Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (SK2014005).

However, empirical evidence finds that these assumptions are frequently violated, impacting on willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. Because the cost attribute plays a key role in CEs used for environmental valuation, this study focuses on the impact of inconsistent choices with respect to cost on WTP, drawing on data from a survey aimed at valuing the environmental and social impacts of organic farming in mountainous olive orchards. An iterative process is used to identify inconsistent choices. Results provide sufficient evidence to suggest that inconsistencies can considerably bias WTP estimates. We propose that identifying and considering inconsistent choices enhances realism and accuracy of the conclusions drawn from CEs in environmental valuation.","[Colombo, Sergio; Rocamora-Montiel, Beatriz] IFAPA, Granada, Spain; [Glenk, Klaus] SRUC, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",,"Colombo, S (通讯作者)，IFAPA, Granada, Spain.",sergio.colombo@juntadeandalucia.es,"Colombo, Sergio/D-2143-2011; Glenk, Klaus/B-8743-2014; Colombo, Sergio/IXD-1645-2023","Colombo, Sergio/0000-0001-7307-9811; Glenk, Klaus/0000-0002-2472-0235;","National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology INIA [RTA2009-00024-00-00]; FEDER fund; Andalusian Council of Economy Innovation Science and Employment (CEICE) [P11-AGR-7515]; Ministry of Innovation and Competitiveness; Scottish Government Rural Affairs; Environment Portfolio Strategic Research Programme, Theme 3 (Land Use)","National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology INIA(Instituto de Investigacion Agropecuaria (INIA)); FEDER fund; Andalusian Council of Economy Innovation Science and Employment (CEICE); Ministry of Innovation and Competitiveness; Scottish Government Rural Affairs; Environment Portfolio Strategic Research Programme, Theme 3 (Land Use)","This study was financed by project RTA2009-00024-00-00, funded by the National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology INIA and co-funded by the FEDER fund, and by project P11-AGR-7515, funded by Andalusian Council of Economy Innovation Science and Employment (CEICE) and the Ministry of Innovation and Competitiveness.

However, much of this literature is based on forward-looking ex-ante analyses and few studies provide empirical evidence on its actual impact. We fill in this gap by evaluating empirically the welfare effects of China's actual tariff liberalisation on Chinese farmers during the 1997-2010 period. By estimating the domestic market price effects of China's tariff liberalisation and the associated wage earning effects, we find that on average Chinese farmers were able to gain more from reduced consumption prices than they would lose from reduced agricultural and wage income due to tariff liberalisation. Welfare gains over time are estimated to be positively correlated with the actual degrees of tariff liberalisation, implying that relatively more gains were realized immediately before and after China's WTO accession in 2001, as compared to the more recent period when relatively little liberalisation was carried out. Farmers' rising non-agricultural income and increasing consumption shares of non-agricultural products are important determinants of these positive average welfare effects. Moreover, welfare gains from tariff liberalisation are shown to be distributed unevenly across Chinese provinces and income levels, with farmers located in coastal provinces and at higher income levels gaining more than their counterparts in remote provinces and at lower income levels.","[Zhu, Jing] Nanjing Agr Univ, China Ctr Food Secur Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jing] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yu, Wusheng] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Wang, Junying] Xingtai Coll, Xingtai, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Elleby, Christian] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",Nanjing Agricultural University; Nanjing Agricultural University; University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen,"Yu, WS (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark.",wusheng@ifro.ku.dk,"Elleby, Christian/P-4197-2019; zhang, xinyu/JKI-8403-2023; Wang, Jiacheng/ABE-5948-2020; li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; Yu, Wusheng/E-4626-2015","Elleby, Christian/0000-0002-2955-6438; Wang, Jiacheng/0000-0003-4327-1508; Yu, Wusheng/0000-0002-2311-3759",PAPD of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; NSFC [71173111],PAPD of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Zhu is with the China Center for Food Security Studies, Nanjing Agricultural University, and College of Economics and Management, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.

The analytical tool has been applied to the Lithuanian FADN database for 2003 and 2012. The research revealed that the FRSI in 2003 and 2012 fell within the medium sustainability interval in all analysed farm size classes. The best sustainability situation in the year 2003 was determined on the large-sized farms, while the best sustainability situation in the year 2012 was established on the mid-sized farms.","[Vitunskiene, Vlada; Dabkiene, Vida] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Econ Accounting & Finance, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Vitunskiene, V (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Inst Econ Accounting & Finance, Kaunas, Lithuania.",vlada.vitunskiene@asu.lt,"Vitunskiene, Vlada/ABB-0505-2022; Dabkienė, Vida/AAO-5927-2021","Dabkienė, Vida/0000-0003-4902-5535; Vitunskiene, Vlada/0000-0001-8435-2932",,,,,29,13,14,1,18,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper elaborates the theoretical interconnection between food security and international trade and then utilize an autoregressive distributed lag model to investigate how/whether trade affects food security in China from two dimensions. Findings - The authors find that international trade indeed leads China to increase its dependence on food imports, namely, it negatively affects the food security in China. Owing to the importance of food security under multilateral trade system, this paper then briefly analyzes two relevant topics of Doha Round negotiation, i.e. public stockholding for food security and special safeguard measures. It is proposed that WTO members should support the food self-sufficiency endeavors of developing countries and appropriately exempt them from rigid discipline of domestic support and market access. Originality/value - This paper discusses the interaction of international trade and food security in various aspects. Empirical study shows that increasing dependence on food imports will negatively impact the food security of China. It is concluded that WTO members should support the food self-sufficiency endeavors of developing countries and appropriately exempt them from rigid discipline of domestic support and market access.","[Zhu, Yu] China Jiliang Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",China Jiliang University,"Zhu, Y (通讯作者)，China Jiliang Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",judy2003@sohu.com,,,,,,,22,14,18,7,87,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

These models predict that consumers will respond to changes in price in a way that is independent of the source of the price change. Yet research in the behavioral sciences indicates that consumers that are emotionally attached to a consumption good or other behavior might respond with resistance when policies threaten their consumption or behavior. Moreover, policies that in fact validate some emotional attachments can stir a stronger preference for the good or behavior. Reviewing both survey and experimental data from the literature, we demonstrate how such emotional responses can create hidden costs to policy implementation that could not be detected using standard welfare economic techniques. Building upon Rabin's work on fairness in games, we propose a partial equilibrium model of emotional response to policy whereby preferences are endogenous to policy choices. In accordance with evidence both from our own analysis and the field, we propose that confrontational policies (such as a sin tax) increase the marginal utility for a good, and that validating policies (such as a subsidy) also increases the marginal utility for a good. A social planner that ignores potential emotional responses to policy changes may unwittingly induce significant dead weight loss. Using our model, we propose a feasible method to determine if emotional deadweight costs exist, and to place a lower bound on the size of these costs.","[Just, David R.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Hanks, Andrew S.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Cornell University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Just, DR (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",djust@cornell.edu,"Hanks, Andrew Stephen/B-7807-2015; Just, David R/K-7302-2012","Hanks, Andrew/0000-0003-0687-4772",,,,,37,19,23,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

A restricted, weighted, two-way fixed effects model is specified for estimating the geographical structure and performance effects. Results indicate a growing concentration among a few exporting countries in the global rice market, and the competitiveness effect is often significant.

In particular, it is argued that the Vietnamese Food Agency, along with VINAFOOD-1 and VINAFOOD-2, have been structured so that they can benefit from the domestic demands for export restrictions anticipated to occur as a consequence of international price volatility and the psychological demand of consumers for price stability. In turn, the actions of these agencies also contribute to international price volatility and the resulting demand for export restrictions. Since the political and economic elite in Vietnam obtain both political and economic power from this system, it is unlikely to be replaced with more effective and efficient policies to combat domestic price volatility. Thus, continued volatility in the price of rice can be expected.","[Fulton, Murray E.; Reynolds, Travis] Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Fulton, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Johnson Shoyama Grad Sch Publ Policy, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada.",Murrray.Fulton@usask.ca,,"Fulton, Murray/0000-0002-0351-5531",Structure and Performance of Agriculture and Agri-products (SPAA) Industry Network; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada,Structure and Performance of Agriculture and Agri-products (SPAA) Industry Network; Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada),"Murray Fulton is a professor and Travis Reynolds is a PhD student in the Johnson-Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy, University of Saskatchewan.

This article uses the case of groundnut variety adoption in Uganda to investigate the role of information, seed supply, and credit constraints in conditioning technology uptake. New data from a household survey in seven groundnut growing districts (n = 945) indicate that 8% of farmers lack information on new varieties, while 18% and 6% of farmers, respectively, cannot adopt mainly due to seed supply and capital constraints. A tobit-type specification that considers all nonadopters as being uninterested in the technology (i.e., corner solutions) would lead to inconsistent parameter estimates and incorrect conclusions in this context. We therefore estimate a modified multi-hurdle specification of demand for new varieties, taking into account how information, seed supply, and capital constraints jointly determine adoption probability and intensity. The study reveals new empirical insights on why agricultural technology adoption in Africa has lagged behind: slow uptake is not mainly due to a lack of economic incentives, but rather a reflection of information, seed supply, and credit constraints that prevent farmers from translating their desired demand into adoption of modern varieties. Policy implications are discussed.","[Shiferaw, Bekele] Partnership Econ Policy PEP, Nairobi, Kenya; [Kebede, Tewodros] Inst Appl Int Studies FAFO, N-0608 Oslo, Norway; [Kassie, Menale; Fisher, Monica] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Shiferaw, B (通讯作者)，Partnership Econ Policy PEP, POB 3077200100, Nairobi, Kenya.",b.shiferaw@pep-net.org,"Chekalin, Vyacheslav/S-6391-2017; Kassie, Menale/ADT-2906-2022","Kassie, Menale/0000-0002-6754-2432; Fisher, Monica/0000-0002-6669-6261; Shiferaw, Bekele/0000-0002-3645-320X",,,,,34,78,88,2,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

We analyse how their preferences vary according to the risk reduction method. Our comparison is between risk reductions achieved by conventional improvements in the meat supply chain system (e.g. more stringent regulations and inspection regimes), and risk reductions achieved by food packaging nanosensors. Our comparison uses a two-treatment discrete choice experiment in which each treatment sample is only presented with one of the risk reductions: either nanotechnology or conventional methods. We also investigate heterogeneity in preferences for two consumer groups: (i) consumers who usually buy conventional raw, whole chickens, and (ii) consumers who usually buy niche, welfare-improved chickens, such as free-range and organic. Our results show evidence of heterogeneity in preferences and willingness- to-pay values of the both consumer groups. We find that consumers, on average, prefer raw, whole chicken with a lower risk of food poisoning, better animal welfare, and lower costs, regardless of the presence of nanosensors. Although consumers in general showed no strong preferences towards or resistance to nanotechnology, those who buy chickens with better animal welfare, on average, showed higher WTP for food risk reduction and animal welfare relative to conventional chicken consumers.","Univ Stirling, Econ Div, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Erdem, S (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Econ Div, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",seda.erdem@stir.ac.uk,"Erdem, Seda/B-7225-2014","Erdem, Seda/0000-0002-4296-5834",Rural Economy and Land Use Programme of the UK Research Councils [RES-229-31-0003]; Department of Economics at the University of Manchester,Rural Economy and Land Use Programme of the UK Research Councils; Department of Economics at the University of Manchester,"Seda Erdem is with the Economics Division, Stirling Management School, University of Stirling, UK.

However, heterogeneity in farmer reservation prices suggests that agglomerations or hot spots of feedstock supply could arise at local or regional levels.","[Mooney, Daniel F.; Barham, Bradford L.; Lian, Chang] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Mooney, DF (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",dfmooney@wisc.edu,"Mooney, Daniel/AAC-5566-2022; Mooney, Daniel F/E-6264-2011","Mooney, Daniel/0000-0002-5056-9102;",Sun Grant Initiative (DOE EERE) [3TC162]; U.S. Department of Energy Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (DOE Office of Science BER) [DEFC02-07ER64494]; Thomsen Wisconsin Distinguished Graduate Fellowship in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,Sun Grant Initiative (DOE EERE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Department of Energy Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (DOE Office of Science BER)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Thomsen Wisconsin Distinguished Graduate Fellowship in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,"The authors thank two anonymous reviewers and editor Terrance Hurley for helpful comments that improved the manuscript.

In this article, I study women's empowerment in northern Mozambique as it relates to agriculture, considering in particular the factors associated with women managing the plots that they nominally control. Women control about 30% of the plots in the data, but only manage about 70% of those plots. Using a unique panel data set, I find that women are more likely to manage plots when households have had historic access to off-farm labor, typically completed by men. When women manage plots, they tend to grow crops with less complicated production techniques and are less likely to grow the main area cash crop. However, conditional on historic access to off-farm labor their farm incomes are the same as among men.","Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"de Brauw, A (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",a.debrauw@cgiar.org,,,,,,,38,26,34,0,21,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

While diversification was commonly demonstrated to be an effective means to reduce risk in most previous studies, our empirical results indicate that, in facing anticipated risks from bad weather, Chinese maize farmers tend to use fewer new varieties and allocate more land to old varieties. The lack of knowledge about weather tolerance of new varieties might be the major reason for this practice. As new varieties often have higher yield potential relative to old varieties due to technological progress, this finding suggests that Chinese maize farmers might be trading yield potential against risk reduction from bad weather. Furthermore, this study shows that maize farmers' variety adoption is significantly related to farmers' land conditions as well as their access to credit markets and technique extensions, suggesting that a well-designed policy intervention could offset or partially offset the anticipation of adverse weather impacts on farmers' variety choices and therefore on maize production.","[Bai, Junfei] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zhigang] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Huanguang] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Haiyan] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA",China Agricultural University; Nanjing Agricultural University; Renmin University of China; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Bai, JF (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",zgxu@njau.edu.cn,"Xu, Zhigang/B-4370-2017; cheng, chen/JHS-9462-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71173204, 71273009, 71222302]; China Agricultural Research System [nycytx-02]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Agricultural Research System,The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (71173204; 71273009; 71222302) and China Agricultural Research System (nycytx-02).

Because of communities' remoteness and poor communications with marketplaces, farmers' uncertainty about market prices is usually high. Traders may take advantage of farmers' ignorance of the market price and extract a rent from them by offering very low prices for their products. In this article, we model bargaining interactions between farmers and traders meeting at the farmgate and we study how price information affects the bargain and the balance of power. We show the conditions for Market Information Services (MIS) to be profitable for farmers and examine efficiency issues associated with asymmetric information. Finally, we test the model's prediction that information results in positive individual gain for farmers using original survey data collected in the Northern region of Ghana. Specifically, we estimate the causal effect of a mobile-based MIS program on farmers' marketing performances and find that farmers who have benefited from the MIS program received significantly higher prices for maize and groundnuts: about 10% more for maize and 7% more for groundnuts than what they would have received had they not participated in the MIS program. These results suggest that the theoretical conditions for successful farmer use of MIS may be met in the field.","[Courtois, Pierre] LAMETA, French Inst Res Agr, INRA, UMR 1135, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Subervie, Julie] MOISA, French Inst Res Agr, INRA, UMR 1110, F-34000 Montpellier, France",INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; INRAE,"Subervie, J (通讯作者)，MOISA, French Inst Res Agr, INRA, UMR 1110, F-34000 Montpellier, France.",subervie@supagro.inra.fr,,"courtois, pierre/0000-0002-3997-828X",French Agency for Development (AFD); Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA),French Agency for Development (AFD)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA),"Pierre Courtois is researcher at INRA, the French Institute for Research in Agriculture, UMR 1135 LAMETA, F-34000 Montpellier, France.

Using farm survey data from Australia's southern Murray-Darling Basin, one of the most active water markets in the world, we tested the relationship between farmers' exposure to risk and their decisions to purchase and sell water allocations (temporary water) on the market. Farmers experiencing higher variability in profit and facing more downside risk purchased greater volumes of water allocations in general. Purchasing water allocations on the market is found to be a risk-reducing strategy, in particular for farmers in the horticultural sector.

In China, the matter of energy security may be immediately transmitted to the food security, imposing a pressure to China's macro-economy to a certain extent. This paper examines the long-run and short-run influence caused by the world crude oil prices and the RMB-dollar exchange rate on the five individual agricultural commodity prices (soybean, maize, wheat, colza oil, and japonica rice) in China. In this paper, the Granger causality approach is applied to test the long-run interrelationships with the weekly data from June 2002 to August 2013. In addition, the impulse-response analysis is utilized to study how the agricultural prices react to the sudden shocks in oil prices and exchange rate in the short term. The results reveal that the impulse response curves demonstrate that agricultural prices are not significantly affected by the abrupt changes in either oil prices or the exchange rate. Consistently, agricultural prices are neutral to the changes in oil prices in the long run while the exchange rate only Granger causes the prices of soybean. Ultimately, we present some sound reasons to explain the statistical results and propose some policy suggestions aimed at the China's food and energy security.","[Ma, Zhengwei; Dong, Xiucheng] China Univ Petr, Sch Business Adm, 18 Fuxue Rd, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Xu, Rui] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Business Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China",China University of Petroleum; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Ma, ZW (通讯作者)，China Univ Petr, Sch Business Adm, 18 Fuxue Rd, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China.",ma_zhengwei@163.com,"xu, rui/GRX-5734-2022","dong, xiucheng/0000-0002-4597-0356",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273277]; Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars; State Education Ministry [2013693],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars); State Education Ministry,"I would like to express my deepest appreciation to all who have helped me to complete this study.

This article examines purchases of whole grain products before and after the change. Nielsen Homescan panel data from 2008 to 2010 provide information on households' food purchases, demographics, and self-reported WIC participation status. We estimate the effect of WIC participation and the 2009 package change on whole grains purchases using a difference-in-difference method, and find that participation in the WIC program was associated with more whole grain purchases during the observed period; the package change in 2009 roughly doubled the associated effect of WIC participation on the purchases of whole grain products. These results are consistent with recommendations in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and suggest that moderate innovations in the design of food assistance programs can lead to beneficial dietary choices.","[Oh, Miyoung; Jensen, Helen H.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Jensen, Helen H.] Iowa State Univ, CARD, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Rahkovsky, Ilya] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC USA",Iowa State University; Iowa State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Jensen, HH (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.;Jensen, HH (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, CARD, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",hhjensen@iastate.edu,,,Iowa State University [58-5000-8-0104]; ERS [58-5000-8-0104],Iowa State University; ERS,"Miyoung Oh is a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Economics, Iowa State University, Helen Jensen is a professor in the Department of Economics and the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development (CARD) at Iowa State University, and Ilya Rahkovsky is an economist with the Economic Research Service (ERS) USDA.

Using an innovative methodology which combines a value chain approach with input-output-analysis, the growth multipliers and productivity of both farm types in Guatemala are analyzed. Results show that smallholder agriculture has the same potential to stimulate output growth as large-scale agriculture. Smallholder value chains include mainly informal sectors and create more jobs than commercial agriculture. Therefore, a reorientation of agricultural and land policies toward small-scale food producers and within a comprehensive policy of integrated rural development is not only necessary in terms of social equity but also for boosting economic development.","[Duerr, Jochen] Univ Kassel, Fac Organ Agr Sci, Dept Dev Econ Migrat & Agr Policies, Steinstr 19, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Dürr, J (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Fac Organ Agr Sci, Dept Dev Econ Migrat & Agr Policies, Steinstr 19, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany.",jochenduerr@gmx.de,,,,,,,35,19,21,3,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Using the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) data, we compare net rice buyers and sellers to self-sufficient households. To identify the effect of rice price changes on household consumption of rice, nonrice food and nonfood items, we employ a difference-in-differences (DiD) technique. Our findings indicate that the surge in domestic rice prices between 2005 and 2010 reduced the nonrice food consumption of net rice buyer households by 7%, compared to the households who are self-sufficient in rice production. However, it did neither affect their rice nor their nonfood consumption. In contrast, while we find no significant effect of rice price increases on the rice consumption of net rice sellers, we observe a 9% increase in their nonrice food consumption. In such situation, a subsidy on low-quality rice may be effective in fulfilling the nutritional requirement of low-income households.","[Hasan, Syed Abul] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Hasan, SA (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",hasanandassociates@yahoo.com,"Hasan, Syed Abul/S-5065-2019","Hasan, Syed Abul/0000-0002-7439-9400",,,,,39,10,11,2,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

By comparing the intergenerational lock-in effects of religious belief with that of non-religious belief, the purpose of this paper is to explain why more and more peasants convert to religion especially Christianity in China. Design/methodology/approach - Data used in this paper comes from a field survey conducted in villages, Funan county. The samples were obtained by the two-stage cluster probability proportional sampling method. Based on the collected survey data, econometric model on the intergenerational lock-in effects of belief was constructed and used for analysis. Findings - Compared with non-religious believers, religious believers can transmit their beliefs more successfully. In addition, the intergenerational lock-in effects of religious beliefs is weakened by oblique socialization in contemporary rural China. Originality/value - This is the first paper focussing on intergenerational transmission of belief in rural China; although many researchers did careful analyses on effects of parents' belief or religiosity on children's belief or religiosity in the West, few of them compared the success of intergenerational transmission between different beliefs. This paper fills this gap; as an interdisciplinary study, this paper tries to study religion in economics analysis approaches. This attempt extends research field in Economics and at the same time enriches analysis tools in Religion.","[Ruan, Rongping; Zheng, Fengtian] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang Xiuhua] Baylor Univ, Dept Sociol, Waco, TX 76798 USA",Renmin University of China; Baylor University,"Zheng, FT (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zft2000@126.com,"Wang, Xiuhua/AAV-9555-2021; Wang, Xiuhua/AAV-4507-2020",,"John Templeton foundation in USA [4301 - 39566]; National Natural Sciences Foundation of China [71103006, 71573266]",John Templeton foundation in USA; National Natural Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors are especially grateful to constructive comments from Professor Fenggang Yang at Purdue University.

Design/methodology/approach - A large number of household-level observations are employed to measure the program's income multiplier. An unrestricted model was first employed to measure the multipliers in a period of two years, and the difference was evaluated. Then, the income promotion effects of grain subsidy on various income sources for each specific subset of the population, such as liquidity conditions and household characteristics, were estimated. Findings - The results show that the grain subsidy program has a high income multiplier, and the income promotion effect of the transferred subsidies is from agricultural production derived by intensifying input for each unit of land. The multiplier effect of the grain subsidy program as a cash transfer program can be interpreted as the shadow value of relaxing liquidity constraints and could be particularly utilized by households with more farming land and farmers in less developed regions in China. Hence, to maximize the income multiplier effect, the grain subsidy distribution method should consider these criteria instead of retaining the prevalent standard that is based on contracted land areas. Originality/value - This study addresses the gap that the effect of China's grain subsidy program on income increment has not been empirically examined in nation wide.","[Yi, Fujin; Lu, Wuyi; Zhou, Yingheng] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University,"Yi, FJ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",fujinyi@njau.edu.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of China [71303115, 71333008]; Nanjing Agricultural University [Y0201400037, Y0201400069, Y0201400327, SKCX2015004]; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars from Ministry of Education of China, Education department of Jiangsu province [2014SJD069]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); China Center for Food Security Studies at Nanjing Agricultural University; Jiangsu Rural Development and Land Policy Research Institute; Jiangsu Agriculture Modernization Decision Consulting Center","National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Nanjing Agricultural University; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars from Ministry of Education of China, Education department of Jiangsu province; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); China Center for Food Security Studies at Nanjing Agricultural University; Jiangsu Rural Development and Land Policy Research Institute; Jiangsu Agriculture Modernization Decision Consulting Center","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support by National Science Foundation of China (Grants: 71303115, 71333008), Nanjing Agricultural University (Grants: Y0201400037, Y0201400069, Y0201400327, SKCX2015004), the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars from Ministry of Education of China, Education department of Jiangsu province (Grant: 2014SJD069), Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD), China Center for Food Security Studies at Nanjing Agricultural University, Jiangsu Rural Development and Land Policy Research Institute, and Jiangsu Agriculture Modernization Decision Consulting Center.

This study aims to use these measures to analyze the performance of a sample of Catalan arable crop farms. Specifically, we apply the methodology recently developed by Coelli et al. (2007) and Murty et al. (2012), and extend it to a consideration of the stochastic conditions under which production takes place as proposed by Chambers and Quiggin (1998 and 2000). Results suggest that efficiency ratings depend on model specification. Also, ignoring the stochastic nature of production yields downward-biased efficiency scores. Empirical findings suggest that environmental and technical efficiency are strongly interrelated indicating that an efficient use of chemical inputs improves both environmental and technical performance of farms.","[Guesmi, Bouali] Ecole Super Agr Mograne, Zaghouan, Tunisia; [Serra, Teresa] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL USA",Universite de Carthage; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Guesmi, B (通讯作者)，Ecole Super Agr Mograne, Zaghouan, Tunisia.",bouali.guesmi@upc.edu,"guesmi, bouali/AAB-4188-2021","guesmi, bouali/0000-0003-4167-6560","Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Plan Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica, Desarrollo e Innovacion Tecnologica (I+D+i) Project [RTA2012-00002-00-00]","Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Plan Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica, Desarrollo e Innovacion Tecnologica (I+D+i) Project(European Union (EU))","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Plan Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica, Desarrollo e Innovacion Tecnologica (I+D+i) 2008-2011, Project Reference Number RTA2012-00002-00-00.",,77,20,22,0,45,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

The analysis draws on data from 85 low- and middle-income countries for the period 2004-2011 to estimate latent class stochastic frontiers in which the technological class to which the country belongs is determined within the model. To enable efficiency comparisons between countries across these technological classes, we estimate a meta-frontier that encompasses all the class frontiers. We embed components of an agricultural innovation systems framework in this estimation to explain countries' technical inefficiency with respect to their respective class frontiers. Mobile phone subscriptions as a measure of institutions that facilitate the transfer of knowledge and information as well as the number of scientific and technical journal articles as a measure of research productivity and knowledge production are found to improve technical efficiency of agricultural production in these countries. The mean technical efficiency score of agricultural production between 2004 and 2011 for countries in class one is 44.1% whereas it is 62.7% for countries in class two, indicating sizeable potential to improve agricultural production from the same level of agricultural inputs through efficiency-enhancing investments.","[Mekonnen, Dawit K.; Spielman, David J.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Fonsah, Esendugue Greg] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Tifton, GA 31793 USA; [Dorfman, Jeffrey H.] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Mekonnen, DK (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",d.mekonnen@cgiar.org,,"Spielman, David/0000-0002-6889-7358; Mekonnen, Dawit/0000-0003-3642-3497",,,,,67,30,37,4,132,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

These disaggregated categories correspond closely to the commodities of interest to public policymakers with respect to taxation and health policies. The system of demand equations is estimated with Nielsen's data using a semiflexible Almost Ideal Demand System model in order to impose negative semi-definiteness on the demand parameters. Results indicate elastic own-price elasticities for virtually all commodities. Cross-price elasticities suggest that beverages most linked with negative externalities, namely full strength beer, dark RTD and dark spirits, may need to be taxed jointly. Any proposed tax increase to cask wine may also result in consumers shifting demand to more undesirable beverages. The elasticity estimates are used to illustrate the effect of a hypothetical change towards taxation equalisation based on alcohol content. These elasticities offer crucially needed inputs for analysing any tax change policies.","[Srivastava, Preety] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [McLaren, Keith R.; Wohlgenant, Michael; Zhao, Xueyan] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Wohlgenant, Michael] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Monash University; North Carolina State University,"Srivastava, P (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",xueyan.zhao@monash.edu,"Srivastava, Preety Pratima/AFL-1427-2022","Srivastava, Preety Pratima/0000-0001-8656-1914; Zhao, Xueyan/0000-0002-5096-8787","National Health and Medical Research Council, Australia","National Health and Medical Research Council, Australia(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia)","The authors acknowledge funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council, Australia.

Yet for much of the time since the early 1970s, more people have moved from metro to nonmetro U.S. counties. The underlying causes of this pattern have changed over time with economic shocks and changing household preferences. For instance, the post 2000 period has seen a significant decline in domestic migration rates, a significant increase in commodity prices that favor rural areas, and potential changes in the valuation of natural amenities that would affect migration. This article investigates the determinants of U.S. gross migration from metro to nonmetro counties and nonmetro to metro counties for the 1995-2000 and 2005-2009 periods in order to compare the differences in rural to urban and urban to rural migration, as well as compare the 1990s to the 2005-2009 periods. More specifically, the present study extends the literature by more broadly examining the underlying factors associated with deconcentration and economic restructuring arguments of metro to nonmetro migration. The article uses (1) extensive county-to-county migration flows and (2) the utility maximization theory that extends the framework of a discrete choice model. The results show that population density, distance to urban areas, industry mix employment growth, natural amenities, and percentage of older people are key factors underlying these migration patterns. We also find a slight fading of effects of natural amenities and population density, and a slight increase in the effects of wage and employment growth from 2005-2009.","[Rupasingha, Anil] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20024 USA; [Liu, Yongzheng] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Partridge, Mark] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Renmin University of China; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Rupasingha, A (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",anilrup@gmail.com,,,,,,,61,25,31,6,64,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

J,"Fulton, M",,,,"Fulton, Murray",,,Agricultural Policy in the 21st Century: Economics and Politics,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D AGROECONOMIE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper provides a framework for thinking about agricultural policy, why and how it is introduced, and how it changes over time. This framework suggests that agricultural policy will be influenced by both concerns for efficiency and lobbying. While agricultural policy will not always be effective, it will be relatively stable, at least in terms of its broad outlines. Underlying this broad stability, however, will be considerable small-scale change as program and policy details shift in response to a changing environment. When policy changes in a major way, which it almost always will, the shift will be abrupta punctuation. These abrupt changes come as attention is eventually paid to areas and/or issues that are increasingly understood to be not working. While there is considerable room for economic analysis in the policy process, it will not be the main driver; this role belongs to politicsthe ability to change the discourse around a policy issue in such a way that different evaluations and interpretations of the policy and its impact are created. Based on the analysis in this paper, it is argued that supply management is more likely to see significant change than business risk management programs, since more attention seems to be currently directed at the former issue. It is also argued that although proponents of local food, organic production, and urban agriculture have had some success at getting attention focused on these issues, this success will not translate into any major policy changes, in part because markets for these products are developing and appear to be working reasonably well. Le present article fournit un cadre theorique pour reflechir sur la politique agricole, a savoir sa raison d'etre, sa mise en place et son evolution au fil du temps. Ce cadre theorique permet de penser que la politique agricole sera influencee a la fois par les preoccupations en matiere d'efficacite et par le lobbyisme. Bien que l'on comprenne que la politique agricole ne sera pas toujours efficace, elle demeurera assez stable, du moins en ce qui concerne ses grandes lignes. Toutefois, cette stabilite sera influencee par une multitude de petits changements attribuables au fait que les programmes et les politiques sont concus de facon a repondre a un contexte en evolution. Lorsque les politiques changent de facon importante, ce qui est pratiquement toujours le cas, le virage est brutal. Ces changements brutaux surviennent lorsque l'attention se tourne eventuellement sur des sujets ou des enjeux qui ne semblent plus emouvoir. Bien que l'analyse economique ait sa place dans le processus d'elaboration des politiques, elle n'en sera pas le principal moteur; ce role appartient a la politiquecette capacite de modifier le discours entourant un enjeu politique de facon a creer diverses evaluations et interpretations de la politique et de ses repercussions. D'apres notre analyse, la gestion de l'offre est plus susceptible que les programmes de gestion du risque d'entreprise de subir des changements importants puisque l'attention semble actuellement tournee vers elle.

Both treatments had all the same designed characteristics except that in the second treatment, the participants who reported the highest levels of competitiveness were not allowed to participate in the auction. Then, we could directly compare bids from the participants with two different levels of competitiveness (higher competitiveness and lower competitiveness).

By employing a computable general equilibrium model and an environmentally extended Social Accounting Matrix, this article simulates the effects of different carbon tax policy scenarios. The modeling results show that all agricultural sectors will be affected negatively but to differing degrees. The household compensation policy will improve the performance of the poultry and fishing sectors, while having opposite effects in the other agricultural sectors. The inclusion of the agricultural industry into the carbon tax scheme will lead to a considerable further decrease in output, employment and profitability in the agricultural sector, and a significant further reduction in real GDP, but a much larger emission reduction.","Univ New England, Inst Rural Futures, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",University of New England,"Meng, S (通讯作者)，Univ New England, Inst Rural Futures, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.",xmeng4@une.edu.au,,"Meng, Sam/0000-0002-3329-5277",,,,,28,18,19,3,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

An unbalanced panel includes 454 Czech farms and 2103 observations for years 2007-2013. The Parametric Stochastic Frontier Analysis is used to assess the technical inefficiency and efficiency. A true fixed effects model with RDP subsidies explaining the variance of the inefficiency term is estimated. The results are ambiguous. On one hand, the RDP subsidies contributed to the decrease of variance of the inefficiency term, but on the other, the effect is statistically significant only at 90% level of significance. Therefore, we further tested the medians of inefficiency (efficiency) which are lower (higher) in the subsidized farms. We concluded that there are statistically significant differences depending on whether the farm received the RDP subsidies or not.

Considerable efforts have been exerted to promote the diffusion of improved farmland management to address these challenges. Despite these efforts, adoption rates, especially of soil conservation and water harvesting technologies, are still low, which has been the subject of investigation in several studies in Ethiopia and elsewhere. Most studies on the adoption of these technologies, however, tend to focus on economic incentives only, paying little attention to the role of social capital. This article provides evidence of the effects of different dimensions of social capital on innovation adoption across households holding different levels of risk aversion. We address this issue by using cross section and panel data from Ethiopia. Results show that social capital plays a significant role in enhancing the adoption of improved farmland management practices. We also find evidence that the effect of social capital across households with heterogeneous risk taking behavior is different.","[Wossen, Tesfamicheal; Berger, Thomas] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Econ & Social Sci Trop & Subtrop 490D, Hohenheim, Germany; [Wossen, Tesfamicheal] Int Ctr Trop Agr CIAT, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Di Falco, Salvatore] Univ Geneva, Dept Econ, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",University Hohenheim; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; University of Geneva,"Wossen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Econ & Social Sci Trop & Subtrop 490D, Hohenheim, Germany.",t.wossen@uni-hohenheim.de,,"Wossen, Tesfamicheal/0000-0003-3793-7078; Berger, Thomas/0000-0003-3316-9614","Foundation fiat panis; Food Security Center from the University of Hohenheim, which is part of the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) program; DAAD; German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)","Foundation fiat panis; Food Security Center from the University of Hohenheim, which is part of the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) program; DAAD(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)","The research project has been financially supported by the Dr. Hermann Eiselen, Ph.D. Grant from the Foundation fiat panis, and the publication is an output of the scholarship from the Food Security Center from the University of Hohenheim, which is part of the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) program exceed and is supported by DAAD and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).

Design/methodology/approach - An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) regression model is applied to estimate the effects of public investment in agricultural R&D and extension on Australian braodacre productivity. Findings - The study reveals that public investment in agricultural R&D and extension has contributed almost two-thirds of average annual broadacre productivity growth between 1952-1953 and 2006-2007, the average internal rate of return to public investment in agricultural R&D and extension was 28.4 and 47.5 per cent a year, respectively, and overseas spill-ins is an important source of domestic agricultural productivity growth. Practical implications - Policy implications: the findings suggest that increasing public investment in agricultural R&D and extension and maintaining agricultural R&D policy stability are equally important to have a sustained long-term agricultural productivity growth, and maintaining an open trade and investment regime is important to benefit from foreign knowledge spillovers which is especially important for developing countries. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the existing literature by employing more sophisticated econometric techniques with an extended data set for the period from 1952-1953 to 2006-2007. The study separates the contribution of public R&D investment and the extension investment, and also takes into account the contribution of overseas public investment on the TFP growth in the Australian broadacre sector.","[Zhang, Dandan] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Chen, Chunlai] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Sheng, Yu] Nankai Univ, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",Peking University; Australian National University; Nankai University,"Chen, CL (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",chunlai.chen@anu.edu.au,"Sheng, Yu/ABC-2411-2020",,,,,,31,5,7,2,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Current management practices of both primary and secondary pests in agricultural production principally rely on the use of pesticides with associated negative social and environmental consequences/externalities. Excessive use of pesticides against primary pets can remove NEs from the agro-ecosystem and amplify susceptibility of the system to outbreaks of secondary pests. The combined effect of NEs on primary and secondary pests has received limited attention. This study uses an intraseasonal bioeconomic model to explicitly take into account biological interactions among primary pests, secondary pests, and NEs assuming decision makers' profit maximizing behavior. The model explicitly captures the opportunity cost of injury to NE in terms of both primary and secondary pest suppression by NE. The results show that in the context of the green peach aphid (primary pest) and two-spotted spider mite (secondary pest) in potato production, inclusion of NE into pest mitigation strategy can increase returns by 2%.","[Yang, Lianxin; McIntosh, Christopher] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, 875 Perimeter Dr, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Elbakidze, Levan] West Virginia Univ, Agr & Resource Econ, 2018 Agr Sci Bldg,101 Res Way,POB 6108, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Marsh, Thomas] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Hulbert Hall 101, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Idaho; University of Idaho; West Virginia University; Washington State University,"Elbakidze, L (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Agr & Resource Econ, 2018 Agr Sci Bldg,101 Res Way,POB 6108, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",levan.elbakidze@mail.wvu.edu,"McIntosh, Christopher/ABI-6704-2020",,USDA-CSREES Risk Assessment and Mitigation Program [2009-51101-20104],USDA-CSREES Risk Assessment and Mitigation Program,"Funding for this research was provided by the USDA-CSREES Risk Assessment and Mitigation Program, grant number 2009-51101-20104.

This decomposition allows assessment of reallocation impacts on the different sources of productivity growth. The empirical application focuses on a large panel of English and Welsh farms over the period 2007-2013. The results show that coordination inefficiency significantly increases with the proportion of resources allocated to livestock production in economic and statistical terms. Coordination inefficient farms should generally allocate more land to crop production. Depending on the region, the average coordination productivity growth ranges from -9.7% to 15.9% per year. It is driven by coordination technical change rather than coordination inefficiency change.","[Ang, Frederic] Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Agrifood Econ & Social Sci Res Div, POB 237, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England; [Kerstens, Pieter Jan] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Ctr Econ Studies, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium",University of Reading; KU Leuven,"Ang, F (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Sch Agr Policy & Dev, Agrifood Econ & Social Sci Res Div, POB 237, Reading RG6 6AR, Berks, England.",f.k.g.ang@reading.ac.uk,"Kerstens, Pieter Jan/I-2183-2019","Kerstens, Pieter Jan/0000-0002-4368-0259; Ang, Frederic/0000-0002-2323-7081",,,,,36,4,4,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

We explore the predictions of a standard expected utility theory framework on the nature of demand in terms of price, the basis of the hedge, and risk aversion using data from a randomized control trial. We find that demand behaves as predicted: it falls with price and basis risk and is hump-shaped in risk aversion, with price sensitivity decreasing at higher levels of basis risk. We estimate a negative price elasticity of 0.58 and find that doubling the distance to a reference weather station decreases demand by 18%. These results indicate that improving pricing and quality of insurance products can directly increase demand. In addition, we examine the impact of insurance training relative to other mechanisms designed to increase understanding. The evidence suggests that increased incentives to learn or learning by using are more effective at increasing both understanding and demand. Finally, we contribute to the scarce evidence on the demand for insurance over time. In terms of our main interventions, we find that the effect of premium subsidies persists over time, while the impact of investments in new weather stations diminishes and the effect of increased training in the first season seems to disappear during the second season. Importantly, while having previously purchased insurance does not encourage future uptake, receiving a payout does. This could reflect issues of trust in the product or the insurance company, and constitutes an important topic for future research.","[Hill, Ruth Vargas] World Bank, Poverty Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Robles, Miguel; Ceballos, Francisco] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",The World Bank; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Ceballos, F (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",f.ceballos@cgiar.org,,"Robles Flores, Luis Miguel/0000-0001-6171-6625","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets; international Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie)","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets; international Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie)","Ruth Vargas Hill is a senior economist in the Poverty Global Practice, The World Bank.

We find that while cigarette and coffee demands fit well with the rational addiction model, alcohol demand conforms to a model with inventory effects. The results suggest that alcohol consumption increases the marginal utility derived from consumption of cigarettes. Increasing alcohol prices would decrease not only the consumption of alcohol, but also the consumption of cigarettes. On the other hand, increasing cigarette prices do not have the same effect on consumption of alcohol. The cross-price elasticity of coffee with respect to cigarette price is positive and significant which suggests that coffee substitutes for cigarettes when cigarette prices increase. The cross-price elasticity of alcohol with respect to coffee price is found to be negative and significant. On the other hand, Morishima elasticities of substitution indicate that cigarette, alcohol and coffee substitute each other along the indifference curve when relative prices change.","[Koksal, Aycan] Cleveland State Univ, Dept Econ, 2121 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA; [Wohlgenant, Michael] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",University System of Ohio; Cleveland State University; North Carolina State University,"Koksal, A (通讯作者)，Cleveland State Univ, Dept Econ, 2121 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",aycankoksal@gmail.com,,,North Carolina Agricultural Research Service,North Carolina Agricultural Research Service,Financial support provided in part by the North Carolina Agricultural Research Service.,,27,3,3,2,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

This article examines the underlying motives of producers to adopt sustainable practices. We focus on expected economic, social and personal rewards and analyse the role of producers' financial risk perception and risk tolerance. Results from personal interviews with 164 hog producers show that the adoption of sustainable practices is affected by expected economic rewards but not by social and personal rewards. Further, while perceived risk is a barrier to the adoption of sustainable practices, risk tolerance is a positive moderator of the relationship between economic rewards and adoption. In addition, perceived tax benefits and turnover have a significant positive relationship with adoption, while education and age do not play a role.","[Trujillo-Barrera, Andres; Pennings, Joost M.

Because Japanese consumers in different regions have different preferences for seafood, we focused our study to see how the regional seafood retail markets (Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, and Fukuoka) are integrated for 10 major seafood products (horse mackerel, short-necked clams, yellowtail, scallops, cuttlefish/squid, flounder, tuna, mackerel, saury, and octopus) consumed in Japan. We applied the relatively new Phillips-Sul convergence test for our analysis. For most of the seafood products investigated in this study, our results indicate that the Japanese regional seafood markets cannot be integrated as a whole and that marketing strategies need to consider the peculiar characteristics of the regional seafood markets.","[Aruga, Kentaka] Ishikawa Prefectural Univ, Dept Bioprod Sci, Nonoichi, Ishikawa, Japan; [Li, Raymond] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Ishikawa Prefectural University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Aruga, K (通讯作者)，Ishikawa Prefectural Univ, Dept Bioprod Sci, Nonoichi, Ishikawa, Japan.",kentaka.aruga@gmail.com,"Aruga, Kentaka/M-1216-2017; Li, Raymond/AAN-6505-2020","Aruga, Kentaka/0000-0003-3033-272X; Li, Raymond/0000-0002-8868-7104",,,,,15,5,5,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

To better understand how changing incomes and prices influenced the consumption patterns, the contribution estimates the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) models. The aim of the paper is to find patterns and preference changes in the consumer demand for meat in Slovakia. From the methodological aspect, there were used important items of the demand, and for the consumer behaviour analysis, there were computed elasticity coefficients by using the model AIDS. The coefficients of the price and income demand elasticity were determined. The computed elasticities showed that all meat items had a positive income elasticity of demand which implies that they were normal goods. Beef and pork were expenditure (income) elastic and hence could be considered as a luxury, while poultry and fish were income inelastic meaning that those were of necessity.","[Benda Prokeinova, Renata; Hanova, Martina] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Prokeinova, RB (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",renata.prokeinova@uniag.sk,,,"Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education of Slovak Republic; Slovak Academy of Sciences VEGA (Economic Growth, Global Commodity Markets and the Food and Nutrition Security in the Central and Eastern Europe and the Western Balkans.)

Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts a sample-selection ordered probit model (Greene and Hensher, 2010) to estimate the impacts of overall social-network intensity, of the number of strong ties (relatives), and of the number of weak ties (friends), using data on 1,064 representative households collected from three provinces (Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Shandong). Findings - The numbers of strong ties and weak ties both have significant impacts on households' willingness to contribute to SHFs provision, but only the latter has a significant impact on their level of contribution. More specifically, a one standard deviation increase in the number of weak ties (i.e. friends) is associated with a 6.6 percent increase in households' propensity of contributing more than 550 yuan and a 8.2 percent decrease in their propensity of contributing less than 100 yuan. Originality/value - This paper is the first to examine the impacts of social networks on households' contribution to SHFs provision in rural China. Its finding is of great policy relevance-fostering and maintaining social networks (e.g. through rural cooperatives) can significantly increase households' contribution to public-good provision.","[Cai, Qihua; Zhu, Yuchun] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling, Peoples R China; [Chen, Qihui] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; China Agricultural University,"Zhu, YC (通讯作者)，Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling, Peoples R China.",zhuyuchun321@126.com,"Zhou, Hong/JKJ-1067-2023; Chen, Qihui/I-2813-2019; QIHUA, CAI/GSN-4001-2022","Chen, Qihui/0000-0002-0944-0470; QIHUA, CAI/0000-0003-4617-4682",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273210]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of Ministry of Education of China [NCET-13-0492]; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education [20130204110033]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities - for Arts and Social Science [2013 RWZD01]; Chinese Universities Scientific Fund [2014XJ013],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of Ministry of Education of China(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education(Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (RFDP)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities - for Arts and Social Science(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Chinese Universities Scientific Fund,"This research is financially supported by the following programs: National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71273210), Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of Ministry of Education of China (No. NCET-13-0492), Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (No. 20130204110033), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities - for Arts and Social Science (No. 2013 RWZD01), and the Chinese Universities Scientific Fund (No. 2014XJ013).

Low-income elderly may be uniquely affected by these so-called food deserts due to limited transportation options, strong attachments to local neighborhoods, fixed incomes, and physical limitations for food shopping. Using 2006 and 2010 Health and Retirement Study data linked to census tract-level measures of food deserts, this study measures whether living in a food desert affects food and material hardship, participation in food assistance programs, and the food spending of elderly adults. In both cross-sectional and fixed effects regressions of elderly residents of urban counties, we find little evidence that living in a food desert affects these outcomes. We find, however, that individuals residing in a food desert without a vehicle are 12 percentage points more likely to report food insufficiency. Those SNAP recipients living in food deserts are 11 percentage points more likely to receive subsidized meals, while nonparticipants in food deserts and SNAP recipients outside of food deserts are less likely to receive subsidized meals. Our findings suggest that seniors without vehicles and SNAP recipients in food deserts may be the most vulnerable to limited food store access.","[Fitzpatrick, Katie] Seattle Univ, Econ, Seattle, WA 98122 USA; [Greenhalgh-Stanley, Nadia] Kent State Univ, Econ, Kent, OH USA; [Ploeg, Michele Ver] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC USA",Seattle University; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Fitzpatrick, K (通讯作者)，Seattle Univ, Econ, Seattle, WA 98122 USA.",fitzpatk@seattleu.edu,"Fitzpatrick, Katie/AAJ-8660-2020","Ver Ploeg, Michele/0000-0001-8476-7281; Fitzpatrick, Katie/0000-0003-0652-4334",Kent State University [58-4000-1-0021]; USDA ERS [58-4000-1-0021],Kent State University; USDA ERS(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"The authors thank Brian Roe, Ron Cheung, three anonymous reviewers, and participants at the 2013 Western Economic Association International Meetings for numerous helpful comments and suggestions.

This study reports results from a discrete choice experiment conducted with pastoralists and graziers across northern Australia. The experiment was designed to explore the willingness of pastoralists and graziers to sign up to voluntary biodiversity conservation contracts. Understanding preferences for contractual attributes and preference heterogeneity were additional objectives. Such knowledge can increase effectiveness and efficiency of conservation programs by informing contract design, negotiation and administration. Random parameter logit modelling showed that of contract attributes, conservation requirement, stewardship payment, contract duration and flexibility in contract conditions significantly influenced choices. Land productivity was a significant factor as were attitudes. There was significant heterogeneity of preferences for all contract attributes. Models were run for best-worst scaling responses and the first preferences subset, with the latter model deemed superior. Latent class modelling distinguished four classes of decision-makers and illustrated different decision heuristics. Conservation investment strategies, which offer farmers contract options that meet biodiversity requirements while accommodating heterogeneous attribute preferences, are likely to lead to increased participation rates. Complementary suasion efforts are also required which espouse the benefits that pastoralists derive from biodiversity and participation in voluntary conservation contracts.","[Greiner, Romy] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Greiner, Romy] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci Technol & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Greiner, Romy] James Cook Univ, Cairns Inst, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",Charles Darwin University; James Cook University; James Cook University,"Greiner, R (通讯作者)，Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia.",romy.greiner@jcu.edu.au,"Greiner, Romy/AAA-4928-2021; Greiner, Romy/N-2104-2013","Greiner, Romy/0000-0002-2792-5391",National Environmental Research Program - North Australia Hub and Charles Darwin University; North Australian Beef Research Council; Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association; Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia,National Environmental Research Program - North Australia Hub and Charles Darwin University; North Australian Beef Research Council; Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association; Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia,"This research was jointly funded by the National Environmental Research Program - North Australia Hub and Charles Darwin University.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the uptake rate of a new set of MH services in poor rural areas of China. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is based on the survey responses of women's representatives and village cadres from almost 1,000 villages in June 2012 as part of a wide-scale public health survey in Sichuan, Gansu and Yunnan provinces in the western part of China. Findings - The authors find that the uptake rate of MH services (including in-hospital delivery, antenatal care visits and post-partum care visits) in poor rural areas of Western China are far below average in China, and that the rates vary across provinces and ethnic groups. The analyses demonstrate that distance, income, ethnicity and availability appear to be systematically correlated with low uptake rates of all MH services. Demand-side factors seem to be by far the most important sources of the differences between subpopulations. The authors also find that there is potential for creating a Conditional Cash Transfer program to improve the usage of MH services.

The samples of towns were selected randomly from 25 counties located in five provinces from different regions of China. Data were collected through questionnaires and direct observation. Findings - The THCs located in rich areas have higher levels of human resources than poor areas. THCs in rich areas also have more fixed assets than those in poor areas.

The allocation of mandated equipment is unequal. Practical implications - These findings suggest that China's government should pay more attention to THCs located in poor areas, especially in light of new initiatives to improve health care in poor rural areas. Originality/value - This is the first nationally representative study to employ rigorous empirics to investigate the extent of inequality in allocation of resources within THCs across China.","[Ma, Yue] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Boswell, Matthew] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Shaanxi Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Stanford University","Ma, Y (通讯作者)，Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Peoples R China.",,"Ma, Yue/U-7597-2019; ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023","Ma, Yue/0000-0002-1980-7520;","111 Project [B16031]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71110107028, 71033003]; Shaanxi Science and Technology Research and Development Project [2012KR2-05]; International Initiative for Impact Evaluation; Ford Foundation","111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shaanxi Science and Technology Research and Development Project; International Initiative for Impact Evaluation; Ford Foundation","The authors are supported by the 111 Project (Grant No. B16031).

Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviewed the achievements and experiences of China agricultural insurance development in the past eight years, deeply analyzed the problems during the development and proposed several solutions. Findings - During 2007-2014, the development of China agricultural insurance has made significant accomplishments and achieved important experience; however, problems also emerged during the process, such as blurry boundaries between government and market, unclear policy target, disordered market competition and improper management. To solve these problems and promote China agricultural insurance, efforts should be put more on fiscal taxation policy, government department coordination, catastrophe risk dispersion system, maintaining orderly competition, regulating management and strengthening innovation. Originality/value - This paper makes a systematic analysis on the experiences, problems and solutions for China agriculture insurance during 2007-2014, which is of great significance to promote China agriculture insurance development.","[Tuo, Guozhu] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Beijing, Peoples R China",Capital University of Economics & Business,"Tuo, GZ (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Beijing, Peoples R China.",1657583549@qq.com,,,,,,,0,6,6,9,75,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Empirical results from the ready-to-eat breakfast cereal (RTEC) market confirm the conceptual analysis that lowering information cost via simplified nutritional labeling increases the healthfulness of consumer choices. The healthfulness attribute weighs 28.44% more heavily in consumers' decision-making with simpler labeling systems. On average, introducing front-of-package labeling increased the probability of a consumer choosing a healthy RTEC by 3.49% and reduced the probability of choosing an unhealthy RTEC by 3.81%. Calories, sugar, saturated fat, and sodium consumption decrease by 0.31%, 2.63%, 6.94%, and 1.97%, respectively. Fiber intake increases by 3.24%. Further results show that less-educated and smaller households with less frequent purchases benefit the most from a reduction in information cost.

To investigate whether late-life transitions are associated with a greater likelihood of changing the regularly bought yogurt brand, we analyzed real purchase data of German consumers from 2004 to 2008. Our findings provide empirical evidence that changes in social relationships (change in household size, relocation) are associated with a higher likelihood of changes in first yogurt brand and first grocery chain for older consumers.

Previous research on the valuation of health risk has been dominated by the study of mortality risk. However, in most cases foodborne illnesses are non-fatal, so we focus on individuals' preferences for reducing morbidity risk, while also including a realistic, if remote, chance of death. We use a contingent valuation method on a Swedish sample and we estimate a value of a statistical illness consistent with previous findings in the literature. We also examine how willingness to pay (WTP) varies with the expected change in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and estimate the WTP per QALY. We find that WTP increases with, though less than proportionally to, a change in QALYs. However, our results also suggest that respondents may have found it difficult to evaluate compound risks of both morbidity and mortality simultaneously.","[Andersson, Henrik] CNRS, UT1C, LERNA, Toulouse Sch Econ, F-75700 Paris, France; [Hammitt, James K.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Risk Anal, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Sundstrom, Kristian] Lund Univ, Inst Food & Agr Econ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Harvard University; Lund University,"Andersson, H (通讯作者)，CNRS, UT1C, LERNA, Toulouse Sch Econ, F-75700 Paris, France.",henrik.andersson@tse-fr.eu,,,"VTI; Centre for Transport Studies, Stockholm","VTI; Centre for Transport Studies, Stockholm","Henrik Andersson is at the Toulouse School of Economics (LERNA, UT1C, CNRS), France.

We investigate cost containment in the WIC Program, with a focus on California. Results show that smaller vendors often charge considerably higher prices for WIC foods than their larger counterparts. However, larger vendors do not mark up WIC foods more or promote them less than comparable control products. Cost containment can be improved by targeting WIC Program sales to larger vendors when it is possible to do so without compromising participant access, and using large-vendor prices as a benchmark to limit prices set by smaller vendors.","[Saitone, Tina L.; Sexton, Richard J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Volpe, Richard J., III] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Agribusiness Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Sexton, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rich@primal.ucdavis.edu,,,"California Department of Public Heath, Women, Infants and Children Program; United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service","California Department of Public Heath, Women, Infants and Children Program; United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service","This work was funded in part by the California Department of Public Heath, Women, Infants and Children Program and through a cooperative work agreement with the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.",,28,10,12,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

The first six articles have a strong focus on understanding the extent and drivers of gender differences in land productivity and use data from nationally representative household surveys that are implemented under the Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) initiative. The LSMS-ISA data are multi-topic, with geo-referenced household and plot locations, and information on production and identity of managers and owners at the plot level. The last two articles in the volume rely on in-depth quantitative and qualitative case study data, which, in combination with the nationally representative data, allow for greater insights into the extent and correlates of gender differences in sub-Saharan African agriculture. While there does seem to be persistent evidence of gender gaps, the studies find the sources of these gaps to vary within and across countries.

We investigated the causal linkages between agriculture and gross domestic product growth with the aid of directed acyclic graphs, a recently developed algorithm of inductive causation. The results suggest that while agriculture could be an engine of economic growth, the impact varies across countries. In some cases, we found strong evidence in support of the agriculture-led growth hypothesis. In contrast, the results for some other countries indicate that having a vibrant aggregate economy is a prerequisite for agricultural development. Le present article reexamine le debat sur le role de l'agriculture dans la promotion de la croissance economique de neuf pays en developpement. Nous avons etudie les liens de causalite entre l'agriculture et la croissance du PIB a l'aide de graphes acycliques orientes, un algorithme de causalite inductive recemment mis au point. Les resultats montrent que, meme si l'agriculture peut constituer un engin de croissance economique, son impact varie d'un pays a l'autre. Dans certains cas, nous avons obtenu des preuves solides qui appuient l'hypothese selon laquelle la croissance est motivee par l'agriculture. En revanche, les resultats obtenus dans le cas d'autres pays indiquent qu'une economie globale vigoureuse constitue une condition prealable au developpement de l'agriculture.","[Awokuse, Titus O.; Xie, Ruizhi] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University of Delaware,"Awokuse, TO (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, 513 South Coll Ave, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",kuse@udel.edu; rxie@udel.edu,"Awokuse, Titus/AAQ-5902-2020","Awokuse, Titus/0000-0002-3245-1055",,,,,55,57,67,2,45,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

This viral disease reduces yield, delays fruit ripening, and affects wine quality. Although there is new information on the disease spatial-dynamic diffusion, little is known about profit-maximizing control strategies. Using cellular automata, we model the disease spatial-dynamic diffusion for individual plants in a vineyard, evaluate nonspatial and spatial control strategies, and rank them based on vineyard expected net present values. Nonspatial strategies consist of roguing and replacing symptomatic grapevines. In spatial strategies, symptomatic vines are rogued and replaced, and their nonsymptomatic neighbors are virus-tested, then rogued and replaced if the test is positive. Both nonspatial and spatial classes of strategies are formulated and examined with and without considering vine age. We find that spatial strategies targeting immediate neighbors of symptomatic vines dominate nonspatial strategies, increasing the vineyard expected net present value by 18% to 19% relative to the strategy of no disease control. We also find that age-structured disease control is preferred to non-age-structured control but only for nonspatial strategies. Sensitivity analyses show that disease eradication is possible if either the disease transmission rate or the virus undetectability period is substantially reduced.","[Atallah, Shady S.; Gomez, Miguel I.; Conrad, Jon M.] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Nyrop, Jan P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University,"Atallah, SS (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,"Atallah, Shady S./AFR-7527-2022; Gomez, Miguel I./AAD-3707-2019","Atallah, Shady S./0000-0002-9715-6268;","United States Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture through Hatch Multistate Project [S1050]; United States Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture through Viticulture Consortium East Grant [2008-34360-19469]; Division Of Computer and Network Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [0832782] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; NIFA [2008-34360-19469, 583269] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",United States Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture through Hatch Multistate Project; United States Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture through Viticulture Consortium East Grant; Division Of Computer and Network Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"This article was previously circulated under the title An Agent-Based Computational Bioeconomic Model of Plant Disease Diffusion and Control: Grapevine Leafroll Disease.

Moreover, in the study, the factors affecting technical efficiency were identified, and the econometric modelling of their impact was performed with the use of the Tobit model. The studies indicate that across the 27 EU Member States, the level of the technical efficiency of agriculture is diverse, and the difference between the states with the highest and the lowest efficiencies is 40%. Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy and Malta were identified as the countries with the thoroughly technically efficient agriculture. In turn, the least technically efficient agriculture is observed for the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia and Slovakia. Taking into account the factors determining the technical agriculture efficiency, it should be noted that the stimulants have proven to be such factors as: the soil quality, the age of the head of the household and the surcharges for investments.

Eye tracking was used to capture the magnitude of attention spent by participants on specific areas of interest regarding the energy drinks in the auction (e.g., brand). Results indicate that attention to brand, package attributes, and product information had a varying impact on WTP depending on the brand examined. Results show that the presence of brand had an impact on WTP for certain brands. Also, as more attention was paid to particular stimuli regarding the energy drinks, individuals were more likely to either increase or decrease their WTP. These results have implications for both marketers of branded food products as well as researchers eliciting consumers' preferences and WTP values for products that can be branded in the marketplace.","[Lewis, Karen E.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 302 Morgan Hall,2621 Morgan Circle, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Grebitus, Carola] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, WP Carey Sch Business, 7231 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Univ Arkansas, Food Policy Econ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Oslo, Norway; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; UT Institute of Agriculture; Arizona State University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; National Bureau of Economic Research; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research; Korea University,"Lewis, KE (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 302 Morgan Hall,2621 Morgan Circle, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",klewis39@utk.edu; carola.grebitus@asu.edu; rnayga@uark.edu,,"DeLong, Karen/0000-0002-6352-7171",,,,,41,21,23,5,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

This article applies the double-hurdle model to a cross-section of fish farms to analyze demand for improved fish feed from private markets, and whether the government feed subsidy program has an effect on private demand for improved feed. The results indicate that households' decisions to participate in the improved feed market are affected by the quantity of improved feed received from the government. Once the participation decision has been made, we find evidence of crowding-in of the private improved feed sector; that is, the government's allocations of subsidized feed appear to increase private sector demand. In addition, the price of improved feed negatively affects the quantity purchased as expected. Education, extension contacts, and ease of marketing matured fish increase household propensity to purchase improved feed commercially. Policies that help reduce the price of improved feed such as reduction in tariffs on imported feeds and feed ingredients will foster demand for the feed, as will policies that facilitate marketing of fish at reasonable prices by households.","[Amankwah, Akuffo; Quagrainie, Kwamena K.; Preckel, Paul V.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Amankwah, A (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",aamankwa@purdue.edu,"Preckel, Paul V/A-9365-2009",,Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Collaborative Research on Aquaculture & Fisheries through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [EPP-A-00-06-00012-00]; Norman E.

This paper presents an empirical study of these competing implications that estimates the impact of market concentration on new product introductions in a panel of nine food processing industries over 1983 to 2004. Controlling for industry-level unobservables (using fixed effects) and endogeneity of industry market structure, we find that industry concentration promotes the introduction of new products. Preliminary evidence also suggests that new product introductions spur subsequent food industry mergers. Both conclusions are consistent with the entry-for-merger theory of product variety wherein atomistic innovators introduce new products in anticipation of profitable future mergers with concentrated firms.","[Bhattacharya, Haimanti] Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Innes, Robert] Univ Calif Merced, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, Econ, Merced, CA 95340 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University of California System; University of California Merced,"Innes, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Merced, Sch Social Sci Humanities & Arts, Econ, Merced, CA 95340 USA.",rinnes@ucmerced.edu,"Bhattacharya, Haimanti/K-9789-2019","Bhattacharya, Haimanti/0000-0002-3157-482X",,,,,39,3,3,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Our dataset is comprised of 75,708 farmers drawn from the Taiwanese Agriculture Census supplemented with administrative data on farmer disability. Approximately 46% of the farmers in our sample were affected by legislation expanding compulsory schooling from the primary school level to the junior high school level. Utilizing the compulsory schooling reform as a natural experiment for identification, we estimated an instrumental variable two-part model of the incidence and severity of disability, where the latter is measured using the number of disabled days for farmers aged from 35 to 45. We find that greater educational attainment significantly reduced the likelihood of farm-related disability as well as the severity of disability. Two potential mechanisms for this effect were fewer on-farm work days and less use of chemical inputs to farm production among more educated farmers.","[Chang, Hung-Hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Meyerhoefer, Chad D.] Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA",National Taiwan University; Lehigh University,"Chang, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",hunghaochang@ntu.edu.tw,,"chang, hung-hao/0000-0003-2296-134X",Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan [NSC102-2410-H-002-017]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2014S1A3A2044459],"Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","Hung-Hao Chang is a professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics at National Taiwan University.

In this article, we investigate the technological implications of these developments at the farm level. We model the conditions under which technology transfer and adoption will occur in a value chain setting and review the corresponding evidence on these issues. We find that technology transfer within a value chain can occur in an environment with imperfect credit and technology markets but depends on the surplus generated by the technology and the holdup opportunities within the value chain. We also discuss how these holdup opportunities affect bargaining power and the division of surplus and how the nature of the technology affects technology transfer and the implications for value chain governance.","[Kuijpers, Rob; Swinnen, Johan] Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Ctr Inst & Econ Performance LICOS, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Kuijpers, R (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Ctr Inst & Econ Performance LICOS, Leuven, Belgium.",rob.kuijpers@kuleuven.be,"Swinnen, Johan/AAC-1736-2021","Swinnen, Johan/0000-0002-8650-1978",KU Leuven Methusalem Fund,KU Leuven Methusalem Fund,"Rob Kuijpers is a Ph.D. candidate at the Centre for Institutions and Economic Performance (LICOS), University of Leuven (KU Leuven).

This paper explores whether easements may also overcome a credit-market failure, as banks may not be lending based on the full developed value of land. Original survey data test our research hypotheses and show profitable owners and nonoperators to be using easement payments to extract capital from their land by using the preservation programs as a bank. The results also show that the unprofitable owners and operators are reinvesting in their agricultural enterprises. Both results are consistent with an underlying credit-market failure, and the latter suggests that easements may provide indirect efficiency enhancement. The results suggest an integration of policies on agricultural finance and land preservation might lead to improved efficiency.","[Duke, Joshua M.] Univ Delaware, Appl Econ & Stat, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Schilling, Brian J.; Gottlieb, Paul D.] Rutgers State Univ, Agr Food & Resource Econ, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Sullivan, Kevin P.] Rutgers State Univ, Off Res Analyt, Stat Anal, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Esseks, J.

This approach allows us to account for heterogeneity with respect to the impact of the chosen explanatory variables in a contingent behaviour travel cost model of demand where the researcher must also account for the fact that the sample data has been collected on-site. The analysis also develops individual consumer surplus estimates and finds that estimates are systematically affected by both the random parameter and latent class specifications.

We test the ROT hypothesis against three plausible alternatives using a maximum likelihood friction model that we augment for unobserved heterogeneity.

However, the literature on its economic benefits, especially in the context of small and medium-scale farmers in the temperate developing world is scanty. Using a study of 621 wheat farmers in Syria, we provide empirical evidence on the impacts of adoption of ZT on farm income and wheat consumption. We use propensity score matching (PSM) and endogenous switching regression (ESR) approaches to account for potential selection biases. After controlling for confounding factors, we find that adoption of the ZT technology leads to a US$ 189/ha (33%) increase in net crop income and a 26kg (34%) gain in per capita wheat consumption per year (adult equivalent) - an indication of meaningful changes in the livelihoods of the farm households. Besides the biophysical and environmental benefits documented elsewhere, our results suggest that adoption of ZT can also be justified on economic and food security grounds. Therefore, ZT can have sizeable impacts in transforming the agricultural sector in the temperate developing world provided that the technology is well promoted and adopted.","[El-Shater, Tamer; Yigezu, Yigezu A.; Piggin, Colin; Haddad, Atef; Khalil, Yaseen; Loss, Stephen; Aw-Hassan, A.] Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas, Amman, Jordan; [Mugera, Amin] Univ Western Australia, Inst Agr, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",CGIAR; International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA); University of Western Australia,"Yigezu, YA (通讯作者)，Int Ctr Agr Res Dry Areas, Amman, Jordan.",y.yigezu@cgiar.org,"Mugera, Amin/E-6749-2012","Mugera, Amin/0000-0002-5199-2201",Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR),Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res),"Yigezu A.

The underlying rationale for a number of important decisions that underlie the data used in cost-return estimates for public agricultural research and extension are presented. The parameters of the state productivity model are estimated from a panel of contiguous U.S. 48 states from 1970 to 2004. Public research and extension are shown to be substitutes rather than complements. The econometric model of state agricultural TFP predicts growth rates of TFP for two-thirds of states that is less than the past trend rate. The results and data indicate a real social rate of return to public investments in agricultural research of 67% and to agricultural extension of 100+%.

The aim of the paper is to evaluate the differences in the dynamics of profitability for two types of milk producers - specialized dairy farms and mixed farms - within the context of the agricultural policy changes. This aim is achieved by decomposing profitability into output growth, output and input price changes, changes in decoupled subsidies, technical change, scale, mark-up, and technical efficiency change components based on input distance function estimation. Based on the panel data obtained from the FADN database in the time period 2004-2011, it was found that the change in profitability was positive in the analysed time period, and slightly higher for the specialized dairy farms than for the mixed ones. The changes in output price, mark-up component and technical change are the main determinants of the development of profitability. Agricultural policy measures had different effects on these components. The strongest correlation was between the operational subsidies and the technical change and technical efficiency change, and this correlation was negative.","[Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Kroupova, ZZ (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",kroupovaz@pef.czu.cz,"Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/AAO-8608-2021","Kroupova, Zdenka Zakova/0000-0001-5834-3338",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague: 'Profitability of Czech dairy farms within the context of agricultural policy changes' [IGA 20151015],Czech University of Life Sciences Prague: 'Profitability of Czech dairy farms within the context of agricultural policy changes',Supported by the internal grant of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague - IGA 20151015: 'Profitability of Czech dairy farms within the context of agricultural policy changes'.,,25,16,16,11,46,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Its high costs and low efficiency compared to the traditional cheaper sources belong to the main problems. This issue is serious especially currently - at the times of a slow economic growth when a switch to renewable energy sources means yet another harm to the competitiveness of the EU producers as it increases their production costs. Another weak point is that the silage maize as the most common input material for the anaerobic digestion leads to the displacement of the food crops production and it is considered to be also a contributor to the food price increase. Biogas plants also compete for input with the livestock production that ends up in the biogas plants instead of e.g. feeding cows. The aim of the paper is to investigate the long-run relationship between the biogas industry and the agricultural sector in Germany - a leader in the technology with the most developed biogas sector among the European Union member states. The econometric analysis based on the Vector Correction Model confirms the stated assumptions and concludes that the production of biogas via the anaerobic digestion has a significant impact on agriculture in Germany.,"[Lajdova, Zuzana; Lajda, Jan; Bielik, Peter] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Lajdova, Z (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",zuzana.lajdova@gmail.com,"Bielik, Peter/AAL-5561-2020",,European Community under building the Research Centre AgroBiotech [26220220180],European Community under building the Research Centre AgroBiotech,This work was co-funded by the European Community under the project No. 26220220180: building the Research Centre AgroBiotech.,,25,8,8,1,28,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The government has thus imposed a series of financial reforms on them over the years. The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of public policies on the CDFAs' performance and check if they are a driving force or obstruction? Design/methodology/approach - This study uses the generalized Meta-frontier Malmquist Productivity Index (MMPI) framework to estimate the productivity dynamics for various types of CDFAs during 2000-2009. Moreover, the proposition of whether financial supervision and structural change played the role of driving force or obstruction on productivity changes of CDFAs is also examined. Findings - The empirical results show that the productivity of CDFAs decreased year on year despite the policies. The sources resulting in the decline were mainly from technical change and technical efficiency. Meanwhile, the productivity performance of urban Farmers' Associations was the best, followed by that of rural and hybrid ones. As for the determinants, it was found that small financial reforms and the financial tsunami caused a decrease in the productivity of CDFAs. Furthermore, increasing the number of competitive financial institutions, expanding the scale of the arable lands of peasant households, increasing the proportion of dry lands, decreasing the area of fallow lands and increasing the ratio of peasant households helped increase the productivity of CDFAs. Originality/value - This study uses the generalized MMPI model to observe productivity dynamics in order to analyze changes in the productivity of different types of CDFAs.","[Lu, Yung-Hsiang] Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept BioBusiness Management, Chiayi 60004, Taiwan",National Chiayi University,"Lu, YH (通讯作者)，Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept BioBusiness Management, Chiayi 60004, Taiwan.",yhlu@mail.ncyu.edu.tw,,,,,,,30,2,2,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - By using the household-level data of six provinces of China, farmer household production function is used in this paper to estimate the investment return rate of farmer. Findings - The paper indicates that regardless which kind of grouping standard is adopted, the investment return rates of poor farmer households in general are far lower than the non-poor. In general, the richer a farmer household, the higher is the return rate of his household productive operations. Practical implications - The study of this paper reminds policy makers that poverty reduction microcredit rate should really take endurance capacity of poor farmers for credit rate into accounting because of the low return rate of their family investment. Exorbitant credit rate should be avoided to protect the credit right of poor farmers. Originality/value - There is seldom study on the comparison of return rates of family operation investment between poor and un-poor farmers; there is also unenough empirical study on the rationality of high interest rate on poor households from the return rate of investment point of view.

The research into innovation systems concentrates on innovative regions mainly and these are especially the metropolitan and urban areas. By contrast, a small attention is devoted to the innovation development in the peripheral or rural regions. The aim of the paper is to apply the theory of the regional innovation systems typology and to find relevant indicators that can be used as a basis for the determination of the peripheral regional innovation systems at the level of Czech regions. Applying the point method and the cluster analysis, it was found out that the definition of peripheral regions fits the best the regions Vysocina, Usti, South Bohemia and Karlovy Vary. In the peripheral regions, the strategy of catching up with the more developed regions is recommended for the innovation policy. These regions should focus on attracting external actors, supporting businesses to be founded, and generally, support small and medium-sized enterprises and links to external clusters and knowledge organizations. For innovations to develop in this type of regions, it is essential and of key importance to gain a long-term public support from the state or the regional government.","[Zitek, Vladimir; Klimova, Viktorie] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Lipova St 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Klimova, V (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Lipova St 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",klimova@econ.muni.cz,"Zitek, Vladimir/I-5431-2015; Klimova, Viktorie/I-4345-2015","Zitek, Vladimir/0000-0003-4724-2210; Klimova, Viktorie/0000-0002-2880-0371",,,,,39,10,10,1,28,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

However, within countries, resource booms and busts can have distinctive effects across local economies, as extractive regions face particular economic consequences unlikely to be observed in nonresource regions. Empirically, most studies analysing the resource curse have relied on cross-country models to estimate effects and inform policy; however, the use of regional - within-country - analysis has gained attention from scholars lately, promoted by two advantages: it avoids unobserved country heterogeneities confounding economic outcomes caused by resources and exploits the subnational quasi-natural experimental conditions generated by endowments. This paper contributes to the resource curse literature by discussing its theoretical causes across scale (regional vs. national effects) and highlighting the empirical challenges involved in the analysis of mining economic impacts across regions.

Cost projections are very sensitive to market conditions and program participation assumptions, and stochastic analysis indicates that farm program costs could easily differ from expected values by $5 billion or more in any given year. By replacing direct payments with new policies that make payments tied to market prices and yields, the bill could have important World Trade Organization (WTO) implications. If the new policies are classified as non-commodity specific amber box support, projections indicate that existing WTO limits on the current Aggregate Measure of Support would not be exceeded on average, but could be under some market conditions. Furthermore, the new policies are very likely to exceed some WTO rules proposed by various parties in the Doha Round negotiations.","[Glauber, Joseph W.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Westhoff, Patrick] Univ Missouri, Food & Agr Policy Res Inst, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Glauber, JW (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",,,,"US Department of Agriculture [58-0111-13-002, 58-0111-14-001]",US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"The research was supported by the US Department of Agriculture under agreement nos. 58-0111-13-002 and 58-0111-14-001.

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alternative policies for controlling nitrate pollution at both the field and farm level, this article utilizes a structural dynamic model of a representative CAFO. The model accounts for herd management, manure handling systems, crop rotations, water sources, irrigation systems, waste disposal options, and pollutant emissions. Results show that the standard approach of limiting the amount of animal waste that may be applied to fields reduces net farm income by more than 25%, whereas the most cost-effective emission-based policies reduce income only marginally. This motivates greater consideration for nonpoint source pollution control policies that target estimated emissions. Furthermore, price instruments are shown to slightly outperform quantity instruments under conditions that are typical for CAFOs. The results also show that adopting alternative technologies and practices is crucial for cost-effective abatement, and demonstrate the importance of accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of both irrigation water and salinity when designing policy mechanisms for nitrate pollution control.","[Wang, Jingjing] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Baerenklau, Kenneth A.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of New Mexico; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Wang, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",wangj@unm.edu,"wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022; WANG, JINGYI/GSJ-1241-2022","Wang, Jingjing/0000-0001-7589-0368",,,,,30,7,10,1,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Besides land sales and purchases, intergenerational transfers of assets may foster inequality in landholdings among second generation (2G) couples who, having wed after the 1980s reallocation, received no land from the government. Data analysis of three rice-growing villages reveals that land received directly from parents accounts for 18-41% of inequality in landholdings among sample 2G couples. Although net land gain after marriage, primarily through purchases, is the largest contributor to the inequality, nonland assets received from parents positively affect the net gain. Direct and indirect effects combined, assets received from parents account for 35-57% of inequality in landholdings.

We elucidate and address these issues in the context of a case study of research aiming to develop varieties that are resistant to Pierce's disease (PD) of grapevines. PD imposes costs of over $100 million per year on the California grape industry, even with public PD control programs in place. Research projects to develop PD resistant varieties of grapevines are at various stages of completion. We describe the economic problems posed by PD, document the research programs undertaken to address the disease and present an economic assessment of the returns to the investment, which are conditional on other policies. Using a simulation model of the market for California winegrapes, we estimate the benefits from research, development and adoption of PD-resistant vines as ranging from $4 million to $129 million annually over a 50-year horizon, depending on the length of the R&D lag and the rate of adoption.

We develop a theoretical model of Bayesian updating, perform comparative statics over the model, and show how the theoretical model can be consistently incorporated into a reduced form econometric model. Our main findings are that in a random utility model (RUM) discrete choice model, a subject's scale should increase and the variability of scale should decrease with experience if subjects are Bayesians. We then estimate the model using field data regarding preferences for one particular public good, water quality. We find strong evidence that additional experience increases scale, thereby making consumer preferences more predictable from the econometrician's perspective.

In part, this has occurred because of conscious deregulation of previous price support and stabilisation schemes. Occasionally, the changes occurred because of poor administration and spectacular default. Previous price and marketing policies schemes provided differential rates of assistance with adverse consequences for resource allocation. Pricing arrangements affected marketing institutions and marketing costs beyond the farm gate, domestically and internationally. The conceptual basis of agricultural marketing analysis was contested. Private and public roles were confused, including between Commonwealth and state governments. Key principles of agricultural marketing and policy development in Australia are illustrated in the paper by reference to commodities with different histories and economic characteristics: wool, wheat, dairying and meat. Special emphasis is given to market information and price discovery. In line with continuing urbanisation and modern logistics, retail marketing of agricultural products has also been transformed. This has become controversial as a policy issue. Competition issues, the economic behaviour and performance of supermarkets, and their effects on farmers and consumers are also introduced in the paper.","[Griffith, Garry] Univ New England, Sch Business, Armidale, NSW, Australia",University of New England,"Griffith, G (通讯作者)，Univ New England, Sch Business, Armidale, NSW, Australia.",ggriffit@une.edu.au,,"Griffith, Garry/0000-0002-5276-6222",,,,,47,7,7,3,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

We use a specific factors computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to simulate the short-run impact of this retaliatory policy. The baseline is carefully designed to isolate the impacts of the ban on the European Union (EU), Russia itself and a selection of key trade partners. The modelling of the ban follows a novel approach, where it is treated as a loss of established trade preferences via reductions in consumer utility in the Armington import function. Not surprisingly, the results indicate that Russia bears the highest income loss (about (sic) 3.4 billion) while the EU recovers part of its lost trade through expansion of exports to other markets. An ex-post comparison between simulation results and observed trade data reveals the model predictions to be broadly accurate, thereby validating the robustness of the modelling approach.","[Boulanger, Pierre; Dudu, Hasan; Ferrari, Emanuele] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Agr & Life Sci Econ Unit, Seville, Spain; [Philippidis, George] Aragonese Agcy Res & Dev ARAID, Ctr Food Res & Technol CITA, Zaragoza, Spain; [Philippidis, George] Wageningen Univ, LEI, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Philippidis, George] Univ Loyola Andalusia, Dept Econ, Seville, Spain",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); Wageningen University & Research; Universidad Loyola Andalucia,"Boulanger, P (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Agr & Life Sci Econ Unit, Seville, Spain.",pierre.boulanger@ec.europa.eu,"Boulanger, Pierre/AAW-6397-2020; Ferrari, Emanuele/J-4954-2019; Dudu, Hasan/AAX-2338-2020","Boulanger, Pierre/0000-0003-1793-6203; Ferrari, Emanuele/0000-0003-0031-7190; Dudu, Hasan/0000-0002-2820-1096",,,,,24,31,33,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

We model price relationships between international rice prices and 221 domestic prices in 47 developing countries that import rice. We use a threshold vector error correction model that accounts for transaction costs of trade in spatial price transmission, and an improved regularised Bayesian threshold estimator for threshold models. Our results show that threshold values are higher after 2008 than before, which suggests that transaction costs in international rice trade have increased in recent years. Threshold values are highest for Latin American countries followed by African and Asian countries, and higher for retail than for wholesale prices. Since 2008, price transmission is slower in countries that responded to high and volatile prices with domestic market-based interventions such as price controls and faster in countries that responded by lowering tariffs and by implementing production support measures.","[Jamora, Nelissa] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Jamora, Nelissa] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; [von Cramon-Taubadel, Stephan] Univ Gottingen, Agr Policy, Gottingen, Germany; [von Cramon-Taubadel, Stephan] Nanjing Agr Univ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; Nanjing Agricultural University,"Jamora, N (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",njamora@uga.edu,"Jamora, Nelissa/IWE-3750-2023","Jamora, Nelissa/0000-0002-2535-242X",German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the GlobalFood Program [RTG 1666],German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the GlobalFood Program,"The research was financially supported through the German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the GlobalFood Program (RTG 1666).

The models also account for unique time-series patterns inherent in crop price data. The results point to two main conclusions. First, mixture models appear to provide an easy-to-estimate approach for capturing real-life crop price movements. Second, mixture models find that, during extreme market downswings, correlations in price movements strengthen by several orders of magnitude. These results suggest that structured securities assembled from different crops tend to lose diversified protection during extreme market downswings, the exact times when such protection is needed most.","[Zimmer, David M.] Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Econ, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA",Western Kentucky University,"Zimmer, DM (通讯作者)，Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Econ, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA.",david.zimmer@wku.edu,,,,,,,34,5,5,0,1,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The fact that applied economics offers theory and methods that help us address topics as diverse as the Canadian grain value chain and the economics of species at risk speaks well for the future of our discipline. There is a vast array of work for us to do. Membership in the CAES offers an excellent link to the most up-to-date research in this area through our journal and conferences. Every society I attend inspires me to examine my own research and look at problems in new ways using new tools I learned from presentations made by the members of CAES. The main message of my address is to promote the application of Game Theory strategies as a way to understand behavior in the grain value chain. These tools are already being applied in areas as different as optimizing tradable systems of environmental goods and assessing competitive behavior in beef packing. Tout d'abord, je tiens a mentionner que j'appuie l'adhesion a la Societe canadienne d'agroeconomie (SCAE). Le fait que l'economie appliquee offre la theorie et les methodes qui nous aident a examiner des sujets aussi varies que la chaine de valeur des grains du Canada et l'economie des especes en peril augure bien pour l'avenir de notre discipline. La diversite du travail a accomplir est immense. Etre membre de la SCAE procure un lien privilegie a la recherche de pointe grace a notre Revue et a nos conferences. Aujourd'hui, mon message vise principalement a promouvoir l'application des strategies de la theorie des jeux pour comprendre le comportement au sein de la chaine de valeur des grains. Certains domaines, tels que l'optimisation des systemes d'echange des biens environnementaux et l'evaluation du comportement concurrentiel dans le secteur du conditionnement du bOEuf, utilisent deja ces outils. La panoplie d'outils a notre disposition est mise en valeur dans notre Revue et lors de nos congres. Tous les congres auxquels j'assiste me motivent a examiner ma propre recherche et a analyser les problemes sous un angle different grace aux nouveaux outils mis au point et presentes par les membres de la SCAE.","[Brewin, Derek G.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, 353-66 Dafoe Rd, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Brewin, DG (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, 353-66 Dafoe Rd, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",brewindg@ms.umanitoba.ca,"Brewin, Derek/ABB-1374-2020","Brewin, Derek/0000-0003-4514-5441",,,,,51,9,9,4,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

However, due in part to previous data deficiencies, there is still little evidence supporting the assumption that improved food store access will alter dietary habits, especially for the poorest of U.S. households. This article uses the new National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS) to estimate consumer food outlet choices as a function of outlet type and household attributes in a multinomial mixed logit model. In particular, we allow for the composition of the local retail food environment to play a role in explaining household store choice decisions and food acquisition patterns. We find that households are willing to pay more per week in distance traveled to shop at superstores, supermarkets, and fast food outlets than at farmers markets and smaller grocery stores, and that willingness to pay is heterogeneous across income group, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participation, and other household and food environment characteristics. Our results imply that policymakers should consider incentivizing the building of certain outlet types over others, and that Healthy Food Financing Initiatives should be designed to fit the sociodemographic composition of each identified low-income, low-access area in question.","[Taylor, Rebecca; Villas-Boas, Sofia B.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Taylor, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",becca.taylor@berkeley.edu,"Villas-Boas, Sofia B/B-6241-2009","Taylor, Rebecca/0000-0002-9014-8775; Villas-Boas, Sofia/0000-0001-8443-4364","University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service and Food and Nutrition Service [58-5000-1-0050, 58-5000-3-0066]","University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service and Food and Nutrition Service","This project was supported with a grant from the University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research through funding by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service and Food and Nutrition Service, Agreement Numbers 58-5000-1-0050 and 58-5000-3-0066.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper defines the extent of the Belt and Road in terms of geographical boundaries, justifying the application of the stochastic frontier gravity model to the FDI analysis, and then constructing a frontier regression model to assess the China's outward FDI efficiency and it determinants in countries along the Belt and Road. Findings - Regarding the core gravity parameter estimates, China's outward FDI was highly consistent with the gravity model. As far as policy parameters are concerned, China's outward FDI was significantly restricted by some man-made barriers in host countries. According to the estimated FDI efficiency scores, China has huge outward FDI potential in countries along the Belt and Road. In general, China's outward FDI efficiency demonstrated a consistent uptrend from the perspectives of both FDI flows and stocks over the period of 2003-2013. Although China's outward FDI performance indicated a very uneven pattern across different countries and periods, there were no significant performance differences between the Road and Belt. Practical implications - The Belt and Road initiative can be largely beneficial to China's outward FDI, but the specific framework of cooperation should be designed on the basis of determinants of China's outward FDI. The regional cooperation with the Road countries should mainly focus on the removal of business barriers and financial barriers. The regional cooperation with the Belt countries should mainly concern the improvement of local intellectual property protection, the reduction of local tax burden, and removal of business barriers and financial barriers. Originality/value - To the authors' best knowledge, no existing literature has specifically examined the efficiency of China's outward FDI in the countries along the Belt and Road and its determinants.","[Fan, Zhaobin; Zhang, Ruohan; Liu, Xiaotong; Pan, Lin] Jinan Univ, Int Business Sch, Zhuhai, Peoples R China",Jinan University,"Fan, ZB (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Int Business Sch, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.",tfanzb@jnu.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Fund of China [13BRK013]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [15jnlh007],National Social Science Fund of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"the authors acknowledge support from the National Social Science Fund of China (Grant Number 13BRK013), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant Number 15jnlh007).",,28,41,43,9,187,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The authors' investigations show that the time series of typhoons and rice damages are described by nonlinear. The result of the assessment shows that the model based on the AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model is the best performing model in describing the rice loss severity due to typhoons and may have a chaotic behaviour if the variation of parameters is large enough.

The material exchange is causing spreading of diseases that have caused a severe damage, such as the epidemics and culture extinctions with a high economic, health, environmental and social impact. In such a context, the definition of possible methods to face the emergencies is absolutely necessary. This research suggests the adoption of an evaluation model for phytosanitary emergencies (Citrus Tristeza Virus - CTV), a model that is sustainable from the economic, social, biotic and phytosanitary perspective. It is based on an integrated model that considers the application of a participatory planning technique and of an evaluation method included among the tools of the Social Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SMCE). The results highlighted that the hypothesis 1 cohabitation with the Citrus Tristeza virus is the predominant hypothesis, followed at short distance by the hypothesis 2 total eradication and re-implantation, while the hypothesis 3 abandonment or extirpation gained a marginal meaning.

Several policy alternatives are currently being considered in order to improve the efficiency of irrigation water use so that extraction of groundwater is diminished. An understanding and quantification of different sources of inefficiency in groundwater extraction is critical for policy design. Survey data from a geographically extensive sample of irrigators is used to gauge the importance of common pool problems on input-specific irrigation inefficiency. Results show that mechanisms of electricity cost sharing implemented in many wells have a sizable impact on inefficiency of irrigation application. Moreover, irrigation is very inelastic to its own unitary cost. Therefore, results suggest that policies aimed at eliminating electricity cost-sharing mechanisms would be significantly more effective than electricity price-based policies in reducing irrigation application. Results also show that well sharing does not affect groundwater pumping significantly, suggesting either a limited effect of individual pumping on water level or absence of strategic pumping by farmers sharing the wells.","[Sun, Shanxia; Sesmero, Juan P.] Purdue Univ, Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Schoengold, Karina] Univ Nebraska, Agr Econ, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Sun, SX (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Agr Econ, 403 West State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",sun217@purdue.edu,"Sun, Shanxia/JTV-5571-2023","Schoengold, Karina/0000-0001-9378-7129",Purdue Research Foundation,Purdue Research Foundation,"The authors would like to thank Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Ecologia y Cambio Climatico for conducting the survey and collecting the data we use in the analysis.

The analysis is based on 110 adult (nonstudent) participants who participated in a two-stage economic experiment taking place three months apart. In the first stage of the experiment, willingness-to-pay (WTP) was elicited for items that were stated to contain bovine growth hormones, genetically modified ingredients, ingredients that have been exposed to antibiotics, and ingredients that were irradiated. Depending on the treatment, each first-stage auction was supplemented with positive or negative information about each of the labels. The second-stage experiments re-elicited WTP for the same group of participants and the same items accompanied with the original labels, but this time without any secondary information. Our results suggest that the adverse impact of negative information does not persist over time; whereas in the case of positive information, changes in WTP from the initial to the follow-up auctions are not statistically significant. This study enhances our understanding of how consumers retain information over a longer time period and suggests that previous studies that measure labeling impacts on WTP using isolated, single-shot experiments may overstate the longer term effects of labels and negative information.","[Liaukonyte, Jura; Streletskaya, Nadia A.; Kaiser, Harry M.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Liaukonyte, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, 340B Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",Jurate@cornell.edu; nas245@cornell.edu,"Streletskaya, Nadia A/HPH-8381-2023; Streletskaya, Nadia/KAG-1211-2024; Streletskaya, Nadia/GOV-5233-2022","Streletskaya, Nadia/0000-0001-7306-8426",,,,,46,7,9,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

The purpose of our paper is to quantify the impact of HFSS regulations on household expenditures in the three sequential phases that reflect the evolution of the U.K. regulatory regime: a period of no regulation, a period of voluntary self-regulation at company level, and the current coregulation implemented by the industry code of practice. Results suggest that coregulation is the only regulatory mechanism that leads to a significant reduction in advertising expenditures. The reduction in total advertising of 11.4 million is composed of an 15.2 million decrease in television (TV) HFSS advertising expenditures. This decline in TV advertising is partially compensated by other media, which translates to a change in household HFSS food and drink expenditures. However, self-regulation and coregulation lead to reduction on HFSS expenditure. As a result of regulation, households without children decrease HFSS drink expenditures by 5.2 pound per capita (per quarter), while households with children decrease per capita HFSS food expenditures by 14.9 pound and HFSS drink expenditures by 5.6 pound (per quarter).","[Silva, Andres] INRA, French Natl Inst Agr Res, UR Food & Social Sci Res Unit ALISS 1303, F-94205 Ivry, France; [Higgins, Lindsey M.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Agribusiness Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Hussein, Mohamud] Food & Environm Res Agcy, Sand Hutton YO41 1LZ, Yorks, England",Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo; Food & Environment Research Agency,"Silva, A (通讯作者)，INRA, French Natl Inst Agr Res, UR Food & Social Sci Res Unit ALISS 1303, 65 Blvd Brandebourg, F-94205 Ivry, France.",asilvam@uc.cl; lhiggins@calpoly.edu; mohamud.hussein@fera.gsi.gov.uk,,"Higgins, Lindsey/0000-0001-9873-9919; Silva Montes, Andres/0000-0002-4816-2821",,,,,49,15,15,0,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Using a face-to-face survey in farming communities in Aragon (Spain), and through the estimation of an Ordered Logit model (OL), we assess the ranking of AES attributes, and obtain their economic valuation according to the farmers' preferences. We find that social factors are also important in determining farmers' decisions. In particular, the importance of social trust and expectation of compliance by other neighbours, encourage farmers to sign up to AES. These and other results may be used to design more effective AES and help to solve this important biodiversity problem.","[Allo, Maria; Loureiro, Maria L.] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Econ Theory, Santiago De Compostela 15280, Spain; [Iglesias, Eva] Tech Univ Madrid, Dept Agr Econ, Madrid, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Alló, M (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Econ Theory, Santiago De Compostela 15280, Spain.",maria.loure-iro@usc.es,"Alló, Maria/GLV-5840-2022; Iglesias, Eva/K-6614-2017; Loureiro, Maria/Q-2384-2015","Alló, Maria/0000-0003-1389-7235; Iglesias, Eva/0000-0002-7086-7553; Loureiro, Maria/0000-0002-7082-3980",Proyecto Ganga-SEO Birdlife,Proyecto Ganga-SEO Birdlife,"Maria Allo and Maria L.

In this paper, we present results from an experimental demand-elicitation exercise in rural Bangladesh to shed light on smallholder farmers' interest in formal insurance products. We propose a suite of insurance and savings products, and we randomly vary the price of one insurance option (area-yield insurance) and the presence of one of the savings options (group savings). Consistent with economic theory, farmers buy more of the insurance products that cover the risks they primarily face. However, because farmers are subject to a variety of risks, they do not focus on only one type of insurance; instead, they evenly split their endowment between life and disability insurance and agricultural insurance. Demand for area-yield insurance falls with price; we also observe important cross-price elasticities with other insurance products. The presence of group savings does not alter demand for insurance, though group savings is found to be a particularly popular risk management tool, especially when decisions are made in groups.","[Clarke, Daniel; de Nicola, Francesca; Hill, Ruth Vargas] World Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Kumar, Neha] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Mehta, Parendi] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",The World Bank; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of California System; University of California Davis,"Kumar, N (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",N.Kumar@cgiar.org,"Kumar, Neha/GSI-5286-2022",,International Food Policy Research Institute and Index Insurance Innovation Initiative,International Food Policy Research Institute and Index Insurance Innovation Initiative,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the International Food Policy Research Institute and Index Insurance Innovation Initiative.

On the other hand, there is mixed evidence for a negative effect of supermarkets on child nutrition, particularly for those in high-income households.","[Umberger, Wendy J.; He, Xiaobo] Univ Adelaide, Global Food Studies, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Minot, Nicholas] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, Washington, DC USA; [Toiba, Hery] Brawijaya Univ, Malang, Jawa Timur, Indonesia",University of Adelaide; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Brawijaya University,"Umberger, WJ (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Global Food Studies, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",wendy.umberger@adelaide.edu.au,"Toiba, Hery/AFK-1090-2022; Toiba, Hery/GXG-2224-2022; Umberger, Wendy/HSF-2064-2023; Toiba, Hery/AAF-8272-2022","Toiba, Hery/0000-0003-3816-9066; Umberger, Wendy/0000-0003-4159-7782; Toiba, Hery/0000-0003-3816-9066; Minot, Nicholas/0000-0001-9657-0427",Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) [ADP/2005/006],Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res),"Wendy J.

In this paper we investigate the effects of variations in the timing and location of choice experiment questions concerned with conservation of a UK national park, as research involving measurement of psychological well-being suggests potential differences for the same individual dependent upon when and where preferences are elicited. We apply the choice experiment technique to the valuation of changes in upland agricultural and semi-natural landscapes in the Peak District National Park in the UK, to investigate whether timing and location of elicitation (context) affects the value associated with changes in ecosystem services under different management regimes. Four treatments are employed - using the same sample of individuals answering the same choice scenarios - to measure WTP ex-ante (off site), in situ (on site), and ex-post at two different time intervals (off site). We show that our on-site (in situ) treatment generates very different estimates of preferences than any of the off-site treatments. That stated preferences associated with environmental goods are so context dependent may have implications for the use of stated preferences in policy analysis in terms of identifying how environmental policy is funded and the divergence in value attributed to sampling different populations.","[Tinch, Dugald; Hanley, Nick] Univ Stirling, Dept Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Colombo, Sergio] IFAPA Area Econ & Sociol Agr, Granada 18004, Spain",University of Stirling,"Tinch, D (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Dept Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",dugald.tinch@stir.ac.uk,"Colombo, Sergio/IXD-1645-2023; Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012; Colombo, Sergio/D-2143-2011; Tinch, Dugald/F-5041-2015","Colombo, Sergio/0000-0001-7307-9811; Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499; Tinch, Dugald/0000-0001-6411-0629",UK Research Councils' Rural Economy and Land Use programme; ESRC; NERC,UK Research Councils' Rural Economy and Land Use programme; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"Dugald Tinch and Nick Hanley are with the Economics Department at the University of Stirling, Scotland.

We document how biotechnology and management interact to improve agricultural productivity and reduce farm risk exposure. For corn, we find that GM European Corn Borer (GM-ECB) technology consistently increases CE (the increase ranging from +4.6% to +11.8%) and that a significant part of this increase can come from risk reduction.

The paper aims to detect structural breaks and compare differences before and after the change points. Design/methodology/approach - The structural breaks detection procedures in this paper can be applied to find out two different types of change points, i.e. in the middle and at the end of one time series. Then time series and regression models are used to compare differences of trade relationship before and after the detected change points. The methods can be employed in any economic series and work well in practice. Findings - The results indicate that structural breaks in 2002 and 2009 are caused by China's accession to WTO and the financial crisis. Time series and regression models show that the development of China's exports to Germany in agri-food products has different features in different sub-periods. Before 1999, there is no significant relationship between China's exports to Germany and Germany's imports from the world. Between 2002 and 2008 the former depends on the latter very strongly, and China's exports to Germany developed quickly and stably. It decreased, however suddenly in 2009, caused by the great reduction of Germany's imports from the world in that year. But China's market share in Germany still had a small gain. Analysis of two categories in agri-food trade also leads to similar conclusions. Comparing the two events we see rather different patterns even if they both indicate structural breaks in the development of China's agri-food exports to Germany. Originality/value - This paper partly originally proposes two statistical algorithms for detecting different kinds of structural breaks in the middle part and at the end of a short-time series, respectively.","[Guo, Zhichao] Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Feng, Yuanhua; Gries, Thomas] Univ Gesamthsch Paderborn, Fac Business Adm & Econ, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany",Beijing Technology & Business University; University of Paderborn,"Guo, ZC (通讯作者)，Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",sxguozc@hotmail.com,,,,,,,32,4,4,3,40,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This study describes the approaches for the organised value chains as a new business model in a globalized world and it describes about the great variety of financial arrangements found in India and the actors in the agri-food chain with varying degrees of formality and informality. The study also brings about the role of the value chain in promoting the rural financing deepening, the financial operators that use agricultural value chain to provide dynamic, innovative services with low cost transaction costs and the technical assistance programs to help the participants in the chain to upgrade their operations, to reduce risk and to improve the access to financial services and concludes by identifying the changes in paradigm.","[Soundarrajan, Parvadavardini] PSG Coll Technol, Dept Humanities, Coimbatore 641004, Tamil Nadu, India; [Vivek, Nagarajan] PSG Inst Management, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India",PSG College Technology,"Soundarrajan, P (通讯作者)，PSG Coll Technol, Coimbatore 641004, Tamil Nadu, India.",parvadavardini@gmail.com,"N, Vivek/GOP-3808-2022","N, Vivek/0000-0002-0422-0655",,,,,12,7,9,3,26,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

We propose modeling crop yields using mixtures with embedded trend functions to account for potentially different rates of technological change in different components of the yield distribution. By doing so we can test some interesting and previously untested hypotheses about the data generating process of yields. For example: (1) is the rate of technological change equivalent across components, and (2) are the probabilities of components constant over time? Our results-technological change is not equivalent across components and probabilities tend not to have changed significantly over time-have implications for modeling yields. We find estimated conditional yield densities are quite different when unique trend functions are embedded inside the mixture components versus estimating the same mixture with detrended data. Also, we prove different rates of technological change in different components lead to nonconstant variance with respect to time (i.e., heteroscedasticity). We present two applications of the proposed yield model. The first application considers climate determinants of component membership, where our results are consistent with the literature for climate determinants of yields. The second application compares the proposed yield model to USDA's current rating methodology for area-yield crop insurance contracts and finds the proposed model may lead to more accurate rates.","[Tolhurst, Tor N.; Ker, Alan P.] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University of Guelph,"Ker, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",aker@uoguelph.ca,,,Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food; Institute for the Advanced Study of Food and Agricultural Policy at the University of Guelph; Structure and Performance of Agriculture and Agri-products Industries network,Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food; Institute for the Advanced Study of Food and Agricultural Policy at the University of Guelph; Structure and Performance of Agriculture and Agri-products Industries network,"This article was derived from the first author's M.Sc. thesis completed at the University of Guelph.

Government transfers and relief income, aiming at the poor, help alleviate inequality and poverty, but are not targeting the poorest. Unequal distribution of production subsidies actually lead to higher poverty incidence.

Because the study of behavior in the face of risk and uncertainty has mostly focused on behavior in the face of income risk and uncertainty, we first review the theoretical and empirical literatures on behavior in the face of price risk and uncertainty. Then, because policy recommendations are only as good as the empirical findings on which they are based, and because market-level phenomena such as price risk do not lend themselves well to randomization, we discuss the ways in which experimental economics can inform our understanding of price risk. Finally, because expected utilitythe workhorse model used to study behavior in the face of risk and uncertaintyfails to account for a number of behaviors, we discuss how insights from behavioral economics could be incorporated into the study of price risk, with the ultimate goal of generating more policy-relevant findings.","[Bellemare, Marc F.; Lee, Yu Na] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Bellemare, Marc F.] Univ Minnesota, Ctr Int Food & Agr Policy, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Bellemare, MF (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.;Bellemare, MF (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Ctr Int Food & Agr Policy, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",mbellema@umn.edu; leex5244@umn.edu,"Bellemare, Marc F./HCH-3192-2022; LEE, YU/JXY-2338-2024",,,,,,39,7,7,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Key to solving the P pollution puzzle is to take stock of progress to date, the puzzle pieces available, and the gaps to be filled. In this paper, we synthesize the state of knowledge on P pollution, discuss the state of existing public programs, and review economists' contributions to informing P pollution policies. We review the water quality valuation literature, identifying limitations in the linkages to policy-relevant environmental quality metrics. We examine how and why P is used agriculturally, along with recent advances in market-based policy design and field testing. We survey new knowledge in biology and engineering, including improved understanding of the fate and transport of P. In light of recent learning and persistent knowledge gaps, we recommend directions for economic research to add needed pieces to the puzzle of how to protect our water bodies. Puzzle gaps meriting attention include mechanisms to target public funds more effectively in voluntary abatement programs, policy design for emerging mitigation technologies, new ways to implement performance-based policies, means to leverage social norms and behavioral cues, changes in the pay-the-polluter paradigm, and application of state-of-the-art evaluation methods to conservation programs.

A sharp decline in the number of U.S. dairy farms and an increase in average herd sizes have accompanied exits, which have been concentrated among smaller herds. Given that more productive farms are better positioned to increase operation size and to continue operation, we hypothesize that the more technically efficient farms are better able to expand and also have stronger incentives to continue production. Using data from the USDA's 2010 ARMS Phase III, Dairy Production Practices and Costs and Returns Report, we estimate technical efficiency using stochastic production frontier analysis with endogenous inputs. The efficiency estimate is then incorporated into the analysis of exit intention and herd size. The results confirm our hypotheses that smaller and less efficient farms are more likely to exit and that more efficient dairy farms tend to expand herd size. Moreover, farms without successors but with older and more educated operators are more likely to exit.","[Dong, Fengxia] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hennessy, David A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Hennessy, David A.; Jensen, Helen H.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Volpe, Richard J.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Agribusiness Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Michigan State University; Iowa State University; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Dong, FX (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",fdong6@wisc.edu,,,USDA Economic Research Service [58-4000-9-0049]; Iowa State University [58-4000-9-0049],USDA Economic Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Iowa State University,"The Economic Research Service, US Department of Agriculture (Washington, DC) provided access to the data, as well as partial financial support for the analysis under Cooperative Research Agreement 58-4000-9-0049 between USDA Economic Research Service and Iowa State University.

Disruption of this network may catalyse systemic risks affecting food, energy, water and environmental security (FEWES) worldwide. We describe the conceptual development, expansion and practical application of a stochastic version of the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM), used to assess competition for land use between agriculture, bioenergy and forestry at regional and global scales. In the stochastic version of the model, systemic risks of various kinds are explicitly covered and can be analysed and mitigated in all their interactions. While traditional deterministic scenario analysis produces sets of scenario-dependent outcomes, stochastic GLOBIOM explicitly derives robust outcomes that leave the systems better-off, independently of which scenario applies. Stochastic GLOBIOM is formulated as a stochastic optimisation model that is critical for evaluating portfolios of robust interdependent decisions: ex-ante strategic decisions (production allocation, storage capacities) and ex-post adaptive (demand, trading, storage control) decisions. As an example, the model is applied to the question of optimal storage facilities, as buffers for production shortfalls, to meet regional and global FEWES requirements when extreme events occur. Expected shortfalls and storage capacities have a close relationship with Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) risk measures. A Value of Stochastic Solutions is calculated to illustrate the benefits of the stochastic over the deterministic model approach.","[Ermolieva, Tatiana; Havlik, Petr; Ermoliev, Yuri; Mosnier, Aline; Obersteiner, Michael; Leclere, David; Khabarov, Nikolay; Valin, Hugo; Reuter, Wolf] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, Laxenburg, Austria; [Reuter, Wolf] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Ermolieva, T (通讯作者)，Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, Laxenburg, Austria.",ermol@iiasa.ac.at,"Valin, Hugo/Z-1557-2019","Valin, Hugo/0000-0002-0618-773X; Mosnier, Aline/0000-0001-8566-1593; Havlik, Petr/0000-0001-5551-5085; Leclere, David/0000-0002-8658-1509","EU [603906, 613532, 612755]",EU(European Union (EU)),"The development of stochastic GLOBIOM contributes to ECONADAPT (603906), TRANSMANGO (613532), and AGRICISTRADE (612755) EU FP7 projects.",,47,18,19,2,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

These trade policies are inconsistent with the terms-of-trade motivation often retained to characterize the payoff frontier of self-enforcing trade agreements, as they can worsen the terms of trade of the countries that apply them. This article analyzes trade policy coordination when trade policies are driven by terms-of-trade effects and a desire to reduce domestic food price volatility. This framework implies that importing and exporting countries have incentives to deviate from cooperation at different periods: the latter when prices are high and the former when prices are low. Since staple food prices tend to have asymmetric distributions, with more prices below than above the mean but with occasional spikes, a self-enforcing agreement generates asymmetric outcomes. Without cooperation, an importing country uses its trade policy more frequently because of the concentration of prices below the mean, but an exporting country has a greater incentive to deviate from a cooperative trade policy because positive deviations from the mean price are larger than negative ones. Thus, the asymmetry of the distribution of commodity prices can make it more difficult to discipline export taxes than tariffs in trade agreements.","[Gouel, Christophe] INRA, Econ Publ, Paris, France; [Gouel, Christophe] CEPII, Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE,"Gouel, C (通讯作者)，INRA, Econ Publ, Paris, France.;Gouel, C (通讯作者)，CEPII, Paris, France.",christophe.gouel@grignon.inra.fr,"Gouel, Christophe/G-9859-2011","Gouel, Christophe/0000-0002-3946-5222",Knowledge for Change Program (KCP); European Union [290693],Knowledge for Change Program (KCP); European Union(European Union (EU)),"Christophe Gouel is a junior researcher at Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA), Economie Publique, and a research fellow at Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales (CEPII).

We quantify the economic impacts of climate change on agriculture through changes in both quantity and quality, where quality is measured by crop grades. Our model controls for methodological issues regarding sample selection, aggregation, phenology, and nonlinearity. The empirical application to Japanese rice production indicates that temperature effects are asymmetric: quantity is especially vulnerable to cold, whereas quality is vulnerable to extremely high temperature. Using these results, we simulate the effect of global warming, and we find that warming (a 3 A degrees C increase) increases farm revenues by improving yield but decreases revenues as a result of deteriorating quality. The net effect is negative, suggesting that quality matters more than quantity. The negative effect, however, can be mitigated by shifting cultivation periods and/or regions. Overall, our results suggest that the estimated impacts of climate change and adaptation strategies could be severely misleading unless quality is considered.","[Kawasaki, Kentaro] PRIMAFF, Tokyo, Japan; [Kawasaki, Kentaro] OECD, Tokyo, Japan; [Uchida, Shinsuke] Nagoya City Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Nagoya City University,"Kawasaki, K (通讯作者)，PRIMAFF, Tokyo, Japan.;Kawasaki, K (通讯作者)，OECD, Tokyo, Japan.",kenkawa@affrc.go.jp,,"Uchida, Shinsuke/0000-0002-2803-4734",,,,,39,44,47,8,66,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The analysis takes account of thresholds in price adjustments toward their long-run equilibrium. The first stage considers the price dynamics between international and Indian domestic cotton prices. The second stage considers price transmission from domestic to farm gate cotton prices in Vidarbha. Results from the first stage indicate that Indian and international cotton markets are well-integrated. In contrast, the second stage reveals significant threshold-type nonlinearities as well as asymmetries in price transmission between domestic and farm gate prices. The short-run dynamics suggest that the pass-through from domestic to farm gate prices is larger when domestic prices decrease than when they increase. Moreover, back of the envelope calculations suggest that the loss in revenue for a typical farmer from a decrease in domestic price is larger than the gains from an increase in domestic price of the same magnitude. The implication is that traders benefit from price fluctuations at the expense of farmers. Evidence from fieldwork in Vidarbha suggest that asymmetries revealed in this analysis may be linked to trader's market power and inadequate market information among farmers.","[Shrinivas, Aditya] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Gomez, Miguel I.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Cornell University,"Shrinivas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",shriniv2@illinois.edu,"Gomez, Miguel I./AAD-3707-2019",,Tata-Cornell Agriculture and Nutrition Initiative (TCi),Tata-Cornell Agriculture and Nutrition Initiative (TCi),The authors are grateful for the support from Tata-Cornell Agriculture and Nutrition Initiative (TCi).

We examined the degree of habit formation and the role of advertising for cigarettes, little cigars/cigarillos, large cigars, e-cigarettes, and smokeless tobacco using market-level scanner data for convenience stores from 2009 to 2013. Results based on a dynamic demand system show that while all tobacco products are habitual, e-cigarettes are the most habitual product. More choices of flavors, less restrictions on its use in public places, less documented harmful effects, and a higher upfront cost might explain the higher degree of habit formation for e-cigarettes. We also find that e-cigarettes did not substitute for or complement cigarettes. The results imply that e-cigarettes may serve as a gateway to nicotine addiction but not necessarily to cigarette smoking. Regarding advertising, cigarette magazine advertising did not affect cigarette demand, while e-cigarette TV advertising increased e-cigarette demand with a positive spillover to cigarette demand. Such results may help explain e-cigarettes' recent success in sales and imply that e-cigarette TV advertising might undermine efforts to reduce cigarette smoking.

This paper focuses on specific potential causes by estimating economies of scale and technical efficiency for a panel of Quebec dairy farms that spans the 2001-10 period. Additionally, this paper investigates the sources of total factor productivity growth. The stochastic frontier analysis, based on an input-distance function, is used to estimate returns to scale relationships across dairy farms. The results show that there is significant economies scale to be exploited and that cost of production could also be reduced by improving technical efficiency. Accordingly, the paper indicates that input-mix effect is the main source of total factor productivity growth. The results have important implications for Canada's supply management policy, and more specifically for the trading of production quota between dairy farmers, as well as for the delivery of targeted extension services.","[Singbo, Alphonse] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, BP 320, Bamako, Mali; [Larue, Bruno] Univ Laval, CREATE, Agri Food Trade, Canada Res Chair Int, 2425 Rue Agr,Local 4417 Pavillon Paul Comtois, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); Laval University,"Larue, B (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, CREATE, Agri Food Trade, Canada Res Chair Int, 2425 Rue Agr,Local 4417 Pavillon Paul Comtois, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",alphonsesingbo@gmail.com; bruno.larue@eac.ulaval.ca,,"Singbo, Alphonse/0000-0002-7605-3737",,,,,47,16,16,3,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

Our aim is to provide up-to-date estimates of the duration of the cycles, and to determine whether or not some of the recent market shocks can be associated with changes in the nature of the cycles. Spectral decomposition of the variables reveals 10-year cycles in total cattle inventories, beef cow inventories, beef supply, and beef prices. Seasonal and annual cycles are also found in beef supply and prices, respectively. Using intervention analysis, exchange rate appreciation, feed price escalation, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) are modeled as pure jumps. Exchange rate and feed price shocks are modeled as having started in 2002 and 2007, respectively, and persisted up to the end of the sample period, while BSE is modeled as a shift for the period 2003 to 2005. We find significant impacts of the three shocks on total inventories, but beef supply appears to have been impacted by exchange rates and BSE. A spectral comparison of the pre- and post-shock periodograms of beef supply reveals a 58% reduction in the peak amplitude of the beef supply cycle. Dans le present article, nous analysons les cycles du secteur canadien des bovins de boucherie par le biais des proprietes des series chronologiques de quatre variables associees a ce secteur, a savoir le cheptel bovin total, le cheptel de vaches de boucherie, l'approvisionnement en bOEuf et les prix du bOEuf. Notre objectif consiste a fournir des estimations a jour de la duree des cycles et a determiner si certains chocs ayant recemment secoue les marches peuvent etre associes ou non a des changements lies a la nature des cycles. La decomposition spectrale des variables montre que le cheptel bovin, le cheptel de vaches de boucherie, l'approvisionnement en bOEuf et les prix du bOEuf suivent des cycles de dix ans. L'approvisionnement en bOEuf et les prix du bOEuf suivent respectivement des cycles saisonnier et annuel. l'aide de l'analyse d'intervention, nous avons modelise l'appreciation du taux de change, la flambee des prix des aliments pour animaux et les episodes d'encephalopathie spongiforme bovine (ESB) comme etant des chocs.

China's dietary shift from plant to animal-based foods, induced by its income growth, is likely to impose considerable pressure on agricultural resources. China's demand for food on this measure appears consistent with global trends, while China is an out-performer on the supply side, producing much more food than its income level and land endowment would predict. China's current per capita income is in a range where consumption growth is high and in excess of production growth, but the gap between supply and demand is likely to diminish as population and per capita consumption growth decelerate. Continuing agricultural productivity growth and sustainable resource management will be important influences on the growth of China's future net import demand for food.","[Fukase, Emiko] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Martin, Will] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA",The World Bank; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Martin, W (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",w.martin@cgiar.org,,,World Bank Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade,World Bank Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade,"This work was undertaken with support from the World Bank Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade.

Based on theoretical considerations, we develop a hedonic pricing model that allows for different shapes of the term structure curve while controlling for other price-relevant characteristics. We apply this model to land lease contracts in Saxony-Anhalt. We find an upward-sloping term structure during the agricultural price boom in 2007 and 2008, where market participants expected increasing rental prices. For the subsequent years, however, we detect a single-humped term structure. Hence, market participants revised their expectations and assumed a decline of land rental prices in the long term.","[Huettel, Silke] Univ Rostock, D-18055 Rostock, Germany; [Ritter, Matthias; Esaulov, Viacheslav; Odening, Martin] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany",University of Rostock; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Hüttel, S (通讯作者)，Univ Rostock, D-18055 Rostock, Germany.",silke.huettel@uni-rostock.de,"Odening, Martin/AAV-9918-2020; Hüttel, Silke/CAF-9025-2022; Ritter, Matthias/G-2391-2017","Ritter, Matthias/0000-0003-2543-3673; Odening, Martin/0000-0001-6427-1641; Huttel, Silke/0000-0002-2141-2931",German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Financial support from the German Research Foundation (DFG) is gratefully acknowledged.

In this study, we focus on nitrates used in agriculture, which can pollute groundwater many years after their initial application. A dynamic optimal control problem with heterogeneous farmers is proposed. The usual structural parameters such as the discount rate, the natural clearing rate and the lagged time interval between the occurrence of soil-level pollution and the impact on groundwater are taken into account. We also examine pollution as caused by a continuous set of farms characterised by their individual performance index and by their individual marginal contribution to the pollution. The issue is further investigated by taking account of change in the information context, successively related to perfect information and to asymmetric information. As a result, when the delay between the spreading of N-fertilizer and the impact on the aquifer increases, that is, the longer the lag, the steady-state pollution stock and the steady-state shadow price of the stock both increase. Moreover, we show that the optimal regulation may require a decreasing amount of fertilizer over time, even in thecase of initial underpollution.","[Bourgeois, Cyril] Univ Paris Sud, RITM, Sceaux, France; [Bourgeois, Cyril; Jayet, Pierre-Alain] INRA, UMR Econ Publ, Grignon, France",Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE,"Bourgeois, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Sud, RITM, Sceaux, France.",bourgeois_cyril@yahoo.fr,"Bourgeois, Cyril/AAC-5110-2022","Bourgeois, Cyril/0000-0003-1909-2040","PIREN-Seine, an interdisciplinary research program; Region Ile de France","PIREN-Seine, an interdisciplinary research program; Region Ile de France(Region Ile-de-France)","This study is based on research activities funded by PIREN-Seine, an interdisciplinary research program dedicated to the study of the environment in the Seine river basin in France.

An Assessment of the Local-level Approach,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Counter-cyclical government programs; difference-in-differences; means-tested transfers; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,FOOD STAMP; WELFARE-REFORM,"The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has grown rapidly in recent years-by about 50% in the seven years between 2000 and 2007, and by another 70% in the four years between 2007 and 2011-such that in 2011, SNAP served 14% of the U.S. population. Contributing to our understanding of the causes of this very rapid increase in the caseload, this article extends the time period of analysis through and past the official end of the Great Recession, analyzes more geographically disaggregated caseloads and the impact of substate economic conditions, and considers the impact of recent major, state-level SNAP policy changes. In models that exploit substate-level data, we find consistent evidence of significant impacts of both the substate level and statewide economy on local area SNAP caseloads. Surprisingly, while one might have expected more geographically disaggregated data to improve the alignment of the measurement with the concept of interest (i.e., the labor market opportunities of an individual), and therefore lead to larger estimates of the impact of the economy, in fact estimates fall-perhaps due to measurement error. We find at best mixed evidence of policy impacts. Simulations indicate that the economy can account for most of the 2007 to 2011 increase in the caseload, although relatively less of the 2000 to 2007 increase. Nonetheless, the role of the economy in driving caseloads appears to be substantial in both periods.","[Klerman, Jacob Alex] Abt Associates Inc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Danielson, Caroline] Publ Policy Inst Calif, San Francisco, CA USA",ABT Associates,"Danielson, C (通讯作者)，Publ Policy Inst Calif, San Francisco, CA USA.",danielson@ppic.org,,,USDA Economic Research Service [59-5000-1-0029],USDA Economic Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"This paper was supported with funding from the USDA Economic Research Service, Cooperative Agreement 59-5000-1-0029.

We estimate an irrigation management model for major crops in the West Coast (California, Oregon, and Washington), which includes a farm-level equation of irrigated share and crop-specific equations of technology adoption and water application rate (orchard/vineyard, vegetable, wheat, alfalfa, hay, and pasture). We find that economic and physical water scarcity, climate, and extreme weather, such as frost, extreme heat, and drought, significantly impact producers' irrigation decisions. Producers use sprinkler technologies or additional water applications to mitigate risk of crop damage from extreme weather. Water application rates are least responsive to surface water cost or groundwater well depth for producers of orchard/vineyard. Water supply institutions influence producers' irrigation decisions. Producers who receive water from federal agencies use higher water application rates and are less likely to adopt water-saving irrigation technologies for some crops. Institutional arrangements, including access to distinct water sources (surface or ground) and whether surface water cost is fee based, also affect the responsiveness of water application rates to changes in surface water cost. The analysis provides valuable information about how producers in irrigated agricultural production systems would respond and adapt to water pricing policies and climate change.","[Olen, Beau; Wu, JunJie; Langpap, Christian] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Olen, B (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",beau.olen@oregonstate.edu,"mahsum, masot/ABC-4546-2020; WU, Junjie/A-9796-2015","Langpap, Christian/0000-0002-6583-6402","National Science Foundation [1039192]; U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2012-70002-19388]; U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Chief Economists [58-0111-14-020]; Division Of Earth Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [1039192] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; NIFA [2012-70002-19388, 578682] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture; U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Chief Economists; Division Of Earth Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant no. 1039192, by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture under award no. 2012-70002-19388, and by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Chief Economists under Cooperative Agreement 58-0111-14-020.

Water markets, such as spot purchases or water supply option contracts, can make this decision process more flexible. We analyse the potential interest in an option contract for an irrigation district that has access to several water sources. We apply a stochastic recursive mathematical programming model to simulate the water procurement decisions of an irrigation district's board operating in a context of water supply uncertainty in south-eastern Spain. We analyse what role different option contracts could play in securing its water supply. Results suggest that the irrigation district would be willing to accept the proposed option contract in most cases subject to realistic values of the option contract financial terms. Of nine different water sources, desalination and the option contract are the main substitutes, where the use of either depends on the contract parameters. The contract premium and optioned volume are the variables that have a greater impact on the irrigation district's decisions.","[Rey, Dolores; Garrido, Alberto] Univ Politecn Madrid, CEIGRAM, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Calatrava, Javier] Univ Politecn Cartagena, ETSIA, Cartagena, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Centro de Estudios e Investigacion para la Gestion de Riesgos Agrarios Medioambientales CEIGRAM; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Rey, D (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Water Sci Inst, Bedford, England.",d.reyvicario@cranfield.ac.uk,"Calatrava, Javier/JXY-9270-2024; Calatrava, Javier/G-3880-2011","Calatrava, Javier/0000-0003-1165-7908; Rey Vicario, Dolores/0000-0002-9024-576X",INIA (Spanish National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology); FEDER (Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional) [RTA2010-00109-C04-03],INIA (Spanish National Institute for Agricultural and Food Research and Technology); FEDER (Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional)(European Union (EU)),"This study has been developed in the framework of the European project 'Water Markets Scenarios for Southern Europe: new solutions for coping with water scarcity and drought risk?'

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the government's policy choices can be affected by environmental benefits and the economic value of forests. Design/methodology/approach - We build a simple theoretical model and employ province-level data. Findings - The results show that the government will allocate less forestland to local people if environmental concerns are more important and privatize less forest if the economic benefits from forest are higher. Social implications - Therefore, the transformation of forest management policies reflects not only the government's own preferences but also its gradual adjustment to the changing market and institutional environment. Originality/value - The present paper provides a regulation approach that complements the growing literature on forest resource management.","[Wei, Jiegen] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden; [He, Haoran] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",University of Gothenburg; Beijing Normal University,"He, HR (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",haoran.he@bnu.edu.cn,,,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) to Environment for Development; National Natural Science Fund [71303022]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [13YJC790039]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) to Environment for Development; National Natural Science Fund(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"The authors thank Thomas Sterner, Qian Weng, Jintao Xu, and seminar participants at the University of Bonn, University of Gothenburg and Beijing Normal University.

However, with the an increased use of advertising using social media, such as online banner advertisements, there is a need for investigation to determine whether online advertising has a similar impact as television advertising. We investigate the factors related to both the awareness and impact of online and television advertisements on the frequency of orange juice consumption. A negative time trend is found with regard to awareness of both online and television advertising. The relationship between awareness of orange juice advertisements and frequency of consumption is somewhat surprising. The major surprise is the lack of relationship between online advertising and consumption frequency. Only awareness of online Facebook advertisements is positively related to the number of days per week orange juice is consumed. The lack of relationship with awareness of television advertisements, which at first may be surprising is reflected in a recent decision by the Florida Department of Citrus, which is responsible for the funding and placement of orange juice advertisements, to no longer invest in television advertising. Additional research on whether or not online advertisements are proving ineffective is needed.","[House, Lisa A.; Jiang, Yuan; Salois, Matthew] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"House, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",lahouse@ufl.edu; jyspring@ufl.edu; msalois@ufl.edu,"House, Lisa/V-5724-2017","House, Lisa/0000-0002-1901-6550",Florida Department of Citrus,Florida Department of Citrus,The authors are solely responsible for the contents of the article and are grateful to the support of the Florida Department of Citrus.

According to the results, the location equilibria are not fixed but depend on the intrinsic competitiveness of the spatial market. As the intrinsic competitiveness rises, the cooperative tends to be located closer to the middle point of the market. The limited differentiation in location entails an efficiency loss which is nevertheless smaller than that associated with the competition of two profit maximising firms (pure duopsony) on exactly the same spatial market. The superiority of a mixed duopsony lies in the fact that the resulting equilibrium locations entail lower total transportation cost relative to those of a pure duopsony.","Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Palmerston North, New Zealand",Massey University,"Fousekis, P (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",p.fousekis@massey.ac.nz,,,,,,,30,5,6,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The main hypothesis is that more invasions in a region are associated with lower investment, and in particular a bias towards annual crops as opposed to long-term crops. We use a county-level dataset for the state of Parana, Brazil, from 2003 to 2007, with 1,995 observations. The panel data structure allows us to control for fixed effects, such as the formalisation of land titles and land concentration, which might be correlated with the intensity of invasions. An instrumental variable fixed effects model was estimated to avoid other sources of bias. Our main finding is that land invasions are associated with lower long-term crop production and a higher percentage of annual crops, which could accelerate land degradation, and undermine environmental sustainability.","[Orellano, Veronica] Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Azevedo, Paulo Furquim] Insper Inst, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Azevedo, Paulo Furquim; Saes, Maria Sylvia] CNPq, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Saes, Maria Sylvia] Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Nascimento, Viviam Ester] Fac Tecnol Praia Grande, Santos, Brazil",Insper; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Orellano, V (通讯作者)，Sao Paulo Sch Econ, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",veronica.orel-lano@fgv.br,"Azevedo, Paulo F/A-6873-2016; Macchione, Maria Sylvia Saes/E-8109-2015; Saes, Maria Sylvia Macchione/ABH-7020-2020","Macchione, Maria Sylvia Saes/0000-0002-6344-0113;",,,,,20,4,6,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

We estimate the response of corn stover supply density to its price driven by changes in land use and examine its implications for a processing plant's pricing strategy and marginal cost, as well as associated changes in soil erosion. We find that plants will exploit the intensive margin as well as the extensive margin to secure additional amounts of stover. Our results show, counterintuitively, that a market for stover may result in lower soil erosion due to reallocations of land to continuous corn with removal, which, combined with no-till farming, results in lower soil erosion than the baseline without stover removal. Also contrary to expectations, using cover crops with stover removal may result in higher soil erosion due to land use changes within the fuel shed associated with optimal pricing.","[Sesmero, Juan; Tyner, Wallace] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Pratt, Michelle] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Sesmero, J (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jsesmero@purdue.edu,,,,,,,31,6,6,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Analyses based on simulation models on this topic typically ignore the role of domestic margin services. We extend the standard Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model to allow for variations in the share of domestic margin services in consumed food across countries. This approach enables us to differentiate consumer prices from producer prices. Following the extension, the results show that domestic margin services reduce the consumer food price volatility for all countries, especially in high-income countries, where the share of domestic margin services in final food consumption is higher. The effect of price-insulating border policies is also reduced in the extended model. We find that our extension of the GTAP model greatly improves simulations of the 2007 surge in international agricultural prices. We validate our extension of the GTAP model by showing that the econometrically estimated food price pass-through is decreasing with income and thus, is smaller in high-income countries.","[Yang, Fan; Brockmeier, Martina] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Int Agr Trade & Food Secur, Stuttgart, Germany; [Bekkers, Eddy; Francois, Joseph] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland",University Hohenheim; University of Bern,"Yang, F (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Dept Int Agr Trade & Food Secur, Stuttgart, Germany.",fan.yang@uni-hohenheim.de,"Francois, Joseph/B-6108-2017","Francois, Joseph/0000-0002-4686-7780","German Ministry of Science, Research and Arts (MWK) Baden - Wuerttemberg; Swiss National Science Foundation NCCR","German Ministry of Science, Research and Arts (MWK) Baden - Wuerttemberg; Swiss National Science Foundation NCCR(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF))","Fan Yang and Martina Brockmeier are both in the department of International Agricultural Trade and Food Security, University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany.

We show that when a program sets criteria for participation and offers in-cash and in-kind support to selected FBOs, it may promote rent-seeking and crowd out equity capital formation. This is so because FBOs may have formed for the sole purpose of benefitting from incentives offered by the program and thus lack an economic justification, which is an important condition for progression through the cooperative life cycle. Further, by setting stringent participation criteria, the program may end up selecting younger organizations while it is the more consolidated organizations that are able to connect to business development services (BDS) and engage in more offensive collective action.","[Francesconi, Gian Nicola] Natl Agr Res Labs Kawanda, CIAT, Kampala, Uganda; [Wouterse, Fleur] IFPRI, Kampala, Uganda",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Wouterse, F (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Plot 15,East Naguru Rd,POB 28565, Kampala, Uganda.",f.wouterse@cgiar.org,,"Wouterse, Fleur/0000-0001-7186-9270",,,,,50,27,28,0,39,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The efficient decision rule accounts for real option values associated with maintaining land disposition in an environment with highly uncertain future prices and irreversible past planting decisions. We parameterize a baseline model for a representative acre in Iowa and compare the model's predictions and profits to relatively naive, shorter horizon decision rules, and a field managed with optimal fertilizer applications conditional on corn and soybeans always being rotated. We also examine the effects of a permanently larger premium on corn prices relative to soybean prices, which has been observed in locations near recently established ethanol plants. We then compare the various decision rules to actual crop choices in a panel of over 6,500 Iowa plots during 1979-2007. As compared to less forward-looking objectives, we find the agronomic benefits of rotations coupled with real option values can lead to a more inelastic response of planting decisions to both transitory and permanent price changes. Always rotating, regardless of prices, is close to optimal, but so are shorter-horizon objectives. One implication is that reduced corn monoculture and fertilizer application rates might be implemented with modest incentive payments of $4 per acre or less.","[Livingston, Michael] Promontory Financial Grp LLC, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Livingston, Michael] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC USA; [Roberts, Michael J.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Zhang, Yue] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; North Carolina State University,"Livingston, M (通讯作者)，Promontory Financial Grp LLC, 801 17th St NW,Suite 1100, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",mlivingston@promontory.com; michael.roberts@hawaii.edu; yzhang19@ncsu.edu,,"Roberts, Michael/0000-0002-1741-7780",,,,,32,25,33,2,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

The effects on rice production patterns are also examined for the fast and slow pyrolysis plus the biochar application. In addition to adopting the mathematical programming model (Modified Taiwan Agricultural Sec tor Model) in the analysis of the bio-energy production and the crop cultivation patterns, the study further employs a nonparametric kernel regression model to forecast the increased benefits of rice from using biochar under various scenarios. With the biochar application, Taiwan's rice production could increase ranging from 6308 to 38 118 tons annually, depending on the pyrolysis type and the plant location. The results indicate that the biochar utilization can potentially increase social benefits if rice is planted. The net increase of farmer sand the environmental revenues can achieve up to NT$ 419 400. Moreover, we find that farmers should give priority to the improvement of nutrient saving to make higher benefits. Second, the total benefits could be improved if the seed use is efficient and harvesting and transporting costs for the energy crop and processing and the hauling cost of biochar are lower. Simulation results indicate that Taiwan benefits from the bio-energy production in terms of energy security, farmers revenue, social welfare and rice supply. The results show that, in general, pyrolysis plus the biochar application not only increase the domestic renewable energy supply but also enhance the farmers' and environmental revenues significantly.","[Chang, Meng-Shiuh; Wang, Wen] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Kung, Chih-Chun] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Poyang Lake Ecoecon, Nanchang 330032, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Kung, CC (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Poyang Lake Ecoecon, Nanchang 330032, Peoples R China.",cckung78@hotmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41161087, 41461118, 71303099, 71263018, 71463022]; National Social Science Foundation of China [12ZD213]; Postdoctoral Foundation of Jiangxi Province [2013KY56]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2013M531552]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Postdoctoral Foundation of Jiangxi Province; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"Chih-Chun Kung would like to thank for the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41161087, 41461118, 71303099, 71263018 and 71463022), the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 12&ZD213), Postdoctoral Foundation of Jiangxi Province (No. 2013KY56) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2013M531552).",,38,3,3,1,37,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

We find that modelling uncertainty in a state-contingent manner results in a lower estimate of forecast value than the typical expected value approach. We attribute this finding to a more conservative long-term farm plan in the discrete stochastic programming (DSP) model, which is better balanced for climate uncertainty. Hence, a climate forecast, even though it still revises probabilities held by farmers, does not call forth such large changes in farm plans and associated farm incomes. We then use the DSP model to assess how attributes of a hypothetical forecasting system, particularly its skill and timeliness, as well as attributes of the decision environment, influence its value. Lastly, we assess the value of current operational forecast systems and show that the value derived from seasonal climate forecasts is relatively limited in the case study region largely because of low skill embodied in forecasts at the time when major farm decisions are being made.","[Crean, Jason] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Orange, NSW, Australia; [Parton, Kevin] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Management & Mkt, Orange, NSW, Australia; [Mullen, John] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Orange, NSW, Australia; [Hayman, Peter] South Australian Res & Dev Inst, Adelaide, SA, Australia",NSW Department of Primary Industries; Charles Sturt University; Charles Sturt University; South Australian Research & Development Institute (SARDI),"Crean, J (通讯作者)，NSW Dept Primary Ind, Orange, NSW, Australia.",jason.crean@industry.nsw.gov.au,"Parton, Kevin/Q-7695-2019","Parton, Kevin/0000-0003-3378-799X",,,,,17,12,12,1,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Stated preference (SP) surveys are a flexible and affordable approach to elicit values, however the presence of hypothetical bias compromises their reliability. In this study, we seek to identify strategic behaviors and how they relate to hypothetical bias in SP survey for private goods. An online survey was conducted to measure willingness-to-pay (WTP) for regular and free-run eggs using two treatments, a nonhypothetical experimental auction and an open-ended elicitation question. We find that the bias associated with the presence of strategic behavior in the open-ended elicitation survey can be isolated by calculating premiums, which are defined as the difference between declared values for free-run eggs and regular eggs. The insight gained from this study can be used to improve experimental design of hypothetical SPs surveys and significantly reduce hypothetical bias.","[Doyon, Maurice; Bergeron, Stephane] Univ Laval, Dept Econ Agroalimentaire & Sci Consommat, Pavillon Paul Comtois,2425 Rue Agr, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",Laval University,"Doyon, M (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Dept Econ Agroalimentaire & Sci Consommat, Pavillon Paul Comtois,2425 Rue Agr, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",maurice.doyon@eac.ulaval.ca; stephane.bergeron.4@ulaval.ca,,"Doyon, Maurice/0000-0001-6581-3078",Consumer Demand Network; Egg Industry Economic Research Chair,Consumer Demand Network; Egg Industry Economic Research Chair,We would like to thank Tim Richard and William Allender.

We investigate which combination of these alternative strategies is economically optimal for cattle farmers. We apply a dynamic optimisation framework to consider both the negative externality of drug resistance development and human behaviour. We develop a bio-economic model to simulate the economic consequences of treatment strategies in a dynamic scenario that takes into account the interactions among the vector, host and livestock farmers. This model allows for the evolution of drug-resistant trypanosomes through trypanocide misuse and simulates the observed behaviours of cattle farmers based on the elicited risk and time preferences of a sample of 202 cattle farmers in Mali and Burkina Faso. The results show that the private optimal mix of treatment strategies for a risk averse and patient farmer involves preventive treatment for susceptible cattle, supported by a small number of curative treatments for infected cattle. Compared with the treatment strategies observed in the field, this optimal mix of treatment strategies would save approximately 5% of the annual income of a livestock farmer in the study area and would reduce the prevalence of trypanosomosis. In addition, we demonstrate that a reduction in a farmer's risk aversion is associated with higher treatment rates that can avoid additional losses. By contrast, a decrease in a farmer's patience is related to lower treatment rates that thwart additional benefits. Our results suggest that individual risk and time preferences need to be considered in the development process of disease control interventions.","[Liebenehm, Sabine] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Fac Econ & Management, Inst Dev & Agr Econ, Hannover, Germany; [Bett, Bernard; Said, Mohamed] Int Livestock Res Inst, Nairobi, Kenya; [Verdugo, Cristobal] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Med Prevent Vet, Santiago, Chile",Leibniz University Hannover; CGIAR; International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI); Universidad Austral de Chile,"Liebenehm, S (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Fac Econ & Management, Inst Dev & Agr Econ, Hannover, Germany.",Liebenehm@ifgb-hannover.de,,"Liebenehm, Sabine/0000-0001-5337-6923",German Research Foundation (DFG) [WA 1002/8-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Bernard Bett and Mohamed Said are both with the International Livestock Research Institute, Nairobi, Kenya.

However, IPM is knowledge intensive and its spread may dissipate over time due to knowledge required for its effective implementation and to competing messages about pest control. We examine IPM spread and adoption several years after formal intensive IPM outreach efforts ceased in a potato-producing region in Ecuador. We describe adoption patterns and sources of IPM knowledge in 2012 and compare them with patterns that existed when outreach ceased in 2003. Results show that IPM adoption continues in the area but with a lower proportion of farmers fully adopting all practices and a higher proportion adopting low to moderate levels as compared to 2003. Almost all potato farmers in the area use some IPM practices, reflecting a major increase in IPM use. Farmer-to-farmer spread has supplanted formal training and outreach mechanisms. IPM adoption significantly lowers pesticide use and saves production costs for adopters.","[Yaguana, Vanessa Carrion] Virginia Tech, Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Alwang, Jeffrey; Norton, George] Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Barrera, Victor] Natl Autonomous Inst Agr & Livestock Res INIAP, Quito, Ecuador",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Yaguana, VC (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Agr & Appl Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",vcarrion@vt.edu,"Alwang, Jeffrey/AAA-1716-2020","Carrion-Yaguana, Vanessa/0000-0003-2054-0330; Alwang, Jeffrey/0000-0002-2950-8516",United States Agency for International Development [EPP-A-00-0400016-00],United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),This material is based upon work supported by the United States Agency for International Development under the Cooperative Agreement No: EPP-A-00-0400016-00.,,22,25,26,2,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

In general, hedonic price estimates appear to be independent of prices employed. The main identified differences in estimates relate to the size of the producer and some regional impacts. For market prices only, increases in producer size are estimated to reduce prices. This implies the existence of supply chain quantity discounting price practices. The impact of an authoritative wine guide appears to have a negligible influence on prices in Australia. In the absence of market transaction prices, the common practice of employing recommended prices for hedonic wine price estimation is defendable.","[Oczkowski, Edward] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, POB 588, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia",Charles Sturt University,"Oczkowski, E (通讯作者)，Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, POB 588, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia.",eoczkowski@csu.edu.au,"Oczkowski, Eddie/AAY-3706-2020","Oczkowski, Eddie/0000-0003-2071-7116",,,,,33,24,25,1,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

The main results show that in our experimental environment, allowing joint bidding increases efficiency by 11.3% and revenue by 9.4%.

Consistent with expectations, we find that income elasticities of demand for many food products decline as per capita income increases. The declines are relatively large for alcohol and tobacco, and smaller for livestock products. Contrary to expectations, own-price elasticities for some products become more price-elastic as per capita income increases. One explanation may be that economic development brings with it improvements in food supply chains that provide people more choices with respect to food products than those traditionally consumed in rural villages, leading to greater substitution possibilities and more price-elastic demands. Estimates for 2011 of income and own-price demand elasticities are generally reasonable, whereas deriving reliable estimates of cross-price elasticities is difficult. The estimates suggest that China's meat and dairy demands, and in turn livestock feed demands, will continue growing strongly. Policy-makers should continue to monitor the evolution of demand for these products with an eye toward ensuring food security, particularly given the sheer size of the population and relatively tight domestic food supply situation in China.","[Chen, Danhong; Abler, David] Penn State Univ, Agr Environm & Reg Econ & Demog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Zhou, De] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, De] Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equity & Growth, Gottingen, Germany; [Yu, Xiaohua] Univ Gottingen, Agr Econ Transit & Developing Countries, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equity & Growth, Gottingen, Germany; [Thompson, Wyatt] Univ Missouri, Agr Econ Food & Agr Policy Res Inst FAPRI, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Nanjing Agricultural University; University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Abler, D (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Agr Environm & Reg Econ & Demog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",dave@btnumbers.com,"Zhou, De/O-5984-2014","Zhou, De/0000-0002-5228-2842; Abler, David/0000-0002-1305-6498; Yu, Xiaohua/0000-0003-4257-8081",U.S. Department of Agriculture [58-0111-14-001],U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"We are grateful to the editor, Dr. Terrance Hurley, and to three anonymous reviewers, for their helpful comments.

Volatility interactions across markets may lower the effectiveness of diversification strategies to mitigate price risks and should be taken into account when analyzing the pricing behavior of different agricultural commodities. We follow a multivariate GARCH approach to evaluate the time evolution of conditional correlations and volatility transmission across corn, wheat, and soybeans price returns on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. The period of analysis is from 1998 to 2012. The estimation results indicate a lack of lead-lag relationships between corn, wheat, and soybeans price returns at the mean level. We find, however, important volatility spillovers across commodities, particularly at the weekly and monthly level. Wheat and corn seem to play a major role in terms of volatility transmission. Despite the supposed higher financial market integration of agricultural commodities, we do not observe that agricultural markets have become more interdependent in recent years.","[Gardebroek, Cornelis] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Hernandez, Manuel A.; Robles, Miguel] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, Kampala, Uganda",Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Hernandez, MA (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, Kampala, Uganda.",m.a.hernandez@cgiar.org,,"Robles Flores, Luis Miguel/0000-0001-6171-6625",,,,,35,47,48,1,70,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Both irreversibility and persistence in technical inefficiency can lead to sluggish adjustment of quasi-fixed factors of production. The context of our application is the Spanish olive sector using farm-level data. We first estimate a dynamic stochastic frontier model to determine the long-run technical efficiency and its persistence. Then we address the decision to invest under uncertainty and irreversibility using a real option approach and include the technical inefficiency and its persistence in the simulation model to evaluate their impact in the investment decision. Technical efficiency in the dynamic model is 72.7 per cent, which is 5.5 per cent lower than the static framework suggests. We find that olive grove investment is irreversible. However, the level of persistence in technical inefficiency is fairly low, suggesting that efforts to mitigate price uncertainty can improve production returns to the Spanish olive sector.","[Lambarraa, Fatima] Ecole Natl Agr, Dept Rural Econ, Rabat, Morocco; [Lambarraa, Fatima] Univ Gottingen, CRC Poverty Equ & Growth, Gottingen, Germany; [Stefanou, Spiro] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL USA; [Stefanou, Spiro] Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Gil, Jose M.] CREDA UPC IRTA, Barcelona, Spain",University of Gottingen; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Wageningen University & Research; IRTA,"Lambarraa, F (通讯作者)，Ecole Natl Agr, Dept Rural Econ, Rabat, Morocco.;Lambarraa, F (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, CRC Poverty Equ & Growth, Gottingen, Germany.",flambar@gwdg.de,"Lehnhardt, Fatima Lambarraa/Q-5092-2019; Stefanou, Spiro/V-5770-2017; GIL, Jose M./B-2699-2012","Lehnhardt, Fatima Lambarraa/0000-0001-8955-1180; GIL, Jose M./0000-0003-3313-9052",,,,,49,15,15,1,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

A survey was conducted with a representative sample of rural consumers (1,344 in total, 63% women) in all major maize-production zones of Kenya. The survey included an experimental auction with maize products of different qualities. The results showed that many rural consumers were aware of aflatoxins, but few understood their health risks. Respondents were willing to pay a premium for maize tested for aflatoxins and labeled, but asked a high discount for maize that was visibly contaminated with moldy grain. The premium was higher for respondents with education and in regions with aflatoxicosis outbreaks. Knowledge of aflatoxins substantially reduced the overall WTP, but did not increase the WTP for tested maize. Welfare analysis indicates that mandatory testing would result in substantial benefits if the cost of testing can be lowered to below the premium.","[De Groote, Hugo; Kimenju, Simon C.; Gitonga, Zachary M.] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Nairobi 00621, Kenya; [Narrod, Clare] Univ Maryland, Joint Inst Food Safety & Appl Nutr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Bett, Charles] Kenya Agr & Livestock Res Org, Arid & Rangelands Res Inst, KALRO Katumani Res Ctr, Machakos, Kenya; [Scott, Rosemarie P.

The research deploys quantitative assessment of the relationship between prices, income and consumed quantities and qualitative assessment (surveys and focus groups) of opinions and attitudes of consumers, producers and retailers to wastes. To do the analysis we consider the model of social practices. We addressed a sample made by 260 respondents. The results suggest the actual wastes of bakery products are relatively low (less than 5%), because of quite large recoverability of bread and roll surpluses in households. The critical issue for bread and rolls consumption is quality and freshness. The notion of freshness of bakery products has changed since the mid of the 1990s. Furthermore, the food is not considered to be wasted when it is either used as a feeding or composted. The norms on handling with bread in households are likely not as strong as in the past, nevertheless, most of the participants in the focus groups agreed that bread is food which should not be wasted.","[Ratinger, Tomas] TC ASCR, Prague, Czech Republic; [Ratinger, Tomas; Tomka, Adam] CULS, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic; [Boskova, Iveta] IAEI, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Tomka, A (通讯作者)，CULS, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Czech Republic.",tomka.adam@gmail.com,,"Ratinger, Tomas/0000-0003-1379-2177; Boskova, Iveta/0009-0008-6099-0946",IAEI's Internal Research Project Evaluation of Predictions to Improve Their Informational Validity [1287/2014],IAEI's Internal Research Project Evaluation of Predictions to Improve Their Informational Validity,This paper refers to the research conducted under the TC project VATES (2015-2020) and the IAEI's Internal Research Project 1287/2014 Evaluation of Predictions to Improve Their Informational Validity.,,27,6,7,1,25,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors use a survey of farmers in Inner Mongolia, China, with difference-in-difference (DID), propensity score matching (PSM), and hybrid PSM DID treatment effect estimators to assess the effectiveness of crop insurance on farmer income. Findings - The empirical results show that crop insurance does not significantly affect farmer income under the current policy of low-premium, wide-coverage, low-guarantee and low-indemnity. Research limitations/implications - A possible limitation of this study is that the data includes only one geographic area, Inner Mongolia, China, and so results may not generalize to other regions of China. Practical implications - This research provides empirical estimates of the impact of crop insurance on farm household income. Given the results, the authors speculate that a number of specific changes to the crop insurance program might increase its positive impacts. Originality/value - The authors believe this is the first study to use individual farm household level survey data to evaluate the impact of crop insurance on farmer income in China.","[Zhao, Yuanfeng; Chai, Zhihui] Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Hohhot, Peoples R China; [Delgado, Michael S.; Preckel, Paul V.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Inner Mongolia Agricultural University; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Zhao, YF (通讯作者)，Inner Mongolia Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Hohhot, Peoples R China.",zhaoyf@263.net,"Preckel, Paul V/A-9365-2009",,Leader Group of Agricultural Insurance in Inner Mongolia; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71363042],Leader Group of Agricultural Insurance in Inner Mongolia; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was funded by the project which comes from Leader Group of Agricultural Insurance in Inner Mongolia, entitled An evaluation on operating performance of premium subsidies to agricultural insurance in 2012 in Inner Mongolia, China, and a project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China The analysis of adverse selection and moral hazard of farmers in crop insurance (No. 71363042).",,22,15,15,10,59,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

We argue that both people and processes are behind the decision-making of project implementation. Member and professional CEOs of cooperatives differ regarding their managerial vision towards upstream and downstream projects. Cooperatives with member CEOs are upstream focused and it is reflected by the cascading effect of negative vision bias towards downstream projects. When downstream activities become more important, cooperatives need to replace the member CEOs with professional CEOs. However, a cooperative with a professional CEO may still be in a disadvantageous position if the member-dominated Board of Directors' negative bias towards downstream projects is too strong, which may result in an investor owned firm being the efficient governance structure.","[Deng, Wendong; Hendrikse, George W.

The key conclusion of the article is that managerial remuneration and the resources devoted to governance are strategic choices for the COE and that their determination involves a trade-off. This trade-off depends on factors external to the COE, such as the COE's time horizon (as captured in the discount rate) and the manager's opportunity cost outside the COE (e.g. the remuneration paid in investor-owned firms). The trade-off also is influenced by the degree of complementarity between remuneration and governance resources, and by the sensitivity of managerial utility to financial remuneration and to governance.","[Fulton, Murray; Pohler, Dionne] Univ Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",University of Saskatchewan,"Fulton, M (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",Murrray.Fulton@usask.ca,,"Fulton, Murray/0000-0002-0351-5531",,,,,42,7,7,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

We develop an economic model of flex plants, export demands, and two domestic fuel demand curves for a blend of ethanol with gasoline consumed by conventional cars, and ethanol consumed only by flex cars. We analyze the market impacts of the following policies: the blend mandate; fixing gasoline prices below world prices; the high gasoline tax; and a higher tax exemption for ethanol blended with gasoline. Because Brazilian and U.S. ethanol prices have become linked, a change in Brazilian ethanol policy or a shock in world sugar markets can now impact U.S. ethanol and corn prices. We show that in theory, each policy analyzed has an ambiguous impact on ethanol and sugar prices. Empirically, however, a low gasoline tax and a high tax exemption for ethanol used in the fuel blend reduce ethanol and sugar prices; this contradicts conventional wisdom. Overall, we find that policy reforms implemented in 2010 offset the ethanol price increase by about 27% due to outward shifts in fuel transportation and sugar export demand curves, and due to a reduced sugarcane supply caused by bad weather. Our model illustrates the importance of Brazil's ethanol policies on world commodity markets; it also provides insight into how the Brazilian government can adjust policies to better control domestic inflation while minimizing impacts on investment.","[Drabik, Dusan] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [De Gorter, Harry; Just, David R.] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Timilsina, Govinda R.] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC USA",Wageningen University & Research; Cornell University; The World Bank,"De Gorter, H (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",hd15@cornell.edu,"Just, David R/K-7302-2012",,"National Research Initiative of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture under the Agricultural and Food research Initiative (AFRI) [121-564]; Cornell University's Agricultural Experiment Station from Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, USDA [NYC-121-7438]; Knowledge for Change trust fund of the World Bank; European Community [26220220180]","National Research Initiative of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture under the Agricultural and Food research Initiative (AFRI); Cornell University's Agricultural Experiment Station from Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, USDA; Knowledge for Change trust fund of the World Bank; European Community","Dusan Drabik is an assistant professor in the Agricultural Economics and Rural Policy Group at Wageningen University.

This new technology provides wheat growers with opportunities to segregate grain that can be directed to premium markets. In this article, we identify an individual grower's optimal segregation and blending strategies under non-uniformly curved price schedules. When price schedules are three-step shaped, we show that the optimal segregation and blending strategies can be obtained by solving a specified non-linear programming problem. Based on cash price and protein distribution data for wheat in the U.S. Pacific Northwest region over 1991-2011, an application of our theoretical model shows that on average a Hard Red Winter (respectively, Hard Red Spring) wheat grower should be willing to pay about 17.7 (respectively, 30.8) cents for segregating one bushel of wheat. We also study how growers' net returns would be affected were the technology to be adopted. Une technologie capable de mesurer la teneur en proteines du grain de ble et d'effectuer la segregation des grains a partir des mesures recueillies pendant la recolte pourrait bientot voir le jour. Cette nouvelle technologie permettrait aux producteurs de ble d'effectuer la segregation des grains en vue des marches valorisant la qualite. Dans le present article, nous determinons les strategies optimales de segregation et de melange qu'un producteur peut utiliser en fonction des baremes de prix non uniformes. Lorsque les baremes de prix sont etablis en trois paliers, nous demontrons qu'il est possible d'obtenir des strategies de segregation et de melange optimales en resolvant un probleme de programmation non lineaire. partir des donnees sur les prix au comptant et sur la distribution des proteines du ble recueillies dans le Pacifique nord-ouest au cours de la periode 1991-2011, une application de notre modele theorique montre que, en moyenne, un producteur de ble de force rouge d'hiver et de ble de force roux de printemps serait pret a payer environ 17,7 et 30,8cents respectivement pour la segregation d'un boisseau de ble.

We find that both social-and self-image matter: (i) subjects' WTP premium for fair-trade is higher when their decisions are made public; and (ii) subjects revise this premium upward (downward) when their expectations about the premium of others increase (decrease). However, there are significant asymmetries. Making decisions public decreases the WTP for non-fair-trade chocolate rather than increases the WTP for fair-trade chocolate.

Finally, we examine potential reasons and covariates explaining the level of agreement in choices across the 2weeks. Across four different tests, we find very good agreement between the two choice experiments - both with respect to overall choices and with respect to preferences. Furthermore, error variances do not differ significantly between the two surveys. The results also show that the larger the utility difference in a choice task, the larger the probability that the respondent will choose the same alternative in the retest. Moreover, the results show that the longer time respondents take to answer the 12 choice sets in the retest, the lower the probability that the respondent will choose the same alternatives in the retest as they did in the test.","[Morkbak, Morten Raun] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, COHERE, Odense, Denmark; [Olsen, Soren Boye] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark; University of Copenhagen,"Morkbak, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, COHERE, Odense, Denmark.",mrm@sam.sdu.dk,"Olsen, Søren B/M-2949-2014","Olsen, Søren B/0000-0002-1278-3749",,,,,42,18,18,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Design/methodology/approach - The approach of combining cluster analysis with Logit regression is an innovative approach to survey assessment. In addition, by design the authors have identified the four mutually exclusive groups of borrowers combining Group Guarantee membership and actual formal borrowing. Findings - An extremely important observation according to the data is that most farmers appear to be part of group guarantees only because they have to in order to get access to formal credit products. 87.21 percent of the people who belong to groups and utilize the formal credit products belong to this category because their lenders have made participation in groups compulsory for access to credit. This may ration farmers' willingness to even apply for credit. It also indicates a preference on the part of older and more risk-averse respondents to avoid participation in group guarantees. Out of financial characteristics the total loan holdings appears to be the only significant indicator of participation in group guarantees. Furthermore the results indicate that informal and formal credit appear to be replaceable for farmers. Research limitations/implications - The survey is confined only to the counties investigated. China is very diverse in its agricultural economies and many RCCs operate under different guidance and rules from those investigated here. Hence, while the authors can claim that the results are indicative, the authors cannot claim that they will hold generally. Practical implications - Based on group guarantee loan mechanism and survey data analysis of 897 farm households, this paper analyzes influencing factors affecting farmers' participation in group guarantees from microcosmic level, so as to provide some reference to further perfect micro credit operation mode and mechanism. Social implications - The results indicate that the Group Guarantee mechanism, while beneficial to some, may not hold global appeal for Chinese farmers. In the future RCCs may want to consider alternative approaches to loan security than placing the burden of guarantee on farmers' family and friends. Originality/value - The approach of combining cluster analysis with Logit regression is an innovative approach to survey assessment.

As the development of the pest resistance and the outbreak of the secondary pest, it was believed that economic benefit of Bt cotton is dying away. And reduction of cotton sown area in recent years had been considered as one of the consequences. This study empirically estimates the impact of Bt cotton adoption on cotton sown area. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses regression techniques based on provincial level data. In addition, the fixed-effects model is used to control the impact of those time-consistent variables. Finally, several scenarios are estimated for the robustness of the estimation results. Findings - This study shows that the adoption of Bt cotton has positive impact on cotton sown area. On the other hand, the increasing labor cost and decreasing cotton price might be the real reasons behind the decrease of cotton sown area. Originality/value - This, it is believed, is one of the first studies to empirically answer the impact of Bt cotton adoption on cotton sown area in China, using national representative data.","[Qiao, Fangbin; Yao, Yi] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Qiao, FB (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing, Peoples R China.",qiaofb@aliyun.com,,,National Science Foundation of China [71273290],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors acknowledge the financial support of the National Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71273290).,,49,8,9,0,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This article is an investigation of different types of cattle sharing and rental contracts producers in rural Ethiopia adopt. It also investigates why households in rural Ethiopia rely on these contracts that are vulnerable and therefore subject to potential moral hazard problems described in earlier literature. We apply random effect probit and control function econometric methods to household panel data collected in 2005 and 2007 from two agro-ecological zones in Ethiopia. Controlling for the endogeneity of access to livestock credit, we find that contracts are spatially fragmented and better developed where population density is high and credit and insurance markets are poorly developed. We also find that contracts help cash poor and credit constrained households to improve their herd dynamics, to get access to nonlivestock resources (land, labor and cash) and share risks that could have been difficult without the contract. We show that contracts are rational responses of residents in rural communities characterized by imperfect credit and insurance services, since households with better access to credit are less likely to rely on contracts.","[Tadesse, Million A.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Holden, Stein T.; Oygard, Ragnar A.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, Post Box 5003, N-1432 As, Norway; [McPeak, John] Syracuse Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Int Affairs, 215F Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",University of Waterloo; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Syracuse University,"Tadesse, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",mayten01@gmail.com,"McPeak, John G/C-2382-2011; Holden, Stein/AAD-4502-2019",,,,,,17,5,6,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Special attention is given to the 2003 reform, which substantially altered the relative importance of the two types of support by decoupling direct agricultural payments from the production of a specific crop. In our empirical analysis we study the case of Sweden, making use of the variation in the timing of farmers' decisions regarding participation in support programs. We estimate a dynamic non-linear unobserved effects probit model to account for unobserved individual heterogeneity and state dependence. Our results indicate the existence of a negative effect of the market support system in place when organic farming techniques were adopted before the 2003 reform. However, this effect is reversed by the introduction of decoupling. Furthermore, the effects of support differ between certified and non-certified organic production: both pillars have significant effects on non-certified organic farming, whereas certified organic farming is exclusively driven by agro-environmental subsidies.","[Jaime, Monica M.] Univ Concepcion, Sch Business & Management, Concepcion, Chile; [Jaime, Monica M.] Univ Concepcion, Res Nucleus Environm & Nat Resource Econ NENRE, Concepcion, Chile; [Coria, Jessica; Liu, Xiangping] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden",Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de Concepcion; University of Gothenburg,"Coria, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden.",jessica.Ccnia@economics.gu.se,"Jaime, Marcela/HKV-2444-2023","Jaime, Marcela/0000-0002-0972-4254","Biodiversity, Ecosystems and Climate Change Program (BECC) to the Environmental Economics Unit at the University of Gothenburg; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA); Swedish Research Council FORMAS","Biodiversity, Ecosystems and Climate Change Program (BECC) to the Environmental Economics Unit at the University of Gothenburg; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas)","Monica M.

First, the models were used to derive optimal hedge ratios, as well as various measures of risk and return under alternative scenarios, and hedge durations. The results indicated hedge ratios are typically less than 1. The hedge ratios for the Mean-value-at-risk (M-VaR)-Copula model increased with greater durations.

Using a sibling model containing 11,924 children of Swedish farmers and fishers in 2012, we estimate that farmers' sons who became farmers received 28 per cent lower income than same-sex siblings with a career outside farming. For farmers' daughters and fishers' sons, the income gap was about 22 per cent relative to same-sex siblings. Our conclusion is that the decision to become a fisher or a farmer is largely determined by non-pecuniary factors.","[Nordin, Martin] Lund Univ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Blomquist, Johan; Waldo, Staffan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Nordin, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",martin.nordin@nek.lu.se,"waldo, staffan/AHA-9201-2022","Blomquist, Johan/0000-0002-9668-4149",,,,,45,4,4,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0165-1587,1464-3618,,EUR REV AGRIC ECON,Eur.

A simulation model is developed to analyze the market and welfare effects of A x C. When applied to corn, results show that A x C exerts substantial impacts and causes large transfers across sectors. Even if A x C reduced intermediaries' market power to the largest extent feasible, results indicate that it would still cause important losses in aggregate welfare.","[Lence, Sergio H.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Internatl Agr Econ, Ames, IA USA",Iowa State University,"Lence, SH (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Internatl Agr Econ, Ames, IA USA.",shlence@iastate.edu,,,Inter-American Development Bank,Inter-American Development Bank,Funding for the present research was provided by the Inter-American Development Bank.

More than a century of national annual data (1910-2011) is used in the empirical analysis. No constraints on asset fixity are imposed. Results indicate that, with rational expectations, both output categories as well as all input categories exhibit quasi-fixity in response to market change and stochastic climate change. Crops adjust more than twice as fast as livestock-49% versus 20% of the way toward their long-run equilibrium in one year. Fertilizer adjusts most rapidly toward equilibrium levels (88% in one year), and capital adjusts most slowly (5% in one year). Labor oscillates rather than converging smoothly toward equilibrium; its distance from equilibrium is the same as if it adjusted 59% of the way toward its optimal level in one year. Failing to anticipate climate change dramatically slows the estimated rate of adjustment for two netputs and modestly speeds the rate for two others, thus likely increasing overall adjustment costs. Failing to account for uncertainty in anticipated climate change has little impact on adjustment rates.","[Yang, Sansi; Shumway, C.

Prior research has found that participants have higher consumption shortly after receiving their benefits, followed by lower consumption towards the end of the benefit month. Known as the SNAP benefit cycle, this consumption pattern has been found to have negative effects on beneficiaries. We hypothesize two behavioral responses of SNAP participants may work in tandem to drive much of the cycle: (1) short-run impatience-a higher preference to consume today, and (2) fungibility of income-the degree of substitutability between a SNAP dollar and a cash dollar. Using data from the National Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS), a newly developed nationally representative survey of daily food acquisitions by SNAP households, we find evidence of both behavioral responses. However, the degree of short-run impatience and fungibility of income is found to differ significantly across poverty levels and use of grocery lists to plan food purchases. SNAP households could gain from food purchase planning education.","[Smith, Travis A.; Berning, Joshua P.; Yang, Xiaosi; Colson, Gregory; Dorfman, Jeffrey H.] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Smith, TA (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",tasmith@uga.edu,,"Colson, Gregory/0000-0002-9863-4399","University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research through U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service [58-5000-1-0050, 58-5000-3-0066]","University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research through U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service","Travis A.

Yet rigorous evidence on this relationship is scarce. Using maize and petrol price data from east Africa, we show that global oil prices do affect food prices but primarily through transport costs, rather than through biofuel or production cost channels. We find that global oil prices transmit much more rapidly to the pump and then to local maize prices than do global maize prices, suggesting that the immediate effects of correlated commodity price shocks on local food prices are driven more by transport costs than by the prices of the grains themselves. Furthermore, we present suggestive evidence that, for markets furthest inland, changes in world oil prices have larger effects on local maize prices than do changes in world maize prices.","[Dillon, Brian M.] Univ Washington, Evans Sch Publ Policy & Governance, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, Sch Appl Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Barrett, Christopher B.] Cornell Univ, David R Atkinson Ctr Sustainable Future, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Cornell University; Cornell University,"Dillon, BM (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Evans Sch Publ Policy & Governance, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;Barrett, CB (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Appl Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Barrett, CB (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, David R Atkinson Ctr Sustainable Future, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",bdillon2@uw.edu; cbb2@cornell.edu,"Barrett, Christopher B./A-9750-2009","Barrett, Christopher B./0000-0001-9139-2721",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Harvard Kennedy School,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Harvard Kennedy School,"The authors thank Joanna Barrett and Shun Chonabayashi for research assistance, Chris Adam, Heather Anderson, Channing Arndt, John Baffes, Anindya Banerjee, Marc Bellemare, Harry de Gorter, Oliver Gao, Doug Gollin, Miguel Gomez, Yossie Hollander, Wenjing Hu, David Lee, Matt Nimmo-Greenwood, Per Pinstrup-Andersen, Tanvi Rao, Stephan von Cramon-Taubadel, seminar participants at the IATRC 2013 and CSAE 2014 annual meetings, the IMF/OCP/NYU 2014 conference on food price volatility, seminar audiences at Cornell, Melbourne, Monash, Sydney, Wisconsin, and the Center for Global Development, as well as the editor and two anonymous referees for helpful comments on earlier drafts.

Two-limit truncated regression results show that higher yields and a greater proportion of acres planted with Roundup Ready (R) seeds motivate weed BMP adoption. While soybean and corn farmers have lower adoption intensity than cotton farmers, farmer educational attainment and greater concern for herbicide effectiveness and for human and environmental safety are found to help increase the adoption of weed BMPs.","[Dong, Fengxia; Mitchell, Paul D.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hurley, Terrance M.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Frisvold, George B.] Univ Arizona, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Arizona,"Dong, FX (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,"Hurley, Terrance/0000-0003-2135-7570",,,,,30,5,12,0,16,WESTERN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS ASSOC,LOGAN,"C/O DEEVON BAILEY, UTAH STATE UNIV, ECONOMICS DEPT, 3535 OLD MAIN HILL, LOGAN, UT 84322-3530 USA",1068-5502,2327-8285,,J AGR RESOUR ECON,J.

The most important aspect of small family farms is to protect the rural environment against the socio-economic marginalization of rural territories and reducing the out-migration from the countryside as well. Since the 1960s, the European Union has arranged a microeconomic survey on a sample of farms aimed at estimating the impact of the Common Agricultural Policy strategies on farmers called the Farm Accountancy Data Network or the FADN. The purpose of the analysis was to assess by a quantitative approach using the FADN dataset the technical, economic and allocative efficiency in Italian family farms over the time 2000-2012. In particular, the aim of the paper has been to investigate if the legal typology of property has influenced the efficiency of Italian farms. Some findings have pointed out that the co-operatives and family farms during the five year time 2008-2012 have had the same level of efficiency. Italian small farms smaller than 5 hectares need adequate financial supports allocated by the II. pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy and these subsides are pivotal in particular towards family farms located in the upland and hilly areas.","[Galluzzo, Nicola] Assoc Geog & Econ Studies Rural Areas ASGEAR, Via Salaria Aquila,76 Scala A, I-02100 Rieti, Italy",,"Galluzzo, N (通讯作者)，Assoc Geog & Econ Studies Rural Areas ASGEAR, Via Salaria Aquila,76 Scala A, I-02100 Rieti, Italy.",asgear@libero.it,,,,,,,42,17,17,0,19,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The data encompassed 34 632 cow records from the Czech Republic 12 regions and were collected during a 1-yr period (2012). The milk yield during the production period was analysed relative to the reproduction and economic parameters. The main reasons for culling cows were fertility problems and movement disorders, followed by the low milk yield, mammary gland diseases, and postpartum complications. The analysis of fertility showed that the herds with the longest calving intervals (>= 410 d) and the highest culling due to fertility (>= 25% of the total) achieved the lowest milk yields. The average difference between the highest and lowest calving interval (<= 389 d) groups was 721 kg/cow per yr. The lowest reported profitability of costs was for the longest calving interval and the highest postpartum complications groups.

Design/methodology/approach - A two-stage selection correction approach (Bourguignon, Fournier, and Gurgand (BFG)) for the multinomial logit model is employed to estimate the impact of marketing contracts on net returns from apple production. On the basis of the BFG estimation, the authors also use an endogenous switching regression model and a propensity score matching technique to estimate the causal effects of marketing contract choices on net returns from apple production. Findings - The results reveal significant selectivity correction terms in the choices of both written contracts and no contracts and insignificant selectivity correction terms in the choice of oral contract, indicating that accounting for selection bias is a prerequisite for unbiased and consistent estimation. The findings also indicate written contracts increase apple farmers' net returns, while oral contracts exert the opposite effect.

On this basis, combined with ordinary pork hindquarter profiles in the real market, different traceable pork hindquarter profiles were set to develop seven market schemes. Furthermore, market shares of each scheme were simulated using the random first choice method. Most consumers chose appearance rather than safety in the choice experiment, which also indicated that traceable safety information certified by the government had a higher part-worth utility. Simulation results suggested that a larger market share could be better achieved by supplying multilevel traceable pork hindquarters in the market at the same time, rather than by supplying single-level traceable pork hindquarters. Moreover, income was found to be the key factor in determining consumers' demand.","[Wu, Linhai; Liu, Xiaolin; Wang, Hongsha; Wang, Shuxian; Xu, Lingling] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Food Safety Res Base Jiangsu Prov, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Linhai; Xu, Lingling] Jiangnan Univ, Synerget Innovat Ctr Food Safety & Nutr, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Dian] Soochow Univ, Sch Dongwu Business, Dept Econ, Suzhou 215021, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Dian] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Food Sci & Technol, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Jiangnan University; Jiangnan University; Soochow University - China; Jiangnan University,"Wu, LH (通讯作者)，Jiangnan Univ, Sch Business, Food Safety Res Base Jiangsu Prov, 1800 Lihu Rd, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wlh6799@126.com; lxl0535@163.com; 15150157673@139.com; 15006183793@163.com; wsx_july@163.com; hualongxifeng6130@sina.com,"ZHAO, S/IWV-4219-2023",,"Study of Cogovernance for Food Safety Risk in China; Key Projects of National Social Science Foundation of China [14ZDA069]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273117]; Central University Basic Research Funds [JUSRP51416B, JUSRP51325A]; Study of Food Safety Consumption Policy: the Case of Traceable Pork, a project of the Six Top Talents in Jiangsu Province [2012-JY-002]; Research on Chinese Food Safety Risk Control, a project of college Innovation Team of Jiangsu Province social science [2013-011]","Study of Cogovernance for Food Safety Risk in China; Key Projects of National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Central University Basic Research Funds; Study of Food Safety Consumption Policy: the Case of Traceable Pork, a project of the Six Top Talents in Jiangsu Province; Research on Chinese Food Safety Risk Control, a project of college Innovation Team of Jiangsu Province social science","This paper was supported by Study of Cogovernance for Food Safety Risk in China, one of the Key Projects of National Social Science Foundation of China in 2014 (Project Approval No. No.14ZDA069), and Study of Multiple Simulation Experiment on Traceable Food Consumption Policy based on Consumer Preferences: the Case of Pork, a project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Approval No. 71273117), and Central University Basic Research Funds (Project Approval No. JUSRP51416B & JUSRP51325A), and Study of Food Safety Consumption Policy: the Case of Traceable Pork, a project of the Six Top Talents in Jiangsu Province (Project Approval No. 2012-JY-002), and Research on Chinese Food Safety Risk Control, a project of college Innovation Team of Jiangsu Province social science (Project Approval No. 2013-011).",,56,7,7,0,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-3976,1744-7976,,CAN J AGR ECON,Can.

We show analytically that pessimistic agents will invest more in prevention expenditure than optimists. We also demonstrate how small differences in beliefs may induce substantial differences in type-related prevention expenditure. The more atomistic agents are, the less they will contribute to the public good. Pessimistic beliefs then lead to a double deprivation, and we discuss potential issues and remedies. The more optimistic a society is, the lower will be its total green expenditure. We then use a large international survey to study how beliefs and additional controls determine prevention expenditure. We rely on several proxies for beliefs and the willingness to contribute to prevention expenditure, which we combine through principal component analysis. In addition, we investigate the role of environmental education for the relationship between beliefs and the willingness to contribute. Because of potential endogeneity bias due to unobserved variables that are likely to affect both beliefs and the willingness to contribute, we follow the theoretical analysis and resort to a recursive bivariate model. Our main findings are very much in line with the theoretical predictions. We find, across all specifications, that more optimistic beliefs lead to a lower willingness to contribute. Environmental education affects the willingness to contribute only indirectly through its impact on beliefs.","IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France",IPAG Business School,"Schumacher, I (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France.",ingmar.schumacher@ipag.fr,,"Schumacher, Ingmar/0000-0003-2339-982X",,,,,53,2,3,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

In turn, the consumer provides working capital to the farm during the growing season. CSA contracts also provide risk management for farmers with limited access to Federal crop insurance by transferring part of the farm's risk to the consumer. We derive a theory of CSA contract pricing for the two most prevalent types of CSA contracts: yield contracts, in which consumers receive a percentage of the farm's production, and weight contracts, in which consumers receive fixed quantities. We develop a two-period model in which expected utility maximizing producers and consumers engage in CSA contracting in the first period based on anticipation of yields and spot prices in the second period. Using the model, we generate several testable hypotheses to be explored in future research. Additionally, we present an overview of the data necessary to test the propositions and potential challenges that might arise in related empirical work.","[Sproul, Thomas W.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Kropp, Jaclyn D.] Univ Florida, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",University of Rhode Island; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Sproul, TW (通讯作者)，Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, 1 Greenhouse Rd,Rm 208, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",sproul@uri.edu; jkropp@ufl.edu,,"Sproul, Thomas/0000-0001-5713-8754","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [RI00H-108, 229284]; USDA ERS [58-3000-2-0063]; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Multistate Research Coordination, Southern Region [1006135]","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); USDA ERS(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Multistate Research Coordination, Southern Region","The authors would like to thank the editor, Brian Roe, two anonymous referees, Joseph Cooper, Charles Moss, and Calum Turvey for their insightful comments and suggestions on earlier drafts of this work.

We test predictions about the type of water contracts derived from the literature on economic organization by using ordered probit models to investigate the correlates of contract duration. We confirm that long-term and permanent contracts are more likely when investments in specific assets are required for conveyance. We also find that longer-term arrangements are common when buyers with uncertain water supplies purchase from sellers with more certain rights, suggesting that urban municipalities use long-term contracts to reduce risk. We do not find robust evidence supporting the hypothesis that short-term agreements are more likely when the costs of transfer to third parties are potentially high.","[Emerick, Kyle] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Lueck, Dean] Univ Arizona, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",Tufts University; University of Arizona,"Emerick, K (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",,,,Earhart Foundation,Earhart Foundation,"We have received helpful comments from Doug Allen, Jean-Etienne de Bettignies, Ricard Gil, Michael Hanemann, Gary Libecap, Bentley MacLeod, Edward Morey, David Zetland, and two anonymous referees.

In contrast with theoretical expectations, I find individuals with the lowest willingness to accept participated in these reverse auctions at lower rates than other eligible individuals, all else being equal. This suggests that who bids in an auction plays an important role in the success of conservation outcomes. These results indicate that market design should expand to consider how, and whether, the economic incentives underlying auction participation align with desired conservation outcomes, both within fisheries and in natural resource management more broadly.","Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm NOAA Fisheries, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Social Sci Branch, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"DePiper, GS (通讯作者)，Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm NOAA Fisheries, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Social Sci Branch, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.",geret.depiper@noaa.gov,"DePiper, Geret/JXK-0664-2024","DePiper, Geret/0000-0001-9178-9673",NOAA Fisheries; NOAA Fisheries/Sea Grant Graduate Fellowship in Marine Resource Economics,NOAA Fisheries(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA Fisheries/Sea Grant Graduate Fellowship in Marine Resource Economics,"Geret S.

Efforts applied toward continuing or regaining such access generate a public good-all growers benefit regardless of the extent of private effort taken, while exclusion is impractical. Private incentives to take preventive measures and stamp-out effort interact in complex ways. There are intra-farm temporal interactions and also inter-farm contemporaneous interactions. Public effort also takes place and interacts with private effort. This paper provides a succinct multi-agent model to explore these interactions in social optimum and in Nash equilibrium, and also to explore how socially optimal and Nash behavior differ. Comparative statics under social optimality are more straightforward than under Nash equilibrium. Whether it is in social optimum or Nash equilibrium, public prevention effort complements both private prevention and private stamp-out efforts. However, public stamp-out effort substitutes for both private stamp-out and private prevention efforts. Reasonable conditions are identified under which Nash levels of private prevention and stamp-out efforts are both below socially optimal levels. Concerning policy prescriptions, secure property rights and low property transfer costs should promote prevention and eradication efforts. Other things being equal, public prevention effort should be more effective at improving welfare than comparable public stamp-out effort. Subsidies on private effort should favor prevention because subsidies on eradication effort may discourage prevention effort. Even if products from diseased animals are safe to consume and acceptable to consumers, it may be optimal to destroy them.","[Wang, Tong] Texas A&M AgriLife Res, San Angelo, TX USA; [Hennessy, David A.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Hennessy, David A.] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, Ames, IA USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M AgriLife Research; Iowa State University; Iowa State University,"Hennessy, DA (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",hennessy@iastate.edu,"wang, tong/HTR-5412-2023",,USDA NIFA Policy Research Center [11061138/2012-01764],USDA NIFA Policy Research Center,Tong Wang is postdoc research associate with Texas A&M AgriLife Research.

Both private and social optimality are considered; with the difference that a stock value related to the number of grazing animals is attached to the social management problem due to landscape preservation. The efficiency of alternative policy tools in terms of obtaining the socially optimal management scheme is discussed. The model builds on existing studies from the fisheries literature, but the important difference is that while capital is related to harvesting effort in the fisheries, capital contributes to production capacity to keep the animal stock during the winter in our farm model.

Design/methodology/approach - Probit, Logit, and IV-Probit model are used to provide pertinent empirical analysis. Findings - Analysis of survey data establishes three facts about the farm labor market in rural China: first, households with high farm endowment are more likely to hire farm labor; second, because of the mismatch between farm ability and land size created by egalitarian land reallocation, households with more land reallocations are more likely to participate in farm labor market to adjust such mismatch; third, land rental market and farm labor market seem to be complementary. These results are robust to alternative model specifications, subsamples, alternative dependent variables, and additional controls. Welfare analysis demonstrates that the farm labor market is conducive to agricultural output. Originality/value - The main contribution of this study is to lay out stylized facts in terms of the development of farm labor market using a unique survey data set.","[Che, Yi] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yan] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Yu, Linhui] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Zhejiang University,"Zhang, Y (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",zhang_yan@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,,Liberal Arts Research and Innovation in Shanghai Jiao Tong University [13QN18],Liberal Arts Research and Innovation in Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"The authors thank the editor, Xian Xin, and three anonymous referees for comments which substantially improved this paper.

It deals with Burundi, belonging to the low income food deficit countries with one of the world's lowest rates of the gross domestic product per capita. The paper defines the food security situation in the global connection, representing a wide complex of economic, social, demographic, technologic and political aspects of production, distribution, shift and consumption of foodstuffs. The inter-related causes of food insecurity are mainly the long lasting civil wars, a limited access to land, environmental degradation, climatic shocks and the rapid population growth resulting from the high birth rates and the return of refugees. Subsistence crops and livestock products represent the main source of income for most households. The performance of these subsectors is very low, and generates chronic food deficits. Agriculture is thus the key sector in the predominantly rural economies and there is still a significant room for growth, diversification, increasing productivity and improving competitiveness.","[Jenicek, Vladimir; Grofova, Sarka] Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Jenícek, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",jenicek@ftz.czu.cz,,,"Faculty of International Relations, University of Economics, Prague","Faculty of International Relations, University of Economics, Prague","Supported by the Faculty of International Relations, University of Economics, Prague.",,16,5,5,0,16,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors employ a transitionary demand process and develop a new approach of complete demand system with a two-stage dynamic budgeting: a strongly separable DLES in the first stage and a LA/DAIDS in the second stage. Employing provincial aggregate data (1995-2010) from the China urban household surveys, The authors estimated the demand elasticities for primary food products in urban China. Findings - The results indicate that most primary food products are necessities and price inelastic for urban households in China. The authors also found that the dynamic model tends to yield relatively smaller expenditure elasticities in magnitude than the static models do due to the friction effect of dynamic adjusting costs, such as habit formation, switching costs, and learning process. However, the dynamic effects on own price elasticities are inconclusive due to the add-up restriction. Practical implications - The research contributes to the demand analysis methodologically, and can be used for better projections in policy simulation models. Originality/value - This paper methodologically relaxes the restrictive assumption of instant adjustment in static models and allows consumers to make a dynamic decision in food consumption. Empirically, the authors introduce a new complete dynamic demand model and carry out a case study with the use of urban household data in China.","[Zhou, De] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Yu, Xiaohua] Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Herzfeld, Thomas] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Cent & Eastern Europe IAMO, Dept Agr Policy, Halle, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Yu, XH (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Poverty Equ & Growth, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",xyu@gwdg.de,"Zhou, De/O-5984-2014; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Policy, Department Agricultural/X-9655-2019; Herzfeld, Thomas/B-2929-2014","Zhou, De/0000-0002-5228-2842; Herzfeld, Thomas/0000-0001-8331-5750; Yu, Xiaohua/0000-0003-4257-8081","German Research Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273006, 71473123]",German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The funding support from German Research Foundation (RTG 1666 Global Food) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project ID: 71273006 and 71473123) are acknowledged.,,52,28,30,3,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

This article assesses the resource saving and productivity enhancing impacts of a crop management package revolving around minimum tillage in maize-based farming systems in northwest Ethiopia. An endogenous switching regression model was applied to plot-and household-level survey data collected from 290 rural households operating 590 maize plots during the 2012 production year. Controlling for variations in plot and household characteristics, the average effect of minimum tillage package (minimum tillage package) on maize productivity is 0.44 t/ha. Compared to conventional practice (CP), adoption of the MTP decreased the average male and female labor use in maize production by 14.4 and 8.2 person-days per ha, respectively. Similarly, MTP adoption decreased draft power use for land preparation by 13.2 pair of oxen-days per ha. Compared to CP, in general, there is a considerable short-run maize productivity gain and reduction in labor and draft power use under MTP.","[Jaleta, Moti; Tesfaye, Kindie; Marenya, Paswel] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Kassie, Menale; Jena, Pradyot Ranjan] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Nairobi, Kenya; [Kassie, Menale] Int Ctr Insect Physiol & Ecol Icipe, Nairobi, Kenya; [Teklewold, Tilaye] ARARI, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Jena, Pradyot Ranjan] Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Surathkal, India; [Erenstein, Olaf] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, El Batan, Mexico",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); International Centre of Insect Physiology & Ecology (ICIPE); National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Karnataka; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Jaleta, M (通讯作者)，Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",m.jaleta@cgiar.org,"Jena, Dr. Pradyot Ranjan/AAK-2995-2020; Kassie, Menale/ADT-2906-2022","Jena, Dr. Pradyot Ranjan/0000-0002-0674-3441; Kassie, Menale/0000-0002-6754-2432; Erenstein, Olaf/0000-0002-7491-5786; Tesfaye, Kindie/0000-0002-7201-8053",EU-IFAD [COFIN-ECG-54-CIMMYT],EU-IFAD,"We are thankful to EU-IFAD for financing this study under COFIN-ECG-54-CIMMYT large grant agreement, enumerators, and supervisors for their dedications during the survey and sample farmers for their time and information.",,33,38,39,0,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Our approach includes two forms of stated choice task nonattendance, each derived from separately framed questions asked immediately following the completion of each choice task. We also evaluate a measure of inferred serial nonattendance based on the posterior distributions of random coefficient estimates. We find that choice task nonattendance question framing statistically impacts marginal utility coefficients and, to a lesser degree, willingness-to-pay estimates. While direct questions addressing attribute attendance or nonattendance affect these estimates, inferred indicators of serial nonattendance suggest that many attributes are not likely ignored as often as respondents may indicate.

First, the external environment was analysed to define suitable recommendations for the industry, and also to discover opportunities and threats through fitting strategic analyses, that affect the aforementioned businesses. Secondly, it was necessary to get familiar with the internal environment and functioning of specific businesses in the industry (namely those that operate in the Western region of Prostejov at the foot of the Drahanska Highlands) and to evaluate their efficiency to define their strengths and weaknesses. The paper demonstrates that there is a wide range of means that can be taken advantage of when defining fitting strategies for agricultural businesses, e.g. the Porter's Five Forces Model, the IFE and the IE Matrix, the SWOT Matrix as well as the general strategies by Ansoff. Among the most important recommendations for increasing the competitiveness of SMEs in the agricultural industry, there belong: taking advantage of all the suitable agricultural subsidies, taking advantage of accredited agricultural advisors, making sure that the legal requirements of governmental bodies are met, increasing revenues for arable farming (through a good quality seed stock, chemicals and fertilizers, the foundation of suitable storage facilities in order to postpone the sales of the grain after the harvest season), creating sales cooperatives/associations to balance the competing force of buyers, rejuvenating the workforce, solidifying the ownership structure in the businesses, entrepreneurial diversification (electrical energy production), increasing quality in animal farming.","[Chladkova, Helena; Formankova, Sylvie] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Management, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Chladkova, H; Formankova, S (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",chlad@mendelu.cz; orongo@email.cz,"Formánková, Sylvie/L-7260-2017; Formánková, Sylvie/S-2297-2019; Chladkova, Helena/Q-5643-2016","Formánková, Sylvie/0000-0003-0269-4723; Formánková, Sylvie/0000-0003-0269-4723; Chladkova, Helena/0000-0002-9037-2689",,,,,27,8,8,2,29,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Used in this definition, full operating cycle consists of the conversion of inventories (including the time required to collect the materials and/or raw materials, processing them, and the time required storage of the finished products before transfer) and the full period of the collection of receivables.

The import ban particularly affected the import of competitive agricultural and foodstuff commodities into Russia. The ban was the result of the political and security tensions existing between the Russian Federation and the Western World, since early 2014. If we take into consideration the volume of the mutual trade and the importance of the mutual trade for each of the stakeholders mentioned above, it can be assumed that the main objectives of the Russian embargo was not to hurt the individual countries - especially the European Union, but rather to support domestic producers in order to achieve a higher level of self-sufficiency in basic agricultural products. It is evident that the objective of the applied import ban is to reduce the dependence of the Russian Federation on imports. This paper provides an analysis of the most affected product groups and products, especially in relation to the EU countries. The paper provides the following findings: The result of the applied import ban was a significant reduction of the Russian agrarian import value. The import ban also improved the overall competitiveness of the Russian agricultural trade, whilst on the other hand, the competitiveness of some commodity groups was reduced.","[Smutka, Lubos; Ishchukova, Natalia; Selby, Richard] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic; [Spicka, Jindrich] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Winston Churchil Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Spicka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Winston Churchil Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",jindrich.spicka@vse.cz,"Smutka, Lubos/K-6401-2015; Selby, Richard/M-8765-2019; Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013","Smutka, Lubos/0000-0001-5385-1333; Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0001-5699-9544",Internal Grant Agency of the FEM CULS Prague [20151031],Internal Grant Agency of the FEM CULS Prague,Supported by the Internal Grant Agency of the FEM CULS Prague (Project No. 20151031 - The selected aspects of economy sanctions and their impact on mutual trade between the EU and Russia).,,23,34,35,1,25,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Yield gaps are quantified by measuring how varietal mean yields have changed over time, due to productivity increases generated by public and private wheat breeding programs. Variety performance trial data for Kansas winter wheat are used to summarize the evolution of wheat yields over the time period 1985 to 2011. A measure of yield potential is compared to actual on-farm yields to derive implications for wheat industry stakeholders. Persistent and expanding yield gaps between potential yield and actual on-farm yield are measured and analyzed. Producers' variety adoption decisions explain a relatively small portion of this gap, and producers have become more effective at identifying and adopting yield-enhancing varieties over time.

We find that price elasticities generally take lower values for processed goods, and the opposite holds for income elasticities. Processed goods are also characterised by an inverse relationship between price elasticities and average unit values. The analysis suggests that both emerging and advanced countries can be expected to increase their export specialisation in processed goods. Furthermore, developed economies can face fierce competition from emerging countries by enhancing the quality content of their processed good exports.","[Bianchi, Carluccio; Lorenzini, Eleonora] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Baiardi, Donatella] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Management & Stat, Milan, Italy",University of Pavia; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Baiardi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Management & Stat, Milan, Italy.",donatella.baiardi@unimib.it,"Baiardi, Donatella/HZK-8866-2023",,project '@BILITA: e-commerce and marketing intelligence'; Pavia University; Italian Ministry of Economic Development,"project '@BILITA: e-commerce and marketing intelligence'; Pavia University; Italian Ministry of Economic Development(Ministry of Economic Development, Italy)","Carluccio Bianchi and Eleonora Lorenzini are with the Department of Economics and Management, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.

At the national level, there is weak evidence of mean differences in productivity between male and female plots, but conditional on manager characteristics, plot characteristics, inputs, and crop choice, plots managed solely by a woman are consistently found less productive than all other plots. An Oaxaca-Blinder-type decomposition reveals that important factors explaining the gender differential are plot area and family labor. Women are able to obtain higher yields on smaller plots farmed with less male labor and more female labor and thus cover the gender gap in productivity at the aggregate level, but there are still significant unobservable factors which contribute to widening the gap.","Amer Univ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",American University,"Slavchevska, V (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",vs4030a@american.edu,,"Slavchevska, Vanya/0000-0003-0490-3920",,,,,28,60,62,2,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Extreme weather outcomes have been linked to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which globally impacts agricultural production. This study demonstrates that extreme ENSO events alter cotton yield distributions in the Southeastern United States. These impacts translate into economically meaningful effects on crop insurance premium rates. Commercial insurers can use publicly available information to determine if government-set premium rates are mispriced, and in turn extract economic rents via the federally mandated Standard Reinsurance Agreement. By ceding underpriced policies in El Nino and La Nina years, we find that private insurance companies can reduce paid indemnities by 10-15% on average.","[Tack, Jesse B.] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA; [Ubilava, David] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Mississippi State University; University of Sydney,"Tack, JB (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, POB 5187, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",tack@agecon.msstate.edu,"Ubilava, David/K-8208-2012; Ubilava, David/AAH-3542-2019","Ubilava, David/0000-0002-8993-6766; Ubilava, David/0000-0002-8993-6766",,,,,78,22,26,5,75,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Because food prices and social unrest are jointly determined, data on natural disasters are used to identify the causal relationship flowing from food price levels to social unrest. Results indicate that for the period 1990-2011, food price increases have led to increases in social unrest, whereas food price volatility has not been associated with increases in social unrest.

It proposes a bio-economic dynamic farm model calibrated with the positive mathematical programming (PMP). The standard PMP approach was extended to simulate the mixed farming systems through the introduction of a livestock production activity in the first calibration step. It allows incorporating activities not available in the base year, but that can be performed by the farmers after the future policy reforms. The model provides supply-responses for both the crop and livestock farms according to the agricultural and financial policy shifts. It maximizes the farm net financial flows subject to the resource, livestock, financial and agricultural policy constraints. The initialisation data were obtained from a face-to-face stratified survey applied on the mixed-sheep farms that have used grassland areas under the Agri-Environment Schemes (AES) in the North-Western Romania (Transylvania). The results show that the most vulnerable group to the policy changes is represented by the small-size farms, to which the AES are very important economic drivers. Thus, the diversification and the off-farm employments possibilities should be integrated into the future rural development plans as a premise for their survival.","[Jitea, Mugurel Ionel; Dumitras, Diana Elena; Simu, Vasile Alexandru] Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med, Dept Econ Sci, Cluj Napoca, Romania",University of Agricultural Sciences & Veterinary Medicine Cluj Napoca,"Jitea, MI (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med Cluj Napoca, 3-5 Calea Manastur, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",mjitea@usamvcluj.ro,"Mugurel, Jitea/O-1169-2013; dumitras, diana/AAH-2013-2019","dumitras, diana/0000-0003-3652-2671; Ionel Mugurel, Jitea/0000-0002-3862-4332",Romanian National Council of Scientific Research [190/2010],Romanian National Council of Scientific Research,The research is part of the scientific project financed by the Romanian National Council of Scientific Research with the title Assessing the impact of the Common Agricultural Policy reform in Romania using a simulative approach (post-doctoral fellows PN II - project No. 190/2010).,,48,2,2,0,19,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

However, in Chinese western rural area, the level of return to education is very low due to the underdeveloped economy and the condition of the education system. For improving the schooling returns level, Chinese central government is paying great attention to the condition of education in the rural western area. To date, no research has examined what educational style is more favorable for improving western rural laborers' non-farm incomes. To answer this question, the purpose of this paper is to compare the treatment effect of high school education and secondary vocational education on their non-farm incomes. That will provide significant evidence for the government to carry out educational policy. Design/methodology/approach - Base on the Mincer model, several methods is used to estimate the average return to a year education on western rural labors' non-farm income, including OLS, IV and Heckman tow-steps method, to accounting for the ability endogenous and self-selection bias. And the propensity score matching method is used in estimate the treatment effects of high school education and secondary vocational education. Findings - The results from Mincer model showed that the schooling returns in Chinese western rural area were estimated to range from 2.7 to 3.9 percent, that were lower than the average levels in Chinese whole rural area that are estimated in the other recent studies. By using propensity score matching to roll out the heterogeneous bias, show that the treatment effect from high school education was higher than that from secondary vocational education, indicating that the secondary vocational education is better. Originality/value - Studies concerning the causal relationship between schooling ( high school education and secondary vocational education) and non-farm earnings in the western region of China remain very limited, even empty.

To account for selection bias from both observable and unobservable factors, an endogenous switching regression model is employed to estimate the impact of the technology on continuous outcomes like farm output, throughput accounting ratio (TAR), poverty gap, and severity of poverty. A recursive bivariate probit model is however used for the estimation of impact of adoption on a binary outcome like poverty headcount. The empirical findings demonstrate that the adoption of CA technology increases maize output, and farm TAR and reduces household poverty. Moreover, the results reveal that farmers' years of schooling, social networks, access to credit, extension services, and machinery as well as soil quality positively influence adoption of CA technology.","[Abdulai, Abdul Nafeo] Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Johanna Mestorf Str 5, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Abdulai, AN (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Johanna Mestorf Str 5, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",anabdul@food-econ.uni-kiel.de,"Abdul-Rahaman, Awal/GVS-8674-2022",", Awudu/0000-0003-4618-2789",,,,,45,92,99,0,64,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

EVIDENCE FROM MALAWI AND ZAMBIA,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Africa; land rental; land scarcity; Malawi; smallholder farming; Zambia,AGRICULTURAL GROWTH; LABOR; DETERMINANTS; REFORMS,"We use nationally representative household-level panel survey data in two neighboring countries in Southern Africa-Zambia and Malawi-to characterize the current status of rural land rental market participation by smallholder farmers, and their subsequent welfare impacts. Rural rental market participation is much higher in densely-populated Malawi than in lower-density Zambia, reflecting the role of land scarcity in driving rental market development. Consistent with previous literature, we find evidence that rental markets contribute to efficiency gains within the smallholder sector by facilitating the transfer of land from less-able to more-able producers, on average, in both countries. Furthermore, we find that rental markets serve to re-allocate land from relatively land-rich to land-poor households. We examine the impacts of participation on a number of welfare outcomes and find evidence for generally positive returns to renting in land in both countries, on average. However, our analysis also indicates that the returns to renting in land vary strongly with scale of production: tenants who produce more have larger returns to renting in, and many of the smaller producers who rent in do so at an economic loss. The impacts of renting out (i.e., participating in markets as landlords) are decidedly more mixed, with overall negative returns to landlords in Malawi and negligible returns to landlords in Zambia. The findings in this article highlight the need for researchers and policymakers in sub-Saharan Africa to stay attuned to how land rental market participation and its impacts evolve in the near future.","[Chamberlin, Jordan] Int Ctr Maize & Wheat Improvement CIMMYT, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Ricker-Gilbert, Jacob] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Chamberlin, J (通讯作者)，Int Ctr Maize & Wheat Improvement CIMMYT, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",j.chamberlin@cgiar.org,"Chamberlin, Jordan/AAI-7139-2020; Chamberlin, Jordan/W-7127-2018","Chamberlin, Jordan/0000-0001-9522-3001",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under the Guiding Investment in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification in Africa (GISAIA) Project; United States Agency for International Development to the Food Security Research Project in Zambia,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under the Guiding Investment in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification in Africa (GISAIA) Project; United States Agency for International Development to the Food Security Research Project in Zambia(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"Jordan Chamberlin is a spatial economist at the International Center for Maize and Wheat Improvement (CIMMYT) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

We introduce vertical differentiation in a firm-based trade model in which firms differ in terms of their productivity and non-cooperatively select the quality and price of their product. A higher public standard increases prices set by constrained and unconstrained firms, but the effect on firms' output is generally ambiguous for both types of firms. The most productive firms raise their private standard and enjoy higher profits at the expense of less productive firms. A public standard can increase welfare, especially when there is a high concentration of low productivity domestic firms because of a better allocation of resources.","[Gaigne, Carl] INRA Natl Inst Agr Res, SMART, UMR1302, Rennes, France; [Gaigne, Carl] Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; [Larue, Bruno] Univ Laval, Dept Agr Econ & Consumer Studies, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada",INRAE; Laval University; Laval University,"Gaigné, C (通讯作者)，INRA Natl Inst Agr Res, SMART, UMR1302, Rennes, France.;Gaigné, C (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada.",,,"Gaigne, Carl/0000-0002-1540-234X",Fonds Quebecois de Recherche sur la Societe et la Culture; Farm Credit Canada; European Union [290693 FOODSECURE],Fonds Quebecois de Recherche sur la Societe et la Culture; Farm Credit Canada; European Union(European Union (EU)),"Carl Gaigne is a research director at INRA (National Institute for Agricultural Research), UMR1302 SMART, Rennes, France, and professeur-associe with Laval University, Canada.

Our findings indicate that a border reduces the likelihood that two cereal prices will be cointegrated by 23%, and each additional 1,000 km of distance reduces the probability of cointegration by 7%. The speed of price transmission is on average 13 percentage points per period faster between prices that are located within the same country compared with cross-border price pairs. Our meta-analysis also indicates that increasing distance strongly reduces the speed of price transmission on domestic markets, but that the effect of distance on the speed of transmission is considerably weaker for trade over longer international distances.

The empirical application focuses on firm-level data for the Spanish food processing industry covering the period from 1996 to 2011. This investigation of the impact of firms' investment decisions on productivity growth employs a dynamic production framework and analyzes the impact of these decisions on the components of dynamic productivity growth. Our findings show that dynamic productivity growth is negatively affected by investment spikes in both the meat processing and oils and fats industries, and that dynamic inefficiency change initially falls just after the infusion of large investment for oils and fats firms, but then grows as the firms acquire experience with this investment. We further find that investment spikes lead to improvements in dynamic technical change and worsening in dynamic technical inefficiency change in the meat processing industry, while dynamic scale inefficiency change was negatively impacted in both industries.","[Kapelko, Magdalena] Wroclaw Univ Econ Poland, Wroclaw, Poland; [Lansink, Alfons Oude] Wageningen Univ, Business Econ Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lansink, Alfons Oude] Wageningen Grad Sch Social Sci, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Stefanou, Spiro E.] Univ Florida, Chair Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Stefanou, Spiro E.] Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Wageningen University & Research,"Kapelko, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ Poland, Wroclaw, Poland.",magdalena.kapelko@ue.wroc.pl,"Stefanou, Spiro/V-5770-2017; Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/H-8840-2012; Kapelko, Magdalena/F-3788-2016","Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/0000-0002-9273-6044; Kapelko, Magdalena/0000-0003-2020-2374",National Science Centre in Poland [DEC-2013/11/D/HS4/00252],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","This research has been funded by the National Science Centre in Poland, decision number DEC-2013/11/D/HS4/00252.",,40,23,24,1,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

Results show that adoption decisions are driven by household and plot level characteristics and that the adoption of a combination of SAPs raises both maize yields and incomes of smallholder farmers. Adoption of improved maize alone has greater impacts on maize yields, but given the high cost of inorganic fertiliser that limits the profitability of adoption of improved maize, greater household incomes are associated rather with a package involving SAPs such as maize-legume rotation and residue retention.","[Manda, Julius; Alene, Arega D.] Int Inst Trop Agr, Lilongwe, Malawi; [Gardebroek, Cornelis] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kassie, Menale] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Nairobi, Kenya; [Tembo, Gelson] Univ Zambia, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Lusaka, Zambia",Wageningen University & Research; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); University of Zambia,"Manda, J (通讯作者)，Int Inst Trop Agr, Lilongwe, Malawi.",j.manda@cgiar.org,"Kassie, Menale/ADT-2906-2022","Kassie, Menale/0000-0002-6754-2432; Manda, Julius/0000-0002-9599-5906",USAID/Zambia,USAID/Zambia(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"Julius Manda and Arega Alene are with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Lilongwe, Malawi.

This situation also creates negative externalities related to upward pressure on food prices and lower livestock production. Moreover, biogas plants focused primarily on maize silage could increase the area of arable land for growing maize for energy purposes and decline the production of crops for human nutrition.

Bilateral market share is a function of productivity and trade costs. However, countries with similar land and climate characteristics systematically have high productivity in similar products making them disproportionately sensitive to changes in each other's trade costs. We use a random coefficients logit model to estimate a parametric distribution of comparative advantage and trade costs across products and calculate regional trade liberalization elasticities for each exporter in each import market. Unlike most existing models, the value of the elasticity depends on the degree to which liberalization includes competitors with similar comparative advantage within the agricultural sector. We find disproportionately larger trade elasticities under China-led liberalization relative to U.S.-led liberalization among close U.S. competitors compared to countries whose agricultural products are unlikely to compete head-to-head with U.S. exports. For the United States, we find that the lost opportunity cost of exclusion from regional liberalization is increasing in the extent to which its close competitors gain new access.","[Heerman, Kari E.

In response to these challenges, which often manifest themselves as lower and more variable surface water supplies, as well as depleted and degraded ground water supplies, growers tend to seek opportunities to adapt. One option for growers to reduce their exposure to water scarcity and heightened uncertainty is to diversify. Indeed, access to a portfolio of supplies is one way in which water and irrigation districts, as well as individual growers, are responding to the changing landscape of water resource availability. This article evaluates the benefits to irrigated agriculture from having access to multiple sources of water. With farm-level information on 1,900 agricultural parcels across California, we use the hedonic property value method to investigate the extent that growers benefit from having access to multiple sources of water (i.e., a water portfolio). Our results suggest that while lower quality waters, less reliable water, and less water all negatively impact agricultural land values, holding a water portfolio has a positive impact on land values through its role in mitigating the negative aspects of these factors and reducing the sensitivity of agriculture to climate-related factors. From a policy perspective, such results identify a valuable adaptation tool that irrigation districts may consider to help offset the negative impacts of climate change, drought, and population increases on water supply availability and reliability.","[Mukherjee, Monobina] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, Program Nat Resource Econ & Policy, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Schwabe, Kurt] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, Program Nat Resource Econ & Policy, Environm Econ & Policy, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Schwabe, Kurt] Univ Calif Riverside, Water Sci & Policy Ctr, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside; University of California System; University of California Riverside; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Mukherjee, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Environm Sci, Program Nat Resource Econ & Policy, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",monobina.mukherjee@email.ucr.edu,,"Schwabe, Kurt/0000-0002-3402-1411",University of California Giannini Foundation,University of California Giannini Foundation,"Monobina Mukherjee is a research associate in the Program of Natural Resource Economics and Policy, Department of Environmental Sciences, University of California, Riverside.

Previous studies have shown that the differences in auction prices stem from the traits of the individual hogs rather than certain breeds demanding a premium because of their superior meat quality. Methodologically, this study utilizes the multivariate GARCH and the constant conditional correlation models to analyze the average daily prices of the two breeds generated by random auction sequences. Data were collected from 1485 observations, from January 2009 to December 2013, of the Miaoli hog auction market of Taiwan. Based on the dissimilarity of price volatility structures and the low correlation factor between the black hogs and white hogs, this study concludes that these two hog breeds should be regarded as heterogeneous products. This conclusion should serve as a reference for the local hog producers when searching for the best economic traits of indigenous breeds in terms of rearing the potential as well as for the stakeholders when developing the breed-specific marketing strategies.","[Kuo, Heng-Hung] Chung Hua Univ, Dept Finance, 707 Sec 2 Wu Fu Rd, Hsinchu 30012, Taiwan; [Ho, Li-Hsing; Lin, Wen-Hung] Chung Hua Univ, Dept Technol Management, Hsinchu 30012, Taiwan",Chung Hua University; Chung Hua University,"Kuo, HH (通讯作者)，Chung Hua Univ, Dept Finance, 707 Sec 2 Wu Fu Rd, Hsinchu 30012, Taiwan.",hhkuo@chu.edu.tw,,,,,,,47,1,1,0,10,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

It appears that results from these studies should be useful inputs to decision-making about environmental policy or management. Here, we investigate the extent to which this occurs in practice in Australian environmental management bodies. Nonmarket valuation experts were surveyed about their studies that they believed to have influenced policy. Then, decision-makers in environmental bodies were interviewed about the level of influence nonmarket valuation has had on their decisions. We find that researchers' perceptions of the influence that nonmarket valuation has on decision-making are overly optimistic. Interviews with decision-makers suggest that nonmarket valuation is little used in decision-making. Indeed, the majority of them are unfamiliar with nonmarket valuation techniques. Nevertheless, once the concept was explained to them, many decision-makers believed it could benefit environmental policy. Researchers' perceptions of the reasons for low usage of nonmarket valuation are largely inaccurate. We suggest a range of strategies that economists can use to promote the use of nonmarket valuation in environmental policy and management decisions, including ways to improve communication and engagement with decision-makers, and strategies to increase the capacity for decision-makers to use nonmarket valuation results.","[Rogers, Abbie A.; Kragt, Marit E.; Gibson, Fiona L.; Burton, Michael P.; Petersen, Elizabeth H.; Pannell, David J.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Petersen, Elizabeth H.] Adv Choice Econ PTY LTD, Murdoch, WA, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Rogers, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA, Australia.",abbie.rogers@uwa.edu.au,"Kragt, Marit E./D-3185-2011; burton, michael/A-9541-2009; Pannell, David/B-4476-2008; Rogers, Abbie/H-5739-2014","Kragt, Marit E./0000-0001-6847-4817; Pannell, David/0000-0001-5420-9908; Rogers, Abbie/0000-0002-7611-7593; burton, michael/0000-0003-4213-4093; Dempster, Fiona/0000-0002-7989-3483; Petersen, Elizabeth/0000-0002-1250-1692",Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions,Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program(Australian Government); Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions(Australian Research Council),The authors would like to thank the researchers and decision makers that participated in this study for their time and valuable insights.

A comparative study of rice farm size and productivity in China and India,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,China; India; Farm size; Inverse relationship; Land productivity; Rice farmers,INVERSE PRODUCTIVITY; LAND QUALITY; LABOR; TRANSFORMATION; EFFICIENCY; GROWTH,"Purpose - The farm size-productivity relationship has long been the subject of debate among development economists. Few studies address this issue for China, and those that do only with outdated data sets poorly representing the current situation after the past decade of rapid change, which includes the rapid development of land rental markets, village labor out-migration and use of farm machines. Meanwhile, many studies have researched this relationship for Indian, which is undergoing similar changes except for the development of active land rental markets. The purpose of this paper is to measure the farm size-productivity relationship under the situations of rapid transformation in China and India. Design/methodology/approach - Based on the data of 325 Jiangxi and 400 Allahabad rice farmers in 2011, the survey covered multiple plots of each household in one/multiple growing season(s). The authors use the production function approach and the yield approach, and control for farmland quality, imperfect factor markets, and farm size measurement error, to identify the farm size-productivity relationship. Findings - The regressions show that land yields increase with plot size both by season and over the year in China. Thismay be one of the reasons that farmsizes are growing in some areas. In India, however, the inverse farm size-productivity relationship is observed by the study, despite recent changes. Moreover, land yields increase with farm machine use in both China and India. This result contributes to the debate over whether mechanization improves yields or just expands the land frontier. Originality/value - The paper empirically estimates the farm size-productivity relationship under rapid agrarian transformation in both China and India based on a unique data set collected by the authors in a detailed primary survey. The paper considers measurement error in the analysis, which adds values to this type of analysis.","[Wang, Jianying] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Coll Econ, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Kevin Z.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Das Gupta, Sunipa] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Accra, Ghana; [Huang, Zuhui] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Zhejiang University,"Chen, KZ (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China.",k.chen@cgiar.org,"Covey, Kevin/AAE-3599-2020; Chen, Kevin/GYU-8963-2022","Covey, Kevin/0000-0001-6914-7797;","Asia Development Bank for the project on Strategic Research on Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security in Asia [TA-7648-REG]; National Natural Science Foundation of China for Agricultural Economy and Management Discipline Group Key Projects [71333011]; Doctoral Dissertation Scholarship of China Institute for Rural Studies, Tsinghua University [201409]","Asia Development Bank for the project on Strategic Research on Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security in Asia; National Natural Science Foundation of China for Agricultural Economy and Management Discipline Group Key Projects; Doctoral Dissertation Scholarship of China Institute for Rural Studies, Tsinghua University","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Asia Development Bank for the project on Strategic Research on Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security in Asia (TA-7648-REG), the National Natural Science Foundation of China for Agricultural Economy and Management Discipline Group Key Projects (No. 71333011) and Doctoral Dissertation Scholarship of China Institute for Rural Studies, Tsinghua University (201409).",,35,45,49,8,64,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

A basket of polices targeted at increasing farming scale has been issued in recent years thereby resulting to debates over large-scale farming in China. The purpose of this paper is to summarize and highlight the debate over China's on-going large-scale farming. Design/methodology/approach - This paper contributes to the policy debates over large-scale farming in China by reviewing the existing literature on the positive and negative impacts of large-scale farming on agricultural development, land productivity, and national food security. This paper overviews the different ideas and findings of studies associated with the topic. Findings - The mainstream literature supports the idea that large-scale farming will address the challenges facing China's agricultural development, while others argue that it crowds out the benefits of small farmers, and raises concerns over inequalities of resources allocation and income distribution, and undermines social stability. While proponents argue that large-scale farming may lead to rise in land productivity, opponents argue that it may result into decrease in land productivity and national grain output. Originality/value - This paper is a policy review based on existing works. It organizes the different debates over large-scale farming in China, and highlights the key arguments put forward.","[Zuo, Yonghong] China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Ma, Ling; Cai, Hailong; Wu, Tianlong] China Agr Univ, Ctr Rural Dev Policy, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Xin, Xian] China Agr Univ, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University,"Xin, X (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",xinxian@cau.edu.cn,,,,,,,26,20,21,4,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

The evidence points to the rapid emergence of overweight as a public health problem, widespread not only in urban, but also in rural areas; associated noncommunicable diseases are also on the rise. Over time, while most indicators of undernutrition have improved, magnitudes are nonetheless high; a persistent problem is anemia, the prevalence of which remains high and unchanged. As for food, more than quantity, it is its quality that appears to be correlated with malnutrition. Yet improvements in diet quality have not been high, and micronutrient intakes remain low. It has become increasingly difficult for the poor to have a diet rich in vegetables, dairy and meat, as their prices (per unit calorie), relative to cereals, have risen faster than for the rich.","[Meenakshi, J.

In this paper we investigate the effects of public investment in agricultural R&D on food prices, per capita calorie consumption, adult body weight, obesity, public healthcare expenditures related to obesity, and consumer welfare. We find that a 10% increase in the stream of annual U.S. public investment in agricultural R&D in the latter half of the twentieth century would have caused a modest increase in the average daily calorie consumption of American adults, resulting in small increases in public healthcare expenditures related to obesity. On the other hand, such an increase in spending would have generated very substantial consumer benefits, and net national benefits, given the very large benefit-cost ratios for agricultural R&D. This implies that current policy objectives of revising agricultural R&D priorities to pursue obesity objectives are likely to be comparatively unproductive and socially wasteful. Moreover, R&D lags of decades mean that such an approach would be totally ineffective in the immediate horizon.","[Alston, Julian M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Alston, Julian M.] Univ Calif Davis, Robert Mondavi Inst, Ctr Wine Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Alston, Julian M.] Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, Berkeley, CA USA; [MacEwan, Joanna P.] Precis Hlth Econ LLC, Austin, TX 78733 USA; [Okrent, Abigail M.] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"MacEwan, JP (通讯作者)，Precis Hlth Econ LLC, Austin, TX 78733 USA.",Joanna.MacEwan@precisionhealtheconomics.com,,,"National Research Initiative of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, USDA [2006-55215-16720]; USDA Economic Research Service [58-4000-1-0044]; University of California Agricultural Issues Center; Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics; InSTePP","National Research Initiative of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture); USDA Economic Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); University of California Agricultural Issues Center; Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics; InSTePP","The work reported in this paper was supported by the National Research Initiative of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, USDA, Grant # 2006-55215-16720, and by a cooperative grant from the USDA Economic Research Service, Agreement # 58-4000-1-0044, as well as financial and indirect support from the University of California Agricultural Issues Center, the Giannini Foundation of Agricultural Economics, and InSTePP.

The nonparametric data envelopment analysis method is used to further decompose total factor productivity into technical change and different measures of output-oriented efficiency change. Finally, the system-Generalized Methods of Moments approach is employed to investigate the dynamic relationship between different components of productivity on farm profitability. Results indicate that profitability change is mainly driven by total factor productivity change. The main source of total factor productivity change is technical change. The upward-shifting frontier results in declining technical efficiency.

The relative price of machines against agricultural labor has declined in an accelerating way, which contributed to the observed rapid introduction of machines. The elasticity of substitution between labor and machines was large in some commodities, which contributed to a fast substitution of labor by machines.","[Wang, Xiaobing; Huang, Jikun] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Yiheyuan Rd 5, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaobing; Huang, Jikun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Datun Rd 11a, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yamauchi, Futoshi] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA","Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; The World Bank","Huang, JK (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Yiheyuan Rd 5, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Huang, JK (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Datun Rd 11a, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",jkhuang.ccap@pku.edu.cn,", IAMO/G-2328-2012",,"National Natural Sciences of China [71373255, 71333013]; Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS [2012RC102, 2012ZD208]; Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSZD-EW-Z-021-1, Y02015004]","National Natural Sciences of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences)","We acknowledge the funding from National Natural Sciences of China (71373255; 71333013), the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS (2012RC102; 2012ZD208) and Chinese Academy of Sciences (KSZD-EW-Z-021-1; Y02015004).",,22,88,105,16,114,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

It does so by examining how gender-specific borrowing activities influence household expenditures which are either specifically of interest to men or women, and by examining the effects of all loans rather than only those provided by microcredit organizations. The article uses a quasi-experimental design to identify the effects of borrowing by men and women by using an original combination of panel data and instrumental variables on subsamples of the surveyed population. It finds that the borrower's gender affects how households allocate their resources to different expenditure items and assets that are valued differently by men and women. In all, the findings suggest that providing greater credit access to women may improve their household bargaining positions.","[Porter, Maria] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Justin S Morrill Hall Agr,446 West Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Porter, M (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Justin S Morrill Hall Agr,446 West Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",mporter1@anr.msu.edu,,,,,,,69,16,18,1,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

Newly created incentives for the comparative economics/economy were tackling, inter alia, the post-socialist countries, that were already exposed to the transformation and reform processes. Models of economic systems formed in this period have initiated a great discussion among the relevant stakeholders. This fruitful discussion has led to the creation of a number of model approaches, focusing on the definition of a common theoretical framework for the comparative analysis and its further applications within the surrounding of particularly advanced concrete modern economies. The presented paper contains newly emerged approaches, the so-called varieties of capitalism. The aim of the paper is: To explore the approaches typical for the varieties of capitalism, that could be considered as the mainstream over the last 25 years, and to deliver their review; then to map the approaches how the models of economic systems of post-socialist countries are defined, and to answer a question, whether the varieties of capitalism can be used for the comparative analysis of economic systems of these countries.","[Cihelkova, Eva] Pan European Univ Bratislava, Fac Econ & Business, Tematinska 10, Bratislava 85105, Slovakia",Pan-European University,"Cihelkova, E (通讯作者)，Pan European Univ Bratislava, Fac Econ & Business, Tematinska 10, Bratislava 85105, Slovakia.",eva.cihelkova@paneurouni.com,,,Pan-European University in Bratislava,Pan-European University in Bratislava,Supported by the funds from the internal assistance program of research activities on the Pan-European University in Bratislava.,,37,8,8,0,4,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The comparative analysis shows that agricultural performance, according to the agricultural indicators analysed and the phenomenon of working poverty vary significantly across the EU countries. The correlation and regression analysis results suggest that the high level of employment in agriculture in some EU countries can be mainly explained by the small scale agriculture, a high share of subsistence holdings and a low agricultural labour productivity. The results of the multiple regression analysis highlight that working poverty at the EU level is influenced positively by the employment in agriculture, and is influenced negatively by the economic size farm and land productivity. Moreover, the results show large cross-country differences in terms of agricultural performance-working poverty link, fact which emphasizes the need to take specific actions to improve efficiency of the EU agricultural sector for reducing the working poverty. The findings of the study can be useful for the policymakers to formulate policies for a decent and productive employment within a sustainable development of agriculture.","[Herman, Emilia] Petru Maior Univ Tirgu Mures, Fac Econ Law & Adm Sci, Nicolae Iorga 1, Targu Mures 540088, Mures County, Romania","George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, & Technology of Targu Mures","Herman, E (通讯作者)，Petru Maior Univ Tirgu Mures, Fac Econ Law & Adm Sci, Nicolae Iorga 1, Targu Mures 540088, Mures County, Romania.",emilia.herman@ea.upm.ro,"Herman, Emilia/S-8210-2019; Herman, Emilia/K-7284-2014; Herman, Emilia/GQB-3206-2022","Herman, Emilia/0000-0003-3763-7585; Herman, Emilia/0000-0003-3763-7585; Herman, Emilia/0000-0003-3763-7585",,,,,53,5,5,1,32,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The difference between the value of the synthetic measure of the country with the highest level of competitiveness of agriculture (Netherlands) and the country least competitive in this regard (Slovenia) was 3.5-fold. In addition to the Netherlands, there were classified also France, Germany, Denmark and Belgium in the first group, so the countries with high levels of the socio-economic development. In the second group, there were seven countries: Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, Cyprus, Austria, Ireland and Luxembourg.

No significant differences in consumers' willingness to pay were revealed by the experimental auction and real choice experiment on the whole, and results from both nonhypothetical experimental methods demonstrated that consumers were willing to pay certain premiums for all four types of traceability information and had the highest willingness to pay for government certification information. These results indicate that consumers trust in pork safety protection under governmental supervision. Moreover, it was found that government certification information played a significant role in improving consumer utility, demonstrating that consumers paid close attention to safety risks in farming. Therefore, this study predicts that the introduction of governmental supervision into the pork traceability system and establishment of a system for collecting traceability information starting from the stage of pig farming will play important roles in meeting consumer demands for pork quality and safety, as well as promoting the development of traceable food policies.","[Wu, Linhai; Wang, Hongsha; Wang, Shuxian] Jiangnan Univ, Food Safety Res Base Jiangsu Prov, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Linhai] Synerget Innovat Ctr Food Safety & Nutr, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Dian] Soochow Univ, Sch Dongwu Business, Dept Econ, Suzhou 215021, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Dian] Jiangnan Univ, Sch Food Sci & Technol, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hu, Wuyang] Univ Kentucky, Dept Agr Econ, Lexington, KY 40546 USA",Jiangnan University; Soochow University - China; Jiangnan University; University of Kentucky,"Wu, LH (通讯作者)，Jiangnan Univ, Food Safety Res Base Jiangsu Prov, 1800 Lihu Rd, Wuxi 214122, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wlh6799@126.com,,,"Study Co-governance for Food Safety Risk in China; National Social Science Foundation of China [14ZDA069]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273117]; Central University Basic Research Funds Jiangnan University [JUSRP51325A, JUSRP51416B]; Six Top Talents in Jiangsu Province [2012-JY-002]; college Innovation Team of Jiangsu Province social science [2013-011]",Study Co-governance for Food Safety Risk in China; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Central University Basic Research Funds Jiangnan University; Six Top Talents in Jiangsu Province; college Innovation Team of Jiangsu Province social science,"This article was supported by Study of Co-governance for Food Safety Risk in China, one of the Key Projects of National Social Science Foundation of China in 2014 (Project Approval No. 14ZDA069), and Study of Multiple Simulation Experiment on Traceable Food Consumption Policy based on Consumer Preferences: the Case of Pork, a project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Approval No. 71273117), and Central University Basic Research Funds Jiangnan University (Project Approval No. JUSRP51325A and JUSRP51416B), and Study of Food Safety Consumption Policy: the Case of Traceable Pork, a project of the Six Top Talents in Jiangsu Province (Project Approval No. 2012-JY-002), and Research on Chinese Food Safety Risk Control, a project of college Innovation Team of Jiangsu Province social science (Project Approval No. 2013-011).",,29,64,67,7,91,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

However, only a few studies have investigated farmers' attitudes toward adopting GM grain crops in China. The purpose of this paper is to explore farmers' willingness to adopt GM insect-resistant rice prior to its commercial release in China and determines the factors that affect farmers' prospective adoption decisions. Design/methodology/approach - The data are collected using a questionnaire. Descriptive statistics are used to analyze the farmers' potential willingness to adopt GM rice and level of awareness of GM rice and socioeconomic characteristics. Ordered and binary probit models are applied to identify the key factors that affect the farmers' decision to adopt GM insect-resistant rice. Findings - Descriptive statistics show that most farmers have little knowledge of GM rice, approximate 35.5 percent of farmers could plant GM rice, and over half of the respondents are uncertain whether or not they will adopt the new crops. The results of econometric analyses show that increasing output and income, and simplicity in crop management, have positive effects on prospective adoption, whereas the high-seed price of GM rice has a significantly negative effect. Health implications also have a significantly positive effect on the farmers' decision to adopt GM grain crops. A comparative analysis of ordered and binary probit models demonstrates that farmers are more deliberate in their decisions when they have fewer choices. Aside from the above-mentioned variables, the following factors are also statistically significant in the probit model: government technicians' recommendations, neighbors' attitudes, level of environmental risks, and the farmer's age. Originality/value - Information on the major risks and benefits of GM rice was provided to the farmers in the questionnaire. The farmers were then asked to choose from the three ordered alternative answers, namely, accept, uncertain, and reject. Both ordered and binary probit models were applied to comparatively analyze the collected data. This study is one of a handful of studies that employ these econometric models to identify and explain the underlying factors that affect farmers' decisions. The relevant findings have important implications for future agricultural policy in China.","[Xu, Ruomei] Anhui Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yanrui] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Perth, WA, Australia; [Luan, Jingdong] Anhui Agr Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Hefei, Peoples R China",Anhui Agricultural University; University of Western Australia; Anhui Agricultural University,"Xu, RM (通讯作者)，Anhui Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Hefei, Peoples R China.",xrm@ahau.edu.cn,"Wu, Yanrui/C-2458-2013","Wu, Yanrui/0000-0002-8966-1459",Anhui Agricultural University; Ministry of Education of China,"Anhui Agricultural University; Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)",The authors acknowledge the generous financial support from Anhui Agricultural University and the Ministry of Education of China.,,26,17,18,4,52,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Results indicate that in addition to price, Chinese consumers looked for other wine attributes such as brand and color but there are significant regional differences in wine preference and expenditure. On average, Chinese spend more on gift wines than for their own consumption. Increase in self-consumption contributed significantly to increases in gifting but the reverse effect was much weaker. Factors contributing to self-consumption and gifting are different and sometimes the effects were completely opposite such as consumers' experiences with wine, the role of wine advertisement, and the occasions when wine was consumed.

Despite clear differences in human and physical capital, there are no obvious differences in the knowledge, adoption, and error in self-reporting between men and women. Having received training unanimously lowers knowledge misreports and increases adoption misreports. Other determinants of reporting error differ by gender. Misreporting is positively associated with a greater number of plots for men. Recall decay on measures of knowledge appears prominent among men but not women.

Among the LAC countries linked by an Free Trade Agreement (FTA), a large percentage of trade is already duty free though many trade barriers in agriculture persist. There is a significant difference in the trade patterns among the LAC countries. The Southern Cone countries, for example, have extensive agricultural exports to Asia and to the European Union (EU), and have few FTAs with regional countries. By contrast, countries in Central America and the Andean region have extensive trade agreements with each other, and have fewer exports outside the region. Meanwhile, other regions are negotiating ambitious mega-agreements, particularly the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). These could have significant impacts on the region, including trade diversion and preference erosion in major import markets. Several possible avenues exist for Latin American countries to accomplish the following: counter the impact of a TPP and T-TIP on agricultural exports; strengthen existing bilateral trade agreements within the region; link existing multi-country agreements such as Mercado ComA(0)n del Sur (MERCOSUR) and the Pacific Alliance to North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); consolidate the current trade agreements with the EU; or sign on to the TPP.

We find that investments in innovative technology indeed increase the productivity of dairy production by shifting out the production frontier. Our findings further imply that investments in innovative dairy technologies require a sufficient level of complementary education to trigger also an increase in efficiency at farm level.

Therefore, a put option with cumulated growing degree days as its underlying index is assumed to be bought by farmers as a risk management instrument to prevent income fluctuations from adverse temperature conditions. Design/methodology/approach - The objective of this paper is to analyze the efficiency of temperature-based WD in reducing risk exposure for Chinese agriculture industry. Therefore, a put option with cumulated growing degree days as its underlying index is assumed to be bought by farmers as a risk management instrument to prevent income fluctuations from adverse temperature conditions. Findings - The results of the efficiency tests show that temperature-based put options are efficient in offsetting yield shortfalls for rice and wheat in China. The weather-yield models have a high prediction power in explaining yield variation by temperature. Research limitations/implications - The de-trending procedure for the weather-yield model should be improved to distinguish better between technology progress, human activities and influence of weather. Further, more advanced models could be used for the pricing. Practical implications - The findings of the paper support the launch of WD as an efficient risk management tool for agriculture in China. Compared with traditional damage-based insurance, WD are more flexible, have lower transactions costs and avoid moral hazard or adverse selection. Originality/value - The efficiency problem of WD has not been analyzed sufficiently worldwide and especially not for developing countries like China where a large proportion of the population works as farmers.

Design/methodology/approach - A multi-sector, Ramsey-type growth model is fit to Chinese data and used to perform policy experiments. Findings - An intra-regional water reallocation increases per capita gross domestic product (GDP) by about 1.5 percent per year over the period 2000-2060. The aggregate potential welfare gain due to this reallocation is 1002.51 billion RMB. Transferring water from southern to northern China via the South-North Water Transfer Project, on average, has a negligible impact on per capita GDP over the period 2000-2060, but aggregate welfare increases by 557.23 billion RMB. Combining intra-regional and inter-regional water reallocations, on average, increases per capita GDP by 0.38 percent per year over the period and the aggregate welfare gain from this combination is 1148.06 billion RMB. Each policy scenario has implications for long-run regional production patterns: In an intra-regional reallocation scenario, Southern China produces almost 70 percent of aggregate GDP, in the inter-regional transfer it produces 58 percent of aggregate GDP, while in a combined intra/inter-regional reallocation it produces 55 percent of aggregate GDP. Originality/value - This analysis can serve as a template for developing a useful planning tool that one can fit to national or regional data and use to examine a variety of policy relevant questions.","[Fang, Xiangming] China Agr Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Roe, Terry L.; Smith, Rodney B.

Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is conducted using an extended gravity model, where the regulations enforced in different countries, as well as bilateral agreements between China and its trade partners on combating illegal logging are included as explanatory variables. The impacts of the efforts against illegal logging on bilateral trade of forest products are examined based on the estimated coefficients of these policy variables. Findings - The results show that the regulations have significant and positive effects on the bilateral trade of total forest products between China and its partner countries. The bilateral agreement on combating illegal logging between showed a negative effect on the bilateral trade of forest products. A further study of three types of forest products shows that the regulations have a negative effect for roundwood, but a positive effect for furniture and wood-based panels. The bilateral agreement, on the other hand, affects negatively the trade of all the three forest products. Practical implications -Since the export of roundwood from China is negligible, the results from this study imply that international efforts to reduce illegal logging have caused reduction of the import of roundwood into China. China's wood processing industry is to a high degree dependent on imported roundwood. To secure timber supply is therefore an important strategy for sustainable development of the wood processing industry in China. Originality/value - To the knowledge, this is the first comprehensive assessment of the impacts of international efforts to reduce illegal logging on forest products trade flow between China and its partner countries. The results provide important scientific bases for decisions on reducing international trade of illegally sourced wood products and on promoting sustainable development of the wood processing industry in China.","[Guan, Zhijie] Changzhou Univ, Sch Business, Changzhou, Peoples R China; [Gong, Peichen] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Econ, S-90183 Umea, Sweden",Changzhou University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Guan, ZJ (通讯作者)，Changzhou Univ, Sch Business, Changzhou, Peoples R China.",zhijie.guan@163.com,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [13BGL101]; Jiangsu Education Administration Bureau,National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Jiangsu Education Administration Bureau,The paper is supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 13BGL101).

Design/methodology/approach - Based on the transaction cost theory (TCT) and the contingency theory (CT), a survey was undertaken at county level to support the main effects and moderating effects and the results were analyzed using a general linear model. A complementary case study was also used to further discuss the results. Findings - It was found that the change rate of peasant households' scope of operation is sensitive to inadequate market information, purchase and sales expense and resolving disputes expense. In terms of specialized cooperatives, the change rate of their scale of operations is sensitive to inadequate market information, the chances of violating an agreement and incomplete norms. The moderating effect of regional classification is supported in terms of purchase and sales expenses on the performance variance of peasant households, and in terms of inadequate market information on the performance variance of specialized cooperatives. Research limitations/implications - First, the data were collected at the county level, which could only reflect the conditions of the macro-environment. Second, many variables were designed as dummies for the sake of brevity and efficiency, because the respondents were officers in local agricultural departments. Third, transaction costs may not have a direct effect on the variance of productivity but indirect through many potential mediators. Practical implications - The results not only provide useful information for agricultural operators to analyze the transaction costs related to their forms of organization, but also impartial advice for policy makers to consider the form of agricultural operators in different regions. Originality/value - This study focusses on the role of the external environment by integrating the TCT and CT theory. Furthermore, it seeks to explore whether the relationship between transaction costs and the performance variance of peasant households and specialized cooperatives varies across different regions of China.","[Yu, Kangkang; Zhu, Xinkai; Chen, Xuan] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Zhu, XK (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zxk@ruc.edu.cn,,,"program of China Agricultural Department named Research on Operators and Erectors of Modern Agriculture; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71302159]; Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry","program of China Agricultural Department named Research on Operators and Erectors of Modern Agriculture; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars)","The author acknowledge that the research underlying this paper was supported in part by a program of China Agricultural Department named Research on Operators and Erectors of Modern Agriculture, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71302159) and by the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, State Education Ministry.",,36,2,3,0,37,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Innovators such as firms and other agents develop supply chains to accommodate the nature of the innovations. In this article we analyze an innovator's supply chain design problem. The design of the supply chain involves three sets of decisions. The first is how much to produce. The second involves how to undertake production, and how many resources to allocate to the production of feedstock (agricultural products that are inputs for processing), processing, and marketing. The third set involves deciding on the amount of feedstock to be obtained through contracts with farmers. We show that the innovator determines its overall level of production by taking advantage of its monopoly power, derived from the innovation in the output market, and behaves as a monopsony in buying feedstock from contractors. These decisions are constrained by the marginal cost of capital and the properties of production and marketing technologies. When the innovator is risk averse, risks in farm production, processing, and marketing will affect both processed output and the share of feedstock bought through contracts.","[Du, Xiaoxue; Lu, Liang; Zilberman, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Reardon, Thomas] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zilberman, David] Giannini Fdn, Berkeley, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Michigan State University,"Lu, L (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",lld2x1515@berkeley.edu,"Lu, Liang/AAK-1069-2021",,Energy Biosciences Institute; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture; United States Agency for International Development (USAID) via the Food Security Policy Innovation Laboratory at Michigan State University,Energy Biosciences Institute; USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); United States Agency for International Development (USAID) via the Food Security Policy Innovation Laboratory at Michigan State University(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"Xiaoxue Du and Liang Lu are PhD candidates in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Berkeley.

Agricultural prices have now come down considerably since their 2011 peak, but are still 40% higher in real terms than their 2000 lows. This paper briefly addresses the main arguments on the causes of the agricultural price cycle. It broadens the scope of analysis by focusing on six agricultural commodities, and identifies the relative weights of key quantifiable drivers of their prices. It concludes that increases in real income negatively affect real agricultural prices, consistent with the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis and its predecessor, Engel's Law. Energy prices matter most (not surprisingly, given the energy-intensive nature of agriculture), followed by stock-to-use ratios and, to a lesser extent, ex-change rate movements. The cost of capital affects prices only marginally, probably because it not only influences demand, but also evokes a supply response. The added value of these results lies in that, when examined in tandem and against market fundamentals, they challenge the conclusions from uni-dimensional approaches that often put disproportionate weight on an individual factor.","[Baffes, John] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Haniotis, Tassos] European Commiss, Brussels, Belgium",The World Bank,"Haniotis, T (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Brussels, Belgium.",anastassios.haniotis@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,59,41,42,6,69,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Different volatility drivers have been identified for different markets in the theoretical and empirical literature. However, there is no comprehensive analysis that considers a large number of potential drivers and investigates their joint effects in a dynamic model of interrelated markets. Our study provides such a volatility analysis for the oilseeds and vegetable oils markets. We use a common GARCH approach and a VAR model to identify volatility drivers and spillover effects. Our results show that exchange rate volatility is very important. However, the hotly debated financialisation of commodity markets is not found to be volatility increasing in our monthly data. Impulse response functions show strong spillover effects. Because many volatility drivers found to be important in other markets have no significant effect in our study, our results suggest that volatility drivers are market specific. This implies that any volatility-reducing policies need to be designed for the market in question.","[Bruemmer, Bernhard; Jaghdani, Tinoush Jamali] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Chair Agr Market Anal, Gottingen, Germany; [Korn, Olaf; Schluessler, Kristina] Univ Gottingen, Fac Econ Sci, Chair Finance, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,"Brümmer, B (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Chair Agr Market Anal, Gottingen, Germany.",bbruemm@gwdg.de,"Brümmer, Bernhard/C-5067-2009","Brümmer, Bernhard/0000-0001-8052-4346; Jamali Jaghdani, Tinoush/0000-0003-2204-0452",European Commission [312182 KBBE. 2012.1.4-05],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The ULYSSES project has received research funding from the European Commission Project 312182 KBBE. 2012.1.4-05.

While biological control is usually considered as an environmentally-friendly alternative to chemical pesticides in controlling pests in crops, there is growing concern that these environmental benefits could be outweighed by the negative consequences of the invasion. These include (i) biodiversity losses as populations of native ladybirds suffer from intraguild predation and competition for resources; (ii) human nuisance in houses, including risks of allergy and (iii) potential losses to wine-growers. We provide an economic valuation of environmental and private characteristics affected by the Asian ladybird's invasion. We conduct a discrete choice experiment among a representative sample of the French population. Our results show that the consequences of the Asian ladybird's introduction do affect significantly the population's welfare. Among these, the impact on biodiversity through the threat on native species appears to be a significant concern.","[Chakir, Raja; David, Maia; Gozlan, Estelle; Sangare, Aminata] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRA, Econ Publ, Thiverval Grignon, France",INRAE; AgroParisTech; Universite Paris Saclay,"David, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRA, Econ Publ, Thiverval Grignon, France.",maia.david@agroparistech.fr,"CHAKIR, RAJA/X-1414-2019","CHAKIR, RAJA/0000-0002-6980-0343; CHAKIR, RAJA/0000-0003-3821-092X; Gozlan, Estelle/0000-0002-7344-322X",Agropolis Fondation [1001-001],Agropolis Fondation(Agropolis Fondation),This research was supported by Agropolis Fondation under the reference ID 1001-001.,,58,14,14,3,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-857X,1477-9552,,J AGR ECON,J.

Researchers have noted the data limitations-frequency and market breadth-associated with using data compiled by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This research addresses these shortfalls by using daily position data for a specific long-only index fund. The empirical analysis focuses on the firm-level position data across 13 U.S. agricultural futures markets. The firm-level data are shown to be representative of the overall index fund industry. Empirical tests fail to find any evidence linking the firm's trading with market returns. However, there does appear to be a consistent negative relationship between the firm's roll transactions and changes in calendar price spreads. Notably, the direction of this impact runs contrary to the price-pressure hypothesis. The results of this study, and others, indicate that a clear verdict can be reached-new limits on speculation in agricultural futures markets are unnecessary.","[Sanders, Dwight R.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Agribusiness Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Irwin, Scott H.] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Lawrence J Norton Chair Agr Mkt, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Sanders, DR (通讯作者)，So Illinois Univ, Dept Agribusiness Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",DwightS@siu.edu,"Irwin, Scott H./AAN-1996-2020; Irwin, Scott H./CAA-2702-2022","Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848",,,,,33,8,9,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

We examine this issue using irrigation water storage infrastructure which has the potential to provide desirable services to residential properties affected by the condition of the storage structure. We examine a particular prairie setting where concerns regarding fluctuations in water levels of an irrigation storage lake led to an agreement between the irrigation agency and the owners of properties around the lake to stabilize water levels. Using quasi-experimental hedonic property approaches with two different control groups we estimate the subsequent impact of this agreement on shoreline property values using a time series of sales data. The methods utilized in this article represent an effective approach to produce plausible estimates of some of the economic values captured by the infrastructure generating ecosystem services. We find that property values increased as a result of the agreement and that the additional property tax revenues arising from these values can be used to some extent to offset the annual service fees paid to the irrigation agency to provide the stabilized lake levels. This article illustrates the potential for irrigation infrastructure management to provide increases in ecosystem service values beyond irrigation, and also that these values can be captured to pay for the costs of providing these increased values.","[Kim, Hyun No; Boxall, Peter C.; Adamowicz, W.

It is also a 'great place to work' for the existing employees. The article therefore focuses on the approaches to implementing the strategic talent management which are taken by the agricultural and forestry companies. The paper investigates the position taken regarding the talent management in theory. It is based on the aims of a primary survey, the purpose of which was to develop a deeper understanding of the supporting theoretical concepts underpinning the company approaches to talent. The objective of the work is to identify the main components of the strategic talent management based on the primary survey of companies operating in agriculture and forestry. Th is is accomplished by evaluating the data obtained from the primary analysis of the methods and approaches used on 101 farms and other agricultural companies. The data comes from the manager surveys for which a single manager represented the given company. The mono-dimensional and multi-dimensional statistics were used to evaluate the data. The results indicate that in 62% of the companies examined are familiar with the principles of the talent management and that the talent management forms part of the mission of the company (48%). A deeper analysis is used to further examine the differences in the approach of the companies included in the study. The paper contains an in depth discussion of the concept of the strategic talent management, as well as identifying the main processes connected with it. Moreover, the paper presents new research findings by defining and validating the main attributes of the strategic talent management (TM); additionally the gap between the awareness of the top management of the talent management concept and its use in practice is found and discussed.","[Vnouckova, Lucie; Smolova, Helena] Univ Econ & Management, Narozni 2600-9a, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic; [Urbancova, Hana] Czech Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Vnouckova, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ & Management, Narozni 2600-9a, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic.",lucie.vnouckova@vsem.cz,"Depoo, Lucie/ABE-4039-2020; Urbancova, Hana/K-5663-2015","Depoo, Lucie/0000-0003-4296-875X; Urbancova, Hana/0000-0001-6603-8691",,,,,48,5,5,4,39,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

The development of rural land-rental markets can improve agricultural productivity and equity by facilitating transfers of land to more productive farmers and facilitating the participation in the non-farm economy of less productive farmers. In contrast to the burgeoning development of off-farm labor markets, the development of rural land-rental market has lagged. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the factors affecting households' entry and transaction intensity in rural land-rental markets, especially the effects of land tenure and off-farm employment. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a field survey data of 479 household in Henan Province in 2009, the authors used Cragg's double-hurdle model to identify the determinants for households' land-rental participation and its transaction amount. Findings - Off-farm employment is one of main driving factor for household's land rent-out decision. Tenure insecurity reduces both the propensity and the magnitude of rental market transactions.

I find that farmers are significantly more tolerant of risk than the general population, though they are significantly less tolerant of risk than nonfarm business owners. Once demographic differences are controlled, farm and nonfarm business owners are more similar in their risk attitudes and both groups remain significantly more risk tolerant than the general population. First-generation farmers display greater risk tolerance than farmers who inherit operations from family members, as do farmers who have just begun operating a farm; neither pattern emerges among nonfarm business owners. The most risk tolerant farmers are young and male with larger operations, higher incomes, less formal education and close proximity to metropolitan centers. Among farmers, those with less diversified operations and those with specialty enterprises are more risk tolerant than other types of farmers. Crop farmers are less risk tolerant than fruit and vegetable farmers or farmers with specialty enterprises, while farmers who receive government payments or buy enterprise insurance are not significantly different in risk tolerance from farmers who eschew such opportunities. These findings stimulate questions about how farm programs and the distinct challenges of entry in the production agriculture sector shape the underlying distribution of key farmer characteristics such as risk tolerance.","[Roe, Brian E.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Agr Policy & Mkt, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Roe, BE (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Agr Policy & Mkt, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",roe.30@osu.edu,"Roe, Brian/A-7386-2009","Roe, Brian/0000-0003-4228-2889","National Institute of Food Agriculture [2008-25400-18701]; Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center; McCormick Program in Agricultural Marketing and Policy, Ohio State University","National Institute of Food Agriculture; Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center; McCormick Program in Agricultural Marketing and Policy, Ohio State University","Salaries and research support were provided by the National Institute of Food & Agriculture (grant# 2008-25400-18701), the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, and the McCormick Program in Agricultural Marketing and Policy, Ohio State University.",,70,33,40,2,56,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",2040-5790,2040-5804,,APPL ECON PERSPECT P,Appl.

Traditional cointegration tests have been used to perform these analyses; however, these tests can only reveal the presence of stable or average long-term relationships. To evaluate market dynamics over time, we modify a time-varying smooth transition autoregressive (TV-STAR) model to examine pine stumpage markets in the US South. The proposed model incorporates an economic indicator and allows us to evaluate market integration as it changes throughout a specified time period. The potential significance of this work is twofold. First, market integration can be observed as a function of an economic indicator, and secondly, the proposed model will allow us to draw inference about market integration at specific time points.","[Hood, Harrison B.] Timber Mart South, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Dorfman, Jeffrey H.] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Dorfman, Jeffrey H.] Univ Guelph, Inst Adv Study Food & Agr Policy, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Guelph,"Hood, HB (通讯作者)，Timber Mart South, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",,,,,,,,29,12,19,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

This is the first study that assesses the potential impact of GM crops in Africa while considering the preferences of producers and consumers towards GMOs as well as the income and price risks they face. The study uses a choice experiment to estimate the ex ante economic impact of a novel technology, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cowpea, on producers and consumers in Benin, Niger and northern Nigeria. The experiment involves the simulation of a market transaction similar to those in open air markets in West Africa. During the market simulation, respondents are informed about the advantages and disadvantages, including health risks, of Bt cowpea. The results from the study suggest that cowpea growers and consumers in Benin and northern Nigeria prefer Bt to conventional cowpea for health safety reasons. The results estimate that social welfare in Benin, Niger and northern Nigeria would increase by at least US$11.82 per capita annually with Bt cowpea, if seed sectors are operating smoothly. With inefficiencies in seed sectors and the potential for cowpea acreage increase, the estimated social welfare increase in the region would be about US$1.26 per capita annually.","[Gbegbelegbe, S.

Moreover, faster wage increases in the regions of origin of many rural-urban migrants are likely to affect the dynamics of inter-regional migration. These wage trends have implications at the local level, in particular in a setting in which migration connects rural communities to the national labor market and in which migration is of high importance for the livelihoods of rural households. Taking a village perspective, this article develops a village computable general equilibrium model to study local impacts of current wage trends in China. As a central piece of the model, the role of access to migration for household livelihoods is recognized. Access to migration is linked to household demographics and included in the model through a composite utility function that captures household preferences and disutilities associated with alternative off-farm activities. Simulation results illustrate how households' utility considerations affect migration responses to national wage changes. Statements about possible impacts on village level labor supply, land use, and agricultural production are made. When migration wages and local off-farm wages are simulated to increase, an overall increase in household and village migration and a higher supply of labor to local off-farm labor markets is accompanied by a contraction of farm production. Although land is reallocated between households with different migration responses, total agricultural output declines.","[Kleinwechter, Ulrich] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Grethe, Harald] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Policy & Markets, Stuttgart, Germany",International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Kleinwechter, U (通讯作者)，Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Ecosyst Serv & Management Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria.",,,"Kleinwechter, Ulrich/0000-0002-9813-9208","State of Berlin, Germany (NaFoG)","State of Berlin, Germany (NaFoG)","The authors are grateful to Xiaobo Zhang, Li Xing, and Yumei Zhang of the International Food Policy Research Institute for the kind provision of data and research support and to Lutz Gohring for intensive discussions on the model.

We find farm technical efficiency is positively related to short-term debt, tax liability and capital investment, but negatively related to off-farm income generating activities.

While many Chinese dairy companies faced huge losses or bankruptcy as a result, one small firm, Dairy United, accelerated its development. Dairy United is one of the fastest-growing and most innovative Chinese dairy producers, one that features an unusual organizational structure and business model. Unlike most corporate and cooperative dairies that purchase cows on the market, Dairy United leases dairy cows from local farmers, giving it access to its primary asset without a large up-front investment, and letting the firm grow its dairy herds with newborn heifers. In return, farmers receive fixed payments biannually, but relinquish control rights and residual claims to the firm. Thus, Dairy United's leasing is helping transform Chinese milk production from a backyard, labor-intensive activity to a more industrialized mode of farming. The case is particularly interesting for understanding applications of agency theory in agribusiness.","[Wang, Jingjing; Klein, Peter G.] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Chen, Mei] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Dalian, Liaoning, Peoples R China",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Dongbei University of Finance & Economics,"Wang, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",,"wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022; Klein, Peter/JOZ-8851-2023; WANG, JINGYI/GSJ-1241-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [70902062]; Philosophy and Social Science Major Research Project of National Education Ministry of China [12JZD025]; Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences [L13AJL002],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Philosophy and Social Science Major Research Project of National Education Ministry of China; Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences,"Jingjing Wang is a PhD candidate at the University of Missouri, Mei Chen is an associate researcher at the Dongbei University of Finance and Economics, and Peter G.

Besides being set in a New Member State, characterised by rather different history of retailing than the established market economies, one of the main innovations of this paper is the comparative assessment of price promotions of two homogenous, every-day products different only with respect to their perishability: one litre boxed and one litre durable fluid milk. Using a battery of empirical techniques from the simple summary statistics, the distribution analysis to the discrete choice models and the co-integration, there is concluded that competing theory predictions on price distributions are not accepted. Also the Hypothesis that manufacturers determine timing of sales is rejected. The results do not confirm that durable goods should have a qualitatively different pricing pattern than perishable products. When the temporal order of sales is considered, the estimations support the Hypothesis of alternate sales. In sum, the predictions of the existing retail sales models only partly confirm certain empirical aspects of price promotions.","[Bakucs, Zoltan; Ferto, Imre] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Inst Econ, Budapest, Hungary; [Bakucs, Zoltan; Ferto, Imre] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary; [Ferto, Imre] Univ Kaposvar, Kaposvar, Hungary",Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Corvinus University Budapest; Kaposvar University,"Bakucs, Z (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budapest, Hungary.",zoltan.bakucs@krtk.mta.hu,"Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021; Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009; Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022","Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964;",OTKA [K-101868],OTKA(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)),Zoltan Bakucs gratefully acknowledges OTKA financial support under project No. K-101868 (Price transmission on Hungarian agri-food markets - a complex view).,,29,3,3,0,10,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Analyzing the modes of governance used by the Polish agricultural producer groups,AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-ZEMEDELSKA EKONOMIKA,,,English,Article,,,,,,co-operatives; governance; organizational choice; Poland; socialist legacy,FARMERS COOPERATIVES; ISSUES,"The cooperative movement in Poland has a long but difficult history, which has caused farmers to have an aversion to cooperatives. Nonetheless, in the early 1990s, the first farmers' cooperative marketing organizations, which were called agricultural producer groups, appeared in the market. These groups are bottom-up, voluntary organizations the primary purpose of which is to jointly sell their members' output. In this paper, it is investigated why the new forms of governance, namely cooperative arrangements, were chosen, and we evaluate the implications of these choices on the market success of these groups. Empirical data were collected from 62 producer groups in one Polish province. We found that the groups were typically functioning as associations, unions, and limited liability companies. The factors that had an impact on the choices made were the number of members and the specific investment per member. Additionally, if the initial investment level was low, not only set-up and operational costs but also tax considerations played a role in the decision. Therefore, we argue that the new bottom-up cooperatives, which are theoretically suitable when the start-up capital is high or the number of members is large, will gradually be recognized and accepted in the market despite the fact that these cooperatives have a bad reputation caused by the socialist legacy. The new cooperative development trend confirms this argument.","[Beckmann, Volker] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Fac Law & Econ, Greifswald, Germany; [Otto, Ilona M.; Tan, Rong] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Otto, Ilona M.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany",Universitat Greifswald; Zhejiang University; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Tan, R (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Yuhangtang Rd 886, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",tanrong@zju.edu.cn,"Beckmann, Volker/Q-7377-2018; Otto, Ilona Magdalena/GNP-4425-2022","Beckmann, Volker/0000-0001-6595-7995;","National Science Foundation of China [71273008, 71350110520]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71273008; 71350110520).,,24,8,8,2,22,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper builds on a review of the existing literature on agricultural value chains and their financing mechanisms, and draws lessons from it for strengthening interface between product and financial markets in order to enable smallholders capture benefits of the value addition. Findings - From the comparative review of value chain financing mechanisms and current policy contexts the authors find dominance of internal financing of value chains (in terms of provision of inputs, technology and services) in both the countries. Value chain finance from commercial banks and other financial institutions is limited and mainly through tripartite agreements among the financing institutions, lead firms and farmers. Practical implications - The lessons drawn from various value chain models and their financing mechanisms provide feedback to financial institutions and policymakers to take measures to strengthen value chain finance in smallholder agriculture. Originality/value - The paper undertakes a rigorous review of the existing value chain models and their financing mechanisms in light of the most recent research on emerging innovations and development strategies, in order to glean key lessons for policy recommendations on strengthening linkages between financial and product markets.","[Chen, Kevin Z.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Joshi, Pramod K.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, New Delhi, India; [Cheng, Enjiang] Univ Victoria, Victoria Inst Strateg Econ Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Birthal, Pratap S.] Natl Inst Agr Econ & Policy Res, New Delhi, India",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Victoria University; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Institute of Agricultural Economics & Policy Research,"Chen, KZ (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China.",k.chen@cgiar.org,"Covey, Kevin/AAE-3599-2020; Birthal, Pratap/Q-7459-2019; Chen, Kevin/GYU-8963-2022","Covey, Kevin/0000-0001-6914-7797;","Asian Development Bank [TA-7996, 45073]; CGIAR Research Programme on Policies, Institutions and Markets (PIM)","Asian Development Bank; CGIAR Research Programme on Policies, Institutions and Markets (PIM)(CGIAR)","Funding support for this study came from the Asian Development Bank TA-7996 project Innovative Financing for Agriculture and Food Value Chains (Project Number: 45073) and the CGIAR Research Programme on Policies, Institutions and Markets (PIM).

To answer this question, we considered an empirical gravity-type trade model. We tested our model with data on bilateral exports of food products sold in supermarkets (groceries) on a large panel of countries, as well as the foreign grocery sales of the world's 100 largest retail companies from 2001-2010. We found a strong positive effect of the overseas presence of retailers from a given country on its exports to those markets. This outcome is far from trivial since most products sold in retailers' foreign outlets are produced locally, and it also testifies to the fact that the presence of a country's retail companies overseas helps reduce export costs to these markets for other firms from the retailers' country of origin. On average, a 10% increase in retailers' sales in a foreign country leads to a 2.1%-2.5% increase in food exports to this destination. Our result is robust to different specifications, the use of different sets of instrumental variables, and econometric approaches. The effects on exported values and quantities are similar, implying that our finding is not induced by price or quality upgrading.","[Cheptea, Angela] INRA, SMART, Res Unit Struct & Marches Agr Ressources & Terr, UMR1302, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Emlinger, Charlotte] CEPII, Paris, France; [Latouche, Karine] INRA, LERECO, Res Unit, Lab Etud & Rech Econ,UR1134, F-44000 Nantes, France",Universite de Rennes; INRAE; INRAE,"Cheptea, A (通讯作者)，INRA, SMART, Res Unit Struct & Marches Agr Ressources & Terr, UMR1302, F-35000 Rennes, France.",angela.cheptea@rennes.inra.fr,,"Emlinger, Charlotte/0000-0002-3593-0617; Cheptea, Angela/0000-0003-3182-9498",Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme [331958]; EC Commission [290693 FOODSECURE],Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme(European Union (EU)); EC Commission,"Angela Cheptea is a researcher at INRA (Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique), UMR1302 SMART (research unit Structures et Marches Agricoles, Ressources et Territoires), F-35000 Rennes, France.

Design/methodology/approach - The four components (social networks, social trust, social reciprocity and social participation) were derived by employing exploratory factor analysis. Logistic model was used to estimate the influence of these components on farmers' participative behaviour. Information was obtained from a field survey covering six counties in 2011 of Shaanxi Province, China. Findings - The findings indicate that considering different components of social capital allows for a better understanding of farmers' participative behaviour. The authors find that higher levels of social trust and social participation lead to a higher propensity for collective action, while social reciprocity reduces the probability of participation. Other socio-economic factors and farming characteristics such as education levels, cultivated area, cropping patterns and grain subsidies also have a significant impact. Practical implications - The findings suggest creating favourable conditions for communication and information exchanges between households, which enhance their trust of each other, and encourage farmers to participate in collective affairs. Moreover, supportive rules are necessary for the future development of collective action. The results of this study also have implications for national irrigation plans for small-scale irrigation facilities in other developing countries. Originality/value - A consideration of the different components of social capital allows for a more precise understanding of farmers' participative behaviour.","[Miao, Shanshan] Henan Polytech Univ, Emergency Management Sch, Jiaozuo, Peoples R China; [Heijman, Wim] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Zhu, Xueqin] Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Lu, Qian] Northwest A&F Univ, Dept Econ & Management, Yangling, Peoples R China",Henan Polytechnic University; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Northwest A&F University - China,"Miao, SS (通讯作者)，Henan Polytech Univ, Emergency Management Sch, Jiaozuo, Peoples R China.",miaoshanshan2004@hotmail.com,"Zhu, Xueqin/K-9471-2013","Zhu, Xueqin/0000-0002-5772-1090",,,,,75,22,24,1,65,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

Significant contributions began in the 1960s and 1970s with conceptual insights into the causes for market failure and the design of appropriate policy responses. The practical orientation of the profession led to the development and application of analytical tools in a wide array of contexts. Prominent amongst these have been nonmarket valuation, market-based policy instruments and the private sector provision of environmental protection. Interaction with natural and social scientists has been a feature. Cross-fertilisation has resulted to define emergent fields such as behavioural economics and ecological economics.

Financial regulators in the United States are now requiring financial institutions with mortgage portfolios to show they have set aside sufficient capital reserves to meet expected and unexpected losses caused by credit defaults. Various methods exist to estimate the loss risk of agricultural loan portfolios, and those methods were used to estimate the economic capital necessary to cover loan losses for a financial institution. Combining estimates of probability of delinquency, probability of loss, loss given default, and exposure at default from various models, one-year-ahead expected loss estimates were derived. Value-at-Risk and expected shortfall estimates were obtained from loss distributions to arrive at unexpected loss estimates. Previous empirical studies reported in the literature often only measured the probability of default, but the other components are essential to determine the necessary economic capital to meet expected and unexpected loan losses. Results show that measures of liquidity, solvency, profitability, and controls for unobserved heterogeneity are important when modeling delinquency, while measures of leverage, state-level economic output, and controls for unobserved heterogeneity are important when modeling loss given default. Predicted portfolio expected losses were greatest for the regression model combination that included the loss given default linear regression static variable models, and least for the regression model combination using static and time-varying variables. These results should prove useful in determining and assessing capital reserve requirements for financial institutions with mortgage portfolios.","[Dressler, Jonathan B.] MetLife Agr Investments, Fresno, CA USA; [Tauer, Loren W.] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Tauer, LW (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",lwt1@cornell.edu,"Tauer, Loren/AAD-6301-2020",,"USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch/Multistate project [0219720]; NIFA [594514, 0219720] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch/Multistate project; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","Jonathan B.

Extended STIRPAT (Stochastic Impact by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology) and EKC (Environmental Kuznets Curve) models are conducted to systematically identify these factors driving CO2 emissions in these countries during the period 1980-2010. To this end, the study employs three different heterogeneous, dynamic mean group-type linear panel models and one nonlinear panel data estimation procedure that allows for cross-sectional dependence. While affluence, nonrenewable energy consumption and energy intensity variables are found to drive pollutant emissions in linear models, population is also found to be a significant driver in the nonlinear model. Both service sector and agricultural value-added levels play a significant role in reducing pollution levels, whereas industrialisation increases pollution levels. Although the linear model fails to track any significant impact of trade openness, the nonlinear model finds trade liberalisation to significantly affect emission reduction levels. All of these results suggest that economic development, and especially industrialisation strategies and environmental policies, need to be coordinated to play a greater role in emission reduction due to trade liberalisation.","[Rafiq, Shuddhasattwa] Deakin Univ, Fac Business & Law, Burwood, Vic, Australia; [Salim, Ruhul] Curtin Univ, Curtin Business Sch, Perth, WA, Australia; [Apergis, Nicholas] Northumbria Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Deakin University; Curtin University; Northumbria University,"Rafiq, S (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Fac Business & Law, Burwood, Vic, Australia.",Shuddhasattwa.Rafiq@deakin.edu.au,"Apergis, Nikolas/J-7125-2017",", Nick/0000-0002-0375-2457",,,,,61,95,96,3,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Some believe the reacceleration has been a product of intensified investment, which in turn has spurred yield growth. Others suggest it is because India's newly wealthy citizens have demanded greater product diversification. To examine these hypotheses, we use growth accounting techniques in conjunction with more complete agricultural production data than in past studies to construct state, regional, and national output, input, and total factor productivity quantity indexes, which can be decomposed into their underlying sources. Sectoral performance evaluation suggests that, since 1980, output growth has diffused away from the northern  grain belt and toward high-value agriculture in traditionally less-productive regions. Productivity growth, rather than resource use, has accounted for these geographical and intensity shifts. The growth burst has not, as the literature has primarily argued, been uniquely explainable by yield growth or product diversification but by a variety of factors, including area expansion. For example, the contributions of irrigation technologies permitting double-cropping have until now been largely ignored.","[Rada, Nicholas] Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Rada, N (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",nrada@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,32,10,10,2,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

A unique dataset of 4,032 parcels of farmland drawn from administrative foreclosure auction profiles between 2000 and 2008 and regression discontinuity design were applied to cope with the endogeneity issue of land use regulations. The results of the parametric and nonparametric estimations indicate that the minimum lot size program significantly increases farmland value by approximately 18% and 15%, respectively. Moreover, the program effect is more pronounced for farmland located in urban/suburban areas. In the absence of a tax effect and externality resulting from non-agricultural activities, the significant program effect on farmland values is likely to result from the effect of the program on farmland's option value for future development.","[Chang, Hung-Hao] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lin, Tzu-Chin] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Land Econ, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan",National Taiwan University; National Chengchi University,"Chang, HH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",hunghaochang@ntu.edu.tw,,"chang, hung-hao/0000-0003-2296-134X",Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan [104-2410-H-002-004],"Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This research was partially funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan under grant number 104-2410-H-002-004.

It was, and in many ways continues to be, controversial. The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) originated in 1973 and has also been controversial. In the 1990s, concerns were raised by economists in Canada and the United States on the design of endangered species (ES) policy. Their concerns surrounded the reconsideration of the ESA and the establishment of SARA. What have we learned since the implementation of SARA over this time? How has the U.S. experience with the ESA informed SARA and its approach? How has the role of economic analysis in ES policy evolved? What continue to be the challenges and what are the opportunities? This paper reviews the concerns raised in the past, and evaluates the lessons learned regarding economics and ES. The unique aspects of the economic analysis of ES problems relative to other environmental concerns are outlined. The paper concludes with a discussion of ways to lessen the tension in debate about the role of economics in ES policy, and embrace the potential for more effective policy analysis and design through integration of economic analysis into conservation policy. Au Canada, la Loi sur les especes en peril (LEP) est entree en vigueur il y a 13ans. Elle avait souleve la controverse et, a certains egards, c'est encore le cas. Aux Etats-Unis, l'Endangered Species Act (ESA - loi sur les especes en voie de disparition) a vu le jour en 1973 et a aussi fait l'objet de controverse. Au cours des annees 1990, des economistes canadiens et americains ont exprime des preoccupations au sujet de la conception des politiques visant a proteger les especes en voie de disparition. Leurs preoccupations ont mene a un reexamen de l'ESA et a la mise en OEuvre de la LEP. Quelles lecons avons-nous apprises depuis la mise en OEuvre de la LEP?

Several adoption constraints have been discussed in the literature, including limited access to information. Using data from maize farmers in Tanzania, we challenge the hypothesis that limited information is an important constraint for hybrid seed adoption. While we find an adoption gap from lack of hybrid awareness, this gap is sizeable only in regions where productivity gains of hybrids are small. Hence, awareness of a new technology may be a function of expected returns. Other constraints related to assets and credit are not significant.

However, managing gleaning operations can be challenging because the arrival of gleaning opportunities and the attendance of gleaner volunteers are both stochastic. We develop a stochastic optimization model to characterize and optimize a gleaning operation. The food bank chooses the gleaning schedule, which affects the gleaner capacity and the number of gleaning opportunities scheduled. In a specific field study of the Food Bank of the Southern Tier in New York, we analyze the tradeoff between call and volume service levels to find the optimum schedule that maximizes the expected total volume gleaned. Moreover, we find that increasing the gleaning window and increasing slot availability can be used as substitute mechanisms for increasing the total volume gleaned.

Using data on basis values across 215 grain-handling facilities, we empirically test the forecasting capabilities of numerous basis models. Contrary to basis models developed for other U.S. regions, we show that recent futures prices, protein content, and harvest information are more important for accurate basis forecasts than historical basis averages.

J,"Khanal, AR; Mishra, AK",,,,"Khanal, Aditya R.; Mishra, Ashok K.",,,Financial performance of small farm business households: the role of internet,CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Agricultural technology; Internet; Household analysis; Agribusiness; Agricultural extension services; Treatment effects,INCOME,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of internet usage on financial performance of small farm business households in the USA. In particular, the authors want to assess the impact of internet usage on small farm businesses, where the owner's main occupation is farming. Using a nationwide farm-level data in the USA and a non-parametric matching estimator, the study finds a significant positive impact of internet usage on gross cash income, total household income, off-farm income. The study further suggests that small farm businesses receive benefits from internet usage as it facilitates reduction in income risk through off-farm income sources, as well as a reduction in marketing and storage costs; households' non-farm transportation and vehicle leasing expenses. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the authors use the nearest neighbors matching method in treatment evaluation, developed by Abadie and Imbens (2002). In this method, a weighting index is applied to all observations and nearest neighbors are identified (Abadie et al., 2004). Although matching estimation through the nearest neighbor method does not require probit or logit model estimation per se, the authors have estimated a probit model because it allows the authors to check the balancing property and to analyze the association of included variables with the likelihood of internet use. Findings - The study suggests that small farm business households using the internet are better off in terms of total household income and off-farm income. As compared to the control group (which is counterfactual, representation of small farm businesses not using the internet), small farm businesses using the internet earn about $24,000-$26,000 more in total household income and about $27,000-$28,000 more in off-farm income. Also, small farm businesses using the internet earn about $4,100-$4,900 more in gross cash farm income compared to their counterpart. The estimate of ATT for NFI is not different from zero. However, gross cash farm revenue increased significantly. Practical implications - To this end internet can provide an important role in information gathering. Internet is one of the convenient means to access and exchange information. Information and communication facilitation through internet have opened up new areas of commerce, social networking, information gathering, and recreational activities beyond a geographical bound. Producers and consumers can take advantages of internet in both collaborative and competitive aspects in economic activities as it can reduce the information asymmetries among economic agents. Social implications - Farmers will seek assistance in interpreting data and applying information to their farming operations, via the internet. Therefore, it is essential that land grant universities continue to improve the delivery of electronic extension and provide information in a clear and concise manner. Originality/value - Studies in farm households have mainly investigated factors influencing internet adoption, purchasing patterns through internet, internet use, and applications. In most cases, impact analyses of communication and information technologies such as internet in agricultural businesses are discussed with references to large scale farm businesses. Thus, the authors know very little about access to the internet when it comes to small farm businesses and small farm households and about how it impacts well-being of small farm households.","[Khanal, Aditya R.] Tennessee State Univ, Dept Agr & Environm Sci, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Mishra, Ashok K.] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Tennessee State University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Mishra, AK (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Ashok.k.mishra@asu.edu,,"Khanal, Aditya/0000-0001-8127-2320",,,,,36,27,29,5,91,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-137X,1756-1388,,CHINA AGR ECON REV,China Agric.

In this paper, we investigate the effect of crop insurance enrollment on contract terms and farmers' participation in marketing contracts. Following Ligon (2003), we set up a mechanism design framework to demonstrate an intermediary's contract design problem, where farmers are assumed to be utility maximizing agents. We depict farmers' optimal choices of insurance coverage using the specification developed by Babcock (2012). Our model shows that improved terms of crop insurance (lower premiums, higher subsidies) make contracts less appealing to farmers as mechanisms for mitigating risk. Therefore, intermediaries may revise their contract offers so that they are more attractive. However, improvements in contract terms are limited by their cost to the intermediaries and will not lead to expanded participation in contracts.","[Du, Xiaoxue; Lu, Liang; Zilberman, David] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Ifft, Jennifer] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Cornell University,"Du, XX (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",lld2x1515@berkeley.edu,"Lu, Liang/AAK-1069-2021",,Energy Biosciences Institute,Energy Biosciences Institute,"Xiaoxue Du is a PhD student in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Berkeley.

In this study, we apply a two-period harvest model to assess the timber harvesting behavior of various landowners at the stand level by utilizing USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data for nine southern states. Forest industry and institutional timberland owners were found to be more likely to conduct partial and final harvests than nonindustrial private forest landowners. Aggregately, Timberland Investment Management Organizations were found to be most, and timberland Real Estate Investment Trusts to be least, price-responsive among ownership groups.

However, they are limited to region and crop-specific estimates of the mean gender gap. This article improves on previous work in three ways. First, data representative at the national level and for a wide variety of crops is exploited. Second, decomposition methodstraditionally used in the analysis of wage gender gapsare employed. Third, heterogeneous effects by women's marital status and along the productivity distribution are analyzed. Drawing on data from the 2011-2012 Ethiopian Rural Socioeconomic Survey, we find an overall 23.4 percentage point productivity differential in favor of men, of which 13.5 percentage points (57%) remain unexplained after accounting for gender differences in land manager characteristics, land attributes, and access to resources. The magnitude of the unexplained fraction is large relative to prior estimates in the literature. A more detailed analysis suggests that differences in the returns to extension services, land certification, land extension, and product diversification may contribute to the unexplained fraction. Moreover, the productivity gap is mostly driven by non-married female managersparticularly divorced women; married female managers do not display a disadvantage. Finally, overall and unexplained gender differentials are more pronounced at mid-levels of productivity.","[Aguilar, Arturo] Inst Tecnol Autonomo Mexico, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico; [Carranza, Eliana] World Bank, Poverty Global Practice, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Goldstein, Markus] World Bank, Off Chief Economist, Africa Reg, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Kilic, Talip; Oseni, Gbemisola] World Bank, Living Stand Measurement Study Surveys & Methods, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico; The World Bank; The World Bank; The World Bank,"Aguilar, A (通讯作者)，Inst Tecnol Autonomo Mexico, Av Camino Santa Teresa 930, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico.",arturo.aguilar@itam.mx,,"Aguilar Esteva, Arturo/0000-0002-7545-9110; Kilic, Talip/0000-0002-3642-3123",,,,,66,87,95,1,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0169-5150,1574-0862,,AGR ECON-BLACKWELL,Agric.

The analysis utilizes the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method, which allows for decomposing the unconditional gender gap into: (i) the portion caused by observable differences in the factors of production (endowment effect) and (ii) the unexplained portion caused by differences in returns to the same observed factors of production (structural effect). The analysis is conducted separately for the North and South regions, excluding the west of the country. The findings show that in the North, women produce 28% less than men after controlling for observed factors of production, while there are no significant gender differences in the South. In the decomposition results, the structural effect in the North is larger than the endowment at the mean. Although women in the North have access to less productive resources than men, the results indicate that even if given the same level of inputs, significant differences still emerge. However, for the South, the decomposition results show that the endowment effect is more important than the structural effect. Access to resources explains most of the gender gap in the South and if women are given the same level of inputs as men, the gap will be minimal. The difference in the results for the North and South suggests that policy should vary by region.","[Oseni, Gbemisola; Goldstein, Markus] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Corral, Paul; Winters, Paul] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",The World Bank; American University,"Oseni, G (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",goseni@worldbank.org,"Winters, Paul/HKE-8169-2023","Winters, Paul/0000-0001-9976-4534",International Fund for Agricultural Development,International Fund for Agricultural Development,"We appreciate the helpful comments of Mariapia Mendola (Universita degli Studi di Milano Bicocca), two anonymous referees, as well as the participants of the Gender and Agricultural Productivity in sub-Saharan Africa workshop at the International Fund for Agricultural Development Headquarters in Rome, Italy.

We first run a cross-sectional analysis with 2008 data and the full set of control variables, then move to the dynamics of collective reputation with panel data analysis on a 30-year time span (1978-2008). Group reputation is history-dependent. In particular, past bad collective behavior increases the probability of being stuck in a bad reputation trap. Minimum quality standards and effective enforcement are fundamental drivers of group reputation. The relationship between group size and collective reputation is non-linear: free entry may not be optimal due to free-riding problems. Finally, institutional signals such as the wine classification system are useful because they can be used by consumers as easily available proxies for information that is much more difficult to acquire.","[Castriota, Stefano] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, CEIS, I-00173 Rome, Italy; [Delmastro, Marco] Autor Garanzie Nelle Comunicaz, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Castriota, S (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, CEIS, I-00173 Rome, Italy.",stefano.castriota@uniroma2.it,,"Castriota, Stefano/0000-0001-9252-778X; Delmastro, Marco/0000-0002-8527-3117","MIUR (Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca) - FISR (Fondo Integrativo Speciale per la Ricerca) project INTERAGRO (metodi e strumenti per la supply chain INTEgRata","MIUR (Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca) - FISR (Fondo Integrativo Speciale per la Ricerca) project INTERAGRO (metodi e strumenti per la supply chain INTEgRata","The authors thank Leonardo Becchetti, Carlo Andrea Bollino, Carlo Borzaga, Davide Castellani, Massimo Colombo, Zeno Enders, Arthur Fishman, Andrea Fracasso, Mikel Larreina, Antonio Nicita, Martin Peitz, Gustavo Piga, Claudia Pollio, participants of seminars in Trento, Perugia, Milan, Naples, and the 2011 American Association of Wine Economists annual conference, and two anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions.

We propose an information-based disaggregation algorithm to systematically generate regionalised elasticities from a single prior, and provide an empirical illustration.","[Garnache, Cloe] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Merel, Pierre R.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Michigan State University; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Garnache, C (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",garnache@msu.edu,,,USDA Economic Research Service Grant Programs [58-6000-0-0097],USDA Economic Research Service Grant Programs,"Cloe Garnache is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Agricultural, Food and Resource Economics, Michigan State University.

The answer may seem straightforward since labels improve information, yet economic theory reveals situations where their introduction reduces the welfare of at least some market participants. This essay reviews the theoretical literature on labels in order to identify and explain the main reasons that may cause labeling to produce undesirable side-effects. In contrast to earlier reviews that either concentrate on narrow topics or treat the subject in a more or less informal way, we bring together the main results from all the relevant topics by presenting and discussing the assumptions and model-building techniques that underpin them. The advantage of this approach is that it identifies the origin of the differences between results, thus allowing the synthesis of results that sometimes appear even to be contradictory. We focus on quality labels and examine the impact of labeling on market structure, the side-effects of costly certification, issues related to the label's trustworthiness, the rationale for mandatory vs. voluntary labeling, the level at which the label's standard is set according to the agency that selects it, the political economy of labels, that is, pro- or anti-label lobbying, lobbying to affect the label's standard, and lobbying in favor or against the label's mandatory imposition. These topics cover a wide range of applications, including Genetically Modified Organism (GMOs), organic produce, geographic indicators, controlled origin, eco-labels, etc. We conclude by identifying topics that require further research.","[Bonroy, Olivier] French Natl Inst Agr Res INRA, GAEL, UMR 1215, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Constantatos, Christos] Univ Macedonia, Dept Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece",INRAE; University of Macedonia,"Bonroy, O (通讯作者)，French Natl Inst Agr Res INRA, GAEL, UMR 1215, F-38000 Grenoble, France.",olivier.bonroy@grenoble.inra.fr,"Constantatos, Christos/AAP-7303-2021","Bonroy, Olivier/0000-0002-3589-1961",,,,,47,111,125,2,90,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0002-9092,1467-8276,,AM J AGR ECON,Am.

This paper captures the effects of subsidy (including area subsidy and price subsidy) on the total sown areas of crops based on the assumption that subsidy has both stimulating effects and inhibiting effects. Different from the prior studies, this paper considers the impacts of the farmland constraint and demand elasticity and some interesting conclusions are achieved. Firstly, a stimulating effect increases crop sown areas while an inhibiting effect reduces them. Secondly, the output efficiency of farmland as well as the demand elasticity has a major impact on the government subsidy. Besides, the capacity constraint makes thing difference and the government should choose between the areas subsidy and price subsidy under different conditions. Finally, this paper offers an empirical test on the conclusions by adopting the Chinese agricultural statistical data.","[Chen, You-Hua; Wan, Jun-Yi] South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen, You-Hua] South China Agr Univ, Guangdong Ctr Rural Econ Studies, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chan] Jinan Univ, Inst Ind Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China Agricultural University; South China Agricultural University; Jinan University,"Wang, C (通讯作者)，South China Agr Univ, Guangdong Ctr Rural Econ Studies, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",wangchan0512@163.com,"Chen, Youhua/M-4136-2013","Chen, Youhua/0000-0001-5697-9295","Guangdong Social Science Foundation [GD13YLJ02]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; GDUPS; National Natural Science Foundation of PRC [71271100, 71401057]; National Social Science Fund [14AJY020]; Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333004]",Guangdong Social Science Foundation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); GDUPS; National Natural Science Foundation of PRC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Fund; Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Supported by the Guangdong Social Science Foundation (GD13YLJ02), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, the GDUPS (2012), the National Natural Science Foundation of PRC (No. 71271100 and No. 71401057), the National Social Science Fund (No. 14AJY020) and the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71333004).",,19,16,21,1,30,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

It identifies three possible ways to measure intra-industry trade (IIT) flows (GHM, FF, and N methods) and defines six hypotheses to test for the drivers of VIIT with three panel data models (static, dynamic, and FEVD). The results suggest that factor endowments are negatively, while economic size is positively and significantly related to VIIT. Distance and VIIT were found to be negatively related as is commonly the case in the standard gravity model. It was also found that VIIT is greater if a New Member State (NMS) is exporting agri-food produce to an NMS, while EU accession has ambiguously influenced the share of VIIT. In general, it seems that our results are independent from model estimations and interestingly they do not differ considerably as we a priori expected. Moreover, our results seem surprisingly robust across various measurements of ITT.","[Ferto, Imre] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Inst Econ, H-1502 Budapest, Hungary; [Ferto, Imre; Jambor, Attila] Corvinus Univ Budapest, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary",Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Corvinus University Budapest,"Jambor, A (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.",attila.jambor@uni-corvinus.hu,"Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021; Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022; Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009","Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964; Jambor, Attila/0000-0001-8089-7222",Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences,Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences(Hungarian Academy of Sciences),The authors gratefully acknowledge two anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions on earlier drafts of this manuscript.

Complexity in economic theory is in general perceived from the perspective of external effects, while the problem may also have other connotations: as the so-called fallacy of composition, or the phenomenon of entropy. The problem of complexity indicates the need for further reflection on the holistic perception of economic processes. This is particularly evident in the case of agriculture, when the evaluation based mainly on microeconomic approach from the perspective of the effect/cost relationship loses sight of the environmental, social, and cultural context. Focus should also be put on the entropy approach, which takes into account the openness of socio-economic systems and the limitations of resources, including the environment. Both the operating practice of agriculture together with the institutional surrounding, and agricultural economics are more advanced in the area of solving the problems of complexity on the practical and theoretical grounds, but there are still many issues that require solutions, particularly quantification of externalities. The work is theoretical in nature and a heuristic approach was applied in the considerations.","[Grzelak, Aleksander] Univ Econ, Aleja Niepodleglosci 10, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Grzelak, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Aleja Niepodleglosci 10, Poznan, Poland.",agrzelak@interia.pl,,"Grzelak, Aleksander/0000-0002-4290-4740",,,,,49,6,6,0,19,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Although the international trade can reduce food insecurity in LDCs, for example, facilitating the access to larger markets, the volatility in food prices since the late 2000s has negatively affected the food availability. This study examines the effects of trade on the food security and traces a U-shaped relationship between two variables, using 2000-2010 panel data for the LDCs. The results are robust across different methods and show that the food security decreases in the initial stages of the trade expansion but increases beyond a given threshold. The key finding of this study is the U-shaped relationship between trade and food security, which suggests that the policy makers should pay more attention to expanding investments in the agricultural productivity, particularly from the viewpoints of the self-sufficiency and self-reliance.","[Kang, Hyunsoo] Wonkwang Univ, Div Int Trade, Iksan, Jeonbuk, South Korea",Wonkwang University,"Kang, H (通讯作者)，Wonkwang Univ, Div Int Trade, 344-2 Sinyong Dong, Iksan, Jeonbuk, South Korea.",agkang75@wku.ac.kr,,,Wonkwang University,Wonkwang University,This paper supported by Wonkwang University in 2014.,,30,5,6,0,27,CZECH ACADEMY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES,PRAGUE,"TESNOV 17, PRAGUE, 117 05, CZECH REPUBLIC",0139-570X,1805-9295,,AGR ECON-CZECH,Agric.

Annual milk production quantity, concentrate feed, roughage feed, veterinary costs, and human labour were used in the analysis as variables of efficiency model. The Tobit Regression Model was used to calculate the DEA scores in order to establish the causes of inefficiencies. According to the results of the DEA model, mean technical efficiency scores estimated for the Constant Return to Scale (CRS) and Variable Return to Scale (VRS) were 0.64 and 0.69, respectively. Inefficiency stems from a certain amount of product which can't be produced using the minimum input. Efficiencies are positively correlated with herd size, concentrate feed ratio, and farmers' experience. However, only herd size and concentrate feed ratio are statically significant with a level of 5 %. The increased herd size and concentrate feed ratio in total feed will enhance the profitability.","[Parlakay, Oguz; Semerci, Arif; Celik, Ahmet Duran] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, POB 31034, Antakya, Hatay, Turkey",Mustafa Kemal University,"Parlakay, O (通讯作者)，Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, POB 31034, Antakya, Hatay, Turkey.",oguzparlakay@hotmail.com; arifsemerci69@gmail.com; ahmetdurancelik01@hotmail.com,"celik, Ahmet/IAP-5710-2023; Semerci, Arif/HTL-3968-2023; PARLAKAY, Oğuz/U-6672-2017","Semerci, Arif/0000-0003-0893-3748; PARLAKAY, Oğuz/0000-0001-6012-0723",Mustafa Kemal University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit [2013/9162],Mustafa Kemal University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit(Mustafa Kemal University),This study was funded by Mustafa Kemal University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit (Project No: 2013/9162).

There were three planting times: sorghum + soybean sown at the same time (S-1), sorghum sown 15 days before soybean (S-2), sorghum sown 15 days after soybean (S-3) and four spatial arrangements (sorghum and soybean sown in 1: 1(T-1), 1: 2(T-2), 2: 1(T-3) and 2: 2 (T-4) row proportions). The experiment was carried out in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with factorial arrangements and was replicated thrice. The statistical analysis of data revealed that forage sorghum sown 15 days before soybean in 2: 1 row proportion (S2T3) recorded the highest physiological growth. The same treatment was instrumental in giving the highest quality forage with considerably higher crude protein, ether extractable fat and ash contents; however soybean performed better when it was sown 15 days before forage sorghum in 2: 2 row proportions (S3T4). Data regarding economic analysis for different intercropping systems revealed that the highest net income of Rs. 42971 and Rs. 46871 ha(-1) and BCR of 2.13 and 2.24 were earned from sorghum sown 15 days before soybean in 2: 1 row proportion (S2T3) during 2013 and 2014 respectively. Overall, it is concluded that delaying soybean sowing for 15 days after sorghum not only increased forage quality but profit was also augmented.","[Iqbal, Muhammad Aamir; Iqbal, Asif; Ayub, Muhammad] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Agron, Faisalabad 38040, Pakistan; [Iqbal, Muhammad Aamir] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Akhtar, Javaid] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Soil & Environm Sci, Faisalabad 38040, Pakistan",University of Agriculture Faisalabad; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Agriculture Faisalabad,"Iqbal, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Agron, Faisalabad 38040, Pakistan.;Iqbal, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",aamir1801@yahoo.com; asifiqbaldahasi@yahoo.com,"Iqbal, Muhammad Aamir/AAI-5078-2021; Akhtar, Javaid/D-1046-2016; IQBAL, MA/AFN-2665-2022","Iqbal, Muhammad Aamir/0000-0003-2701-0551; Akhtar, Javaid/0000-0002-9734-7056",Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan,Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan),"The principal author extends a sincere gratitude to Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan for providing financial assistance to complete this study under Indigenous Scholarship (5000-Fellowships).

The new paradigm requires entities to register gains and losses of the biological assets and of the agricultural produce, as a result of the biological transformation and of variation of the price. Recent statistics show that the agribusiness sector represents about 22% of the Brazilian Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Beekeeping is responsible for injecting into the Brazilian economy over 50 million dollars in annual exports of honey. The objective of this research is to present a model for the measurement and disclosure of the biological assets and of the agricultural produce in beekeeping, adopting procedures standardized by the CPC 29 and by the CPC 46, especially regarding the measurement of the bearer biological assets. The multiple cases study was adopted. Three sources of evidence were applied in representative beekeeping businesses in the state of Rondonia. The results confirm the possibility of measuring a bearer biological asset using information about groups of assets and combined assets. Besides the disclosure proposed for the business, the results contribute to the consolidation of the literature on the measurement of biological assets at the fair value.","[da Rocha, Silvia Adriane] Univ Fed Rondonia, UNIR, Campus Vilhena,Ave 02 Rotary Clube,3756, BR-76980000 Vilhena, RO, Brazil; [Oliveira, Deyvison de Lima] Univ Fed Rondonia, UNIR, PPGA UFRGS, Campus Vilhena,Ave 02 Rotary Clube,3756, BR-76980000 Vilhena, RO, Brazil; [Loose, Cleberson Eller] Univ Fed Rondonia, UNIR, FEAD MG, Campus Cacoal,Rua Univ,920, BR-78975155 Cacoal, RO, Brazil; [Porto, Wellington Silva] Univ Fed Rondonia, UNIR, UFSC, Campus Vilhena,Ave 02 Rotary Clube,3756, BR-76980000 Vilhena, RO, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Rondonia; Universidade Federal de Rondonia; Faculdade de Estudos Administrativos de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Rondonia; Universidade Federal de Rondonia; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),"da Rocha, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rondonia, UNIR, Campus Vilhena,Ave 02 Rotary Clube,3756, BR-76980000 Vilhena, RO, Brazil.",silviarochab@hotmail.com; deyvilima@gmail.com; clebersonloose@unir.br; wsporto2009@gmail.com,"Lima Oliveira, Deyvison de/P-9889-2016","Lima Oliveira, Deyvison de/0000-0001-6984-6520",,,,,27,3,3,0,30,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2016,12,3,,,,,273,302,,,,,,30,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,EG3JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390939100016,0

It is valued as food mainly because it is rich in alpha and beta carotene. There are a few studies on the economics of carrot production. Konya is the most important carrot production area and takes the first position in ranking in Turkey. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine production cost and profitability of carrot production in Konya province, Turkey. The data was obtained from 73 carrot farm enterprises with the help of a well-structured questionnaire. The survey applied to selected enterprises randomly. Data covered the 2011 production season. The average production cost of carrot was US$ 0.150 per kg, the sales price was US$ 0.201 per kg and profit margin was US$ 0.051 per kg in carrot producer enterprises. Relative profit was calculated as 1.34. Gross profit and absolute profit for enterprises were determined US$ 7838.62 and US$ 4249.46 per hectare respectively. According to the Tobit model results; such variables as groups of carrots cultivated area, yield, taking precautions in pesticide used, pesticide dose, marketing, household size were found to have a significant effect on profitability of carrot farms.","[Acar, Musa] Sirnak Univ, Cizre Vocat Sch, Agr Econ, Cizre, Sirnak, Turkey; [Gul, Mevlut] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, Agr Econ, TR-32260 Isparta, Turkey",Sirnak University; Suleyman Demirel University,"Acar, M (通讯作者)，Sirnak Univ, Cizre Vocat Sch, Agr Econ, Cizre, Sirnak, Turkey.",musa.acar@outlook.com; mevlutgul@sdu.edu.tr,"Gül, Mevlüt/J-1711-2014","Gül, Mevlüt/0000-0002-0147-7228",Suleyman Demirel University Scientific Research and Projects Coordination Unit [SDU BAP 3148-YL-12],Suleyman Demirel University Scientific Research and Projects Coordination Unit,We would like to thank Suleyman Demirel University Scientific Research and Projects Coordination Unit (Project number: SDU BAP 3148-YL-12) for their financial support to this project.,,19,1,2,0,6,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT LETRAS CIENCIAS HUMANAS",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JAN-MAR,2016,12,1,,,,,73,88,,,,,,16,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,DV6PF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383058200006,0

In this context, the present study aimed to compare the variable production costs of pork producers among Brazilian states during the period 2006-2013. Therefore, through documentary research, the sample was composed by eight Brazilian states composing the estimates of CIAS / EMBRAPA / CONAB, in compliance with the pork production system, called full cycle. Our data were treated statistically, thus, the results of these tests showed that the average variable costs of production of swine obtained from eight Brazilian states flesh can be compared only to the sample studied; that at least one of the medians found between the eight Brazilian producing states can be considered statistically different; and that during the selected period, there was also statistical difference between the variable costs of production of pork.","[Pontes, Gleison de Abreu; Araujo, Tamires Sousa; Tavares, Marcelo] Univ Fed Uberlandia, FACIC, Ciencias Contabeis, Av Joao Naves Avila 2121,Bloco F,Sala 1F215, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Uberlandia,"Pontes, GD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Uberlandia, FACIC, Ciencias Contabeis, Av Joao Naves Avila 2121,Bloco F,Sala 1F215, BR-38400902 Uberlandia, MG, Brazil.",gleison.orientador@gmail.com; tamiresousa124@hotmail.com; mtavares@ufu.br,"Pontes, Gleison GAP/E-3955-2019",,,,,,32,2,2,1,4,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,OCT-DEC,2015,11,4,,,,,70,92,,,,,,23,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,DM6GF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376447900004,0

As exports of cocoa and cocoa products went from 6% to over 60% of domestic production, a dominant share now consists of unprocessed beans rather than cocoa butter or cocoa powder commonly sold in the past. The growth of cocoa exports was accompanied by the emergence of a noteworthy array of different business enterprises, modified and new, corporate and cooperative. In light of these developments, this paper presents an exploratory assessment of the factors influencing the costs and competitiveness of the major competitors in the value chain for Peru's cocoa before identifying opportunities and risks influencing future scenarios for the cocoa sector going forward.

To determine the effect of changes in seed prices on optimum plan, variable price programming method was performed. The results of the study revealed that economic performances of large-scale farms are better than that of small-scale farms. Supply of wheat seed was inelastic in both groups. In the research area, supply elasticities of small and large-scale farms were 0.78 and 0.02, respectively.

The part of the society, which is engaged in agricultural production sectors, is supported with different kinds of instruments and on different levels according to their unique agricultural conditions. World Trade Organisation regulates the supporting of agriculture with some rules. The countries that violate these rules are exposed to different sanctions. In parallel with the developments in the supporting of agriculture, there is effort for liberalisation of this support from production in Turkey. In 2012, Producer Support Estimate, used as an indication of the agricultural support among OECD countries, has been carried out 7% in the United States, 19.4% in EU, 11.6% OECD-wide and 22% in Turkey. Whereas only 2% of the 2015 budget of Turkey has been reserved for agricultural supports, this share constituted 42% of the EU budget in 2013. In the USA, however, the amount reserved for the agricultural supports was above 100 billion USD. In Turkey, the amount reserved for the agricultural supports in Turkey in 2015 is US$3.7 billion. Yet, the share for agricultural supports according to Agriculture Act accepted in 2006 was needed to be at least US$7.2 billion. In the present study, it is confirmed that agricultural support amount per enterprise in Turkey is 4.3 times lesser than EU average. Agricultural supports do have product cost reducing and producer revenue increasing effect. In Turkey, the wheat crop's share in total supports in 2013 is 23.58% and the sunflower crop's share is 34.21%. The supports provided an increase of 7.58% in wheat producers' revenue and an increase of 20.83% in sunflower producers' revenue. In order to secure the food offer and quality, to ensure an increase in the producer's welfare and help consumers to obtain food for reasonable prices, it is inevitable that the applied agricultural support policies should be long termed, based on planning, suitable for World Trade Organisation's rules and compatible with the EU Partner Agriculture Policy. In this context, reserving sufficient budget for agricultural support practices, determining the agricultural support unit prices more realistically without effecting the market prices and production level will play a significant role in making agriculture sector open to competition with other nations as well as reducing crop costs, in other words increasing the producers' revenues.","[Semerci, Arif] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Econ, POB 31034, Antakya, Hatay, Turkey",Mustafa Kemal University,"Semerci, A (通讯作者)，Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Econ, POB 31034, Antakya, Hatay, Turkey.",arifsemerci69@gmail.com,"Semerci, Arif/HTL-3968-2023","Semerci, Arif/0000-0003-0893-3748",,,,,38,3,3,0,10,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2016,12,3,,,,,71,96,,,,,,26,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,EG3JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390939100006,0

Decomposition results of Malmquist index indicated that the average productivity (MALM) decreased over the entire period and the major source of decline was technical change. Technical efficiency changes had little contribution to Chinese rice productivity growth. At the regional level, almost all provinces had negative average growth rates in total productivity and technical change during the 2003-2013 periods. Influence of the new farm subsidies on rice farms' efficiency is not significant. The deterioration in technical change in all provinces indicates that China has great potential to increase its productivity through technical progress. Increasing expenditure on agricultural R&D and education, raise the literacy rate among the rural population, targeting grain subsidies to liquidity-constrained households, improve and upgrade the technology promotion system may help farmers to improve efficiency and productivity in rice production.","[Zhang, Pingyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Human Geog, 4888 Shengbei St, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shiwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Agr Econ, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China; [He, Xiuli] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Agr Econ, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zheye] Kent State Univ, Dept Geog, Agr Econ, Kent, OH 44240 USA; [Tan, Juntao] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Agr Dev, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS","Zhang, PY (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Human Geog, 4888 Shengbei St, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China.",liushiwei@iga.ac.cn; zhangpy@iga.ac.cn; hexiuli@iga.ac.cn; zwang31@kent.edu; tanjuntaocf@163.com,"liu, shiwei/HRC-8862-2023; He, Xiuli/JDC-8615-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71541021, 41571152, 41301111, 41201159]; Special Research Institute; Science and Technology Association Decision-making Advisory Project of Jilin Province [KX2015002]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Research Institute; Science and Technology Association Decision-making Advisory Project of Jilin Province,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71541021, 41571152, 41301111, and 41201159); One-Three-Five Planning Project and Services Project of Special Research Institute (Comprehensive evaluation and spatial pattern optimization of agricultural ecological environment in Northeast China); Science and Technology Association Decision-making Advisory Project of Jilin Province (KX2015002).

As a new tool, weather derivatives have the potential to support farmers against weather induced risks more efficiently than traditional insurance. Nevertheless the market for weather derivatives is still relatively limited. The objective of this analysis is to quantify the risk reducing effect that can be achieved by using weather derivatives in crop production. For this reason a crop farm in Serbia served as an example to determine the risk reducing effect in wheat and corn production, as they are the most important crops in Serbia with grate export potential. The paper applies stochastic simulation and value-at-risk methods. In the paper are presented fair premiums and payoffs of put options in wheat and corn production, as well as revenue distributions with and without weather derivatives. It was found that the risk reduction was more significant in wheat production (21.88%) than in corn production (18.13%). Therefore, in case of Serbia weather derivatives would be more useful in wheat production.","[Ivanovic, Sanjin] Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Nemanjina 6, Belgrade, Serbia; [Markovic, Todor; Husemann, Christoph; Zekic, Vladislav] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Novi Sad, Serbia",University of Belgrade; University of Novi Sad,"Ivanovic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Nemanjina 6, Belgrade, Serbia.",todor.markovic@polj.edu.rs; christoph.husemann@yahoo.de; sanjinivanovic@agrif.bg.ac.rs; zekic@polj.uns.ac.rs,"Markovic, Todor Djordje/GYQ-6142-2022",,"Ministry for Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia [III-46006, TR-31051]",Ministry for Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia,"This study is result of the project III-46006 titled Sustainable agriculture and rural development in order to achieve strategic goals Republic of Serbia in the Danube region and project TR-31051 named Improvement of biotechnological procedures as a function of rational utilization of energy, agricultural products productivity and quality increase subsidized by the Ministry for Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia.",,17,1,1,2,15,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT LETRAS CIENCIAS HUMANAS",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,OCT-DEC,2015,11,4,,,,,189,202,,,,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,DM6GF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376447900010,0

The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design with factorial arrangement having a net plot size 3 m x 5 m with three replications. The soil contained 0.65% organic matter, 7.3 ppm available P, 197 ppm available K and 0.08 total N. Nitrogen at the rate of 25 kg per hectare and 0, 30, 60 & 90 kg/ha of phosphorus were used as diammonium phosphate (DAP), single super phosphate (SSP) and triple super phosphate (TSP) respectively. Findings of this study revealed that maximum number of plant height at maturity (71.80 cm), branches having pods (4.44), total pods of a single plant (9.58), 1000-grain weight (67.54 g), seed yield (1288.62kg per hectare), biological production (5504.2 kg per hectare), harvest index(23.22%) and protein content (21.07%) were attained by the fertilization of phosphorus 60 kg per hectare. Maximum fertilizer use efficiency (7.30) was achieved by the fertilization of 30 kg phosphorus per hectare in the form of DAP, SSP and TSP. P1 rates had non-considerable effect on plants in a plot and total seeds in a single pod. The outcome shows that various sources of phosphorous had no-prenominal effect on all the parameters under study. Interaction between P rates and various sources was also observed statistically non-considerable. The highest net income was obtained when phosphorus was applied at the rate of 60 kg per hectare.","[Tahir, Muhammad; Bin Khalid, Usama] Univ Agr, Fac Agr, Dept Agron, Faislabad, Pakistan; [Waseem, Muhammad] Lasbela Univ Agr Water & Marine Sci, Uthal, Pakistan",Lasbela University of Agricultural Water & Marine Science,"Tahir, M (通讯作者)，Univ Agr, Fac Agr, Dept Agron, Faislabad, Pakistan.",tahirfsd@yahoo.com; usamabk@yahoo.com; mianwaseem_1028@yahoo.com,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,5,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT LETRAS CIENCIAS HUMANAS",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JAN-MAR,2015,11,1,,,,,23,34,,,,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,CR0LU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361011000003,0

The objective of the model is global cost minimization of alternative routes to export the Brazilian soybean. Three scenarios were proposed ranging the capacity of the intermediate ports. Without restricting ports capacity, the scenario with best results presented a reduction in annual operating costs of US$ 236 million and US$ 926 million dollars respectively when compared to the other scenarios, reinforcing the need to export soybeans using ports of northern Brazil to increase the country competitiveness. In other scenarios, it was confirmed the current saturation of southern and southeastern Brazilian ports.","[Lopes, Harlenn dos Santos; Lima, Renato da Silva; Ferreira, Rafael Costa] Fed Univ Itajuba UNIFEI, Ind Engn & Management Inst, IEPG, Ave BPS 1303 Pinheirinho, BR-37500903 Itajuba, MG, Brazil",,"Lopes, HD (通讯作者)，Fed Univ Itajuba UNIFEI, Ind Engn & Management Inst, IEPG, Ave BPS 1303 Pinheirinho, BR-37500903 Itajuba, MG, Brazil.",harlenn@ufpa.br; rslima@unifei.edu.br; rafaelunifei87@yahoo.com,"Lima, Renato da Silva/I-3262-2012","Lima, Renato da Silva/0000-0002-5824-6607",Brazilian agency FAPEMIG (Foundation for the Promotion of Science of the State of Minas Gerais); Brazilian agency CNPq (Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development),Brazilian agency FAPEMIG (Foundation for the Promotion of Science of the State of Minas Gerais); Brazilian agency CNPq (Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development),The authors would like to acknowledge the Brazilian agencies FAPEMIG (Foundation for the Promotion of Science of the State of Minas Gerais) and CNPq (Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) for the financial support provided to this research.,,25,3,4,1,14,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,OCT-DEC,2016,12,4,,,,,90,109,,,,,,20,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,EG3JR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390940400006,0

The main finding of this study is that the firm size and intellectual capital play a crucial role in firm's success, measured by return on assets. We use data from financial sheets in order to measure human and intellectual capital of enterprises in question. The analysis indicates that with transformation of small into medium type enterprises, the returns on total assets would grow by an average of three per cent. On the other hand, large enterprises are threatened with significant risk of inflation. The regression coefficient of integrated impact of inflation and the size of enterprise is significantly negative. At a constant inflation, increasing the enterprise size leads to the decreasing of returns of over 4%. This result of analysis indicates the importance of good macroeconomic management in terms of reducing inflation and attempts to maintain it on the lowest possible level.","[Sofija, Adzic; Stojic, Dragan] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Sofija, A (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica, Serbia.",sadzic@ef.uns.ac.rs; stojicd@ef.uns.ac.rs,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,6,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT LETRAS CIENCIAS HUMANAS",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR-JUN,2015,11,2,,,,,248,261,,,,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,DB4UF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000368508400014,0

The global warming, if not global burning, is a dire warning about environmental pollution dangers to everyone, living on the Earth. In this field, Iran is a good candidate due to its significantly high share of CO2 emissions in proportion to the low share of economic growth in the world which can be remedied by economic growth, based on Environmental Kuznets Hypothesis (EKH). We employ the Auto-Regressive Distributed Model (ARDL) to examine the long run equilibrium relationship between CO2 emission and economic growth. The results show that, regarding EKC, the nexus of CO2 emissions and economic growth in either sector is in a sharply ascending phase. It implies that if manufacturing (and mining) and services sectors inflate, the quality of environment will decline owing to the intensive and pollutant energy-using structures. Thus, rather than growing, they should be reconstructed by importing cleaner and more efficient technologies and developing internal inventions.","[Taghvaee, Vahid Mohamad; Parsa, Hojat] Persian Gulf Univ, Dept Econ, Bushehr, Iran",Persian Gulf University,"Taghvaee, VM (通讯作者)，Persian Gulf Univ, Dept Econ, Bushehr, Iran.",vahidestan@yahoo.com; hojat_parsa@yahoo.com,"Taghvaee, Vahid/M-8481-2015; Parsa, Hojat/G-8879-2018","Taghvaee, Vahid/0000-0003-3186-6985; Parsa, Hojat/0000-0002-9308-114X",,,,,27,14,14,0,17,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT LETRAS CIENCIAS HUMANAS",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JAN-MAR,2015,11,1,,,,,115,127,,,,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,CR0LU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361011000008,0

The main purpose of this study is to examine the economics production of cocoa in Eastern Region. Eastern Region (East Akim, Aboakwa North, New Juaben, Suhum Kraboa Coatal and Akwapim North districts) being the study area was particularly chosen for this study because of its prime place in cocoa production in Ghana. Data used for the study were collected from 80 cocoa farmers using a well-structured questionnaire for the 2013-2014 farming season. Descriptive statistics, farm budget analysis, profitability and ordinary least square regression were the major analytical tools employed for the study. Results of the analysis showed that the average production cost of cocoa was GHC 1.34 per kg and profit margin was GHC1.80 per kg in cocoa producer enterprises. The gross margin and net profit were calculated as GHC 956.78 and GHC 621.24 per hectare respectively. Relative profit was calculated as 1.49 which indicates that cocoa production in the study area is profitable. Farm size, farmer's age, farming experience and other cost less labour cost were identified as the significant factors affecting the output of cocoa production in the study area. The price of the cocoa is the most pressing problem the cocoa farmer faced. The study therefore recommends that cocoa farmers should be provided with credit facilities from formal credit institutions at affordable interest rates in order to boost cocoa production in the country and government through the Ministry of Food and Agriculture should establish large scale of cocoa farm to employ the youth in order to ease the unemployment rate which is a big problem in the country.","[Yahaya, Awwal Mohammed; Karli, Bahri; Gul, Mevlut] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, TR-32260 Isparta, Turkey",Suleyman Demirel University,"Yahaya, AM (通讯作者)，Suleyman Demirel Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, TR-32260 Isparta, Turkey.",awallawal44@gmail.com; bahrikarli@sdu.edu.tr; mevlutgul@sdu.edu.tr,"KARLI, Bahri/V-7923-2017; Gül, Mevlüt/J-1711-2014","Gül, Mevlüt/0000-0002-0147-7228",,,,,14,9,10,0,37,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT LETRAS CIENCIAS HUMANAS",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JAN-MAR,2015,11,1,,,,,336,352,,,,,,17,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,CR0LU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361011000019,0

The results show that the adoption of CPC 29, brought changes in aspects such as the accounting treatment, changes in form of classification of some items of inventory and fixed assets and use of new ledger accounts as biological assets and change in fair value of biological assets. The results also show that fair crop of cane sugar value was determined with the method of discounted cash flow.

To conduct the survey were investigated 21 companies of five sectors (agriculture, sugar and alcohol, meat, paper and wood) for 4 years (2010-2013). As the basis of inferences, we used non-parametric test of paired sample Wilcoxon on profit data with and without the effect of the change in fair value of biological assets. In addition, an analysis was made on the assumptions that companies used. The results show that the positive and negative effects of changes in the fair value of biological assets on the outcome of the analyzed companies were significant (for almost all sectors) both at initial recognition as in subsequent years. In relation to the disclosure, it was found that most companies assessed used the discounted cash flow model as a measure of these assets, this shows greater subjectivity of such a measure. This greater subjectivity can increase the relevance of financial information to investors but also increases the volatility of the results which can result in increased funding costs for the analyzed companies.","[da Silva, Francisco Narciso; Silva do Carmo, Carlos Henrique] Univ Fed Goias, Estr Campus,S-N Campus Univ, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Ribeiro, Alex Mussoi] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Goias; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),"da Silva, FN (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Goias, Estr Campus,S-N Campus Univ, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil.",franciscolippe@yahoo.com.br; amr@usp.br; chscarmo@uol.com.br,"Carmo, Carlos Henrique Silva do/JZS-9150-2024","Carmo, Carlos Henrique Silva do/0000-0002-9397-8678",,,,,33,3,3,0,21,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,OCT-DEC,2015,11,4,,,,,290,323,,,,,,34,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,DM6GF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376447900014,0

To achieve this goal, we used descriptive research with a qualitative approach and a bibliometric methodology. We obtained a sample of 332 articles through electronic search in the annals of the Congress that address the subject in question. The results obtained indicate that the thematic area with the greatest reception of works is cost management in agribusiness. There was a gradual increase in the number of publications over the course of the 20 years investigated. Regarding the methodological procedures of the researchers analyzed, most of them presented the case study method, i.e. they are empirical research.

DEA approach is appropriate to estimate the efficiency but the result is ambiguous due to lack of information about estimates' uncertainty. The present study overcomes this drawback by applying bootstrapping procedure to DEA. The data is collected from 160 farm household spread across the six southern provinces of China during 2014. The result revealed that the mean technical efficiency is 0.804 in study area which suggest that farm households are potential for producing 80% of litchi. The scale efficiency score imply that a majority of litchi farmers are operating with decreasing returns to scale. We also examine farmer's characteristics with respect to input use under various returns to scale. The bootstrap procedure corrected bias in technical efficiency scores from a mean of 0.804 to 0.66.

Specifically, it considers the prices, government expenditure in the coffee industry, partners' participation and their organisation, and the performance of the coffee industry. We use data collected from several bureaus, institutions, libraries, and field surveys done with the main parties involved in the Mexican coffee sector. Data coming from the national coffee census updated in 2008 was used to figure out some characteristics of the coffee supply chain. The overall results indicate that the main causes for the structural changes have been the adjustment in the Mexican economic policy and the alignment to international agreements in coffee.

Chilean literature is scarce in the application of CAPM in forest assets. In this study, the ex-post revenue of a P. radiata plantation during the period 1995-2011 by a non-industrial owner was analyzed by means of the CAPM model. The stumpage price was considered as an asset, the Selective Stock Price Index (IPSA) as the market rate of return and the monetary policy rate by the Chilean Central Bank ass risk-free. It was found that the annual yield of the investment reached 18.67 %, which reflects the estimated cost of capital opportunity for this crop in this specific site.

This was achieved through the estimation of capital inputs and operational costs for each unit of water (cubic meter M3) used to produce dates. Also, the production function for dates was estimated to measure water economic efficiency in dates' production. This study used data collected from a random sample of date palm farmers in Riyadh Region in 2015. Results showed that: (1) The cost of extracting groundwater increases as the depth of drilling for wells increases. Using a 15% discount value, the cost of extracting groundwater increased from 0.436 Saudi Riyals (SR)/M-3 for 100 meters deep wells to 0.658 SR/M-3 for 200+ meters deep wells. (2) a 10% change in irrigation water, labor, and fertilizers results in a positive change in dates production of 4.8%, 0.8%, and 0.4%, respectively. (3) Marginal return for irrigation water used for dates production was estimated to be 699 SR/1000 M-3. (4) The use of groundwater was economically efficient because the value of marginal product of water (VMP) was greater than its marginal cost (MC) of extraction. (5) Given the scarcity of water in Saudi Arabia, this study stresses the need to include the  economic value of irrigation water of date palms in order to conserve water.","[Nashwan, Othman S.; Al-Qunaibet, Mohammad H.; Ghanem, Adel M.] King Saud Univ, Coll Food & Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia",King Saud University,"Ghanem, AM (通讯作者)，King Saud Univ, Coll Food & Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.",aghanem@ksu.edu.sa,,,,,,,7,4,4,0,4,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT LETRAS CIENCIAS HUMANAS",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JAN-MAR,2016,12,1,,,,,282,289,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,DV6PF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383058200016,0

Results show technical feasibility, obtaining 190 liters of hydrous ethanol from 1,000 kg of sweet potato. Processing cost amounts R$ 0.96 (US 0.46) per liter. From this value, 35.4% is the raw material contribution and 64.6% is dueto processing cost. ABC cost was applied and the main expenditure element was manpower (37%) and the main activity cost was distillation (35%).","[Taborda, Loana Wollmann] Univ Fed Santa Maria, BR-98910000 Tres De Maio, RS, Brazil; [Jahn, Sergio Luiz; Santos Evangelista, Mario Luiz] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Programa Posgrad Engn Prod, BR-97105900 Santa Maria, RS, Brazil; [Lovato, Adalberto] Soc Educ Tres de Maio, BR-98910000 Tres De Maio, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM); Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM),"Taborda, LW (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Santa Maria, Ave Santa Rosa 2405, BR-98910000 Tres De Maio, RS, Brazil.",loanataborda@yahoo.com.br; jahn@smail.ufsm.br; proflovato@terra.com.br; mario.santos.evangelista@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,5,5,0,14,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JAN-MAR,2015,11,1,,,,,245,262,,,,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,CR0LU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361011000015,0

In the study, production cost is determined by calculating the production expenses and the revenue gained by this production. Also, technical efficiency scores of the enterprises are estimated by using Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methods. As a result of the calculations, sunflower production cost is determined as 585,36 USD tonnes-1, and the revenue from the production (except for the supports) is determined as 560,00 USD tonnes-1. Also, technical efficiency scores are estimated with SFA as 0,87 and with DEA-VRS as 0,83.

A multiple regression analysis was applied to the quantitative data as a statistical method in order to identify the relationship between the variables in question. The results show that petroleum and cotton price variations explain but 3.2% of the change in cost behavior. In order to obtain more substantial results, the initial findings underwent factor analysis, which yielded evidence that just 4.9% of the variation in petroleum and cotton prices bears an influence on cost behavior in the companies in question. Hence, a weak relationship between the variables in question was shown.

The study was conducted at Fruit Research Institute in Egirdir district of the Isparta province, Turkey. Results showed that cultivation cost per decare and nursery tree via conventional methods was lower than the cost through organic production. A comparison between various applications of organic apple nursery tree cultivation showed that SOF (solid organic fertilizer) farming practice yielded lowest cultivation cost. In terms of net profit, conventional cultivation brought along higher net profit per decare and nursery tree. A comparison within various applications of organic cultivation indicated that SOF (solid organic fertilizer) + LOF (liquid organic fertilizer) was the most advantageous practice. Nursery trees, which were cultivated via conventional method, were more advantageous in Turkey, since they are sold at the same price with organic apple nursery trees. This fact was due to lack of an organic apple nursery tree market in Turkey. Therefore, it is very important to support organic cultivation of apple nursery tree for environment and human health; besides, apple cultivators should be encouraged for using organic nursery trees by means of appropriate training and informing activities. Most probably, organic cultivation will become more preferable than conventional method in case cultivators are supported in this respect.","[Demircan, Vecdi] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Inst, Agr Econ, Isparta, Turkey; [Atasay, Adem] Fruit Res Inst, Inst, Hort Sci, Egirdir Isparta, Turkey; [Atasay, Adem; Isci, Mesut; Altindal, Mesut] Fruit Res Inst, TR-32500 Egirdir Isparta, Turkey; [Ekinci, Kamil] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Inst, Agr Machinery & Technol Engn, Isparta, Turkey; [Ekinci, Kamil] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Machinery & Technol Engn, TR-32260 Isparta, Turkey; [Isci, Mesut] Fruit Res Inst, Inst, Plant Protect, Egirdir Isparta, Turkey; [Altindal, Mesut] Fruit Res Inst, Inst, Soil Sci, Egirdir Isparta, Turkey",Suleyman Demirel University; Suleyman Demirel University; Suleyman Demirel University,"Demircan, V (通讯作者)，Suleyman Demirel Univ, Inst, Agr Econ, Isparta, Turkey.;Demircan, V (通讯作者)，Suleyman Demirel Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Agr, TR-32260 Isparta, Turkey.",vecdidemircan@sdu.edu.tr; atasay15@yahoo.com; kamil_ekinci@yahoo.com; mesutisci@gmail.com; m_altindal_15@hotmail.com,"Ekinci, Kamil/AAQ-4258-2021","Ekinci, Kamil/0000-0002-7083-5199",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) [KAMAG-111G055],Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),The authors thank to the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) for supporting the research project KAMAG-111G055 under which this work was financed.,,10,3,3,0,22,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2016,12,3,,,,,180,192,,,,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,EG3JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390939100011,0

Results of Cobb-Douglas production function analysis reveal that concentrate feed statistically affect the milk production of milk producers being member to the Eregli Milk Producers Union on a significant level. It is defined that the coarse feed and concentrate forage affected the milk production in non-member milk producers. Even though the technical efficiency is in good level in the research area, it is not in the desired level. Technical efficiency was analyzed using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. While the technical efficiency of union member dairy farming enterprises is 0,83, for nonmember enterprises is 0,86. Organization of Eregli milk producers, carrying out technical training and publications and increasing quality coarse feed production in the enterprises will contribute to the development of milk production activities.","[Oguz, Cennet] Selcuk Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Agr Econ, POB 42075, Konya, Turkey; [Canan, Selime] On Dokuz Mayis Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Agr Econ, Samsun, Turkey",Selcuk University; Ondokuz Mayis University,"Oguz, C (通讯作者)，Selcuk Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Agr Econ, POB 42075, Konya, Turkey.",coguz@selcuk.edu.tr; selimekaya_@hotmail.com,"OGUZ, Cennet/ADY-2531-2022; canan, selime/AAA-7946-2022","OGUZ, Cennet/0000-0001-7846-4866;",,,,,43,11,11,2,23,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2016,12,3,,,,,121,136,,,,,,16,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,EG3JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390939100008,0

The main purpose of this study is to analyze the comparison between cost leadership and differentiation strategies and its relationship with competitive advantage. A quantitative method was used to analyze the current study, a total of 1400 questionnaires were distributed in different frozen chicken companies across Iraq, however 993 questionnaires were filled out by the participants. The researcher developed two main research hypotheses; The first research hypothesis assesses the positive relationship between cost leadership strategy and competitive advantage in agricultural businesses in Iraq, the second research hypothesis assesses whether or not there is a positive relationship between differentiation strategy and competitive advantage in agricultural businesses in Iraq. The result of multiple regression analysis reveals that the value of Beta for cost leadership strategy is .0731<.001 which indicates that the cost leadership strategy will have a direct positive association with competitive advantage, the value of Beta for differentiation strategy is 0.120<.001 this indicates that differentiation strategy will have a positive association with competitive advantage. The researcher came to conclude that the highest value was for cost leadership strategy, the result demonstrated the importance of promotions and discounts in selling frozen chickens. The limitations of this study are sampling method and sample sizes used are the main limitations of this research. Findings of this study suggest the consequences could be indicative of broader perceptions.","[Anwar, Kofand] Cyprus Int Univ, Business Adm Inst, Nicosia, Cyprus",Cyprus International University,"Anwar, K (通讯作者)，Cyprus Int Univ, Business Adm Inst, Nicosia, Cyprus.",kofand_anwar@hotmail.com,,,,,,,42,1,2,0,23,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR-JUN,2016,12,2,,,,,212,231,,,,,,20,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,EG3IX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390938400012,0

This study aimed to identify the relationship between contingent influences and the unit cost of swine production of the full cycle in the state of Santa Catarina (SC). For this quantitative research was developed using the statistical program Eviews (R). Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, correlation and regression analysis with panel data. We analyzed the impact of contingent external variables in the unit cost of live pigs: price of corn, soy, dollar, value of the minimum wage and Selic rate for the period 2009-2012. It was found that external influences have significance in the model, which confirms the considerations made by EMBRAPA (2013) on the costs in pigs. As a result it was found that the cost of live pigs receives significantly influence the price of corn, soybeans and dollar and it is suggested that the swine producer full cycle can be an indicator of trends in the cost of live pigs that are future price trends corn and soybean.","[Toigo, Leandro Augusto; Wrubel, Franciele; Hein, Nelson] Fundacao Univ Reg Blumenau, BR-89012900 Blumenau, SC, Brazil",Universidade Regional de Blumenau (FURB),"Toigo, LA (通讯作者)，Fundacao Univ Reg Blumenau, Rua Antonio da Veiga 140, BR-89012900 Blumenau, SC, Brazil.",leandrotoigo@yahoo.com.br; franciele_wrubel@yahoo.com.br; hein@furb.br,"Hein, Nelson/AAH-2128-2019","Hein, Nelson/0000-0002-8350-9480",,,,,63,0,0,1,7,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JAN-MAR,2015,11,1,,,,,198,221,,,,,,24,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,CR0LU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361011000013,0

In this essay, the concept of Target Costing is explored as a managerial accounting artifact as its various definitions, distinctiveness and applicability as an organizational and managerial process are discussed. Then, it is argued how it should contribute to building competitive advantage in an uncertain and increasing competitive environment, specifically but not restricted to the agribusiness industry. It is concluded that Target Costing should be of great importance in aiding the development and marketing of innovative food products by small agribusinesses.","[Lima, Afonso Carneiro] Univ Fortaleza, USP, FEA, Adm Empresas, Ave Washington Soares 1321,Sala P17, BR-60811905 Fortaleza, CE, Brazil; [Giesbrecht da Silveira, Jose Augusto] Univ Sao Paulo, FGV SP, Av Prof Luciano Gualberto,908 Edificio FEA1, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Giesbrecht da Silveira, Jose Augusto] Ctr Uni FEI, FGV SP, Av Prof Luciano Gualberto,908 Edificio FEA1, BR-05508900 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Ferro da Silva, Samayk Henrique] Univ Estado Santa Catarina, Adm Empresas, Ave Madre Benvenuta 1585-1586 Ao Fim, BR-88035001 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Ching, Hong Yuh] Univ Estadual Campinas, Ctr Univ FEI, Av Humberto Castelo Branco,3972 Sao Bernardo Camp, BR-09850901 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Fortaleza; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Getulio Vargas Foundation; Getulio Vargas Foundation; Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina; Centro Universitario da FEI; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Lima, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Fortaleza, USP, FEA, Adm Empresas, Ave Washington Soares 1321,Sala P17, BR-60811905 Fortaleza, CE, Brazil.",afonsolima@unifor.br; jags@usp.br; samaykferro@hotmail.com; hongching@fei.edu.br,"Lima, Afonso Carneiro/A-3795-2017; CHING, HONG YUH/D-1792-2013","CHING, HONG YUH/0000-0002-3155-7261",,,,,30,3,4,0,28,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2016,12,3,,,,,11,25,,,,,,15,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,EG3JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390939100003,0

Our findings illustrate that profitability; growth opportunity and volatility are negatively and statistically significant with the debt issues on the balance sheet of these public traded firms. We discuss the extent to which these results are consistent with empirical evidence illustrated by prior studies with reference to the 2008 financial crisis. Also, during the 2008 financial crisis the cost of financial distress is high, and as such when size is used as a proxy for the probability of bankruptcy a negatively relationship is inevitable.

Through a case study of Spanish organic olive oil producers in 2012, it examines the relationship between efficiency and internationalisation or e-business, together with aspects such as the age of the company, the quality of its website and its social networking presence. The results confirm a direct association between efficiency and e-business or exports in organic producers with an Internet presence. They also find a positive association between efficiency and young companies.

Community, national and regional policies were designed to change the management of these operations, thus affecting both the number of farms and their size. Current legislation addresses multiple aspects of livestock activity, with the control and prevention of pollution primarily in the pig sector. Livestock production of the Valencian Community in Spain is characterized by family farms with high industrialization, and independent of the land factor. The aim of the paper is to analyse the level of efficiency of livestock farms in the CV, from building of representative inputs of existing provisions in the farm. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used for the accomplishment of this study.

So, in this study GARCH and BEKK methods have been applied to weekly data of beef, mutton and chicken price since 3/2011 to 3/2013 to investigate price fluctuation and volatility spillover. Main results showed that mutton price in comparison to beef and chicken price showed a higher fluctuation because of production structure. Moreover, results showed a mutual relationship between volatility in beef and mutton price. So, government policies for sustainable meat supply such as improvement in accessibility of producers to cheaper and sufficient inputs, exchange market management, producer subsidies, buffer stock programs and price supports are recommended to policymakers.","[Fakari, Behzad; Aliabadi, Mohammad Mehdi Farsi] Univ Mashhad Endereco, Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad Inst, Natl Water & Agr Srateg Res Ctr NWASRC, Dept Agr Econ Mashhad Iran & Res, Mashhad, Iran; [Mahmoudi, Hashem] Tabriz Univ, Inst Tabriz Univ Endereco, Dept Agr Econ, Tabriz, Iran; [Kojori, Moustafa] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Dept Agr Econ, Mashhad, Iran",University of Tabriz; Ferdowsi University Mashhad,"Aliabadi, MMF (通讯作者)，Univ Mashhad Endereco, Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad Inst, Natl Water & Agr Srateg Res Ctr NWASRC, Dept Agr Econ Mashhad Iran & Res, Mashhad, Iran.",Mm_farsi22@yahoo.com,"aliabadi, mohammad mehdi farsi/R-2996-2019",,,,,,28,8,8,0,7,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR-JUN,2016,12,2,,,,,84,98,,,,,,15,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,EG3IX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390938400005,0

To Develop the study, the data used corresponded to the 2009/10 crop year. The results indicate that there is private profitability in Brazil's region; however, the index of Rates of Subsidies to Producers (RSP) confirms that the agricultural corn production systems in Brazil were net taxed and private profits were reduced, compromising its production and commercialization. Finally, it is concluded that the distorting policies associated to market imperfections directly affected the corn production systems, according to the corn PAM in Brazil. Parallel to this, the literature of the New Institutional Economics explains that the state can act in this context, in order to establish harmony between the market behavior and its agents which are inserted in this setting.","[de Freitas, Joao Batista] Univ Rio Grande do Norte UERN, BR 405,Km 03, BR-59900000 Pau Dos Ferros, RN, Brazil; [Palma Revillion, Jean Philippe] Fed Univ Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Belarmino, Luiz Clovis] Empresa Brasileira Pesquisa Agr EMBRAPA, BR-96001970 Pelotas, RS, Brazil; [de Lucena, Leandro Pessoa] Fed Univ Mato Grosso UFMT, BR-78700000 Rondonopolis, MT, Brazil",Universidade do Estado do Rio Grande do Norte (UERN); Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA); Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul; Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso,"de Freitas, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Rio Grande do Norte UERN, BR 405,Km 03, BR-59900000 Pau Dos Ferros, RN, Brazil.",freitasjb.brasil@gmail.com; jeanppr@gmail.com; luiz.belarmino@embrapa.br; lepecena@hotmail.com,"de Lucena, Leandro Pessoa/J-1482-2014",,National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq),National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),The National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) for the funding.,,37,4,4,1,26,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR-JUN,2015,11,2,,,,,299,320,,,,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,DB4UF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000368508400016,0

Main objective of corn production is high and stabile yield and consequently generating maximum return for the producer. In order to achieve this, an adequate set of agrotechnical measures has to be applied in the production process. Application of optimal quantity of nitrogen is important in order to increase profitability from corn production, and second, to avoid environmental pollution. During period 2005-2007 a research was conducted to determine influence of nitrogen application rate (control -without fertilisation, PKNfon, PKN60, PKN120 and PKN180) and different FAO group hybrids (ZP-SC 434, ZP-SC 578 and ZP-SC 677) on production profitability. Increase of nitrogen fertilizer tended to raise grain yield. In a dry year of 2005, high additional return of 257.04 $/ha was with nitrogen fertilization rate of 120 kg/ha. The highest return in 2006 and 2007, was with moderate nitrogen rate of 60 kg/ha. Despite yield increase, excessive use of nitrogen can result in decrease of gross return due to rise in fertilization costs, which happened in 2007 where use of 180 kg/ha resulted in a loss of 210 $/ha.","[Zivanovic, Ljubisa] Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, Nemanjina St 6, Zemun 11080, Serbia; [Kovacevic, Vlado] Minist Agr & Environm Protect, Nemanjina St 22-26, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Subic, Jonel; Jelocnik, Marko] Inst Agr Econ, Volgina St 15, Belgrade 11060, Serbia; [Zubovic, Jovan] Inst Econ Sci, Zmaj Jovina St 12, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Belgrade; Institute of Economic Sciences,"Zivanovic, L (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Agr, Nemanjina St 6, Zemun 11080, Serbia.",ljuba@agrif.bg.ac.rs; vlado.kovacevic@minpolj.gov.rs; jonel_s@iep.bg.ac.rs; marko_j@iep.bg.ac.rs; jovan.zubovic@ien.bg.ac.rs,"Jelocnik, Marko/AAK-5535-2021; Zubović, Jovan/L-6011-2019; Kovcevic, Vlado/ABA-6353-2020","Jelocnik, Marko/0000-0003-4875-1789; Zubović, Jovan/0000-0002-1717-2066; Subic, Jonel/0000-0003-1342-1325; Kovacevic, Vlado/0000-0002-2902-6496","Ministry of Education, Science and Technical Development of the Republic of Serbia [III 46006, 179001]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technical Development of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)","This paper is part of projects III 46006 and 179001, funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technical Development of the Republic of Serbia.

Although the impacts of technical measures have been widely acknowledged in developed countries, China lags far behind the developed countries at this point. This paper begins with a discussion of potential effects from the technical barrier on developing countries. Specifically, the paper investigates the potential influence of Japan's stricter MRL on exports of vegetables in China. Then, it proposes an econometric-simulation framework which could be used to analyze the impacts of pesticide reduction approaches on vegetable cost and production. The model is based on econometric production regressions estimated with spatially referenced, statistically representative samples of farms in China. The research results indicate that a potential accession to Japan's market with technical barrier would cause great damage to the output and profit of China's vegetable production under certain efficiency and technology in a short term.","[Zhang, Tao] Macao Polytech Inst, Inst Econ, Macau, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tao] Macao Polytech Inst, Sch Publ Adm A109, Macau, Peoples R China",Macao Polytechnic University; Macao Polytechnic University,"Zhang, T (通讯作者)，Macao Polytech Inst, Inst Econ, Macau, Peoples R China.;Zhang, T (通讯作者)，Macao Polytech Inst, Sch Publ Adm A109, Macau, Peoples R China.",taozhang7608@hotmail.com,"ZHANG, TAO/K-3795-2019","ZHANG, TAO/0000-0002-2400-7624",,,,,15,1,1,3,38,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR-JUN,2016,12,2,,,,,232,247,,,,,,16,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,EG3IX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390938400013,0

Due to the importance of cost of equity, this paper determines and examines cost of equity on the basis of CAPM and Downside CAPM model for 8 food industry stocks traded at Belgrade Stock Exchange. Research results show that average cost of equity for food industry stocks in Serbia is 11.3798%. It should be pointed out that systematic risk of examined stocks is relatively low. Rather high cost of equity of food industry stocks mainly comes from country risk premium. Therefore, the best way to reduce cost of equity in Serbia can be found on the country level at which sound macroeconomic policy and further development would lead to reduction of overall risk and country risk premium.","[Momcilovic, Mirela; Begovic, Sanja Vlaovic; Zivkov, Dejan] Higher Sch Profess Business Studies, Novi Sad, Serbia",,"Momcilovic, M (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Profess Business Studies, Vladimira Perica Valtera 4, Novi Sad, Serbia.",bizniscentar@gmail.com; sanjavbegovic@gmail.com; dejozivkov@vps.ns.ac.rs,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,6,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JAN-MAR,2015,11,1,,,,,184,197,,,,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,CR0LU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361011000012,0

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine production cost and technical efficiency levels of farms that grow tomato in open fields. Experimental data were obtained from 50 randomly selected tomato producers. Results showed that unit production cost of tomato was $0.17 kg(-1) and labor costs had the highest share of total cost. For the estimation of farm level technical efficiency coefficients, Stochastic Frontier Analysis method was used. Technical efficiency coefficients of tomato producing farms varied from 0.35 to 1.00, and the mean was 0.57. Results of Stochastic Frontier Analysis model showed that input use in tomato production could be lowered by 43%. It was found that inefficiencies of farms were mostly due to preventable technical factors rather than due to random causes. Farms could work at full efficiency by lowering their input use as well as by controlling off farm factors. The study suggested that technical training for tomato growing and extension programs would be useful to increase the efficiencies of tomato growing farms.","[Gunduz, Orhan] Inonu Univ, Battalgazi Vocat Sch, Agr Econ, Battalgazi Campus, Malatya, Turkey; [Sili, Sahinde] Trakya Agr Res Inst, Dept Agr Econ, Agr Econ, D 100 Highway Rd, Edirne, Turkey; [Ceyhan, Vedat] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Agr Econ, Kurupelit Campus, Samsun, Turkey","Inonu University; Ministry of Food, Agriculture & Livestock - Turkey; Ondokuz Mayis University","Gunduz, O (通讯作者)，Inonu Univ, Battalgazi Vocat Sch, Agr Econ, Battalgazi Campus, Malatya, Turkey.",orhangunduz@inonu.edu.tr; sahindesili_66@hotmail.com; vceyhan@omu.edu.tr,"GÜNDÜZ, ORHAN/ABI-6406-2020; Ceyhan, Vedat/GSD-4295-2022; GUNDUZ, ORHAN/AAX-8928-2021","GÜNDÜZ, ORHAN/0000-0002-2357-0802; GUNDUZ, ORHAN/0000-0002-2357-0802",,,,,22,9,9,0,4,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2016,12,3,,,,,26,38,,,,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,EG3JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390939100004,0

This increase in the price of chicken meat is negligible compared to the much better and healthier product that comes at the end which is intended for human consumption.","[Puvaca, Nikola] Patent Co Doo, Dept Poultry Sci, Anim Nutr, Vlade Cetkov 1a, Misicevo 24211, Serbia; [Simin, Mirela Tomas] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Econ, Trg Dositeja Obradov 8, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Ljubojevic, Dragana] Sci Inst Vet Med Novi Sad, Vet Med, Rumenacki Put 20, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Dzinic, Natalija] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Technol, Technol, Bulevar Cara Lazara 1, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Kostadinovic, Ljiljana] Univ Novi Sad, Sci Inst Food Technol, Biochem, Bulevar Cara Lazara 1, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Duragic, Olivera; Popovic, Sanja] Univ Novi Sad, Sci Inst Food Technol, Technol, Bulevar Cara Lazara 1, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; University of Novi Sad; University of Novi Sad; University of Novi Sad,"Puvaca, N (通讯作者)，Patent Co Doo, Dept Poultry Sci, Anim Nutr, Vlade Cetkov 1a, Misicevo 24211, Serbia.",nikola.puvaca@patent-co.com; mirelat@polj.uns.ac.rs; dragana@niv.ns.ac.rs; natadzin@uns.ac.rs; ljiljana.kostadinovic@fins.uns.ac.rs; olivera.djuragic@fins.uns.ac.rs; sanja.popovic@fins.uns.ac.rs,"Djuragic, Olivera/L-2841-2019; Ljubojević Pelić, Dragana Branko/AGT-3595-2022; Tomaš-Simin, Mirela/AAF-6053-2021; Puvača, Nikola/AAA-1244-2021","Djuragic, Olivera/0000-0003-3189-5057; Ljubojević Pelić, Dragana Branko/0000-0002-7833-7696; Tomaš-Simin, Mirela/0000-0003-1833-9857; Puvača, Nikola/0000-0002-5500-7010",Ministry of Science and Technological development of Republic of Serbia [III 46 012],"Ministry of Science and Technological development of Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)",This paper is part of the project III 46 012 which is financially supported by the Ministry of Science and Technological development of Republic of Serbia.,,26,0,1,1,3,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,JUL-SEP,2016,12,3,,,,,260,272,,,,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,EG3JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390939100015,0

In order to lower distances between production and processing sites, the national government has strived to turn it into the second major corridor of the country, relying on the intermodal transport as the main alternative source to reduce logistics cost. In this sense, the intermodal terminal becomes relevant, once its performance tends to impact the logistics system as a whole. This paper aims to assess the efficiency of intermodal grain terminals in Brazil's Northeastern corridor. Based on a quantitative approach, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was employed to measure the relative efficiency of five terminals in two periods (October 2010 to September 2011; October 2011 to September 2012). It can be concluded that intermodal terminals from the region operate at a low level of efficiency, therefore could be considered inefficient. However, there is significant evidence of efficiency improvements over time. This research may be used as decision support by policy makers of both public and private sector organizations.","[Santos, Alexandre Borges] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Prod Engn, Rod Washington Luis,Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Sproesser, Renato Luiz] Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Genie Syst Ind, Inst Natl Polytech Lorraine, Bairro Univ, Av Univ S-N, BR-79070900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Batalha, Mario Otavio] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Genie Syst Ind, Inst Natl Polytech Lorraine, Rod Washington Luis,Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil; [Campeao, Patricia] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Prod Engn, Bairro Univ, Av Univ S-N, BR-79070900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Gomes Pereira, Matheus Wemerson] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Econ Fed Univ Vicosa, Bairro Univ, Av Univ S-N, BR-79070900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos; Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso; Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos; Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul; Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul,"Santos, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Prod Engn, Rod Washington Luis,Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.",borges.alexandre@dep.ufscar.br; renato.sproesser@ufms.br; dmob@ufscar.br; patricia.campeao@ufms.br; matheuswgp@yahoo.com.br,"Pereira, Matheus/IAP-0908-2023; Pereira, Matheus Wemerson Gomes/A-2346-2015; Batalha, Mario O/J-9302-2012","Batalha, Mario Otavio/0000-0003-2711-3358",Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq),Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"The authors would like to acknowledge the Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPq) for providing financial support to conduct this research, the managers who opened doors and shared valuable information with the research group, and Joshua Duarte from Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), who kindly checked the English content of this paper.",,35,1,1,1,15,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,APR-JUN,2016,12,2,,,,,64,83,,,,,,20,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,EG3IX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390938400004,0

In the study, organic, conventional, and soilless cropping systems were compared economically. The study was conducted by producing tomatoes in greenhouses over a three year period between 2012 and 2014. The best result among the three production systems in terms of production costs and net profit were obtained from the organic cropping system. The average yield in a unit area (ton 1000 m(-2)) was 22.37 in soilless culture, 19.28 in organic, and 18.55 in the conventional cropping system. Total production cost for a unit area was 13,508.09 US$ in organic growth, 12,694.34 US$ in soilless culture, and 10,744.62 US$ in the conventional cropping system. Net profit for a unit area was 7,314.31 US$ in organic production, 3,278.87 US$ in soilless culture, and 2,608.98 US$ in the conventional cropping system. Results showed that it is possible to grow vegetables economically with alternative production systems. It requires extending and ensuring sustainability of environmentally friendly production systems. Therefore, farmer training about production techniques, and subsidies alternative production systems are important.","[Demirtas, Bekir; Dagistan, Erdal] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Agr Econ, Antakya, Turkey; [Subasi, O.

Furthermore, growers' agricultural chemicals use practices were also determined. A survey was conducted using a face to face questionnaire with 68 vineyards producers from Central, Keciborlu, Yalvac and Senirkent districts of the Isparta province where there is intensive vineyards production. The farms were chosen by simple random sampling method. Chi-square test was used to analyze the relationship between the dosages of agricultural chemicals used by farmers and practices of agricultural chemicals use of growers and their socio-economic characteristics. In this study, it was also calculated that the cost of plant protection (pesticide and pesticide application costs) per hectare was determined as (sic) 404.77 having the portion of 47.16% of average production cost. Results of this research show that average usage of agricultural chemicals are 56 821.90 g per hectare as an active ingredient. The percentages of used agricultural chemicals are 83.13%, 14.29% and 2.58% sulphur, copper sulfate and pesticides, respectively. It was determined that use of pesticides in grape growing was 1 466.50 g ha(-1). The percentages of used pesticides are 66.53% and 33.47% fungicide and insecticide, respectively. In the research area, the excess use of pesticide was determined in the vineyards production.

The main material of the study consists of primary data gathered from the cold storage in Isparta province. The data covers 2011 storage period. The cold storages are analyzed in groups of normal atmosphere (51 facilities) and controlled atmosphere (8 facilities). According to the results of the study it has been determined that, the average capacity per facility in normal atmosphere cold storages is 4 978.43 tons and in controlled atmosphere cold storages 7 125 tons. The capacity utilization rate is found to be 86.72% in normal atmosphere storages and 96.49% in controlled atmosphere storages. In both types of storages, it has been determined that almost all of the stored products are apples. The net present worth of the investment is found to be $ 166 047.59 in normal atmosphere storages and $ 2 423 434.00 in controlled atmosphere storages. Internal rate of return is determined to be 6.63% in normal atmosphere cold storages and 12.36% in controlled atmosphere cold storages. When a comparison is made in terms of benefit-cost ratio it has been calculated to be 1.03 and 1.39 respectively for normal and controlled cold storages. According to the economical assessment criteria, it has been determined that controlled atmosphere cold storages are more advantageous than normal atmosphere cold storages.","[Kart, M.

The Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR), the present value of expenses and incomes, and the Net Present Value (NPV) were estimated. The scenarios were evaluated through a model, which was built up from the fitting of two logistic models and a Gompertz model, for forecasting citrus tree productivity, severity and disease spread. The best fit for Colima's key lime growers is scenario D with a BCR of 10.9. Scenario D is the one that kept the highest BCR, under changes in price and interest rate. Similarly to Brazil, many Mexican citrus-regions are at risk of being affected by HLB, this paper provides a sense on which strategies are the best to apply in uninfected citrus-regions in Colima and other states within Mexico.","[Vera-Villagran, Elena] Univ Autonoma Chapingo, CIESTAAM, Carr Mexico Texcoco Km 38-5, Chapingo 56230, Mexico; [Myriam Sagarnaga-Villegas, Leticia] Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Zootecnia, CIESTAAM, DICEA, Carr Mexico Texcoco Km 38-5, Chapingo 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Maria Salas-Gonzalez, Jose] Univ Autonoma Chapingo, CIESTAAM, DICEA, Sociol Rural, Carr Mexico Texcoco Km 38-5, Chapingo 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Antonio Leos-Rodriguez, Juan] Univ Autonoma Chapingo, CIESTAAM, DICEA, Carr Mexico Texcoco Km 38-5, Chapingo 56230, Estado de Mexic, Mexico; [Galvao De Miranda, Silvia Helena; De Oliveira Adami, Andreia Cristina] Univ Sao Paulo, CEPEA, Av Padua Dias 11, BR-13416000 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Sagarnaga-Villegas, LM (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Zootecnia, CIESTAAM, DICEA, Carr Mexico Texcoco Km 38-5, Chapingo 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico.",elenverav@gmail.com; sagarnaga.myriam@gmail.com; jmsalasgonzalez@gmail.com; jaleos@gmail.com; shgdemira@usp.br; adami@cepea.org.br,"Miranda, Sílvia Helena Galvão de/A-7373-2016","Miranda, Sílvia Helena Galvão de/0000-0003-0935-8917",,,,,15,1,2,0,6,"UNIV FED RURAL PERNAMBUCO, DEPT ADMINISTRACAO",BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS,"AV D MANOEL MEDEIROS S-N, BAIRRO DE DOIS IRMAOS, RECIFE PE CEP50670-901, BRAZIL",1808-2882,,,CUST AGRONEGOCIO,Custos Agronegocio Line,OCT-DEC,2016,12,4,,,,,344,363,,,,,,20,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Economics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics,EG3JR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390940400018,0

For biological research eight treatments with 1200 broiler chickens of hybrid line Hubbard in total were formed, with four replicates. Control treatment (T1) was fed with commercial mixtures of standard composition and quality based on corn flour and soybean meal. Experimental treatments were fed with same commercial mixtures only with addition of spice herbs as follows:garlic 0.5 (T2) and 1.0 g/100g (T3), black pepper 0.5 (T4) and 1.0 g/100g (T5), hot red pepper 0.5 (T6) and 1.0 g/100g (T7) and mixture of garlic, black pepper and hot red pepper (1:1:1) in total of 0.5 g/100g (T8). Chickens were fed with starter mixtures diet without addition of spice herbs for first two weeks, after which chickens are fed with grower and finisher mixtures according the plan till the end of experiment which lasted 42 days. At the end of experiment and on the basis of gained results it can be concluded that the chickens at experimental treatments T6 and T7 achieved statistically significant (p<0.05) higher final body masses (2460.6 and 2442.4 g) compared to the chickens at control and other treatments. Feed conversion ratio for the entire fattening period ranged from 1.8 kg/kg (T2, T5) to 2.1 kg/kg (T1) with no statistically significant differences (p>0.05). European broiler index (EBI) was lowest in treatment T1 (220.4) and the highest in treatment T6 (298.6) with statistically significant differences (p<0.05). The calculation of the cost includes the cost of dietary mixtures and spices used in experiment. Results of the economic efficiency analyses found that the cost of broiler chickens per treatment is growing, depending on used dietary spice additive. In the treatment T2 average price of body weight gain were 0.68 (sic)/kg which was the lowest, while in the treatment T5 the highest price of body weight gain for the entire production period were 0.82 (sic)/kg, respectively. Results of the economic efficiency analyses found that the lowest price of body weight gain (0.68 (sic)/kg) of chicken was recorded in treatment with garlic powder addition, while the highest (0.82 (sic)/kg) was recorded in black pepper powder addition. This increase in the price of chicken production in compare to the control treatment T1 is negligible compared to the much better and healthier product that comes at the end which is intended for human consumption.","[Puvaca, Nikola] Inst Anim Husb, Vlade Cetkovica 1a, Misicevo 24211, Serbia; [Simin, Mirela Tomas] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Econ, YU-21000 Novi Sad, Serbia; [Kostadinovic, Ljiljana] Univ Novi Sad, Inst Food Technol, Biochem, YU-21000 Novi Sad, Serbia; [Lukac, Dragomir] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Agr, Dept Anim Sci, Anim Genet & Breeding Inst, YU-21000 Novi Sad, Serbia; [Ljubojevic, Dragana] Sci Inst Vet Med Novi Sad, Vet Med Inst, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Popovic, Sanja; Tasic, Tatjana] Univ Novi Sad, Inst Technol, Inst Food Technol, YU-21000 Novi Sad, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; University of Novi Sad; University of Novi Sad; University of Novi Sad,"Puvaca, N (通讯作者)，Inst Anim Husb, Vlade Cetkovica 1a, Misicevo 24211, Serbia.",nikola.puvaca@gmail.com; mirelat@polj.uns.ac.rs; ljiljana.kostadinovic@fins.uns.ac.rs; dragomir.lukac@stocarstvo.edu.rs; dragana@niv.ns.ac.rs; sanja.teodosin@fins.uns.ac.rs; tatjana.tasic@fins.uns.ac.rs,"Tomaš-Simin, Mirela/AAF-6053-2021; Peulic, Tatjana/JRX-1800-2023; Puvača, Nikola/AAA-1244-2021; Ljubojević Pelić, Dragana Branko/AGT-3595-2022","Tomaš-Simin, Mirela/0000-0003-1833-9857; Peulic, Tatjana/0000-0002-7074-4633; Puvača, Nikola/0000-0002-5500-7010; Ljubojević Pelić, Dragana Branko/0000-0002-7833-7696","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological development of Republic of Serbia [III 46 012]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological development of Republic of Serbia","This paper is part of the project III 46 012 which is financially supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological development of Republic of Serbia.

Based on the food safety problem, this paper employs game theory to capture the effects of milk power quality regulation of China on firm competition and industrial development. Firstly, quality regulation increases both variable costs and fixed costs of the regulated firms. High fixed costs hinder new entrants or force incumbents to quit the industry. Reputation increases quality as well as quantity and product substitution enhances the stimulating effects of reputation. Secondly, total quality under Cournot competition is higher than that under Stackelberg competition and reputation enlarges the quality gap between the two different competitions.

Two scenarios were examined: (a) full per capita Internet adoption by 2100, and (b) more rapidly by 2050. Global newsprint consumption is estimated to be 34.2-37.1 million tonnes lower in 2030 than in the US Forest Service 2010 Resources Planning Act report, and the 2010 report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Similarly, global printing and writing paper consumption is forecasted to be 76.7-87.1 million tonnes lower by 2030. By including controls for per capita Internet use in the demand equations for print based media, this article reflects the recent declines in global paper product consumption. Out-of-sample forecasts over a two-year period indicate global model prediction errors from 0 to 3%, depending on the product and exogenous assumptions. The results highlight the importance of considering market evolution in long-term global forecasting, and a failure to account for future rates of Internet adoption will result in an upward bias on paper product market forecasts.

Yet, we frequently observe coexisting governance modes within industries and firms, even when the transaction attributes of a commodity are homogenous. We test whether risk and time preferences, price expectations, and trust in supply chain types can explain variations and coexistence in governance. Specifically, we experimentally elicit economic preferences of forest managers in the Swiss wood sector. We find that all behavioral dimensions are related to the choice of sales channel. Most importantly, trust and expectations are key determinants in transferring property rights, while risk aversion, patience, and ownership structure explain the existence of plural forms at the firm level.

The study developed a theoretical framework for investigating the determinants of financial behavior, combining Bourdieu's concept of economic habitus with the theories explaining behavior of investors in financial markets. Methods of clustering analysis and multinomial logit regression model were used. The study found that an investor's behavior mode is strongly predicted by determinants derived from cultural, economic and social capital. For low-income persons, the culture of origin shapes their financial behavior, and for high-income persons, their economic capital and affiliation to social class are more important. Over time, immigrants assimilate in their financial choices. This study contributes to research of financial behavior as well as migration research by explaining the factors that affect preferences for financial assets allocation among immigrants. Understanding migrants' modes of financial behavior will help policymakers to facilitate accumulation of wealth by immigrants, and in this way contribute to the process of their integration.","[Kushnirovich, Nonna] Ruppin Acad Ctr, Econ & Business Adm Sch, Dept Econ & Management, IL-40250 Emek Hefer, Israel",Ruppin Academic Center,"Kushnirovich, N (通讯作者)，Ruppin Acad Ctr, Econ & Business Adm Sch, Dept Econ & Management, IL-40250 Emek Hefer, Israel.",nonna@ruppin.ac.il,"Nonna, Kushnirovich/J-7752-2019","Nonna, Kushnirovich/0000-0002-3069-3309",,,,,42,8,9,6,22,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Under the traditional public procurement system, however, it is difficult to purchase a highly customized object, such as energy efficiency services, because not only prices but also other nonmonetary aspects need to be taken into account. Multidimensional auctions are useful in such cases. The paper examines the cluster of characteristics of the winning bids of multidimensional auctions for public energy service company (ESCO) projects in Japan. As theory predicts, it is found that the competition effect is significant. Other institutional aspects-such as preannouncement of an energy savings target-are also found important to promote energy efficiency. The results also indicate that the public sector should absorb the regulatory and institutional risks that are related to ESCO projects.","[Iimi, Atsushi] World Bank Grp, Africa Reg Transport & ICT Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Iimi, A (通讯作者)，World Bank Grp, Africa Reg Transport & ICT Global Practice, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",aiimi@worldbank.org,,,,,,,26,3,3,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Seven technology and environmental experts from the German Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) sector were elicited for key relationships and conditional probability values in the model, yielding seven distinct BBNs able to predict how different future technology, economic and policy scenarios will influence model projections. The 2030 scenarios include differing amounts of technological advancement in battery development, regulation, and fuel and electricity greenhouse gas intensities. Across the expert models, 2030 baseline fleet greenhouse gas emissions are predicted to be at 50-65% of 2008 new fleet emissions. They can be further reduced to 40-50% of the emissions of the 2008 new fleet through a combination of a higher share of renewables in the electricity mix, a larger share of biofuels in the fuel mix, and a stricter regulation of car CO2 emissions in the European Union. The experts' BBNs predict that the 2030 ICE will have lower user costs per kilometer than PHEV or BEV for most scenarios, and that ICE will remain the dominant vehicle type in the 2030 German new fleet. According to all of the experts' BBNs, CO2 abatement costs are negative for the 2030 ICE in all scenarios, but can be positive or negative for PHEV and BEV, depending on the expert model and scenario assumed. Critical areas where expert models agree and differ serve to highlight where reductions in uncertainty regarding future technology, economic, environmental and regulatory relationships are most needed to improve our ability to predict and anticipate future vehicle fleet composition and vehicle performance.

The estimate of the net present value of the project involves discounting future revenues at a given discount rate, which can lead to mistaken results when the project implies a certain degree of flexibility. In such cases, methods for the valuation of the investments based on the real options theory allow to estimate the value of projects in an uncertain environment, adding the value of the administrative, operative and managerial flexibility to the strictly financial valuation of the traditional methods. In this paper, the options theory has been applied to the specific case of the abandonment option in a toll motorway concession project. For this purpose, the traffic of the motorway has been considered as the underlying asset to carry out a valuation based on the analogy with the financial options. This methodology is then applied to a case study of a real concession in Madrid, Spain. The results show a significant value of the abandonment option that represents an implicit aid from the Public Administration to the project.","[Lara Galera, Antonio L.; Sanchez Solino, Antonio; Galindo Aires, Ruben A.] Tech Univ Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Galera, ALL (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",alargal@ciccp.es; asanoli@ciccp.es; rubenangel@upm.es,"SOLIÑO, ANTONIO SÁNCHEZ/K-6226-2014; Galindo, Ruben/AAT-1406-2020; Lara-Galera, Antonio Lorenzo/GYV-2690-2022","Galindo, Ruben/0000-0001-9407-9183; Lara-Galera, Antonio Lorenzo/0000-0001-6367-3278",,,,,31,0,0,0,4,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

A welfare assessment suggests that the reforms were mildly welfare positive up to the middle of the third phase, but some concerning trends have emerged, not least the spiralling transaction costs associated with franchise bids and the apparent prevalence of strategic bidding. The problems that emerged, and some of the lessons learnt, in the aborted award of the West Coast franchise in 2012 are assessed. A detailed assessment is also made of the East Coast franchise. The awards that commenced operation in May 2005 and December 2007 (both of which failed) are compared with the new franchise that commenced operations in March 2015. Issues related to the cap and collar regime, GDP support, subordinated loans facility and parent company support are examined. The prospects for movement towards a more variegated set of franchise contracts will be considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As a solution to these issues, the participation of private transport operators and creation of other sources of income than simply providing transportation services have been discussed in recent years. In Japan, private railway companies are the main providers of railway services, especially in urban areas. Although most such private railway companies provide adequate services and operate at a surplus, they receive no subsidies to cover their operating deficits and maintenance costs. Further, the most remarkable feature of private railway companies in Japan is their widely deployed diversification strategy, even into areas barely related to the transportation business, by using physical or tangible assets. This study investigates how the diversification strategies of private railway companies in Japan influence the railway business, focusing on the relationship between diversification and investment in transportation and the use of internal capital by diversified private railway companies. We review the research findings on investment and estimate quantitative models to examine the effect of diversification on transportation investment, based on the internal capital market theory discussed in the corporate finance literature. We find that investment in the railway business is influenced by diversification in terms of capital resource allocation. Internal capital is likely to be utilised for investment in not only the transportation business, but also diversified businesses. We conclude that this result is driven by the expected limitations of growth and profitability, as well as the financial support schemes available to transportation businesses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a simple model for now-casting volatilities based on a specific ARMA representation of the log-transformed squared returns that allows us to estimate the current volatility as a function of current and past returns. The model can be viewed as a stochastic volatility model with perfect correlation between the two error terms. It is shown that the volatility nowcasts are invariant to this correlation, and therefore the estimated volatilities coincide. We propose an extension of our nowcasting model that takes into account the so-called leverage effect. The alternative models are used to estimate daily return volatilities from the S&P 500 stock price index. (C) 2016 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This competition induces host countries to vertically differentiate their education programmes: some countries supply a higher educational quality and charge higher tuition fees, while others provide a lower quality for lower tuition fees. This paper argues that the educational quality of high-quality countries, the national tuition fees and the quality and tuition fee differentials between the countries all increase as the income prospects for graduates in the developing countries catch up with the developed world and the number of international students grows. If foreign students become more likely to stay in their host country after graduation, the implications will be more ambiguous. In particular, an increase in educational quality can be accompanied by a decline in tuition fees. Intensified competition for international students does not necessarily disadvantage developing countries, since they might even benefit from a brain gain.","[Haupt, Alexander] Univ Plymouth, Plymouth Business Sch, Drake Circus, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Haupt, Alexander] Univ Plymouth, Grad Sch Management, Drake Circus, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Haupt, Alexander; Krieger, Tim] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Krieger, Tim] Univ Freiburg, Dept Econ, Wilhelmstr 1b, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany; [Lange, Thomas] Geschaftsstelle Munchen, Acatech Natl Acad Sci & Engn, Hofgartenstr 2, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Plymouth; University of Plymouth; Ifo Institut; University of Freiburg,"Krieger, T (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.;Krieger, T (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Dept Econ, Wilhelmstr 1b, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",alexander.haupt@plymouth.ac.uk; tim.krieger@vwl.uni-freiburg.de; lange@acatech.de,"Krieger, Tim/G-6241-2012","Krieger, Tim/0000-0003-0045-9172",German Research Foundation's (DFG) Research Group on Heterogeneous Labor; Fritz Thyssen Stiftung; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),German Research Foundation's (DFG) Research Group on Heterogeneous Labor(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Fritz Thyssen Stiftung; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"The authors are most thankful to two anonymous reviewers and the journal's editor, Alessandro Cigno, for their excellent help and guidance.

In particular, Hay and Spier (J Legal Stud 26:413-431, 1997) argues that if legal parties have a commonly accessible body of evidence (perfectly correlated pieces of evidence), the party who bears the burden of proof will present the evidence if and only if the evidence supports his position, while the other party (without the burden) will refrain from presenting it regardless of whether the evidence supports his position. In this paper, I claim that the result will be dramatically changed if the pieces of evidence that each party possesses are not perfectly correlated. I show that each party will present the evidence that supports his position whenever available, regardless of the burden of proof assignment.

An implication of this idea is that firms can use these sources for balancing its internal focus on exploratory and exploitative research and development activities (R&D). Then, the paper suggests that the use of this balancing strategy has positive effects on a firm's innovative performance. Using panel data based on Spanish manufacturing companies for the period 2004-2012, the empirical results confirm that firms balancing their internal exploration or exploitation in R&D with sources of external exploitation or exploration in their technology alliances are the firms with better prospects to produce innovation streams. Implications for the literature on complementarities in innovation, ambidexterity and R&D alliance formation are derived from the analysis.","[Lucena, Abel] Univ Balearic Isl, Business Econ Dept, Palma De Mallorca, Spain; [Lucena, Abel] Ctr Res Welf Econ CREB, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Lucena, A (通讯作者)，Univ Balearic Isl, Business Econ Dept, Palma De Mallorca, Spain.;Lucena, A (通讯作者)，Ctr Res Welf Econ CREB, Barcelona, Spain.",abel.lucena@uib.eu,"Lucena, Abel/F-3760-2016","Lucena, Abel/0000-0002-6600-7788",Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2010-21393-C04-02]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2013-48496-C4-1-R],Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),This work was financially supported by the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [grant number ECO2010-21393-C04-02]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [grant number ECO2013-48496-C4-1-R].,,93,13,14,3,77,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Such measures, however, are subject to various types of measurement bias. The latter can include Commodity Substitution Bias whereby the weights assigned to each item in a representative basket of goods and services cease to fully reflect consumer expenditure patterns over time, and particularly during a period of economic upheaval. This, in turn, can lead to the overstatement (or understatement) of inflation. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) now updates the relevant weights every year, thereby reducing the impact of this bias. In this article, we have endeavoured to estimate the size of the bias in the period leading up to the introduction of the new methodology in 2012. The results presented here indicate that the rate of inflation was slightly understated. The degree of this measurement bias was not significantly higher than that identified in other countries in which this phenomenon has been examined, albeit that in the latter countries an upward bias (or overstatement) was found.","[Bermingham, Colin; Coates, Dermot; O'Brien, Derry] Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland,"Coates, D (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.",dermot.coates@centralbank.ie,,"Coates, Dr. Dermot Peter/0000-0002-9378-9869",,,,,10,0,0,0,4,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

First, the stock market and money supply exhibit the most pronounced leading characteristics in the Croatian economy (a 3-month lag length is selected by the information criteria). Second, the dynamic model (including a lagged dependent dummy variable) significantly outperforms the baseline static model. Third, the authors augment the probit model by the Economic Sentiment Indicator; which significantly contributes to the model accuracy.

Research across a large number of developed and wealthy countries, including Ireland, has shown that those with fewer resources, less education or a lower occupational class have higher standardised mortality rates (SMRs) than more advantaged individuals. The last analysis of Irish adult mortality differentials across social classes, carried out by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and based on data for 2006, found that men in the unskilled manual social class had an SMR that was 1.8 times higher than males in the professional social class. However, little is known about how socio-economic inequalities in mortality in Ireland have changed since the mid-1990s, a period characterised by an unprecedented boom and bust in economic activity. In addition, previous analyses have made no attempt to adjust the SMRs to take account of those reporting missing or unknown occupation/socio-economic group (SEG). Using annual mortality data from the CSO over the period 1984-2008, a period of economic recovery and boom, this paper examines whether the general downward trend in mortality observed over this period was experienced equally by all SEGs. We find that the SMR for all groups fell between the 1980s and 2000s but that the extent of this fall was largest for Employer and Manager and Professional SEGs leading to a growing differential between these groups and all others.","[Layte, Richard; Nolan, Anne] Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Layte, Richard; Nolan, Anne] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Layte, R (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Whitaker Sq, Dublin 2, Ireland.",richard.layte@esri.ie,,"Nolan, Anne/0000-0002-4597-180X",,,,,56,1,1,0,5,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

It takes into account impacts of uncertainty, measured by VSTOXX volatility; noisy signals, measured by oil price volatility; and oil price return on forecast changes. The panel smooth transition regression model is applied with different specifications of the transition function to account for nonlinear relations. Data on oil price expectations for different time horizons are taken from the European Central Bank Survey of Professional Forecasters. The results show that forecast changes are governed by overreaction. However, overreaction is markedly reduced when high levels of uncertainty prevail. On the other hand, noisy signals and positive oil price return tend to cause higher overreaction.

In making this distinction, we draw attention to how gender norms can play an important role in shaping reproductive interests. Survey data and previous work show a wealth of differences in the number of children men and women would like to have, and in their behaviors toward the children they have. We argue not that gender norms cause women to want more children than men, but that they cause women to want children more, for reasons that include time spent with children, old-age support, women's proscribed opportunities for achieving social standing, and the relationship in many contexts between honorable female adulthood and bearing children at the right time and under the right circumstances. We further argue that a just and effective population policy must consider fertility outcomes at multiple scales, including that of the welfare of individual women.","[Root, Leslie] Univ Calif Berkeley, Demog, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Johnson-Hanks, Jennifer] Univ Calif Berkeley, Demog & Sociol, Berkeley, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Root, L (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Demog, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",leslier@demog.berkeley.edu; johnsonhanks@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,76,2,2,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

That is, whether they will subsequently negotiate about only wages (Right-to-Manage) or about both wages and employment (Efficient Bargains). We show that under price competition in the product market the equilibrium bargaining agendas always involve only wages. Under quantity competition, however, and provided that the union bargaining power is low enough, one firm/union pair agrees on Efficient Bargains while the other pair agrees on Right-to-Manage. Thus, if sufficient product differentiation among firms exists, then social welfare can be higher under quantity competition than under price competition; the role of unions is critical for this result.","[Vlassis, Minas; Mamakis, Stefanos] Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Univ Campus Gallos, Rethimnon 74100, Crete, Greece",University of Crete,"Vlassis, M (通讯作者)，Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Univ Campus Gallos, Rethimnon 74100, Crete, Greece.",vlassism@uoc.gr; smamakis@hotmail.com,"Vlassis, Minas/AAP-1356-2021","Mamakis, Stefanos/0000-0001-8885-4825",,,,,16,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

We study the welfare effects of residential parking subsidies through changes in car ownership for Amsterdam. We employ a boundary-discontinuity design that exploits spatial variation in the length of waiting lists for permits and therefore in the size of the parking subsidy. In the city center, the waiting time for a permit is up to four years. Our results indicate that one additional year of waiting for a parking permit reduces car ownership with 2 percentage points corresponding to a price elasticity of car demand of -0.8. We demonstrate that subsidizing residential parking induces a substantial welfare loss. On average, a parking permit induces an annual deadweight loss of (sic)270. Furthermore, we show that the provision of parking permits is an income-regressive policy: rich households are five times more likely than poor households to receive these (implicit) parking subsidies.

The Case of Online Reviews,MANAGERIAL AND DECISION ECONOMICS,,,English,Review,,,,,,,INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE; DELAY,"Consumers are frequently in situations that include evaluating the probability of the outcome of a particular choice. It is, therefore, essential to analyze how probability influences choice in order to fully understand consumer behavior. This paper investigates how probability discounting contributes to the understanding of the impact of online reviews on consumer choice. An experiment with 25 participants was conducted. Participants were presented with an online shopping scenario in which they had to choose between two online shops: one with (positive) customer reviews (on delivery reliability and customer service) and higher product prices, while the other had lower prices, but no customer reviews at all. We employed a titration procedure over sales price for the web shop without customer reviews; this was run over seven probability conditions. The point where participants switched between one web shop and another was recorded, and the probability discounting factors were calculated. The results highlight that online reviews are indicators of successful online transactions (i.e., intention to buy) and therefore function as choice benchmarks. In the light of these results, the paper presents practical implications, as well as directions for future research.

To do so, EU member states will likely have to increase imports of biomass from timber rich regions, which will undoubtedly disrupt international wood product markets. In this study, a static global forest trade model of coniferous wood products is used to examine the effects of expanded demand for wood pellets in Europe to generate reliable electricity. Positive mathematical programming (PMP) is used to calibrate the model to 2012 bilateral trade flows. To assess the impact of increased wood-pellet demand on global forest products, we consider a scenario where EU demand for wood pellets doubles. Model results suggest increases in the world prices of industrial roundwood (1%), particleboard ($34/m(3)), fibreboard ($30/m(3)), pulp ($65/t) and pellets (71% to 128%), while the prices of sawnwood and plywood & veneer are projected to fall by $12/m(3) and $4/m(3), respectively. The gains and losses are unevenly distributed between timber rich and timber poor regions; Russia, Canada and the U.S. experience large net welfare gains of $706 million, $544 million and $416 million, respectively, while Asia loses $1.8 billion. In the forest products sector, the gains outweigh losses with economic benefits increasing by some $4.9 billion, but this is a cost to the consumers of electricity and/or taxpayers in the regions implementing these renewable energy policies. The price of wood pellets is projected to rise between $107 and $154 per tonne. The findings highlight the need to account for the interconnections among softwood forest products globally.

We examine the airline managers' perspectives in relation to assessing and bidding for PSOs on scheduled air services. Possible areas for improvement include issues around the dissemination of PSO opportunities in the single market, adequate response times for proposal preparation/submission and preparing for the service launch date as well as incentives to develop the air service during the contract period in terms of revenue and patronage.

This paper analyses for Ireland the consequences of such a shift in the tax mix. In particular, it examines whether this can be carried out in a way that would neither undermine income distribution nor depress government revenue. Simulations using the ESRI tax-benefit model, SWITCH, suggest it is possible to achieve such a broadly revenue-neutral tax shift in a non-regressive way, while lowering marginal tax rates for most taxpayers. In particular, reductions in the Universal Social Charge would reduce marginal and average tax rates and have a positive impact for the income of most households. This could be funded by shifting the tax base toward residential properties, though this might have an adverse effect on income distribution, due to Ireland's high rates of home ownership throughout the income distribution. The analysis shows that low income groups could be protected through the careful introduction of income-related supports, with revenue losses recovered through a more progressive property tax rate structure. Overall, the simulations show that a shift from labour to property tax can be pro-growth and pro-employment, without equity losses. The paper therefore suggests that tax reform can be inclusive.","[O'Connor, Brendan; Hynes, Terence] Dept Finance, Dublin, Ireland; [Haugh, David; Lenain, Patrick] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"O'Connor, B (通讯作者)，Dept Finance, Dublin, Ireland.",,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,1,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Yet, a more systematic appraisal of Ostrom's work shows that it contains no concept of justice. Her idea of rights is extremely limited, often tied to the notion of joint, rather than equal, rights. Indeed, for Ostrom, the notion of the commons is socially separatist and not ecological. Ostrom uses historical examples, but without analyzing how common possession historically evolved and was undermined by external forces. Hence her proposed collective action to save the commons actually accelerates the real threats to the commons. A strikingly different and more holistic approach to the commons is offered by Henry George, who posits the commons as the most important path to social, economic, and ecological sustainability. Unlike Ostrom, who studied the commons scientifically to show that some goods are neither private, public, nor club-based, George studied the commons to understand and remove injustice at the roots. His approach is more critical and certainly more relevant today in showing that another world is possible. However, George's work too, requires significant changes to update its framing of the meanings, prospects, and future of the commons.","[Obeng-Odoom, Franklin] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, Asia Pacific Ctr Complex Real Property Rights, DAB, Peter Johnson Bldg, Broadway, NSW, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Obeng-Odoom, F (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, Asia Pacific Ctr Complex Real Property Rights, DAB, Peter Johnson Bldg, Broadway, NSW, Australia.",Franklin.Obeng-Odoom@uts.edu.au,"Obeng-Odoom, Franklin/G-2644-2017","Obeng-Odoom, Franklin/0000-0003-3997-7751",,,,,88,17,18,2,38,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

How are we to understand the financial system's role in this persistently illiberal yet marketizing political economy? This paper develops a theory of China's financial reform as the management of socio-economic uncertainty by the CCP. Since the early 1990s, the financial system has formed a locus of the CCP's capacity both to manage and to propagate socio-economic uncertainty through the path of reform. The unique path of financial reform in China should thus not be viewed solely in terms of partial' or failed' free-market reform, but rather as the product of a more concerted vision of how the financial system enabled a mode of economic growth that combined the drive for accumulation of capital with the distinctive legacies of China's post-1989 socio-political circumstances.","[Gruin, Julian Y.] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Postbus 15578, NL-1001 NB Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Gruin, JY (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Postbus 15578, NL-1001 NB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.y.gruin@uva.nl,,,"St Antony's College, Oxford; Chiang Ching Kuo Foundation; ESRC [ES/N001982/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N001982/1] Funding Source: researchfish","St Antony's College, Oxford; Chiang Ching Kuo Foundation; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This research was supported by funding from St Antony's College, Oxford, and the Chiang Ching Kuo Foundation.",,58,12,12,3,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

It also considers the interactions of these techniques with multistep intercept corrections that are designed to exhibit robustness to such shifts. In a local-asymptotic parameterization of the probability of breaks, we provide analytical expressions for forecast biases and mean-square forecast errors. We also provide simulations which show that breaks provide a rationale for using methods other than iterated multistep techniques. In particular, we study the relationships between the relative accuracy of the methods and the forecast horizon, the sample size and the timing of the shifts. We show that direct multistep forecasting provides forecasts that are relatively robust to breaks, and that its benefits increase with the forecast horizon. In an empirical application, we revisit an oft-used dataset of G7 macroeconomic series and corroborate our theoretical results. (C) 2015 International Institute of Forecasters.

This demand in national parks is particularly important as it generates revenues for the parks operation especially nature conservation and offers economic benefits to the local community. Satisfied tourists increase chances of repeat visits, loyalty and positive word of mouth communication with others and hence tourists may contribute to higher tourism revenues. Therefore, it is important to maintain tourist satisfaction that serves as an important indicator in sustaining tourism demand at a destination. This study has two key objectives. Firstly, it aims to measure the overall tourist satisfaction based on eight dimensions namely the quality of park, service and hospitality, natural attractions, accommodation, food, transportation and recreational activities and lastly the perceived cost. Secondly, it intends to determine the level of tourist satisfaction by nationality. This study has selected 40 tourists through convenience sampling technique for its pilot survey. The collected data were then analysed with Kruskal-Wallis Test. The results show that the tourists were generally satisfied with their overall travel experience and there is no significant difference among different nationalities on tourist satisfaction. It is concluded that the tourists may not expect high on a natural-based tourist destination, such as a national park that only allows limited development for better nature conservation. Basic services and facilities which were offered in the park are deemed sufficient and have met their expectations.","[Chew, S.

The aim of this paper is the analysis of patient safety management development to identify main obstacles and success factors for its improvement, coming from global literature review combined with a case study where 15 hospitals were interviewed on an innovative labelling system. Hospital management is increasingly confronted by governmental, regulatory, and consumer groups to demonstrate organizational safety culture that assures patients safely from medical error. This article helps to understand what really happened or improved regarding patient safety over the last 15 years and may support answer the question what can we do to improve patient safety? A comprehensive review of patient safety literature globally. The review was a qualitative meta-analysis from which identified barriers and critical success factors for improvement. This research is underlined by a case study which also shows clear adoption barriers. In the result of analysis of literature review and secondary statistical data main conclusions can be stated such as: 1) The scope of improving patient safety has not made significant progress and further efforts are rare and not centred, 2) several macroeconomic obstacles are still observable end especially in the field of commitment, funding, education, but main attention paid by author of this paper is the analysis of managerial aspects of patient safety on micro-level which is creating the third group of conclusions.","[Ehrnsperger, Barbara] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Ehrnsperger, B (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",barbara.ehrnsperger@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,209,218,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200018,0

Our analysis is based on 2013 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) data obtained through an adult population survey and national expert survey. In our investigation we employ PATH-analysis, SEM model and multiple regression analysis to empirically define the effective structure of entrepreneurial activity for the performance of an economy and the environmental factors that impact it. This approach empirically examines the directions of influence in the above mentioned relationships. In addition, the robustness of our findings was checked by repeating our analysis on a different sample (2010 GEM data on 59 economies) and by multiplying regression analysis for separate variables of entrepreneurial activity effectiveness, and our results were confirmed. Our findings suggest that of all the different environmental enablers, access to infrastructure (both physical and commercial) is the most influential attribute of entrepreneurial environment affecting economic performance at a macro level and the effective sectorial structure of business activities. Overall, the main drivers of the productiveness of entrepreneurship are: access to infrastructure, rule of law, effective government programs and market openness and dynamics.","[Holienka, Marian; Pilkova, Anna; Ostapenko, Nataliia] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Holienka, M (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Bratislava, Slovakia.",marian.holienka@fm.uniba.sk; anna.pilkova@fm.uniba.sk; natayal107@mail.ru,"Ostapenko, Nataliia/V-8910-2019; Pilková, Anna/AAD-9645-2019; Holienka, Marian/N-8162-2015","Ostapenko, Nataliia/0000-0002-2184-2579; Holienka, Marian/0000-0002-8975-6116",,,,,31,4,4,0,13,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-21139-8; 978-3-319-21138-1,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,79,95,,10.1007/978-3-319-21139-8_6,0.0,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE5QC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373209100006,0

We argue that, given that a primary goal of establishing a co-branding alliance is to positively revise consumers' beliefs about important attributes of the allying brands, the case of no belief-revision can lead to a failure of the alliance. We show that both an identical and a highly incongruent partnership in terms of attribute-level difference can fail due to the lack of belief-revision. We report that a moderately incongruent brand pair is a promising decision on co-branding partner selection. In doing so, our research contributes to the explanation of why the two extreme types of co-branding alliances may fail from the perspective of consumer evaluation.

A survey was conducted through an exploratory questionnaire organized into three sections: introducing the main topic of the survey, characterizing the respondents, gathering the data on their perceptions respecting the influence of environmental sustainability on the business management and competitiveness, as well as on the professional's employability. The survey was conducted in two companies, a mining and steel company, located in southeastern Brazil. These companies have similar management levels and invest in awareness of environmental sustainability of its managers and employees. The total sample consisted of 98 managers, 63 of the steel company and 35 of mining one. Of this total of surveyed professionals, 24.49% were part of the senior management and 75.51% belong to the medium management positions in these companies. The questionnaire was delivered by the companies and was answered directly by the respondents by e-mail and internet. Data analysis included a descriptive analysis of the surveyed sample, followed by an exploratory factor analysis and the estimation of non-parametric tests, aiming at verifying the validity of the hypothesis derived from the specific objectives of this research. We conclude that the surveyed managers valued environmental sustainability as being very important to company management, for business competitiveness, and for their own employability and, in this order.

The study covers all the companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) from 2003 to 2011. In line with Burgstahler and Dichev (1997), the cross-sectional distributions of earnings and changes in earnings are examined and the distributions are shown in histograms. Previous research (using data from the United States) has shown that the distribution curve for both the earnings and the change in earnings variable had noticeably fewer observations just below zero than would normally be expected, and a significantly higher number of observations just above zero. This pattern in the distributions suggests that managers manage reported earnings to ensure that earnings do not fall below a specific threshold, this being zero or the previous year's performance. Interestingly, and in contrast with the previous literature, using the Burgstahler and Dichev (1997) research model of analysis, our results show no evidence of managers in South Africa managing earnings to avoid reporting small losses or small decreases in earnings. A possible reason for this could be the relatively smaller size of the JSE (compared with stock exchanges in the United States). In addition, and more important, is the possibility that investors and analysts in South Africa may be fixated on other performance indicators, such as revenue and headline earnings per share, rather than on earnings (profits). This study adds to the limited research on earnings management in South Africa, which is a developing economy. Furthermore, previous research shows an inverse relationship between earnings management and earnings quality. The results of this study may therefore be useful to the users and the regulators of financial reports, both are concerned with earnings for the purposes of assessing the cost of capital and how companies utilise their resources.","[Pududu, Mangakane Lehlogonolo; de Villiers, Charl] Univ Pretoria, Dept Accounting, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [de Villiers, Charl] Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand",University of Pretoria; University of Auckland,"Pududu, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Accounting, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,"de Villiers, Charl/G-1334-2019","de Villiers, Charl/0000-0002-0715-8957; Pududu, Mangakane/0000-0002-5523-749X",,,,,59,7,9,0,21,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The model has three innovations with respect to the available literature: (i) we treated ship-to-shore gantry cranes and mobile cranes separately, in order to account for the higher productivity of the former; (ii) we introduced a binary variable for ports using ships' cranes, treated as an additional source of port productivity; and (iii) we introduced a binary variable for ports operating as transshipment hubs.

The results show an improvement in the average technical efficiency of ports in the Latin American and Caribbean region from 52% to 64% between 1999 and 2009; the best performing port in 2009 achieved a technical efficiency of 88% with respect to the frontier. The paper also studies possible determinants of port technical efficiency, such as ownership, corruption and income per capita. The results revealed a positive and significant association between technical efficiency and private port operations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Empirical analysis of this study focuses on the data of the European Union countries. Implicit tax rates are used to measure the tax burden. The study covers the period from 2003 to 2012 using annual data. The results of this study show that there are large differences in the tax burden in the European Union countries. The tax burden on capital and consumption is higher in the very high economic development countries; but implicit tax rate on capital is higher in the case of countries with lower GDP growth, high government sector and high government debt. Joining the EU in 2004 or 2007 did not have a strong effect on the change in the joined countries tax burden. However, the tax burden on labor has declined, and the tax burden on consumption has increased or remained in the similar level in the majority of countries.","[Sineviciene, Lina] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Finance, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Sineviciene, L (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Finance, Kaunas, Lithuania.",lina.sineviciene@ktu.lt,"Sineviciene, Lina/M-7562-2018",,,,,,21,5,5,3,15,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-27573-4; 978-3-319-27572-7,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2016,3-2,,,,,,283,298,,10.1007/978-3-319-27573-4_19,0.0,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG2KA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387429800019,0

The aim of the research is to determine the efficiency of CRM according to the criteria of customer loyalty, innovation capacity and sales revenue. In order to prove or disprove the hypothesis of the positive impact of CRM on the performance of business entities in the Republic of Croatia, various scientific methods were used; analysis, synthesis, description and comparison, and primary data collected by surveying 50 business entities in the Republic of Croatia that apply the CRM system. The research results indicate that the CRM system plays an important role in successfully meeting the needs of customers, gaining loyalty and in raising overall profitability of business entities that apply CRM. The results suggest the need for systematic education of SMEs about the benefits of CRM systems. CRM as one of the key factors for the survival of the company is becoming the focus of the business on which it is necessary to know as much as possible.

Most of these farmers have limited access to credit and insurance, and to markets in which to sell their produce. This paper reviews ethnographic research data and argues that smallholder farmers struggle to take part in modern agricultural value chains in South Africa. System dynamics modelling is used to understand the dynamics relating to agricultural value-chain participants, and to determine whether the ethnographic research data is sufficient to answer the question as to which value-chain participants potentially have the largest impact on smallholder farmers. The modelling results show that banks may have the potential to trigger an impact on smallholder farmers' productivity that could then attract other value-chain industries to take part in efforts to support these farmers. Smallholder farmers could become a long-term viable and sustainable option for increasing food security in South Africa. However, this study has its limitations. The data used from existing ethnographic research, conducted by way of semi-structured interviews with value-chain participants, is limited and is not able to answer questions such as: (i) how much each industry is prepared to engage with smallholder farmers in the event of other industries being prepared to do the same; and (ii) how long it will take each industry to react to a willingness to engage. Ongoing research is required to extend the interviewee base and data in order to answer these questions and for the model to be completed and used for policy guidance.","[von Loeper, Wolfgang; Musango, Josephine; Drimie, Scott] Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Publ Leadership, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Musango, Josephine; Brent, Alan] Univ Stellenbosch, Ctr Renewable & Sustainable Energy Studies, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Brent, Alan] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Ind Engn, Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University; Stellenbosch University; Stellenbosch University,"von Loeper, W (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Publ Leadership, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",wolfgang@mysmart.farm,"DRIMIE, SCOTT/T-5109-2017","DRIMIE, SCOTT/0000-0003-3827-8051; Musango, Josephine Kaviti/0000-0001-9635-0002",,,,,86,40,47,2,31,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

Although both types of poor-quality drugs can be dangerous, they differ in health consequence, price, and potential policy remedies. Assessing basic quality of 1437 samples of Ciprofloxacin from 18 low-to-middle- income countries, we aim to understand how price and nonprice signals can help distinguish between falsified, substandard, and passing drugs. Following the Global Pharma Health Fund e.V. Minilab (R) protocol, we find 9.88% of samples have less than 80% of the correct active ingredient and 41.5% of these failures are falsified. Falsified and substandard drugs tend to differ in two observable attributes: first, falsified drugs are more likely to mimic drugs registered with local drug safety regulators. Second, after controlling for other factors, substandard drugs are on average cheaper than passing generics in the same city but the price of falsified drugs is not significantly different from that of passing drugs on average. These data patterns suggest that careful consumers may have information to suspect a drug is substandard before purchase but substandard drugs can still exist to cater to poor and less-educated population. In contrast, falsified drugs will be more difficult for consumers to identify ex ante because they appear similar to high-quality, locally registered products in both price and packaging.","[Bate, Roger; Mathur, Aparna] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Jin, Ginger Zhe] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Jin, Ginger Zhe] NBER, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Bate, R (通讯作者)，Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",rbate@aei.org; jin@econ.umd.edu; amathur@aei.org,,,,,,,32,15,17,2,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

To achieve this we introduce in a model the concept of macroculture as a complex of mutually supporting values, norms and beliefs in various areas of human activity, like athletics, war, politics, etc. Then, we proceed through a historical review on the history of sports in Ancient Greece and we investigate various aspects of how and under which terms athletics performed during classical Greece, predominantly, in ancient Athens. We found that the values that gradually emerged through sports during an extended period that goes back as far as the Bronze Age times, led to the development of an environment of mutually supporting norms and values such as equality and trust, that by being correlated and coordinated each other, led to the creation of new values and norms, as the theory of macroculture proposes.

In this article, we draw on the notion of mixed embeddedness to explore how time-and-place-specific institutional contexts influence women's entrepreneurship. Drawing on primary data collected in Ghana, where exceptionally more women engage in entrepreneurial activities than men, we examine the scale and characteristics of female entrepreneurial activity, exploring the factors that account for this strong participation of women, and examine whether this high entrepreneurial rate is also reflected in their performance and growth aspirations. The findings reveal a disjuncture between, on the one hand, the vibrant entrepreneurial endeavors of Ghanaian women and positive societal attitudes toward female entrepreneurship and, on the other hand, female business activities characterized by vulnerability and relatively low achievement. The article shows how regulatory, normative, and cultural-cognitive institutional forces, which have been transformed over time by local and global processes and their interaction, are concomitantly propelling and impeding women's entrepreneurial activities. We propose that the study of female entrepreneurs within economic geography could be advanced by analyzing the differing effects of the complex, multiple, and shifting layers of institutional contexts in which they are embedded.","[Langevang, Thilde] Copenhagen Business Sch, Ctr Business & Dev Studies, Dept Intercultural Commun & Management, DK-2000 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Gough, Katherine V.] Univ Loughborough, Dept Geog, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Yankson, Paul W.

The necessary data is collected from a survey conducted among 391 IT professionals working in various companies in Poland. The results of the analysis indicate that business competence, in general, positively affects the job satisfaction of IT professionals in transition economies. However, business competence seems to have mixed effects on various aspects of job satisfaction. Although business competence affects satisfaction with co-workers, supervision and work itself, the surveyed IT professionals feel that business competence does not have any substantial effect on their salary level and professional promotions. The theoretical implication of this study is that systematic development of human capital by building business competence will have positive effects on the job satisfaction of IT professionals in transition economies. This paper also has a practical implication for managers in transition economies seeking improvements in productivity as it may help them to devise a compensation and promotion system that would better account for competency in their employees.","[Kowal, Jolanta] Univ Wroclaw, Inst Psychol, Dept Hist & Pedag Sci, PL-50527 Wroclaw, Poland; [Roztocki, Narcyz] Univ New York New Paltz, Sch Business State, New Paltz, NY 12561 USA",University of Wroclaw,"Roztocki, N (通讯作者)，Univ New York New Paltz, Sch Business State, 1 Hawk Dr, New Paltz, NY 12561 USA.",jolakowal@gmail.com; roztockn@newpaltz.edu,"Kowal, Jolanta/N-6343-2015","Kowal, Jolanta/0000-0002-6241-9603",University of Wroclaw [2019/S/IPS/2012],University of Wroclaw,This work was supported by the University of Wroclaw [grant number 2019/S/IPS/2012].,,38,30,32,2,33,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

A key issue concerns the relationship between regional economic cyclicity and monetary union: in the absence of a common automatic fiscal stabilization mechanism and with limited geographical mobility of factors, the greater the asymmetry of shocks across the regions making up a currency area, the more that area departs from an optimal single currency space as far as monetary policy is concerned. Our aim in this article is to investigate whether the regions in the Eurozone have become more or less similar in their vulnerability and resilience to economic shocks since the monetary union. Using predictions based on a spatial panel model with random effects, an endogenous spatial lag and spatially autoregressive errors, we find that a common contractionary shock across the Eurozone has its biggest impact on the most geographically isolated regions, which are precisely those peripheral regions in Euroland that are suffering the most acute sovereign debt crisis, and which are among the lowest productivity regions of the European Union. The implications of these results for the debate over European monetary and fiscal integration are discussed.","[Fingleton, Bernard] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England; [Garretsen, Harry] Univ Groningen, Fac Business & Econ, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands; [Martin, Ron] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England",University of Cambridge; University of Groningen; University of Cambridge,"Martin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.",rlm1@cam.ac.uk,"Fingleton, Bernard/GZA-5738-2022","Fingleton, Bernard/0000-0001-7359-643X","UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/1035811/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I035811/1, ES/L011921/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L011921/1, ES/I035811/1] Funding Source: UKRI",UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Ron Martin's contribution to this paper draws in part on research conducted for a project on How Regions React to Recession: Resilience, Hysteresis and Long Run Impacts, funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (Grant ES/1035811/1), whose support is gratefully acknowledged.",,41,66,70,5,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

This research compared effects of several nutrition labeling formats on consumers' food choices (i.e., the nutrition table, GDA 100 g/ml, and GDA portion). We primarily focused on whether nutrition label information was standardized to a fixed or varying comparison baseline. Fixed baselines (e.g., 100 g/ml) allow consumers to make direct, relative comparisons of products, while varying baselines (e.g., portion size) often require consumers to undertake complex mathematical calculations. Findings suggest that consumers' food choices are likely to be healthier when nutrition label information is presented on a fixed baseline. Gender was found to moderate these effects such that women made healthier choices-but only when the nutrition label baseline was fixed. Thus, the type of comparison baseline is an important characteristic of nutrition labels for public policymakers, public health officials, and academic researchers to consider.","[Hieke, Sophie] European Food Informat Council, Consumer Insights, Brussels, Belgium; [Hieke, Sophie] Univ Munich, Inst Market Based Management, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Newman, Christopher L.] Univ Mississippi, Sch Business Adm, Mkt, University, MS 38677 USA",University of Munich; University of Mississippi,"Hieke, S (通讯作者)，European Food Informat Council, Consumer Insights, Brussels, Belgium.",sophie.hieke@eufic.org; cnewman@bus.olemiss.edu,,,,,,,21,15,17,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

This article provides evidence of how the state of the economy, measured using per capita income levels and unemployment rates, can influence the demand for public transport by bus with data from the city of Santander (Spain) for the period 2001-2012. The methodology used has involved the short and long run equilibrium demand elasticities estimation using a log-log regression model considering the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals and the endogeneity of the transport supply. The results show that the demand for transport is sensitive to changes in unemployment rates with an elasticity estimated at 0.133 in the static equilibrium model and of 0.210 in the long run dynamic model. The resulting elasticity for income levels was not significant in all the models, with a parameter estimated in the static model of -0.505 and of -0.861 in the long run dynamic model. The model estimated by two stage least squares validated using data from 2013 with unemployment rate as an independent variable gave the lowest average square error in validation.

Full participation among justices is explained using models of spatial competition, showing that two features particular to the Court encourage full participation. First, the doctrine of stare decisis makes the resolution of future cases in part dependent on the resolution of present ones. This raises the cost of abstention, particularly to risk-averse justices. Second, the so-called narrowest grounds or Marks doctrine enforces the logic of the median voter theorem in cases presenting more than two options. This makes voting by otherwise indifferent or alienated justices rational, where it otherwise would not be. Although these explanations may not exhaust the multi-causal factors behind the robust phenomenon of zero abstention, they are the first attempt to rigorously analyze how two unique institutional judicial rules mitigate the incentive to abstain.

The basis for these evaluations is a database of price effects of 41 mergers compiled from published retro-spective studies of mergers.

The aim is to provide the various private and public decision makers with information that could allow them to better understand the current market penetration of the various automotive technologies and to predict the future one. It is found that the car operated by conventional fuels (gasoline, diesel) is currently the least expensive as far as the total costs of ownership are concerned. The bi-fuel liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and the bi-fuel compressed natural gas (CNG) internal combustion engine vehicles are in the same price range. Both the battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and, especially, the hybrid ICE Vs are more expensive. On the contrary, the social lifecycle costs of the BEVs are the lowest, thanks not only to their zero air pollutants' emissions in the use phase but also to their reduced noise emissions. The amount of the social costs relative to the total cost of ownership, estimated using recent European parameters, represents at the most 6% of the total cost. Consequently, even if the external costs were internalized, the alternative fuel vehicles would not become convenient for the final consumer from a monetary point of view. Considering the energy consumption, with the 2011 Italian energy production mix, the BEVs and the diesel hybrid are the most energy efficient cars. Focusing on 7 specific models, and simulating realistic scenarios, it is found that the relative ranking of the BEVs in terms of total costs improves moderately when the traveled distance increases, subsidies are introduced and battery price drops. However, the BEVs become convenient only when the annual distance traveled is at least 20,000 km, a value much higher than the current Italian average and posing serious issues in terms of vehicles' range. Only a joint reduction of the battery price to (sic) 240/kWh from initial estimated cost of (sic) 412/kWh and the introduction of a subsidy would make the BEVs competitive with the current average Italian annual distance traveled.

Research has focused on two potential mechanisms: a firm effect, with diversity at the firm level improving knowledge sourcing or ideas generation, and a city effect, where diverse cities help firms innovate. This article uses a dataset of over 2000 UK small-and medium-sized enterprises to test between these two. Controlling for firm characteristics, city characteristics and firm and city diversity, there is strong evidence for the firm effect. Firms with a greater share of migrant owners or partners are more likely to introduce new products and processes. This effect has diminishing returns, suggesting that it is a 'diversity' effect rather than simply the benefits of migrant run firms. However, there is no relationship between the share of foreign workers in a local labour market or fractionalization by country of birth and firm level innovation, nor do migrant-run firms in diverse cities appear particularly innovative. But urban context does matter and firms in London with more migrant owners and partners are more innovative than others. Firms in cities with high levels of human capital are also more innovative.","London Sch Econ, Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lee, N (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",n.d.lee@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,45,59,63,2,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We consider the question of how to use sensitivity statistics in practice, and in particular, how to judge whether the sensitivity is large or small. For this purpose, we distinguish between absolute and relative sensitivity, and highlight the context-dependent nature of sensitivity analysis. The relative sensitivity is then applied to forecast combinations, and sensitivity-based weights are introduced. All of the concepts are illustrated using the European yield curve. In this context, it is natural to consider the sensitivity to autocorrelation and normality assumptions. Different forecasting models are combined using equal, fit-based and sensitivity-based weights, and compared with the multivariate and random walk benchmarks. We show that the fit-based and sensitivity-based weights are complementary, but that the sensitivity-based weights perform better than other weights for long-term maturities.

Although China's expressway infrastructure originates from June 1984, this relatively late initiation still clearly demonstrates the characteristics of rapid expansion, which forms an interesting context for an analysis of regulatory policies. Based on levels of economic development and geography, China can be divided into three macro regions, i.e. eastern, central and western regions. The rapid development of expressway infrastructure, the pattern of investment, the sources of financing and regional differences in investment in the three macro regions are described. Finally, an ex-post evaluation of the principles underpinning the evolution of regulatory policies for expressway infrastructure in China is carried out, based on a qualitative equity and economic efficiency framework.

In the United States, federal budgetary funds are allocated based on performance outputs and national economic development benefits and clear priority is given to commercial harbours and navigation channels over recreational harbours. This has created significant difficulties particularly when it comes to dredging during this current period of extremely low water levels. Recreational boating advocates argue that boating is too economically important not to maintain and enhance these recreational harbours, and even more so because of the economic downturn in many regions. Considering these backgrounds, this study provides a review of different methods for estimating the economic impacts of water based recreation activities, including recreational boating, fishing and cruise ship, which are benefited from US Army Corps of Engineers' navigation projects. This paper in further demonstrates the proposed methods by a simulation tool, RECONS (Regional Economic System), developed for US Army Corps of Engineers. This study includes a review of various methods (e.g., surveys) for estimating spending (e.g., annual craft, trip spending) required for use in economic impact assessment models. It will also discuss the importance of and alternative ways to produce reliable estimates of boating use (e.g., boating trips), including several recent surveys designed and conducted by the authors. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the recreational uses of Inland Waterways and develops economic impacts spending frameworks for different types of recreational activities. This was rarely done by previous studies.","[Cui, Yue; Mahoney, Ed] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Chang, Wen-Huei; Mahoney, Ed] US Army Corps Engineers, Inst Water Resources, Washington, DC USA",Michigan State University; United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,"Cui, Y (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",cuiyue@msu.edu,,,,,,,23,2,2,0,13,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",0391-8440,,,INT J TRANSP ECON,Int.

We examine the overlap between fuel poverty (based on three self-report items) and poverty in general - with a particular emphasis on the national indicator of basic deprivation which is used in the measurement of poverty for policy purposes in Ireland. We examine changes in the overlap between 2004 and 2011 and the risk factors for fuel poverty compared to those for deprivation more generally. The paper concludes, based on evidence from factor analysis and multinomial regression, that fuel poverty is better regarded as an aspect of low living standards rather than being a distinct dimension of deprivation.","[Watson, Dorothy; Maitre, Bertrand] Dublin Trinity Coll Dublin, Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Watson, D (通讯作者)，Dublin Trinity Coll Dublin, Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",dorothy.watson@esri.ie; bertrand.maitre@esri.ie,,,"ESRI Energy Policy Research Centre; Ireland's Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; ESB; BGE; Eirgrid; Viridian; Commission for Energy Regulation (CER)","ESRI Energy Policy Research Centre; Ireland's Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; ESB; BGE; Eirgrid; Viridian; Commission for Energy Regulation (CER)","The authors are grateful for comments received from ESRI colleagues, especially Sean Lyons.

Furthermore, China is also different from other Asian countries and regions, for example, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, in terms of the social and political context. The small-world network thereby plays quite a different role in innovation in China. This paper expands on the existing studies by examining the impact of the small-world network on firm innovation performance using both quantity and quality measurements. With the intra-firm level patent collaboration data from China, we find that a more clustered patent collaboration network has a negative impact on firm innovation performance. Patent collaboration networks with greater small worldliness would harm firm innovation performance in China, which is quite different from the role played by small worldliness in western and other Asian countries. The path length has a negative impact, and the size of the connected component has a positive impact on firm innovation, which is similar to the role of small-world networks in western and other Asian countries. Our finding is suggestive to the firm managers who face the collectivist culture of China, which has greater emphasis on hierarchy and bureaucracy.","[Zhang, Gupeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Duan, Hongbo] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jianghua] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Business, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Beijing Normal University","Zhou, JH (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Business, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",zhoujh@bnu.edu.cn,,"Duan, Hongbo/0000-0001-5143-4413","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC [71402175, 71202116]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9144036]; Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund Project [13YJC630219]","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund Project","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC [71402175][71202116], Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9144036], Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund Project [13YJC630219].",,62,8,8,1,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

That case, the Boral case, decided by the High Court in 2003, raised a number of interesting issues with regard to whether and how the test that was proposed by Areeda and Turner should be employed to deal with price cuts by large firms that are aimed at competitors. Equally important, the case raised some fundamental questions about whether there was a serious gap in the Australian equivalent of Section 2 of the Sherman Act-Section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, formerly the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA)-which made it difficult to challenge predatory conduct. Boral led immediately to some radical changes in the TPA; but, even today, more than 10 years after Boral, Australians are still struggling to develop the right statutory framework to deal with predatory pricing. This paper will describe the Boral case, discuss how the Australian courts, including the High Court, attempted to apply the A-T test to the facts of the case, and survey and comment on the ongoing legislative turmoil that followed from High Court's decision.","[Hay, Deirdre L.; Hay, George A.] Cornell Univ, Cornell Law Sch, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Hay, GA (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Cornell Law Sch, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",gah7@cornell.edu,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Our methodological approach is innovative: we consider several specifications for the conditional density and combinations schemes. Our results are as follows: the entire density is predicted under combination schemes as applied to univariate GARCH models with Gaussian innovations; the Bayesian winner in relation to GARCH-skewed-t models is informative about the 5% value at risk; the average realised utility of a mean-variance investor is maximised under the Bayesian winner as applied to GARCH models with symmetric Student t innovations. Our results have two implications: the best prediction model depends on the evaluation criterion; and combination schemes outperform individual models.

This study investigates the relationship between Integrated Multimodal Travel Information (IMTI) service and holiday travel behavior characteristics in a trip chain. The Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) method is first used to extract the common factors based on the RP-SP fusion data under the pre-trip IMTI and en-route IMTI services, respectively. The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method is then applied to examine causal effects and quantitative relationships between the influencing factors and trip chain characteristics based on the EFA results. The results show that pre-trip IMTI has a significant negative effect on the holiday travel behavior. The more pre-trip IMTI is obtained by the traveler, the simpler the trip chain spatiotemporal and structural complexity will be. In addition, although the effect of en-route IMTI is less than pre-trip IMTI, it still plays an important role compared to other factors. Therefore, providing IMTI is a new and good alternative to alleviate holiday traffic congestions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigate the effects of changes in the gender wage gap, the quantitative impact of technological improvements in the production of nonmarket goods, and the potential inferiority of nonmarket goods in explaining the dramatic change in labor supply. We find that small decreases in the gender wage gap can simultaneously explain the significant increases in the average hours worked by married women and the relative constancy in the hours worked by single women and by single and married men. We also find that the impact of technological improvements in the household on married female hours and on the relative wage of females to males is too small for realistic values. Some specifications of the inferiority of home goods match the hours patterns, but they have counterfactual predictions for wages and expenditure patterns.","[Jones, Larry E.; McGrattan, Ellen R.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Jones, Larry E.; McGrattan, Ellen R.] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Manuelli, Rodolfo E.] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Manuelli, Rodolfo E.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Federal Reserve System - USA; Washington University (WUSTL); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Jones, LE (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",lej@umn.edu,,,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Elizabeth Caucutt, Nezih Guner, John Kennan, Derek Neal, Ananth Seshadri, and Michele Tertilt for useful discussions and the National Science Foundation for financial support.
