They also explore the extent to which people's objective and subjective measures of WC influence WTP. The results suggest that people's stated perceptions (importance and satisfaction) and the interaction between them have a significant influence on WTP. Those for whom WC was very important and who were very satisfied with WC were willing to pay more to preserve it. The importance variable interacts with subjective perceptions that drive behaviour. Thus one needs to consider not only satisfaction, but also the importance of the environment rather than using only subjective (or objective) measures when trying to explain behaviour. Further deterioration in WC could adversely affect the tourism industry and the average visitor would be willing to pay up to A$ 14.5 per visit to help improve it (although this amount varies for different visitors).","[Farr, Marina; Stoeckl, Natalie; Esparon, Michelle; Larson, Silva; Jarvis, Diane] James Cook Univ, Coll Business Law & Governance, Univ Dr, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",James Cook University,"Farr, M (通讯作者)，James Cook Univ, Coll Business Law & Governance, Univ Dr, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",marina.farr@jcu.edu.au,"Stoeckl, Natalie/AAU-8562-2020; Farr, Marina/AGG-2888-2022; Jarvis, Diane/R-9166-2017","Stoeckl, Natalie/0000-0001-5899-4771; Jarvis, Diane/0000-0003-4822-8736",Tropical Ecosystems Hub part of the Australian Government's Commonwealth National Environmental Research Program; Australian Government's Caring for our Country; Australian Institute of Marine Science,Tropical Ecosystems Hub part of the Australian Government's Commonwealth National Environmental Research Program; Australian Government's Caring for our Country(Australian Government); Australian Institute of Marine Science,"This study was funded by the Tropical Ecosystems Hub, part of the Australian Government's Commonwealth National Environmental Research Program.

Serious problems of child malnutrition and illiteracy are prevalent and its economy centres on the primary sector across a large swathe of its territory. The major socio-economic inequality undermines social cohesion in the country and, therefore, increases the risk of social tension. However, Peru has significant and diverse resources which, if managed in accordance with World Tourism Organization's sustainable tourism guidelines, could promote development through better distribution of income and help to eliminate poverty. The promotion of sustainable tourism could increase social cohesion and lessen social tension. Hence, this research identifies the regional inequalities in Peru's tourism activity and suggests measures for promoting the most disadvantaged areas. The methodology used is based on the concept of polarization traditionally applied to income distribution studies.

Traditional discrete choice models mainly incorporate individual decision-making mechanisms ignoring the household context. In reality, each household member's travel choice often depends on the decision of the other members. We propose a new estimation method that assumes each travel decision depends on intra-household interactions. Using Bayesian estimation we develop a spatial multivariate tobit specification that allows for each individual facing a set of potential destinations to take into account the willingness to travel of other household members. Using a unique dataset containing more than 67,000 trips made by more than 3500 individuals in the area of Greater Cincinnati, we show that depending on the purpose of the trip, household members do interact and accommodate their travel decisions with respect to other household members.

In examining the magnitudes of the income and substitution effects of a change in real wages, the income effect is found to outweigh its substitution effect, indicating that a rise in income resulting from a higher wage increases tourist expenditure in the USA.

This article proposes a combination of wavelet and Postfix-GP, a postfix notation based genetic programming system, for financial time series prediction. The discrete wavelet transform approach is used to smoothen the time series by separating the fluctuations from the trend of the series. Postx-GP is then employed to evolve models for the smoothen series. The out-of-sample prediction capability of evolved solutions is tested on two stocks price and two stock indexes series.

To address this concern, when the U.S. Congress passed the Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community (EZ/EC) program, it included an antipirating provision prohibiting use of grants for business relocation. Later iterations of the EZs and Renewal Communities (RCs) received tax incentives only. The RC program did not include an antipirating provision. Did businesses relocate? This study compares business moves within 1,000 feet inside a given RC/EZ with moves within 1,000 feet outside the RC/EZ before and after the intervention. Data are from the National Establishment Time Series (NETS) Database for California and Tennessee. Moves into some RC/EZs increased but so did moves out, leading to no statistically significant net change in numbers of firms. There were no obvious differences between RCs and EZs.

To set the rate a mathematic model based on the Macroeconomic Forecast of the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic and the empirical relationship called Okun's law can be created. The essential prerequisite for that is to eliminate differences resulting from different utilization of production capacities and changing rate of economic activity of the population in the course of time. The proposed model is not very complicated, it works with several simplified assumptions, but its advantage is the possibility for continual involvement of more and more complicated parameters of the real economy. Nevertheless, even in its basic form the model provides good results, which are in compliance with theoretical starting points and observed facts.","[Adamek, Petr; Dobrylovsky, Jiri] Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Adámek, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",adamek@vse.cz; dobrylov@vse.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1,9,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100001,0

This paper focuses on a comparison of the approaches to the application of the Taguchi approach in manufacturing and services and highlights some differences that need to be respected to assess the full potential of the Taguchi method. The focus is not only on the parameters to which the Taguchi loss function is applied, but also measures to reduce possible deviations. The study shows how the Taguchi loss function can be used when determining the basic success factors for the selection of control elements and their tolerances for manufacturing as well as the service sector. The examples highlight the need not only for different approaches in the methods used, but also the selection of measures to reduce quality costs. In the service sector, a Service Level Agreement approach is used, which takes into account a service guarantee.","[Budaj, Pavol] Catholic Univ Ruzomberok, Fac Pedag, Dept Management, Ruzomberok, Slovakia; [Hrnciar, Miroslav] Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Zilina, Slovakia",Catholic University Ruzomberok; University of Zilina,"Budaj, P (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Ruzomberok, Fac Pedag, Dept Management, Ruzomberok, Slovakia.",pavol.budaj@ku.sk; miroslav.hrnciar@fri.uniza.sk,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,103,107,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500018,0

Exploiting the fact that transactions occur over space and time, we propose a two-stage approach based on instrumental variables (IV) built from information collected from previous transactions. The unidirectional temporal property and the fact that other transactions are exogenous from the perspective of a single buyer or seller are exploited to evaluate the effect of the sale price on time-on-the-market, and the effect of time-on-the-market on the sale price. Based on 29,471 transactions occurring in the suburban neighborhood of Montreal (1992-2000), the results suggest that, everything else being equal, houses staying longer on the market provide negative information to the market, which results in a lower final sale price, while the final sale price is negatively related to time-on-the-market, indicating that houses of better quality (better amenities) stay less time on the market.","[Dube, Jean] Univ Laval, Ecole Super Amenagement Terr & Dev Reg ESAD, 2325 Rue Bibliotheques, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Legros, Diego] Univ Bourgogne, Lab Econ Dijon LEDi, 2 Blvd Gabriel, F-24100 Dijon, France",Laval University; Universite de Bourgogne,"Dubé, J (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Ecole Super Amenagement Terr & Dev Reg ESAD, 2325 Rue Bibliotheques, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",jean.dube@esad.ulaval.ca; diego.legros@u-bourgone.fr,"Dubé, Jean/L-1751-2019","Dubé, Jean/0000-0003-3445-3449",Agence Metropolitaine de Transport (AMT); Fonds de recherche du Quebec - societe et culture (FRQSC),Agence Metropolitaine de Transport (AMT); Fonds de recherche du Quebec - societe et culture (FRQSC)(Fonds de recherche du Quebec (FRQ)Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Societe et culture (FRQSC)),This research was partly funded by the Agence Metropolitaine de Transport (AMT) and by the Fonds de recherche du Quebec - societe et culture (FRQSC).

Persimmon were packed using two types of packaging materials: plain cardboard boxes and cardboard boxes with modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) using 40-mu m thick low density polyethylene (LDPE) film as an inner packaging material. These fruits were exported to Hong Kong via sea for 7 days using reefer containers at set temperatures of 2 degrees C and 15 degrees C. After delivery, the fruits were stored at 10 degrees C and room temperature for 6 days. The number of softened fruits in each test was counted on the day of delivery and on every second day during storage. The softening of fruit was judged directly by touch and fruits that had even slightly softened were regarded as softened fruits. Simultaneously a laboratory test was conducted under conditions mimicking the transport conditions to determine the effect of MAP on persimmon quality based on the evaluation of headspace O-2 and CO2 concentration inside the package, fruit skin color, and ion leakage. The number of softened fruit was less at 2 degrees C than at 15 degrees C transportation temperatures on the day of delivery, but during shelf-life conditions at both 10 degrees C and room temperature, the number of softened fruit increased rapidly on the fruit that was transported at 2 degrees C. These results indicate that the selection of an appropriate transportation temperature, considering the chilling sensitivity of 'Jiro' persimmon fruits, is very important to increase the number of marketable fruits, thereby increasing its overseas trade value. Storage at room temperature after transportation prolonged the shelf-life of fruits better than those stored at 10 degrees C. Using MAP was more effective at preventing quality loss of persimmon not only on the delivery day but also on the day after delivery. 'Wase-Jiro', which is an early-ripening type, was more sensitive to chilling than 'Futsu-Jiro', which is a middle-ripening type. Moreover, it was found that high-grade persimmon is more suitable for export. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Motivated by this, we propose a model in which large-scale decision-making takes place through a sequence of small group interactions. Our model considers a group of participants, each having an opinion which together form a graph. We show that for median graphs, a class of graphs including grids and trees, it is possible to use a small number of three-person interactions to tightly approximate the wisdom of the crowd, defined here to be the generalized median of participant opinions, even when agents are strategic. Interestingly, we also show that this sharply contrasts with small groups of size two, for which we prove an impossibility result. Specifically, we show that it is impossible to use sequences of two-person interactions satisfying natural axioms to find a tight approximation of the generalized median, even when agents are non-strategic. Our results demonstrate the potential of small group interactions for reaching global decision-making properties.","[Goel, Ashish; Lee, David T.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Goel, A (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",ashishg@stanford.edu; davidtlee@stanford.edu,,,,,,,43,7,10,0,3,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,287,303,,10.1145/2940716.2940722,0.0,,,17,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300025,0

Preferences were elicited under rank-dependent utility for prospects with two or three consequences expressed either in time or in monetary units. Probabilities were unknown but learned through sampling. More specifically, time and money were compared under two conditions. In a first experiment, both consequences and probabilities of prospects were unknown and learned through sequential sampling. In a second experiment, the possible consequences were revealed after the sampling. A real incentive system was implemented for both time and money. The heterogeneity of preferences was assessed for time and for money through individual and mixed modeling estimations. We observe that the nature of consequences (time or money) modifies probability weighting in terms of elevation and sensitivity. Subjects exhibit more optimism and less sensitivity to probability changes when deciding about time than about money. Revealing the consequences impacts the shape of the utility function and leaves probability weighting unchanged. We also observe that the real incentives have no effect except for the reduction in decision errors. This effect is stronger for money than for time.","[Kemel, Emmanuel] GREGHEC, Nantes, France; [Kemel, Emmanuel] Cerema, Nantes, France; [Travers, Muriel] Univ Angers, UMR Granem, Angers, France",Universite d'Angers,"Kemel, E (通讯作者)，GREGHEC, Nantes, France.;Kemel, E (通讯作者)，Cerema, Nantes, France.",emmanuel.kemel@cerema.fr; muriel.travers@univ-angers.fr,,,MEDDE/DRI,MEDDE/DRI,"This project was part of a Ph.D dissertation, entitled Attitudes towards Uncertainty with Monetary and Time Consequences: Experimental Investigations.

This article seeks to discuss this disenchantment with Europe through a concept of political myth. It argues that political myths entail both narrations of communal origins and utopian horizons of the communal future. Drawing on insights from Lacanian psychoanalysis, it connects the utopian dimension of myth to the level of affective investment in political communities, and suggests that the disenchantment with the European project might be partly due to the fact that its original utopian horizon-that of peace in Europe-today seems to have been achieved.","[Kolvraa, Christoffer] Aarhus Univ, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Kolvraa, C (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Culture & Soc, Jens Chr Skous Vej 5,4, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",eurock@cas.au.dk,,,,,,,89,39,40,1,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

To a large extent, the use of euphemism depends on context. As a mass media, news reports provide us with a lot of information, covering all parts of the world, involving various fields, and deeply affect people's lives. The language of news report has the characteristics of accuracy, simplicity, authenticity and timeliness. In addition, the news media as a communication tool, but also has the characteristics of publicity, publicity and so on. Due to the vagueness and indirect features of euphemism, euphemism plays a special and important role in the news reports. The main function of euphemism is to protect the face from the author and the reader from all kinds of offensive, and ultimately safeguard the interests of politicians and the government.

The Czech economy is represented by a small dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of an open economy. The model economy consists of three types of agents: firms, households and central bank. Model parameters are estimated using the quarterly data of the Czech Republic for the period from the first quarter of 2000 to the last quarter of 2014. The comparison of two alternative wage setting model schemes shows that the Nash bargaining wage setting with the real wage persistence fits the data better than the Calvo type of wage rigidities modelling approach. The existence of hiring costs in the Czech economy was proved as significant and the estimated hiring costs account for 0.77% of the gross domestic product.","[Nemec, Daniel; Macicek, Martin] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Nemec, D (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",nemecd@econ.muni.cz; 369753@mail.muni.cz,"Němec, Daniel/H-2909-2013","Němec, Daniel/0000-0003-3065-8287",,,,,7,0,0,0,2,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,612,617,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500105,0

Often such a challenge is overcome by focusing mainly on how integration occurred/occurs and the associated classical theories of integration. However, this article argues that we do our students a disservice by ignoring an extant theoretical plurality, and perhaps never more so than in the context of the current crisis and its multiple effects. In particular, the crisis heightens the imperative for engagement with questions posed by what this special issue calls ' dissident ' theoretical approaches. Drawing on the experience of co-authoring a textbook on EU politics, the article considers some of the ways in which we might practically include such approaches, while remaining cognizant of pedagogical constraints.","[Parker, Owen] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Parker, O (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Northumberland Rd, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England.",o.parker@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,45,7,7,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We estimate this reduction using an econometric approach and give a quantitative overview of the financial situation of conventional generators. Our results indicate that investments in new conventional capacities are economically unviable. With the current market design, this situation is going to impact supply security at least in the long run. A popular approach to address this issue is the introduction of additional public support for conventional power plants. However, we believe that subsidizing renewable and conventional capacities contradicts the idea of a liberal market. We present two alternatives: State control of investments in renewables through auctions (as proposed by the European Commission), and a premium paid to representatives of the demand side (such as retailers) independence of their shares of renewables.","[Praktiknjo, Aaron] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav FCN, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Erdmann, Georg] TU Berlin, Dept Energy Engn, Chair Energy Syst Einsteinufer 25 TA 8, D-10587 Berlin, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; Technical University of Berlin,"Praktiknjo, A (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav FCN, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",aaron.praktiknjo@rwth-aachen.de; georg.erdmann@tu-berlin.de,"Praktiknjo, Aaron/O-6105-2017; Praktiknjo, Aaron/AAX-4381-2020","Praktiknjo, Aaron/0000-0002-2151-4241; Praktiknjo, Aaron/0000-0002-2151-4241",,,,,11,25,25,0,3,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2016,37.0,,,,2,,89,106,,10.5547/01956574.37.SI2.apra,0.0,,,18,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EY5JX,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000404014600008,0

The bankruptcy criminal offenses are classic delicta propria and the perpetrators are either the responsible persons within a legal person or the debtors - individuals over which the bankruptcy proceedings may be instituted based on provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. However, in case of criminal offense of false bankruptcy the problem appears at the determining of a circle of persons being responsible for commitment of that offense, which is contributed to by the interpretation of a legal system for this criminal offense. The bankruptcy as a legally defined procedure that is conducted over the debtor's estate for the purpose of making a settlement to creditors indicates at the importance of the protection of creditors but also of adjudicated bankrupts as well as the protection of general public interests with the goal to prevent the commitment of bankruptcy criminal offenses. The aim of false bankruptcy regulating is to point out to the responsibility of persons which appear before and during the bankruptcy proceedings since the commitment of this offense requires a direct intention as a severe aspect of guilt. The determination of criminal responsibility of perpetrator is based, inter alia, on basic principles of obligatory commercial relations, principle of due care and diligence of a prudent businessman and principle of good faith. A specific feature of this criminal offense is that the causing of false bankruptcy is most often carried out over the corporate entities which were successfully running their business until the moment of committing the respective offense. The criminal offenses, committed in a privatisation process of public property, are committed very often but they are rarely prosecuted. For this reason the aim of this paper is to indicate at the importance of consistent implementation of legal provisions in the work of bankruptcy estate managers and registrars in bankruptcy, execution of the control of business activities of corporate entities and timely actions to be taken by the competent prosecutor's office in cases when the bankruptcy proceedings are suspended due to the lacking bankruptcy estate. Proving the direct intention of responsible persons is very difficult in practice, relativizing the determination of their criminal responsibility. With the aim of preventing the commitment of bankruptcy criminal offenses it is very important to have a concept of Actio Pauliana which is used for refuting the debtor's legal activities which impair the estate of the adjudicated bankrupt and violate the principle of equality of creditors.","[Primorac, Damir; Buhovac, Maja] Univ Mostar, Fac Law, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Mostar,"Primorac, D (通讯作者)，Univ Mostar, Fac Law, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg.",damir.primorac@primorac-partners.com; majabuhovac@yahoo.com.hr,,,,,,,17,0,0,1,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,2,12,,,,,,11,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400001,0

The basic ingredients of rendang are beef meat, coconut milk and spices. The process of cooking rendang took around 6 to 7 hours at the temperature around 80-95 degrees C. There are 3 types of food will be produce during the cooking processes differentiated by water content and colors. They are as following: gulai (cooked until the sauce became thin and yellowish), kalio (cooked until the sauce was thick brown color) and rendang (cooked until the sauce was thick and dry and dark brown color). As the food is cooked in a relatively longer period of time and with various ingredients it is interesting to know the nutritional value of the food. This paper is presenting a preliminary results of the research which aim to evaluate the nutritional value of rendang by analyzing the chemistry compositions, protein digestibility (in-vitro), the profile of amino acid (HPLC), and measuring molecule weight of protein (SDS-PAGE). The result shown that the protein in rendang is decreased compare to fresh meat and kalio. The protein digestibility decreased in rendang compare to fresh meat and kalio and the amino acid content is decreased in rendang compare to fresh meat and kalio. The protein band is increased from fresh meat to kalio and rendang, where in fresh meat have 15 protein bands, 16 in kalio and 17 in rendang.

Soil hydrological studies in North-East Germany were carried out in different scales, starting with laboratory, lysimeter measurements and in the field. The measurements of soil hydrological properties were executed with the Extended Evaporation Method (EEM) and the HYPROP device. A method for quantifying deep seepage and solute leaching under field conditions was developed, tested and applied at more than 40 soil hydrological field plots in NE Germany. The hypothesis was confirmed that arable land constitutes the main source of deep drainage and groundwater recharge in Northeast Germany. Deep seepage was strongly reduced under forest. For decision support on landscape renovation and land rededication by afforestation in NE Germany the seepage reduction under forest is to be taken into consideration, especially with respect to the conservation or restoration of wetlands in regions with negative climatic water balance. The EEM and the soil hydrological field method so called virtual lysimeter have the potential for the improvement of soil hydrological studies in Asia as a whole.

According to the first, this was an impartial story involving executive constraints, shared governance, increased monitoring, and increased transparency - in other words things that sound unambiguously good. According to the second narrative this was a story of distributive politics. States had the best access to credit when institutions gave government creditors privileged access to decision making while restricting the influence of those who paid the taxes to reimburse debts. This was a situation where institutions fostered commitment, but at a cost, and sometimes they may not even have been welfare enhancing. In this paper I present evidence from seven centuries of European history, and I suggest that available data support the distributive politics interpretation. I then draw implications for how we think about the politics of sovereign debt today. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Our community has contributed, among other things, new models (notably stochastic) and extensions to the classical formulations to address the issues that arise from practical needs. In this paper, we propose a new generalization based on matroids and show that many of the previous results extend to this more general setting. Because of the rich structures and expressive power of matroids, our new setting is potentially of interest both in theory and in practice. In the classical version of the problem, the offline side of a bipartite graph is known initially while vertices from the online side arrive one at a time along with their incident edges. The objective is to maintain a decent approximate matching from which no edge can be removed. Our generalization, called Matroid Online Bipartite Matching, additionally requires that the set of matched offline vertices be independent in a given matroid. In particular, the case of partition matroids corresponds to the natural scenario where each advertiser manages multiple ads with a fixed total budget. Our algorithms attain the same performance as the classical version of the problems considered, which are often provably the best possible. We present 1-1/e-competitive algorithms for Matroid Online Bipartite Matching under the small bid assumption, as well as a 1-1/e-competitive algorithm for Matroid Online Bipartite Matching in the random arrival model. A key technical ingredient of our results is a carefully designed primal-dual waterfilling procedure that accommodates for matroid constraints. This is inspired by the extension of our recent charging scheme for Online Bipartite Vertex Cover. Finally, given that only few online problems were studied in the submodular fashion, the techniques introduced in this paper for tackling submodularity in the online setting may be of independent interest.","[Wang, Yajun] Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA 98052 USA; [Wong, Sam Chiu-Wai] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA",Microsoft; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Wang, YJ (通讯作者)，Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.",,,,Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations [1408635] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),,,19,2,3,0,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,437,454,,10.1145/2940716.2940793,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300036,0

In this paper, we revisit data for the Italian interbank network based on overnight loans recorded on the e-MID trading platform during the period 1999-2010 using both daily and quarterly aggregates. In contrast to previous reports, we find no evidence in favor of a power-law characterizing the degree distribution. Rather, the data are best described by negative Binomial distributions. For quarterly data, Weibull, Gamma, and Exponential distributions tend to provide comparable fits. We find similar results when investigating the distribution of the number of transactions, even though in this case, the tails of the quarterly variables are much fatter. The absence of power-law behavior casts doubts on previous claims that these interbank data fall into the category of scale-free networks.","[Fricke, Daniel] Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England; [Fricke, Daniel] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, CABDyN Complex Ctr, Oxford OX1 1HP, England; [Fricke, Daniel] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Lux, Thomas] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Lux, Thomas] Univ Jaume 1, Banco Espana Chair Computat Econ, Castellon de La Plana 12071, Spain",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel; Universitat Jaume I,"Fricke, D (通讯作者)，Oxford Martin Sch, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England.",daniel.fricke@sbs.ox.ac.uk; lux@economics.uni-kiel.de,,,European Union Seventh Framework Programme [619255]; FP-7 [CRISIS-ICT-2011-288501],European Union Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)); FP-7,The article is part of a research initiative launched by the Leibniz Community.

Specifically, I first extend the maxmin expected utility theory and get a representation of beliefs such that the probabilistic beliefs over each ambiguous event are represented by a non-degenerate interval, while the ones over each unambiguous event are represented by a number. I then consider a class of the biseparable preferences. Two representation results are achieved and can be used to identify the unambiguity in the context of the biseparable preferences. Finally a subjective definition of ambiguity is suggested.

Using the bounds testing to cointegration procedure and data for the period 1960-2011, the paper finds that in the long run both US exports and imports of tourism are highly responsive to changes in real income, implying that the relative growth of foreign to domestic income is the key determinant of the US tourism trade balance. The real exchange rate is found to be a significant long-run factor affecting that balance. This finding indicates that an appreciation (depreciation) of US dollars deteriorates (improves) the US tourism trade balance. In the short run, income tends to have a significant impact on US exports and imports of tourism.","[Chi, Junwook] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Travel Ind Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Chi, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Travel Ind Management, 2560 Campus Rd,George Hall 346, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",jwchi@hawaii.edu,,"Chi, Junwook/0000-0002-8496-5285",,,,,25,19,20,1,9,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Although callings have generally been referred to as positive and fulfilling to the individual and as beneficial to society, researchers have also suggested there is a dark side' to calling, and have drawn attention to the potential conflicts and tensions inherent in the pursuit of calling, especially for women. This article explores these themes through the first-hand experiences of one woman who felt called to work as a priest. Her narrative illustrates how callings draw the individual irresistibly towards a particular line of work. It also shows how calling work can be both satisfying individually and beneficial to the wider community but, at the same time, involves sacrifice, compromise and a willingness to defer personal rewards.","[Madden, Adrian] Univ Sussex, Sch Business & Management, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Bailey, Catherine] Univ Sussex, Sch Business & Management, Management, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Kerr, Reverend Canon Jean] Diocese Rochester, Rochester, Kent, England",University of Sussex; University of Sussex,"Madden, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Business & Management, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",a.madden@sussex.ac.uk,"Bailey, Catherine/JPK-5151-2023","Bailey, Catherine/0000-0002-8741-3072",University of Kent; University of Sussex,University of Kent; University of Sussex,This research study was funded by the University of Kent and the University of Sussex.,,19,15,18,2,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Using a new dataset linking census data on childhood household characteristics to adult outcomes from military enlistment records, I show that families with a child in utero during the pandemic shifted resources to the child's older siblings, leading to significantly higher educational attainments for these older siblings. These results suggest that the reallocation of household resources in response to a negative childhood health shock tended to reinforce rather than compensate for differences in endowments across children.

The literature to date has ignored the fact, and a fortiori the consequences, that powers of integrated processes are themselves not integrated processes. The paper explains why standard methods should not be applied and discusses some recently proposed viable estimation and testing approaches for cointegrating polynomial regressions. The application to CO2 and SO2 emissions data shows that using appropriate methods leads to strongly reduced evidence for a cointegrating EKC compared to typical but conceptually not sound findings.

With a dataset of 1.34 million REO sale transactions, across 16 CBSAs between 2000 and 2012, we find three noteworthy empirical findings. First, a high REO sale concentration in a market increases the foreclosure discount. Second, foreclosure discount is negatively related to recent house-price appreciation.

This represents a significant civil engineering infrastructure asset that currently contributes to the provision of a sustainable transport mode option nationwide. Commuting and recreational cyclists have observed the often hazardous conditions on these paths. There are various simple measures that could be taken to improve the maintenance of such off-road paths. Reliance on walk-over surveys (direct visual inspection) and path users notifying the local authority may not be tackling maintenance in a resource efficient manner. The proposed inspection method includes the use of an instrumented bicycle to examine cycle path condition through user perception of satisfaction and quality. A questionnaire was conducted to identify the attributes of off-road cycling infrastructure people find most important in relation to their personal satisfaction. An exploratory factor analysis was undertaken on perception study data to elucidate the determination of the variables associated with perceived user satisfaction. The study has shown that people find maintenance issues to be of high importance, especially surface issues. From exploratory factor analysis of results, satisfaction has been found to load with comfort and safety. Field testing was then conducted using subjective user opinions and objective vibration data. These results were then used to assist the creation of dedicated user perception based surface condition rating-scales. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Calvey, J. C.; Shackleton, J.

Much of the literature suggests that computers have also been appropriated as male machines. However, research from developing countries indicates findings to the contrary. This article argues that the relationship between technology and gender is not static. Rather, it alters with the changes in socio-cultural and economic context. Through the Indian example, it shows that the dynamic phase of society and economy has provided a veritable mix of factors that is propelling an upsurge of women in computer-related courses and professions. However, this is not an indication of a radical revolution in gender relations in society. Rather, it encapsulates the transition within developing countries like India and reflects continuity as well as change.

Certified firms complying with such requirements are able to supply some European retailers with products sold under their retailers' own private label. Our analysis revealed that certified firms were among the biggest and most productive firms in the sample. Then, based on recent developments in international economics, we propose a modification of Chaney's model and estimations to test for the hypothesis that entering retailer networks reduces export costs faced by certified firms to access European union (EU) markets. After controlling for size and productivity effects, model estimations show that French firms who adopt BRC and enter the corresponding network benefit from better access through a significant decrease in their entry costs to certain EU markets.","[Latouche, Karine; Chevassus-Lozza, Emmanuelle] INRA, LERECO, UR1134, F-44026 Nantes, France; [Chevassus-Lozza, Emmanuelle] AGROCAMPUS OUEST, Angers, France",INRAE; Institut Agro; Agrocampus Ouest,"Latouche, K (通讯作者)，INRA, LERECO, UR1134, F-44026 Nantes, France.",,,,"European Commission [FP7 FP7 - KBBE-2007-1.4-08, 212036]",European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The authors wish to thank Monique Harel and Vanessa Persillet-Shonkwiler from INRA LERECO for their helpful research assistance to gather the data.

For this reason, we consider European countries as a set of asymmetrically integrated variety of capitalism. The institutional configuration chosen by Europe to aggregate the many varieties of capitalism not only reduced the political autonomy of the single states, but effectively hindered the specific coordination mechanism of Southern European (SE) capitalism which was importantly based on state intervention as a structural element and on inflationary policies. Despite the deep market-oriented reforms this change caused both structural and macroeconomic unbalances. The aim of the paper is to integrate some principles of the variety of capitalism and the dynamics of institutional change with some insights inspired by the work of Arrighi to supply a synthetic and 'alternative' perspective on the difficult role that Southern countries are experiencing in Europe.","[Gambarotto, Francesca; Solari, Stefano] Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, I-35123 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Gambarotto, F (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ & Management, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",,,,European Community [225349],European Community,"We would like to thank Andrea Ginzburg and Hans Pitlik for their helpful comments on a previous version of this paper, as well as the participants in the AISRE, SASE and WWWforEurope at WIFO conferences where it was presented.

This line of inquiry leads me to identify VaR's (counter)performative effects and the way in which it produces banks as authoritative, responsible managers of an uncertain financial future. Viewing financial markets through the lens of Keynesian uncertainty and model performativity helps explain VaR's failures by revealing VaR to be an inherently limited and potentially destabilizing practice. Its use participates in the construction of a financial system that is only temporarily stable and controllable. At the same time, VaR is an important source of authority for banks vis-a-vis regulators and the public because it represents the future as statistically calculable and expert prediction as the optimal, objective mode of preparing for that future. This, in turn, makes less thinkable other responses to uncertainty - ones that might be better suited to contend with the possibility of devastating losses unforeseeable - and perhaps produced - by the widespread use of VaR.","Northwestern Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Evanston, IL 60201 USA",Northwestern University,"Lockwood, E (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Scott Hall,601 Univ Pl, Evanston, IL 60201 USA.",,,,,,,,89,59,59,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The two models considered in the paper differ in the source of the imperfection. In the signal model, the imperfection comes from imperfect observability of initial income gains from the investment, while in the option model, it comes from the stochastic nature of the income gains in the second period. In addition to providing the first treatment of this type of problem, the analysis shows that the influences of underlying parameters on whether or not the government waits to invest are similar in the two models.

Although the investigated time span is very short, the effect is small but statistically significant: a doubling in the ratio of foreign-born residents to the province population induces a significant increase in manufactures' value added with respect to services' value added between 12 and 21 per cent. These effects are more intense when considering an increase in foreign-born populations drawn from countries more different to Italy (in terms of GDP per capita and educational attainment). These results are compatible with the reduced form of a two-sector model where we assume that production is performed with one mobile factor and two sector-specific CES labor composites of simple and complex tasks. If migrants and natives have different productivity when performing simple or complex tasks, an inflow of migrants induces production restructuring in favor of the simple-task intensive sector.

We examine several possible reasons for the gap using the Chinese SAGE data. We first rule out differential reporting by gender as a possible explanation, exploiting information on anchoring vignettes in eight domains of health functioning. Decomposing the gap in general self-assessed health, we find that about 31% can be explained by socio-demographic factors, most of all by discrimination against women in education in the 20th century. A more complete specification including chronic conditions and health functioning fully explains the remainder of the gap (about 69%). Adding chronic conditions and health functioning also explains at least two thirds of the education contribution, suggesting how education may affect health. In particular, women's higher rates of arthritis, angina and eye diseases make the largest contributions to the gender health gap, by limiting mobility, increasing pain and discomfort, and causing sleep problems and a feeling of low energy.

Using a gravity model of China's imports for the years 1995-2009, we explore potential dynamics for this promise, uniquely accounting for market economy recognition and Taiwan recognition. The former is associated with increased imports, while the latter effect is ambiguous and statistically insignificant. Comparison of projected against actual imports across three growth-path-aligned economic geography typologies - resource-rich; landlocked and resource-poor; coastal and resource-poor - sets out China's imports trends in an abstract framework of African export potential. We find not only under' importing across a majority of resource-poor countries. We also find that current trade policy is the least applicable to these comparatively poor exporters' trade with China. If the latter are to serve a broader catalytic role in Africa's regional industrial transformation as compared to the role of coastal and resource-poor countries in regional economic transformation in Asia and Latin America, China-Africa trade and investment policies may need additional thinking.","[Johnston, Lauren A.; Wang, Yuesheng] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Int Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Morgan, Stephen L.] Univ Nottingham, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Morgan, Stephen L.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Contemporary Chinese Studies, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Morgan, Stephen L.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Hist & Philosoph Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Peking University; University of Nottingham Ningbo China; University of Nottingham Ningbo China; University of Melbourne,"Johnston, LA (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Int Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",,"Morgan, Stephen L/E-8430-2010; Johnston, Lauren/G-3344-2015","Johnston, Lauren/0000-0003-3205-8015; Morgan, Stephen/0000-0001-9455-9339",China Scholarship Council; World Bank,China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); World Bank(The World Bank India),"This research was undertaken with financial support from the China Scholarship Council and the World Bank.

This paper explores Hungary's financial nationalist turn and its surprisingly successful resistance to IMF and EU pressures to change course. We open by theorizing financial nationalism, and then trace its ideational roots and contemporary character in Hungary. We subsequently argue that two international factors ironically enabled Orban to take his financial nationalist ideas from theory to practice: 1) IMF and EU policies that first contributed to Fidesz's electoral victory and then made it difficult to counter Orban once in power; and 2) the tolerant behavior of international bond markets. In particular, Orban's willingness and ability to use unorthodox, financial nationalist policies to control government deficits and debt both reduced EU and IMF leverage over Hungary and encouraged bond markets to overlook the unsavory politics that produced those numbers.","[Johnson, Juliet] McGill Univ, Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ H2W 1S4, Canada; [Barnes, Andrew] Kent State Univ, Polit Sci, Kent, OH USA",McGill University; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kent State University Kent,"Johnson, J (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ H2W 1S4, Canada.",,,,Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The authors thank Askat Dukenbaev and Seckin Kostem for their research assistance and the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada for its research funding.

Using time series data from 1975 to 2011, we examine how households respond to unemployment rate shocks and estimate the length of time it takes for households to return to its original level in a vector autoregressive model. The results demonstrate that household formation falls in the quarter after unemployment increases, and that it can take up to 10 quarters to return its previous level. While this is a substantial length of time, one implication of these results is that even a permanent increase in the unemployment rate will not permanently affect housing formation in the long run.","[Choi, Jung Hyun; Painter, Gary] Univ So Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Lusk Ctr Real Estate, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Painter, G (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, Lusk Ctr Real Estate, Lewis Hall 312, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",choijung@usc.edu; gpainter@usc.edu,,,,,,,26,8,8,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

(IEEE Trans Autom Control 19:315-323, 1974) for evaluating the likelihood of a Linear Gaussian State Space System. We show that DSGE models are ideally suited for the use of these recursions, which work best when the number of states is much greater than the number of observables. In several examples, we show that there are substantial benefits to using the recursions, with likelihood evaluation up to five times faster. This gain is especially pronounced in light of the trivial implementation costs-no model modification is required.

This paper aims to discuss how to evaluate the default risk of bond portfolios by applying extreme value theory. Based on Black and Cox default approach, we propose a novel threshold default model and use extreme value theory to derive the distribution functions of the state variables. To some extent, our model can be regarded as the counterpart of CreditMetrics, which is based on Merton approach. According to multivariate extreme value theory, extreme value copula is applicable to build the dependence between the state variables; on the other hand, it is more probable that default clustering occurs in the same region or sector in reality. Taking these into account, we adopt hierarchical Gumbel copulas, which are tail-dependent extreme value copulas and can group the bonds by regions or sectors, to link the state variables. An empirical bond portfolio is used to illustrate the model. The results show that, compared with CreditMetrics and the simple Gumbel copula model, the extremal tail of the distribution of loss from default in the proposed model is heavier. Consequently, the proposed model seems relatively conservative in terms of stress testing.","[Ma, Yong] Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha 410079, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhengjun] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Zhang, Weiguo] S China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xu, Weidong] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou 310085, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Hunan University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; South China University of Technology; Zhejiang University,"Ma, Y (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha 410079, Hunan, Peoples R China.",mymathf@gmail.com; zjz@wisc.edu; wgzhang@scut.edu.cn; weidxu@zju.edu.cn,,"Ma, Yong/0000-0001-7532-8412",Major Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China [11ZD156],Major Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This research was partially supported by the Major Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 11&ZD156).,,27,3,4,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

While its contribution has been much debated within sociological and gender specific journals, its use still remains relatively limited within studies of work and employment relations. It is argued here that this field of study would benefit from greater engagement with and understanding of an intersectional approach to both the design and interpretation of research. Two lines of reasoning are put forward for this contention: firstly, that the intersectional approach contains an important caution against over-generalization that has been obscured; secondly, that separating the challenge for all academics to be more intersectionally sensitive from the methodological challenges of taking an intersectional approach brings the significance of intersectionality into sharper relief.","[McBride, Anne; Hebson, Gail] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Employment Studies, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England; [Holgate, Jane] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Work & Employment Relat, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Manchester; University of Leeds,"McBride, A (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Booth St East, Manchester M15 6PB, Lancs, England.",a.mcbride@manchester.ac.uk,,"Hebson, Gail/0000-0003-0943-9848; McBride, Anne/0000-0003-1047-1319",,,,,43,134,165,0,70,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

In this period domestic generation capacity, both centralized and decentralized, as well as the cross-border transmission capacity increased. Using hourly plant-level data of centralized units and engineering-costs estimates, we estimate the weighted average Lerner index. During super peak hours, the annual average value of this index decreased from 0.23 in 2006 to 0.03 in 2011, indicating more competition. We find indications that the increase in competition can be attributed to the extension of cross-border connections, a higher price elasticity of net demand and more Bertrand-like competition. Enhancing the role of decentralized generation as well as fostering integration of markets seem to be effective measures to promote competition.","[Mulder, Machiel] Netherlands Author Consumers & Markets ACM, The Hague, Netherlands; [Mulder, Machiel] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ Econometr & Finance, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Mulder, M (通讯作者)，ACM, POB 16326, NL-2500 BH The Hague, Netherlands.",machiel.mulder@acm.nl,,,,,,,45,10,10,0,15,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,APR,2015,36.0,2.0,,,,,1,28,,10.5547/01956574.36.2.1,0.0,,,28,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CH5JS,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354072500002,0

In order to do this, one must first explain the reasons for the explosive growth of shadow banking in the immediate pre-crisis era. Current explanations for this growth tend to hold two contrasting positions: one emphasising factors endogenous to the banking sector (notably regulatory arbitrage and financial innovation); the other emphasising exogenous factors (notably the 'search for yield'). Integrating these two explanations, in this article we develop a disaggregated view of the shadow banking system. After clarifying the nature of the relation between the regulated and shadow banking systems, we inquire more closely into the different entities that inhabit the shadow banking system, the different activities that these entities performed and the different financial products that these entities supplied. The disaggregated view of shadow banking suggests that while some parts of the system played an important role in the initial subprime phase of the crisis through their involvement with the toxic securities that were at its centre, other parts of the system were key to the subsequent money and inter-bank phases of the crisis through their close ties with the regulated banks.","[Lysandrou, Photis] City Univ London, City Polit Econ Res Ctr CITYPERC, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Nesvetailova, Anastasia] City Univ London, Int Polit Econ, London EC1V 0HB, England",City University London; City University London,"Lysandrou, P (通讯作者)，City Univ London, City Polit Econ Res Ctr CITYPERC, London EC1V 0HB, England.",Photis.Lysandrou.1@city.ac.uk; a.nesvetailova@city.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,49,52,2,70,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Hawtrey, one of the Cambridge Apostles, was deeply influenced by the ethical philosophy of G.E. Moore. First in The Economic Problem (1926), and then in several other writings, Hawtrey denounced contemporary economics as lacking in ethical foundations, and, accordingly, regarded the individualist economic system as morally unsatisfactory. Hawtrey's approach is compared to that of a contemporary Apostle and Cambridge economist, Gerald Shove. Hawtrey's and Shove's tentative applications of Moore's philosophy to economics and political science, respectively, provide intriguing evidence of a neglected Moorean undercurrent in Cambridge social sciences.","Univ Macerata, Dipartimento Studi Sviluppo Econ, I-62100 Macerata, Italy",University of Macerata,"Macciò, DD (通讯作者)，Univ Macerata, Dipartimento Studi Sviluppo Econ, Piazza Oberdan 3, I-62100 Macerata, Italy.",dadonnini@libero.it,,,,,,,99,2,2,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

The advantage of the generalized local polynomial approach is that we can simultaneously choose the degree of polynomial for each continuous nonparametric regressor and the bandwidths via data-driven methods. We provide estimates of scope economies from the joint production of microloans and microdeposits for a dataset of Microfinance Institutions from over 50 countries. Our approach allows analysis on all Microfinance Institutions rather than only those offering just microloans. Moreover, the smooth coefficient estimator provides a general interface in which to account for both direct and indirect environmental factors. We find substantial scope economies in general, of about 10 % at the median, as well as evidence that economies of scope vary across the type of services and country in which the MFIs operate, suggesting key insights into policy prescriptions.","[Delgado, Michael S.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Parmeter, Christopher F.] Univ Miami, Dept Econ, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Hartarska, Valentina] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Hartarska, Valentina] Auburn Univ, Dept Finance, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Mersland, Roy] Univ Agder, Sch Business & Law, Agder, Norway",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of Miami; Auburn University System; Auburn University; Auburn University System; Auburn University; University of Agder,"Delgado, M (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA.",delgado2@purdue.edu; cparmeter@bus.miami.edu; hartarska@auburn.edu; roy.mersland@uia.no,,"Mersland, Roy/0000-0002-6683-2737",,,,,46,28,32,0,13,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Whereas the distinction between both types of factors is a matter of definition in theory, empirical work usually requires a sharp cut. All determinants of the outcome of interest have to be classified as either a compensation factor or a responsibility factor. We argue that the determinants are often hard to classify. A pragmatic solution to the problem at hand is to introduce a more general soft cut: determinants can be partly compensation, partly responsibility. Still, in a first-best income tax framework, such a soft cut is possible only if the gross income function is additively separable. In case separability fits the data, a simple partial sharing rule emerges as a natural candidate for partial redistribution. This rule can be characterized on the basis of two simple properties, equal treatment of equals and partial solidarity. In case additive separability is rejected by the data, we propose two alternative solutions.","KULeuven, Dept Econ, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Ooghe, E (通讯作者)，KULeuven, Dept Econ, Naamsestr,69 Bus 3500, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",erwin.ooghe@kuleuven.be,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2015,78.0,2.0,,,,,305,317,,10.1007/s11238-014-9423-6,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AZ3JU,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348124200009,0

Using a more detailed critical analysis of textbook content, I show that methods of discursive manipulation are used to highlight positive aspects of the Stalinist period - especially victory in World War II - while downplaying its political repression. This manipulation allows the state to both legitimize its version of Stalinist history and to perpetuate the underlying legitimizing function that version serves. In this way, the discourse implicitly justifies Putin's centralized state as the type of system that has historically produced great achievements for Russia.

The important fact is that investment in road infrastructure can be useful at the total (aggregate) level and at the same time for each of the fourteen regions individually. They can generates multiplication effects that fundamentally exceed the opening investment. Therefore, typical trade-off effects do not exist either in the short and the long-term. Typical trade-off effects can be found in the field of economic effects and monetary effects.

Moreover, AsA is the most abundant antioxidant in plant cells and plays important roles in many developmental and stress processes. The biosynthesis of AsA in higher plants has been elucidated recently and to date four, somehow interlinked, AsA biosynthetic pathways have been proposed, namely the L-galactose, the L-gulose, the myo-inositol and the D-Galacturonic acid pathways. Despite the relevance of AsA in citrus fruits, the biochemical and molecular bases of its synthesis and accumulation are almost unknown. Therefore, the objective of the present work has been to initiate a molecular characterization of the metabolic pathways involved in the synthesis and accumulation of AsA in citrus fruits in order to understand its regulation and to identify potential key steps of the pathway. Nine genes belonging to the four biosynthetic pathways and also to the degradation and recycling of AsA have been selected and their expression characterized in peel and pulp of fruit during development and maturation. Results in fruits of Citrus sinensis 'Navelate' indicate that in this variety the changes in AsA content appear to be regulated not only by de novo biosynthesis of AsA but also by degradation and recycling, and that different mechanisms may operate in peel and pulp. Moreover, post-transcriptional mechanisms could play an important role in the regulation of the AsA content of these fruit tissues.","[Alos, Enriqueta; Legaz, Pedro; Jesus Rodrigo, Maria; Zacarias, Lorenzo] CSIC, IATA, Valencia, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Instituto de Agroquimica y Tecnologia de los Alimentos (IATA),"Zacarías, L (通讯作者)，CSIC, IATA, Valencia, Spain.",lzacarias@iata.csic.es,"Rodrigo, Maria Jesus/H-7720-2012; Alos, Enriqueta/E-7674-2012; Zacarias, Lorenzo/W-2510-2018","Rodrigo, Maria Jesus/0000-0003-2668-0684; Alos, Enriqueta/0000-0003-2878-2617; Zacarias, Lorenzo/0000-0003-3982-8860",,,,,13,1,1,0,11,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,735,741,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600092,0

In order to reduce primary catastrophic consequences of earthquakes, certain preparedness and emergency procedures have to be organized in the event of and prior to an earthquake. Earthquake risk refers to the expected losses to a given element at risk, over a specified future time period. Risk may be measured in terms of expected economic loss, or in terms of number of lives lost or the extent of physical damage to property. Kindergartens in Osijek have an important role in the educational process. For each of the 21 kindergarten buildings, the properties related to the year of construction, height, type of structure, total area, etc., are given. Since they mostly have only a base floor and are built as reinforced concrete buildings, they may serve as emergency shelters after earthquake events. Therefore, a complete strategy for evaluating their capability to face probable earthquakes has to be provided. The aim of the article is to determine seismic vulnerability of kindergarten buildings - the degree of loss to a given element at risk resulting from a given level of hazard, defined as a ratio of the expected loss to the maximum possible loss on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 means without damage and 1 means collapse of building.","[Anticevic, Anita; Hadzima-Nyarko, Marijana; Rabi, Anamarija] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Civil Engn, Drinska 16a, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Anticevic, A (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Civil Engn, Drinska 16a, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",anticevicanita@gmail.com; mhadzima@gfos.hr; agrgurovac@gfos.hr,"Hadzima-Nyarko, Marijana/T-1491-2019","Hadzima-Nyarko, Marijana/0000-0002-9500-7285",,,,,16,1,1,1,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,642,650,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100064,0

Sarba variety was obtained in 1972 in Odobesti region and is supposedly genetically related to Italian Riesling and a muscat-type grape. Although the research information is scarce and some popular sources cite as ancestors either the Italian Riesling or the Tamaioasa, while some other mention both, the Vitis International Variety Catalogue (http://www.vivc.de/)mentions as pedigree ancestors confirmed by markers the Italian Riesling and Muscat of Hambourg. As for the Alb Aromat variety it was obtained at the Pietroasa Research station by self-pollination of Tamaioasa and officially registered in 1999. It may also have in its pedigree the grape Maria Pirovano, as mentioned in the Vitis International Variety Catalogue. Both these new varieties are semi-aromatic, with a muscat-based aroma profile derived from the parent aromatic variety. The resulted wines were analyzed with a double column gas-chromatograph functioning as an electronic nose, providing fingerprints of the volatile substances profile for each sample. The statistical analysis of the volatile profiles confirmed that Sarba is likely to have a parent-offspring relationship with both Italian Riesling and Tamaioasa (or other muscat-type grape), while the Alb Aromat has a closer profile only to Tamaioasa. More detailed studies are needed to confirm the exact parentage of these two grape varieties, as well as the applicability of the electronic nose as a fast and economic, but at the same time adequate instrument, for assessing parentage relationships among grape varieties.

The outcomes of the research highlighted the expediency of changing education programmes to include components that are focused on strengthening intentions towards reproductive behaviours among the population and building the requisite skills among trainees. Thus research conducted with entrepreneurs showed that business structures have significant scope to affect the demographic situation. Interviews with public servants showed a largely superficial level of competency and understanding as regards existing demographic problems and prospects for demographic development. Survey of university students showed that in the period of their studies it is possible to strengthen reproductive intentions and influence future reproductive behaviours.

Alongside the clinical and economic indicators are inserted customer satisfaction to provide a perspective of analysis to the stakeholders of the system. The health management is therefore, by having to draw new organizational strategies to overcome information asymmetry that hangs over these organizations. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview and assessment of the systems performance measurement and present a framework for the identification of a model of performance measurement for adequate health care processes. In healthcare, performance measurement methods emphasize on consideration of multiple factors. The diverse uses of health system performance measures necessitate a wide variety of measurement methods, indicators, analytical techniques and approaches to presentation. Design/methodology/approach - The starting point is represented by the analysis of the Spanish health system, which in this phase of general rationalization has maintained levels of efficiency and positive efficacy. This study uses case study method and develops a conceptual framework for performance measurement and implementing improvement projects. The proposed model has the following six steps: 1. Identify factors to measure performance. 2. Identify organizations system that can provide a comparative analysis. 3. Analyse service performance using Spanish National Health System 4. Plan, implement and evaluate improvement measures. Practical implications - The Spanish National Health System (SNS) is characterized to ensure universal coverage, to be financed through taxes and to have a decentralized health services management in all the Comunidades Autonomas (Autonomous Communities, ACs). The main goal of the SNS is to ensure equality in health care to its citizens independently of where they reside, as well as ensuring a high quality of services provided. Therefore, with the Key Performance Indicators for the Spanish National Health System (INCLA-SNS), we can analyse in which way the SNS achieves this purpose. So, 13 performance indicators were selected for this study from the 50 essential indicators. Originality/value - The framework presented provides a performance measurement system for healthcare processes that is sensitive to change in the external and internal environment of an organization. The identification of these indicators is finalized to implement future research that is to verify the possibility of achieving a model of performance indicators translatable to other health systems in the first place to Italian.","[Bonacci, Isabella; Balado, Alexandra Caride] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ & Management Inst, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Bonacci, I (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ & Management Inst, Via Cinthia Monte St Angelo, Naples, Italy.",,,,,,,,20,0,0,1,18,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,526,538,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200041,0

For citrus growers, this requires permanent adoption of new technology and changes in the cultivars grown, driven by income-risk criteria, as well as by technical and commercial experience. The duration of an investment depends on the agronomic performance of the cultivar or its commercial life, which may be shortened due to lack of consumer acceptance. The survival of a cultivar depends on many variables: technical, quality, and competitiveness of the cultivar. Spanish citrus production falls into five main groups of cultivars: lemons (10.8%), clementines (25%), mandarin hybrids (8.7%), navel oranges (35%) and common oranges (15%). The most productive cultivars are 'Fino' lemon, 'Navelina' navel, 'Clemenules', 'Lane Late' navel and 'Valencia' sweet orange. In relation to changes in varietal composition, it is of interest the introduction of new cultivars of the clemenules group ('Orogrande', 'Nulessin'), navel ('Powell', 'Rohde', 'Barnfield', 'Chislett' and 'Fukumoto') and Valencia ('Barberina', 'Midknight', 'Valencia Late' Frost and ` Delta Seedless'). There is constant pressure to supply new early clementines cultivars, but their survival is usually short.

After criticizing the culture of the protocol, the paper develops a concept antithetical to it: the culture of variety, seen as necessary richness of the values endowment of the organizations that want to innovate and survive in complex contexts. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is rooted in the Viable System Approach (VSA) that conceives complexity as a cognitive subjective phenomena. According to the recent VSA lines of research, complexity depends on the information variety to face complexity; information variety is articulated in three dimensions: informative units, interpretative schemes and values. The last one (values) is just the cultural dimension and its nature (rich or poor in variety) deeply influences the cognitive capability of a system (individual or organization) in promoting, accepting or refusing the change. Originality/value - The VSA proposal to link information variety to values is new and it could lead to original insight in understanding the role of cultural values in promoting (or impeding) innovation in complex environment. Practical implications - The principle of requisite variety is a very concrete managerial principle: if an organization is not capable to change by adapting itself in response to external changes, it will not be able to survive. Here is a call for manager and researchers: a shift to a more flexible, open and responsible view of organizations, less focused on the 'certainty' of the structure and technology, and open to the unpredictable outcomes of the human side of the system's dynamics which is essentially emergent in nature.","[Calabrese, Mario; Simone, Cristina] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Management, Rome, Italy; [Magliocca, Pierpaolo] Univ Foggia, Dept Econ, I-71121 Foggia, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Foggia,"Calabrese, M (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Management, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, Rome, Italy.",,,,,,,,62,0,0,0,5,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,414,426,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200032,0

Such information exists, for example, for England back to 1300, and for Sweden back to 1700. However surname distributions reveal a different, more fundamental type of mobility than that conventionally estimated. Thus surname estimates also allow for measuring a different aspect of social mobility, the underlying average social status of families.

The conclusion was that the main contribution that the intrapreneurial professional can bring is innovation, as well as strategic renewal, revitalization of business performance at the organizational level, increase in corporate value, optimization of benefits to stakeholders etc. However, in order for the intrapreneurship to emerge naturally it, is essential that such a concept be made part of the culture of the organization, thus forming the triad: culture, entrepreneurship and innovation.

The most important technology to make easily available Miscanthus giganteus feedstock on the market is biomass briquetting or pelleting. This study was conducted to determine the capability of mixing Miscanthus giganteus biomass with other vegetable biomass (straw, wood sawdust, or other energetic plants) to obtain briquettes and pellets. Different characteristics were studied as: percentage of variable biomass mixed with Miscanthus (30%, 50%, 70%), humidity variation (wt = 9 - 13%) and quality of final product. The efficient densification process of various biomass plants depends on these properties and on used technologies. Combustion properties of mixed biomass briquettes and pellets (ash content and composition, calorific values, emissions characteristics) have been determined as well. Results are showing that slag problems may be disturbing the combustion process and that the temperature is a critical factor (best results in combustion efficiency are above 1000 degrees C). In order to ensure the productivity for making available constantly processed products (briquettes, pellets), different heating installations need adjustments to increase the efficiency for mixed biomass combustion.

In this environment, we show that only a pooling equilibrium can be sustained, in which a player type who is unconcerned about fairness initially cooperates in order to disguise himself as a player type who is concerned about fairness. This disguising strategy induces the uninformed player to cooperate in all periods of the repeated game, including the final period, at which point the player type who is unconcerned about fairness takes the opportunity to defect, i.e., he backstabs the uninformed player. Despite such last-minute defection, our results show that the introduction of incomplete information can actually result in a Pareto improvement under certain conditions. We connect the predictions of this backstabbing equilibrium with the frequently observed decline in cooperative behavior in the final period of finitely repeated experimental games.","[Duffy, John] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Munoz-Garcia, Felix] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Washington State University,"Muñoz-García, F (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",jduffy@pitt.edu; fmunoz@wsu.edu,"Duffy, John/F-6968-2015","Duffy, John/0000-0002-7660-2281; Munoz-Garcia, Felix/0000-0001-6727-3618",,,,,23,0,0,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JAN,2015,78.0,1.0,,,,,45,75,,10.1007/s11238-013-9400-5,0.0,,,31,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AZ3JQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348123800004,0

But then, towards the middle of the 20th century, horticulturists were enchanted by the plant hormone concept. The hormonal thinking dominated citrus developmental physiology for a long time; flowering, fruit development and ripening, abscission, rooting and vegetative growth were all attributed to one, specific plant hormone or to the perplexing 'hormonal balance' concept. The pioneer of plant growth regulators use in citriculture was the American researcher C.W. Coggins Jr. (born 1930). Synthetic plant growth regulators were exploited in every possible way to solve all practical problems. A major representative of this 'Hormonal' era was the renown Israeli citrus researcher S.P. Monselise (1920-1986). The emergence of the source-sink concept (ca. 1980) partially replaced the hormonal hypothesis. The source-sink hypothesis claims that carbohydrate levels control the major stages of the fruiting process - flowering, fruit set and fruit enlargement - and are, therefore, responsible also for the 'alternate bearing' phenomenon. Although the effects of girdling and fruit thinning seem to support the sink-source concept, direct control of flowering and fruit set by carbohydrate levels has not been unequivocally demonstrated. The Spanish researcher J.L. Guardiola (1943-2010) played a major role in this debate. But then, rather soon, came the molecular-genetic era, forcing us all to acquire a new language and follow its logic. Citrus research is still a few steps behind Arabidopsis but, here we are, still doing our best in order to solve the remaining mysteries of citrus.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Plant Sci & Genet Agr, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Goldschmidt, EE (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Plant Sci & Genet Agr, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",goldsmit@agri.huji.ac.il,,,,,,,47,0,0,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1215,1221,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.154,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600154,0

The survey was conducted among undergraduate and graduate students of all years on the Faculty of Economics in Osijek, through a highly structured questionnaire which was designed based on adapted international scales. Business students represent future business leaders who will, with their knowledge and business decisions, create the economic future of Croatia. It is important for companies as well as for academia to consider students' perceptions of corporate social responsibility and to evaluate how prepared are they for this type of business environment. By understanding the attitudes of business students, it is possible to predict and positively influence the future of corporate social responsibility in the economy of Eastern Croatia, and the whole country as well.","[Ham, Marija; Pap, Ana; Pezic, Marijana] Fac Econ Osijek, Gajevtrg 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Ham, M (通讯作者)，Fac Econ Osijek, Gajevtrg 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",mham@efos.hr; anapap@efos.hr; mar.pezic@efos.hr,"Pap, Ana/X-4796-2019; Ham, Marija/AAC-3577-2022; Pap, Ana/AAA-6356-2020","Pap, Ana/0000-0003-4927-5518; Ham, Marija/0000-0003-4390-2218;",,,,,19,4,4,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,693,702,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100069,0

We also investigate the costs related to the usage of IFRS in comparison to use of the local Czech GAAP. The financial reporting for tax purposes and the role of new informational technology are also touched upon. In this study we have found that the use of IFRS is still relatively low, even though it has increased in comparison to previous studies from 2010 and 2013 from 16 per cent to 28 per cent of firms in the sample. Although the opinion of perceived benefits is slightly different between the group of IFRS adopters and IFRS non-adopters, the most important reasons for not reporting in accordance with IAS / IFRS are the perceived absence of benefits and perceived high costs of its implementation.","[Jindrichovska, Irena] Anglo Amer Univ, Letenska 5, Prague 11800 1, Czech Republic; [Kubickova, Dana] Univ Finance & Adm Prague, Prague 10000, Czech Republic",Anglo-American University; University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Jindrichovská, I (通讯作者)，Anglo Amer Univ, Letenska 5, Prague 11800 1, Czech Republic.",irena.jindrichovska@aauni.edu; kubickova@mail.vsfs.cz,"Kubickova, Dana/F-5098-2013; Jindrichovska, Irena/N-5867-2019",,,,,,15,0,0,1,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,667,677,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000064,0

Uncertainty, and anxiety about the future, as well as instability in the socio-economic situation, have become permanent features of modern society. Thanks to the transition to a market economy in the 1990's, instability and uncertainty appeared in Russian labour relations. This situation gave rise to a more flexible labour system. Hence, relative informality in labour relations is the basis of the non-standard employment relationships in Russia. This, in turn, has given legitimacy to purely verbal contracts of employment, flexible work schedules, as well as indefinite working hours. The modern reality is that we must address the continuing deterioration of the employees' position in the labour relationship, as well as the erosion of existing protective measures against toxic management practices. These latter have a negative impact on workers' professional and personal lives.

One of the most evident phenomena in late maturation is shedding of ripe fruit. A study made in Spain on sweet oranges showed that fruit shedding was related to the increase of sugars content of fruit pulp juice. To investigate this potential relationship between fruit abscission and internal maturity parameters we investigated the fruit maturity process of 10 clementine x mandarin hybrids and 9 commercial sweet orange varieties with different maturity period. Morphological and biochemical analyses (acidity, total soluble solids, fruit weight thickness of the flavedo, thickness of the peduncle, external colo) were carried out on fruit sets of the different varieties during the maturation process, from December to June. The abscission initiation was evaluated by measuring the force required to detach the fruit of the peduncle. Analysis showed that under the local conditions, abscission was generally not expressed even through fruit maturation was evolving. Therefore, we suppose that even though the local conditions have an important effect, abscission of citrus fruit results also from environmental-genotype interactions. Moreover, evolution of abscission and fruit parameters are not correlated suggesting the independence in the process of maturation and abscission under the environmental conditions of Corsica.","[Khefifi, Hajer; Morillon, Raphael] CIRAD, UMR AGAP, Montpellier, France; [Khefifi, Hajer; Luro, Francois] Ctr INRA Corse, INRA, UMR AGAP, San Giuliano, France; [Ben Mimoun, Mehdi] INAT, Tunis, Mahrajene, Tunisia",CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; INRAE; Universite de Carthage,"Khefifi, H (通讯作者)，CIRAD, UMR AGAP, Montpellier, France.",khefifihajer@yahoo.fr,"Mimoun, Mehdi Ben/AAI-9156-2020","Mimoun, Mehdi Ben/0000-0002-3379-8229; Morillon, Raphael/0000-0001-6762-1715",,,,,5,0,0,0,5,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1197,1201,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600152,0

Treatment consisted of inoculation with F. solani, with uninoculated controls. Three parameters were evaluated: recovery from girdling (0-3); amount of DRR (0-4); and percentage of healthy feeder roots. Twenty-four accessions showed no significant difference in DRR between inoculated and uninoculated seedlings, and 12 of these accessions showed low development of DRR (<1). Thirty-three accessions showed no significant difference in recovery from girdling between inoculated and uninoculated seedlings and 10 of these accessions showed good recovery from girdling (>2.7). Twenty-four accessions showed no significant difference in % healthy feeder roots between inoculated and uninoculated seedlings and eight of these showed a high percentage (>80%) of healthy feeder roots. Five accessions were superior in all three parameters: 'Fremont' mandarin (PI 539507), 'Lamas' lemon (PI 539226), 'Mato buntan' pummelo (PI 529398), 'Olivelands' sour orange (PI 539164) and 'South Coast Field Station' citron (PI 539435).

The aim is to provide for suitable tools and means for the assessment that could be further tested in future research. A questionnaire is developed based on theoretical and empirical findings and acid tested in SME CEO interviews against the framework created. The interview results are analyzed and preliminarily interpreted for steering further research. Design/methodology/approach - This study draws on the empirical data gathered in an ongoing Top Leader research project in the Small Business Center of Aalto university school of business, funded by ESF. The datasets are gathered in facilitated workshops, expert round table forums and personal interviews of selected SME management and HR expert representatives. The theoretical background is provided by the extant body of knowledge in organizational dynamic capability, SME strategy, innovation and leadership. Qualitative research and theory building approach using grounded theory method is selected in order to produce explanatory and pragmatic models and proposals. The main units of analysis are the personal, inherited and acquired capabilities of the CEO and the management team. These are operationalized through a framework derived from the literature of the Dynamic Capabilities. Originality/value - In firms operating with scarce resources, like in SMEs, this paradigm is of greatest importance. While sustained superior financial performance or the survival of the firm is a result of multiple independent and cross-dependent variables, an often neglected factor is capability of the CEO and management team of the firm. In a small company, the effect of the personal traits of an entrepreneur and other key influencers are claimed to be of remarkable meaning for the success. While the topic is touched in various streams of scientific research, the results are mostly presented on a conceptual level, thus leaving the full potential in managerial impact untapped. Here we are going to step down to produce a model that can be further leveraged also in managerial context. Practical implications - The preliminary outcomes of the research give implications that especially the external and internal networking abilities of the SME CEO prove to be a fruitful area for more concentrated research. The theoretical model chosen together with empirical data has been successfully translated into a questionnaire that will be used and improved in further interviews. The method is believed to be particularly useful for practitioners of SME leadership and strategy.","[Laine, Jari] Aalto Univ, Dept Ind Engn, FI-00076 Espoo, Finland; [Wirtavuori, Laura] Aalto Univ, Dept Ind Engn, FI-00076 Espoo, Finland",Aalto University; Aalto University,"Laine, J (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Otaniementie 17, FI-00076 Espoo, Finland.",,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,26,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2144,2154,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200169,0

Finally we justify validity and show strategic usefulness of such tool for its entrepreneurial adopters. Tourism is important part of regional economy with economic and socio-cultural impacts. In this context one of the most discussed topics in European Union is social tourism. In practice, social tourism addresses senior citizens, young people, families and people with disabilities. Generally, it can be seen as an umbrella concept, incorporating many different types of initiative and public, private and third-sector stakeholders. Consequently, we analyse possibilities and limitations of senior tourism and its effects for destination. Resultant findings are transferred to computational model, where providers of services adjust their supply in accordance with existing and expected behaviour of senior travellers. To realistically formalize the suggested market structure altogether with internal characteristics of single market players in representationally transparent and computationally powerful way, we adopted agent based modelling (ABM) as the main implementation paradigm. Models, composed from artificial agents, are theoretically able to mimic any type of system. Main advantage of agents is that their characteristics are close to human understanding, so it is straightforward to describe processes or systems in terms of interacting agents. The utilization of agents in traffic or destination occupancy modelling is straightforward. Entities, moving and cumulating on real geographic background allow to analyse local throughputs and capacities in order to predict their future development. Such research focuses primarily on operational and tactical aspects of tourism. Contrariwise, we are interested mainly in strategic planning, which does not represent typical ABM task, particularly because of its inherently fragmented and limited view. On the other hand, our problem represents complex, decentralized and distributed environment with large involvement of subjective factors, where any kind of immature summarization could suppress strategically interesting patterns of emergent behaviour. We used realistic combinations of internal parameters, characterizing type of destination, supply of services and structure of travellers to setup the agents' microworlds. Incoming tourists were addressed by general marketing, word of mouth or by their loyalty to destination or provider. With these configurations we performed and discussed different scenarios, focused on senior travellers. Our results suggest convenient types of destinations and business strategies from this target group point of view.","[Linderova, Ivica] Coll Polytech, Dept Travel & Tourism, Jihlava 58601, Czech Republic; [Smrcka, Frantisek; Voracek, Jan] Coll Polytech, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Jihlava 58601, Czech Republic",College of Polytechnics Jihlava; College of Polytechnics Jihlava,"Linderová, I (通讯作者)，Coll Polytech, Dept Travel & Tourism, Tolsteho 16, Jihlava 58601, Czech Republic.",,"Voracek, Jan/M-4724-2015; Linderova, Ivica/AAK-2161-2021","Voracek, Jan/0000-0003-0819-8106; Linderova, Ivica/0000-0003-1080-1082",,,,,25,0,0,2,8,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,349,362,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200027,0

Fresh fruit feature prominently in on-line grocery advertising, but fruit has special challenges that set them apart from most grocery products: they should be delivered in an optimum ready-to-eat state rather than simply in a minimum time; and there can be much variation in taste and texture between individual pieces. These challenges exist for conventional fruit trading, but are particularly important for e-tailing because it removes the customer's traditional role in selecting their own fruit, and thus the blame for any disappointment will be wholly on the e-tailer. As e-tailers put considerable value on the trustworthiness of their brand, this will generate a new demand for technology that will require the fruit supply chain to improve the predictability and safety of its products. In the near future we can expect to see the demands of business-to-consumer e-commerce driving a transformation in the global fruit trade into an information-intensive industry, leading to the implementation of many new sensor systems. Technology companies entering the fruit industry and creating vertically integrated operations from orchard to retail will bring an enthusiasm for new technology, the resources to develop it and the means to extract value from it. Orchard and fruit monitoring, predictive data mining and postharvest condition management will become increasingly common throughout the fruit supply chain.","[McDonald, R. M.; Sharrock, K.

In this area structural water resource deficits, as well as the gradual decline in citrus prices received by farmers, have promoted the co-plantation of other crops that are more resistant to water shortages, such as pomegranates, which have been grown in eastern Spain for decades. At present, demand for pomegranates is growing due to their associated nutritional benefits and functional food qualities. In this paper, we have analyzed technical-economic aspects of citrus and pomegranate cultivation in light of their increasing competition. The comparison of these two crops begins with an assessment, from a farm economy perspective, of the main results published in the scientific literature on Regulated Deficit Irrigation, which is one of the techniques used to address water shortage problems. Also, we have analyzed the trend in prices received by farmers for the orange 'Lane late', the mandarin 'Clemenules' and for the two main Spanish varieties of pomegranate, 'Valenciana' and 'Mollar'.

The aim of this study is to investigate the in vitro antifungal activity of rosemary essential oil and of some terpenes like eugenol, nerol, limonene (+), limonene (-) and pinene against three strains of Aspergillus species. The method used to evaluate the in vitro antifungal activity of the essential oils and terpenes tested is disk diffusion method. A suspension of the tested filamentous fungi was spread on the agar surface and 6 mm diameter sterile filter paper disks were impregnated with the essential oils and placed in the middle of the inoculated agar plates. Control samples were realized using the same procedure but without using essential oils. The samples were incubated at 25 degrees C under aerobic conditions for 7 days. Antifungal activity was evaluated by measuring the inhibition zone against the tested fungi and by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC). The results showed the effectiveness of eugenol and nerol as antifungal compounds, these ones having the highest inhibitory effect against the tested strains of Aspergillus. Essential oils can be an alternative to synthetic antimicrobial compounds for controlling food spoilage and for assuring microbiological safety of products. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This trend is increasing because shopping centres are trying to create positive experience for their visitors to make them come back to the shopping galleries. Shopping centre is considered to be a tourist destination by several authors due to its range of services, events and attractiveness that create the appropriate recreational potential for the development of urban tourism.

Our study investigates the still underexplored link between organisational knowledge assets and contextual ambidextrous learning. Specifically, we study how different configurations of knowledge assets - also called intellectual capital architectures - influence an organisation's ability to simultaneously pursue knowledge exploration and exploitation. Methodology - We tested our model on a large hospital of about 250 beds and 35 wards located in the northern part of Italy. We surveyed health professionals by means of a structured questionnaire and also employed objective data in order to measure our outcome variables. Selected respondents included head physicians and assistants. Collected data were analysed using structural equations modelling (SEM) methodology in its PLS form and fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). Originality/Value - We propose and empirically explore the relation between intellectual capital architectures and organizational ambidexterity. In so doing we contribute to the debate concerning how organizations can simultaneously pursue both knowledge exploitation and exploration giving birth to ambidextrous learning processes. Also, by conciliating two bodies of literature that come from organizational learning and intellectual capital theory, our study extends the current understanding of the relationships between knowledge management activities and continuous improvement in healthcare. Practical implications - Our study might have implications for managers of healthcare organizations in that it sheds first light on the responsibility hospital managers have to promote current practice improvement through a set of interventions aimed at increasing healthcare organisations' intellectual capital.","[Mura, Matteo; Longo, Mariolina] Univ Bologna, Dept Management, I-40123 Bologna, Italy; [Massa, Lorenzo] Vienna Univ Econ & Business WU, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Massa, Lorenzo] Echole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Dept Management Technol, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Bologna,"Mura, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Management, Via Terracini 28, I-40123 Bologna, Italy.",,"Mura, Matteo/K-7726-2016","Mura, Matteo/0000-0002-5762-2228",,,,,19,0,0,1,13,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1001,1011,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200076,0

Satsuma fruit suffers chilling injury during cold storage, and rind pitting is a common symptom. The objective of this study was to analyze fruit response to different storage temperatures evaluating pitting development and the incidence of different drench treatments on fruit rot and pitting development. Satsuma 'Okitsu' fruits were harvested from two different farms, one with high pitting history (Q102) and the other with low pitting history (Q100). Fruits of each farm were drenched with five different treatments, leaving an untreated sample as control. Fruits from each orchard and drench treatment were kept at 3 degrees C, 6 degrees C or at room temperature, during 30 days. After being drenched the fruits were degreened, waxed and stored. Fruits stored at room temperature did not show pitting, whereas fruits stored at 3 degrees C showed the greatest incidence of pitting. Fruits from the farm Q102 showed higher incidence of pitting than those from the farm Q100. Drench treatments did not affect pitting level but they affected rot incidence. Fruits stored at 3 and 6 degrees C had less incidence of fruit decay than samples stored at room temperature. Four rind samples of fruits with pitting from Q102 and 8 rind samples of fruit without pitting from Q100 and Q102 were analyzed in order to determine their nutrient composition.","[Nunez, Freddy; Larrechart, Leticia] Empresa Citricola NORIDEL SA, Salto, Uruguay; [del Campo, Raquel M.; Diaz, Luis E.; Mara, Hector] Inst Invest Biol Clemente Estable, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Pascale, Daniel; Solari, Juan] Empresa Citricola MODISUR SA, Salto, Uruguay",Instituto de Investigaciones Biologicas Clemente Estable Uruguay,"del Campo, RM (通讯作者)，Inst Invest Biol Clemente Estable, Montevideo, Uruguay.",raqueldc60@gmail.com,"Barrera, Luis Eduardo Díaz/U-2706-2019","Barrera, Luis Eduardo Díaz/0000-0002-9588-9935",,,,,24,0,0,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1541,1548,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600196,0

In spite of the fact that grapefruit is well adapted to semiarid regions, the irrigation needs for fresh fruit production are still very high. The scarcity of water resources forces citrus growers to optimise water use using deficit irrigation (DI) strategies. The aim of this work was to evaluate the sensitivity to DI at different fruit growth stages of 14-year-old 'Star Ruby' grapefruit grafted on 'Cleopatra' mandarin (Citrus reshni Hort.). Water relations, yield and fruit quality responses were studied. The experiment was carried out in an experimental orchard located in Torre Pacheco (Murcia, south-eastern Spain) during two years. There were four irrigation treatments: Control (100% crop evapotranspiration - ETc) and three DI treatments (50% ETc) applied only during certain fruit growth stages: DIPh-I (Phase I - cell division), DIPh-II (Phase II - cell elongation) and DIPh-III (Phase III - final fruit-growth period, ripening and harvest). The midday stem water potential (Psi(md)) of DIPh-I and DIPh-III were influenced by the rainfall regime in both years, whereas the Psi(md) of DIPh-III was decreased and remained lower throughout the study period. The main effects of both the DIPh-I and DIPh-III treatments were related with changes in fruit quality parameters: DIPh-I reduced the percentage of juice and DIPh-III affected negatively the peel colour when the water stress was moderate. However, the effects of DIPh-II were more drastic, decreasing yield due to smaller fruits, altering fruit composition, increasing much more the titratable acidity than the total soluble solids and reducing peel colour, therefore delaying fruit maturation. Based on these results, the periods less sensitive to DI were Ph-I and Ph-III, which should be considered for future studies of regulated DI under Mediterranean climates.","[Perez-Perez, Juan G.; Robles, Juan M.; Isabel Garcia-Oller, Maria; Botia, Pablo] Inst Murciano Invest & Desarrollo Agr & Alimentar, Dept Citriculture, Murcia, Spain",,"Pérez-Pérez, JG (通讯作者)，Inst Murciano Invest & Desarrollo Agr & Alimentar, Dept Citriculture, Murcia, Spain.",juang.perez@carm.es,"GARCÍA, JUAN MIGUEL ROBLES/AAR-8413-2020; ORDAZ, PABLO BOTIA/AAT-4462-2021; Pérez-Pérez, Juan/Q-6244-2016; Pérez-Pérez, Juan Gabriel/AAK-7597-2020","GARCÍA, JUAN MIGUEL ROBLES/0000-0001-8456-613X; ORDAZ, PABLO BOTIA/0000-0002-3646-3264; Pérez-Pérez, Juan/0000-0002-8012-119X; Pérez-Pérez, Juan Gabriel/0000-0002-8012-119X",,,,,14,2,2,1,10,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1767,1774,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.226,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600226,0

Sustainability reports are documents organizations use to report the company's identity, governance, and values, as well as the impact of everyday activities and topics considered as relevant to sustainable development (Global Reporting Initiative, 2013). In the last two decades the commitment of universities to sustainable development has strongly grown (Adomssent et al. 2007, Velazquez et al. 2006, Waas et al. 2010) and today an increasing number of universities, although still limited, periodically publish a sustainability report (Ceulemans et al. 2014, del Mar Alonso-Almeida et al. 2014, Townsend and Barrett 2013). Extant reporting standards and guidelines (e.g. GRI-G4 of the Global Reporting Initiative) seem to be mainly developed for companies (Lozano, 2006) and often neglect the description of methodological aspects to be adopted for the reporting process, especially in the case of universities. The lack of clear guidelines can affect the quality of the reports and make the comparison of different reports hard. Design/methodology/approach - To develop the methodological notes, we reviewed the literature and analysed the most adopted reporting standards and guidelines. We also analysed the sustainability reports of a sample of ten universities. The sample includes reports from the GRI disclosure database. The report analysis was carried out to assess (i) the standard adopted, if any, (ii) the reporting process carried out, i. e. the set of activities and the procedures performed to develop and publish the sustainability report, and (iii) the information reported. As to the reporting process, the activities related to the identification and interaction with stakeholders as well as the activities performed to identify which indicators to be used are analysed and discussed. Originality/value - The proposed methodological notes integrate those provided by the GRI. We also identified some issues that remain as open problems and should be further analyzed. Practical implications - The paper outcomes can be used by universities that already publish a sustainability report to improve the reporting process. The outcomes can also be used by universities, and any kind of organizations, which intend to start the process of sustainability reporting.","[Scozzi, Barbara; Bellantuono, Nicola; Pontrandolfo, Pierpaolo] Politecn Bari, Dipartimento Meccan Matemat & Management, I-70126 Bari, Italy",Politecnico di Bari,"Scozzi, B (通讯作者)，Politecn Bari, Dipartimento Meccan Matemat & Management, Viale Japigia 182, I-70126 Bari, Italy.",,"Bellantuono, Nicola/AAC-3144-2020; Scozzi, Barbara/ABC-8981-2020; Pontrandolfo, Pierpaolo/AAH-5273-2020","Scozzi, Barbara/0000-0001-7359-4469;",,,,,22,0,0,0,11,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2465,2479,,,,,,15,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200193,0

The necessity of dynamic development of the national road infrastructure is also confirmed by the European statistical data, which presents the dynamics of the increasing role of the road transport in the passenger transport in relation to the European Union countries. The Polish road infrastructure still requires high financial inputs which could support and ensure appropriate standards of the existing networks, and also in order to meet the market demands, which result from the increased exchange of goods and the passenger transport. It is necessary to systematically improve the technical conditions of the Polish network of state roads, in order to eliminate its basic limitations, as well as to allow for its development. The motorway construction process in Poland has entered the successive stage. In spite of the large scale of commenced investments, the Polish network of state roads, including motorways and expressways is not internally coherent and insufficiently pervious. The continuation of investment activities on the main lines of the roads in Poland, is the challenge for the near future. In the states, which have been intensively modernised, such as Poland and Croatia, considerably acceleration of the development of such roads may be noticed. In Poland, the National Spatial Development Strategy 2030 was adopted by the Governmental Resolution dated December 13, 2011. It specified the necessity to improve the territorial accessibility in different spatial scales, through the development of the transport infrastructure, implemented in the conditions of sustainable development. However, the line investments of this type have their impacts on modifications in the agricultural space and the natural environment. The paper will present different aspects of impacts of road investments on soils, water and the landscape, and on the land use ways. Documents required for the process of protection and the environmental protection methods, applied in the process of planning locations and implementation of motorways construction in Poland and in Croatia will be also discussed.","[Sobolewska-Mikulska, Katarzyna] Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Geodesy & Cartog, Dept Cadastre & Land Management, Pl Politech 1, PL-00661 Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Technology,"Sobolewska-Mikulska, K (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Technol, Fac Geodesy & Cartog, Dept Cadastre & Land Management, Pl Politech 1, PL-00661 Warsaw, Poland.",k.sobolewska@gik.pw.edu.pl,,,,,,,2,1,1,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,660,669,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100066,0

Beyond the direct financial losses it has also other negative effects, as the loss of business partners, damage to the trade relations, loss of the best employees or degradation of the morale in the organization. Based on dozens of corruption causes and frauds publicized in the media in the Slovak Republic, it looks like the level of corruption and fraud at our society exceeded the imaginable level. The following paradox can be seen: the more control mechanisms are implemented, the higher is the rate of fraud detection. Therefore, in the countries with sophisticated anti-fraud tools was the rate of solved crimes higher, but their average losses were lower. In addition to the high-quality legislation that allows prosecution of criminals, the rate of detection of economic crime significantly depends on the corporate culture and the measures taken by management. The essence of prevention and detection of economic crime depends on the type of crime. The three most common types of economic crimes in the Europe are: corruption, cash theft and fraudulent financial reporting. When we talk about corruption, the first thought of many people includes the corruption in the public sector. Corruption in the private companies is rarely discussed in the media, which does not mean that it is less frequent or less serious form of corruption. Mostly exposed to the corruption are all the employees with the authority to agree new contracts or payments, or if they come into contact with third parties, e.g. during the procurement process. Cash theft is described as the direct theft of cash. The offender simply takes the money and walks away with it. Fraudulent reporting is a type of fraud usually performed by top management at the expense of shareholders. It is often motivated by the mechanisms for management evaluation proceeded before the payment of financial bonus. Although the fraudulent reporting is less frequent fraud, these frauds have the greatest impact. Examples of the recent past indicate (associated with falls of large global companies) that it is not easy to detect the economic crime and that many managers were blind to specific risks. The aim of the paper will be to investigate the development of economic crime in Slovakia since 2005 on the basis of secondary data, to compare the economic crime in individual regions of Slovakia, to analyse the investigated economic fraud in relation to the total number of detected frauds and to analyse its impact on the total amount of financial losses of companies. The results of the analyses will be evaluated and solutions will be proposed. Mathematical and statistical methods, synthesis, deduction and comparison will be used within the paper preparation.","[Suhanyi, Ladislav; Suhanyiova, Alzbeta; Mokrisova, Martina; Horvathova, Jarmila] Univ Presov, Fac Management, Presov, Slovakia",University of Presov,"Suhányi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Presov, Fac Management, Presov, Slovakia.",,"Suhányiová, Alžbeta/AAI-3614-2021; Mokrišová, Martina/D-2350-2018; Horváthová, Jarmila/D-2360-2018; Suhányi, Ladislav/C-8424-2018; Suhányiová, Alžbeta/O-4845-2018","Suhányiová, Alžbeta/0000-0001-6537-0000; Mokrišová, Martina/0000-0001-9473-2429; Horváthová, Jarmila/0000-0003-3388-8635; Suhányi, Ladislav/0000-0002-6277-6117;",,,,,6,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,41,48,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400006,0

First, Green banking is in the implementation of credit or financing intended for entrepreneurs who are friendly to the environment. This is generally given to the SMEs as well as to agricultural and plantation sector. Second, there is also a thought that Green Banking is the bank using environmentally friendly tools in its banking activities. This paper is aimed at analyzing the relationship between the electronic banking as operational support and the improvement of customer service. The bank can also facilitate and be more environmentally friendly for example by reducing paper in each transaction or using recycled materials.

This leads to investigate the environmentally friendly sustainable materials in order to replace the existing ones. One of these polymeric materials is poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) which is a semi-crystalline, linear polymer belonging to the class of polyhydroxyalkanoates. It is fully biodegradable and biocompatible, and produced from renewable resources. Although having promising properties, PHB is unstable during processing at elevated temperatures causing thermal degradation that reduces its mechanical performance. The purpose of the present study was to develop and characterize new composite materials based on PHB and different percentage of cellulose fibers (from 2% to 10%), in order to improve PHB's physical mechanical behavior. In this respect, a series of physical-mechanical analyses (melt processing, optical properties, differential scanning calorimetry, water vapor permeability, etc.) were performed. The results obtained during this study show the most appropriate composition of the tested mixtures and demonstrate that the polymeric material based on PHB and cellulose fibers have good physical-mechanical characteristics, being suitable for packaging industry.

Economic growth and improved living standards in Kazakhstan is a strong attraction for immigrants. However, there has been a steady trend of outflow of young specialists from the country. As a result, narrows the competitive environment in the labor market, employment is provided by jobs with low quality, reduced productivity. The main tasks, which will be answered in the studies: 1.Provide an analysis of the structure of international labor migration, to show the contradictory impact on the economic development of the donor countries and host countries. 2.Explain the need for integration of Kazakhstan into the international educational space for the purpose of expanding the scope of academic mobility of students and scientists. 3.Elaborate recommendations for official agencies to overcome the negative impact of labor migration on the competitiveness of the national economy and encourage the inflow of highly skilled labor. Research Methodology. The methodological basis of scientific research is the position of the classics of economic theory, the national program of modernization of education, labor relations. Application of the methods of observation, analysis and forecasting problems in the study of the relationship of international labor migration, higher education and productivity, revealed a number of contradictions between the growth of jobs and their quality, employability of graduates with higher education. The practical significance of the study. In Kazakhstan, the majority of labor migrants are employers of cheap labor, which allows companies to reduce accounting costs of production. However, for the national economy this phenomenon is accompanied by the growth of low-quality jobs. Kazakhstan in these conditions can get into middle income trap. In addition, costs of the state are rising for social protection of migrants. To increase income state need to stimulate the involvement to the labor market of educated, skilled professionals. Active labor migration and technological transformation require additional state expenditures on creation of conditions for education and training of young professionals. In connection with these processes is increasing the need for a paradigm shift in education, above all, openness of the national education system. In Kazakhstan, higher education is an essential part in shaping the capabilities of the employee. While in many countries, critical for employers has experience of the employee, the countries of the former Soviet Union - the main criteria for the selection of personnel is a diploma of higher education of the applicant. The higher education system is the subject of the priority of public funding and institutional reforms. However, no one institution of the country was not included in the Top 100 best universities in the world. In the structure of the labor force arriving dominated the share of uneducated persons. In addition, employers are placing a complaint domestic universities due to low competence of young professionals. The main reasons: an old model of higher education. Impact studies on the development of Kazakhstan's economy. The recommendations developed on the basis of the research will allow the relevant authorities to conduct the following activities aimed at improving the competitiveness of Kazakhstan's labor market. Restrict the issuance of visas to foreigners working without a formal invitation to the works of the Kazakhstan organizations. Create a special educational courses for guest workers. Extend the conditions for academic mobility of domestic students and researchers in order to improve education quality and competitiveness of domestic experts.

This paper presents the preliminary results of GDP and its components using expenditure and production approach and presents several comparisons with the data estimated according to standard ESA 1995.","[Vltavska, Kristyna; Sixta, Jaroslav; Simkova, Martina; Zeman, Jan] Univ Econ Prague, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Vltavská, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",kristyna.vltavska@vse.cz; sixta@vse.cz; martina.simkova@vse.cz; jan.zeman@vse.cz,"Sixta, Jaroslav/J-9828-2014; Vltavská, Kristýna/J-1497-2017",,,,,,10,1,1,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1675,1682,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000160,0

In industry, we see a proliferation of policies, programs and actions towards different sectors (garment, movies, etc.). These dynamics are part of the rehabilitation projects of various Cities (City of Culture, City of Light, etc.) and the generation of new societal values (Kuty, 1991). However, although culture is the central pillar of an arrangement of worlds, it proves problematic. It introduces within traditional industries values such as creativity and innovation and poses questions relative to the status of artists, and creative professionals. This raises the question of social innovation and development of social entrepreneurship amongst other issues. In the Garment and Fashion industry, the issue of interconnection between cultural and creative industries, and non-creative and non-cultural industries, has been debated for some time by various international organizations (UNESCO, UNCTAD, etc.). In the end, the scope of the new creative economy remains unclear and elusive (Bouquillion, 2010). Some sectors such as fashion, are on the frontiers of two worlds, garment being more in industry, while Fashion is definitely in the creative world. Both these worlds contribute to entrepreneurship and knowledge development in the City, as is observed in Montreal. Purpose - The goal of our research is to highlight the role of creativity within the fashion sector and its importance in entrepreneurship issues in general as well. Design/methodology/approach - Our analysis of the fashion sector in Montreal is based on participant observations (Peneff, 1996) and a survey which was conducted from 2009 to 2013 by semi-structured and open interviews (approximately sixty, 28 designers and 32 Intermediate Sectorial& Intersectorial Actors). The study was based on interviews and internal data (reports, corporate documents, press articles, etc.). The interviews lasted between one hour and half to two hours each, and were done in four rounds, then fully transcribed. The first round is based on a guide to trace the trajectories of Emerging Designer (ED) (semi-structured interviews); the second round takes place in open interviews aimed to collect the story of Renowned Designer (RD) and pioneers (DP) (Bernier, Perrault, 1987). The third round follows a guide developed towards Intermediate Sectorial Actors (ISA), Intermediate Intersectorial Actors (IIAS) and Political Intermediaries (IP) (semi-structured interviews). Finally, the fourth round follows a guide geared towards Intermediate Promoter Industry (IPI) representatives (semi-structured interviews). We triangulated data (Royer, 2007) from our various sources (interviews, official documents, information in social networks including Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Originality/value - Our study seeks to demonstrate that the creativity of local actors contributes largely to entrepreneurship and local development, and this creativity development responds to the needs of territories to distinguish themselves from one another. Practical implications - This study situates itself within an ongoing attempt in Quebec, where for several years the actors and intermediaries, political as well as from civil society, have thought together and sought the establishment of a local metropolitan cluster of fashion in which creativity and innovation are encouraged.","[Yagoubi, Amina; Tremblay, Diane-Gabrielle] Univ Quebec, TELUQ, Canada Res Chair Socioorg Challenges Knowledge Ec, Montreal, PQ H2S 3L5, Canada",University of Quebec; Universite TELUQ; University of Quebec Montreal,"Yagoubi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, TELUQ, Canada Res Chair Socioorg Challenges Knowledge Ec, 5800 Rue St Denis,Off 1105, Montreal, PQ H2S 3L5, Canada.",,"Tremblay, Diane-Gabrielle/AED-3661-2022","Tremblay, Diane-Gabrielle/0000-0002-3343-9146",,,,,55,0,1,0,17,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1225,1236,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200094,0

Practice ignores the possibility that there could be a point when motorists stop driving on toll roads due to a toll budget constraint. The unconstrained toll budget assumption may be valid in networks where the addition of a new toll road does not result in a binding budget constraint that car users may have for using toll roads (although it could also be invoked for existing tolled routes through a reduction in use of a tolled route). In a road network like Sydney which offers a growing number of (linked) tolled roads, the binding budget constraint may be invoked, and hence including additional toll links might in turn reduce the car users' willingness to pay for toll roads to save the same amount of travel time. When this occurs, car users are said to reach a toll saturation point (or threshold) and begin to consider avoiding one or more toll roads. Whilst toll saturation has important implications for demand forecasting and planning of toll roads, this type of behaviour-has not been explored in the literature. We investigate the influence that increasing toll outlays has on preferences of car commuters to use one or more tolled roads as the number of tolled roads increases. The Sydney metropolitan area offers a unique laboratory to test this phenomenon, with nine tolled roads currently in place and another five in planning. The evidence supports the hypothesis that the value of travel time savings decreases as a consequence of toll saturation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus far, corporations and governments alike have made the intuitive yet untested assumption that working the existing workforce harder and longer can alleviate the economic fallout. This is based on the 'success' similar efforts have previously seen in production industries characterized by physical inputs. Our study provides evidence that these successes may not carry over to industries, such as transportation that are reliant on intellectual skill. It is shown that meeting productivity goals by increasing the job demands of knowledge workers, specifically air traffic controllers, compromises the provision of new kinds of value added. Furthermore, it is demonstrated for the first time that increasing job duration exacerbates the effects of job demand on human performance. Coping with staffing shortages by asking that knowledge workers simply 'do more' may impede rather than stimulate economic growth. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

By relying on a sample of more than 1, 700 notarized records, the article shows that political instability had an important effect on the amount and length of loans. As Peru became politically more stable after the mid-1840s, private lenders made larger loans with longer maturities. Medium-term credit among approved loans was more frequent after political stabilization. Long-term credit, however, was not common during this period.","[Felipe Zegarra, Luis] CTR Catolica Grad Business Sch, Lima, Peru",,"Zegarra, LF (通讯作者)，CTR Catolica Grad Business Sch, Lima, Peru.",lfzegarrab@pucp.pe,,"Zegarra, Luis Felipe/0000-0002-9956-8055",,,,,46,6,8,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

The research question guiding this inquiry is, How are collections of industrial and product design functioning as components of economic development strategies? The analysis of 11 key-person interviews identified indirect connections to economic development among the case institutions, including events, programming, membership groups, and university partnerships. The study concludes by outlining a framework that builds from these existing connections and offers additional strategies for improving the integration of cultural institutions and design collections in design-based economic development approaches.","[Kinahan, Kelly L.] Univ Louisville, Dept Urban & Publ Affairs, 426 W Bloom St, Louisville, KY 40292 USA",University of Louisville,"Kinahan, KL (通讯作者)，Univ Louisville, Dept Urban & Publ Affairs, 426 W Bloom St, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.",Kelly.kinahan@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,4,4,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

This analytical focus captures the usual integration dynamics and institutional design outcomes, but overlooks the constitutional dimension of how the crisis affects the EU's legal order. In this agenda-setting article, I draw attention to legal scholarship that highlights important deviations from the EU's 'legal normalcy'. Legal studies find that a number of emergency measures were taken on an extra-legal basis and through quasi-autocratic procedures. Normative reconstructions interpret this practice as a form of transnational state of exception which transitions into permanent traits of authoritarianism in the EU's legal order. I argue that their findings offer a new terrain for political science research which transcends the explanatory categories of integration theory.","[Kreuder-Sonnen, Christian] WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Berlin, Germany",,"Kreuder-Sonnen, C (通讯作者)，WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Res Unit Global Governance, Reichpietschufer 50, D-10785 Berlin, Germany.",christian.kreuder-sonnen@wzb.eu,,"Kreuder-Sonnen, Christian/0000-0002-0397-3452",,,,,73,40,40,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This approach differs from much of the existing literature, which tends to examine economic assimilation by looking at levels of (un)employment or wages. Focusing on occupational attainment is useful, in that disadvantage in the labour market is not limited to employment status and earnings, and an individual's occupation may provide a broader signal of their economic and social well-being. Findings indicate that, on arrival, immigrants from a non-English speaking background face significant disadvantage in occupational attainment, particularly those from Asian countries. There is also evidence to suggest that those who arrive later in life, or are from an Asian non-English speaking background, are the least likely to assimilate over time. Results are indicative of the need for policies to better integrate immigrants from more diverse cultures and societies into the Australian labour market.","[Fleming, Christopher M.] Griffith Univ, Sch Business, S Bank, Qld, Australia; [Kifle, Temesgen] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Kler, Parvinder] Griffith Univ, Econ, S Bank, Qld, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Logan Campus; Griffith University - South Bank Campus; University of Queensland; Griffith University; Griffith University - Logan Campus; Griffith University - South Bank Campus,"Fleming, CM (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, South Bank Campus,226 Grey St, S Bank, Qld 4101, Australia.",chris.fleming@griffith.edu.au,"Fleming, Christopher/ABE-3736-2020; Kler, Parvinder/P-3968-2019","Fleming, Christopher/0000-0001-7596-7775; Kler, Parvinder/0000-0001-5235-1038",Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS),Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS)(Australian Government),"This article uses unit record data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey.

Decision making during evacuations implies different choices, of which one of the most important concerns is the escape route. The choice of a route may involve local decisions on alternative exits from an enclosed environment. This study investigates the effect of environmental (presence of smoke, emergency lighting and distance of exit) and social factors (interaction with evacuees close to the exits and with those near the decision-maker) on local exit choice. This goal is pursued using an online stated preference survey carried out making use of non-immersive virtual reality. A sample of 1503 participants is obtained and a mixed logit model is calibrated using these data. The model shows that the presence of smoke, emergency lighting, distance of exit, number of evacuees near the exits and the decision-maker and flow of evacuees through the exits significantly affect local exit choice. Moreover, the model indicates that decision making is affected by a high degree of behavioural uncertainty. Our findings support the improvement of evacuation models and the accuracy of their results, which can assist in designing and managing building and transportation systems. The main aim of this study is to enrich the understanding of how local exit choices are made and how behavioural uncertainty affects these choices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Among several alternatives that commuters can choose when they face increase of congestion tax, this study specifically tests the impact on the modal change to public bus transportation. This study finds that commuters switch to public bus services by 12% to 20% in the morning hours after S$1 increase and by approximately 10% in the evening after toll adjustment of S$0.50 to S$1.00 in the affected gantry area compared to the counterfactual through difference-in-difference method. Also, we find that the increase in bus ridership has long-lived effect at least within two months and commuters from area with lower income level respond more to the toll increase. When we repeat the same test for robustness with arbitrary time slot during which the toll is not levied, we find no significant modal change. Other confounding factors from macro-economic standpoint and service quality cannot explain the results as the modal change occurred in short period within specific area and time. We also find that commuters from low income area respond more to the toll rate adjustment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This article builds on these models by suggesting a theoretical framework of support that is driven by both perceptions of the economy and political efficacy. Using data from the 2013 Eurobarometer 80.1, I find that political efficacy is a key predictor of public opinion towards the EU and that citizens who feel their voice is represented in the EU are more likely to maintain support for the EU even when their perceptions of the economy are poor. The findings in this article have particular significance to the puzzle of declining support for the EU following the onset of the 'great recession' in 2008.","[Mcevoy, Caroline] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Mcevoy, C (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, Room 5-07 Coll Green, Dublin 2, Ireland.",mcevoyc1@tcd.ie,,,,,,,38,16,17,1,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In this article, we argue that an analysis of agenda formation dynamics in the European Council may help us understand better how the European Council works and how its role has evolved over time. Building on theories of agenda-setting, we identify two ideal-typical modes of agenda formation: selective targeting and routine monitoring. Based on a comprehensive dataset of coded European Council Conclusions in the period 1975-2011, we show that the substantive content of the European Council agenda shows little change over time. However, in terms of agenda formation dynamics, we find a marked shift toward routine monitoring of issues. This supports the claim that the European Council is developing into the EU's de facto government.","[Carammia, Marcello] Univ Malta, Msida, Malta; [Princen, Sebastiaan] Univ Utrecht, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Timmermans, Arco] Leiden Univ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands",University of Malta; Utrecht University; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Carammia, M (通讯作者)，Univ Malta, Inst European Studies, Msida 2080, Msd, Malta.",marcello.carammia@um.edu.mt,,"Carammia, Marcello/0000-0002-3864-8756; Timmermans, Arco/0000-0003-2451-6688",,,,,51,19,21,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In China, many prospective port projects have also explored a landlord port financing model. However, some evidence suggests that landlord port financing in China is a variant of the international mainstream landlord port financing model. Based on an explanation of their unique features and practices, this paper analyzes the Chinese quasi-landlord port financing model from a contract theory perspective, in which it can be viewed as a double-level principal-agent relationship and two-layer profit distribution contract with three participants: the state-owned assets administration department, the port investment company and the operators. Furthermore, the results show that in the Chinese quasi-landlord port financing model, whether in the case of both joint venture and port land lease (fixed rent), or in the case of both joint venture and port land transfer, the optimal incentive scheme is the same as in the international landlord port financing model with profit sharing rent or mixed rent.

An important share of these fatalities is due to injuries to the head and the neck. Helmets can provide efficient protection, but many drivers do not use them. We focus on helmet use behavior among motorbike users in Delhi. We use a detailed data set collected for the purpose of the study. To guide our empirical analysis, we rely on a model in which drivers decide on self-protection and self-insurance. The empirical findings suggest that risk-averse drivers are more likely to wear a helmet and that this has no systematic effect on speed. Helmet use also increases with education. Drivers who show a higher awareness of road risks seem to be both more likely to wear a helmet and to speed less. Controlling for risk awareness, we observe that drivers tend to compensate between speed and helmet use. The results can provide a basis for awareness-raising policies. They also show that improvements to the road infrastructure risk leading to risk-compensating behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on observations from both the EA and the ECCU, we present a new policy framework which is capable of imposing fiscal discipline, with the aim of avoiding the risk of unsustainable fiscal policies reappearing and of preventing monetary policy from being undermined by undisciplined national governments. In the ECCU case, we find that fiscal deficits are more a result of financial and trade imbalances than fiscal indiscipline per se. Consequently, constraints on overall debt, public and private, rather than direct limits on endogenous public deficits, appear to be the appropriate response.","[Hallett, Andrew Hughes] George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Jensen, Svend E.

The maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters of the model are derived along with their asymptotic properties, together with a Lagrange multiplier test of the null hypothesis of linearity in the underlying latent index. The development of the STL model is motivated by the desire to assess the impact of deregulation in the Queensland electricity market and ascertain whether increased competition has resulted in significant changes in the behaviour of the spot price of electricity, specifically with respect to the occurrence of periodic abnormally high prices. The model allows the timing of any change to be endogenously determined and also market participants' behaviour to change gradually over time. The main results provide clear evidence in support of a structural change in the nature of price events, and the endogenously determined timing of the change is consistent with the process of deregulation in Queensland.

Our first main result is the welfarism theorem using the axiom of intratemporal anonymity. By this theorem, the ranking of social alternatives is determined by an intratemporally anonymous and finitely complete quasi-ordering [which we call social welfare relation (SWR)] defined on the set of all streams of utility vectors of generations. We introduce three SWRs: the critical-level generalized utilitarian (CLGU) SWR, the critical-level generalized overtaking (CLGO) SWR, and the critical-level generalized catching-up (CLGC) SWR. They are infinite-horizon extensions of the critical-level generalized utilitarianism. We characterize (in terms of subrelation) the CLGU SWR with five axioms: Strong Pareto, Finite Anonymity, Weak Existence of Critical Levels, Restricted Continuity, and Existence Independence. Further, the CLGO and the CLGC SWRs are characterized by adding consistency axioms. We also present infinite-horizon reformulations of some population ethics axioms. In particular, we characterize the CLGO and the CLGC SWRs associated with a positive critical level by using the axiom of avoidance of the repugnant conclusion.","[Kamaga, Kohei] Sophia Univ, Fac Econ, Chiyoda Ku, 7-1 Kioi Cho, Tokyo 1028554, Japan",Sophia University,"Kamaga, K (通讯作者)，Sophia Univ, Fac Econ, Chiyoda Ku, 7-1 Kioi Cho, Tokyo 1028554, Japan.",kohei.kamaga@sophia.ac.jp,,"Kamaga, Kohei/0000-0001-8281-7193","Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture, Japan [23730196]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23730196] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture, Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I am grateful to two anonymous referees and an editor of this journal.

Research has shown that low-income communities and communities of color are often exposed to greater harms and enjoy fewer benefits from transportation systems than the general population. However, federally-mandated EJ analyses rarely conclude that projects could result in disproportionate impacts to these communities. This paper investigates the methods used to define EJ communities a key analytical step for which there is little specific guidance as a potential driver of variation in observed EJ outcomes. Using a case study of transit accessibility in Fresno County, California, the paper contrasts three methods for the identification of EJ communities: (1) a commonly used threshold-based approach that groups geographic areas using demographics, (2) a population-weighted approach that calculates weighted means of performance measures, and (3) community based identification of EJ areas. The analysis indicates that the first method is appropriate for targeting transportation investments but not for assessing EJ outcomes, while the second two methods are appropriate for assessing EJ outcomes. Importantly, the method used to define EJ communities can substantially affect the analytical outcome, potentially shifting a finding of inequity from null to positive or vice versa. These results have important implications for transportation planning agencies and transportation service providers that conduct EJ and equity analyses, as a finding of inequity may lead to design changes or mitigations.

I argue that one key feature of the developmental state' - namely, state control over the financial system - contributes to an undervalued exchange rate. However, state control of finance promotes undervaluation under a narrower set of conditions than most developmental state theories suggest. State-owned banks increase support for exchange rate undervaluation from certain interest groups. When those interest groups are politically important, state-owned banks encourage policymakers to undervalue their exchange rates. Two sets of empirical analyses support the argument. Using time-series - cross-sectional data, I show that state-owned banks are associated with undervalued exchange rates, but only in developing countries with large manufacturing sectors. Second, analyses of firm-level survey data reveal that state-owned banks increase the manufacturing sector's support for an undervalued exchange rate. These findings suggest that state institutions influence exchange rate policy, though their effects are contingent upon the configuration of interests in society.","[Steinberg, David A.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Steinberg, DA (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",,,,,,,,90,5,7,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This approach is important because several previous studies have highlighted the need to develop empirical models tailored to an industry, especially when it is as significant in the national economy as the hotel industry is in Spain. The article also examines whether the models developed to date remain valid in the new economic environment characterized by the economic crisis. The results obtained confirm the influence on the probability of business failure of profitability, debt, economic structure, economic and financial stability and liquidity. Moreover, significant influence is identified with regard to the number of delegations, the level of employment, seasonality and competitive concentration in the tourist destination where the business is located.","[Vivel-Bua, Milagros; Otero-Gonzalez, Luis] Univ Santiago Compostela, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Lado-Sestayo, Ruben] Univ A Coruna, La Coruna, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Universidade da Coruna,"Vivel-Búa, M (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago Compostela, Fac Sci Econ, Ave Burgo Nac S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain.",mila.vivel@usc.es,"Lado-Sestayo, Rubén/AAC-3201-2019; /F-2087-2015","Lado-Sestayo, Rubén/0000-0003-3760-2868; /0000-0002-8214-6227; Vivel Bua, Maria Milagros/0000-0002-8829-3746",,,,,45,14,16,1,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

We assess this conjecture empirically for the (former) transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe, using Member States as well as developing and developed countries in Europe and Central Asia as a control group. The data used is a macro-economic panel of 48 countries covering six three-year periods between 1995 and 2012. We find that EU accession positively affected the quality of competition policies over and above an overall trend towards more market-oriented policies. The improvement in competition policies was not reversed in a single country of the sample, documenting the strong and sustainable transformative power of the EU. The findings are robust when controlling for endogeneity issues.","[Boeheim, Michael H.; Friesenbichler, Klaus S.] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Boeheim, Michael H.] Vienna Univ Econ & Business WU, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Böheim, MH (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",michael.boeheim@wifo.ac.at,"Friesenbichler, Klaus/ABC-7176-2021","Friesenbichler, Klaus/0000-0003-2303-0336",Anniversary Fund of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank [15280],Anniversary Fund of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank,"The authors would like to thank Harald Oberhofer, Eva Pichler and Hans Pitlik as well as two anonymous referees of this journal for valuable comments and suggestions, as well as Anna Strauss and Katharina Koberl for their research assistance.

We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that stroke accounted for a larger fraction of deaths during the Great Recession than expected from other deaths and from trends, cycles, and other forms of autocorrelation. Based on vital statistics death data from California spanning 132 months from January 2000 through December 2010, we found support for the hypothesis. These findings appear attributable to non-Hispanic white men, who experienced a 5% increase in their monthly odds of stroke-attributable death. Total mortality in this group, however, did not increase. Findings suggest that 879 deaths among older white men shifted from other causes to stroke during the 36 months following the start of the Great Recession. We infer the Great Recession may have affected social, biologic, and behavioral risk factors that altered the life histories of older white men in ways that shifted mortality risk toward stroke.

The empirical results indicate that, once the stock index is in the bull trend, an increase in oil price cannot affect the real stock return, while a decrease in oil price can lead to higher stock returns. On the contrary, if the stock market is in the bear era, the oil price growth cannot significantly affect the stock returns. Remarkably, oil price shocks cannot always damage the broad stock index, especially in a bull market era. Furthermore, regardless of the oil price shock, long-term investors need not adopt any policy and strategy to reduce the impact of the oil price on the stock market because the effect of a bull stock market will weaken the negative effect of an oil price shock. On the other hand, regardless of oil price shocks, when the stock market exhibits a bear trend, investors should adopt coping policies and strategies to avoid the impact of other non-oil factors shock, such as declines in real GDP to the stock market in the 15 selected countries. Clearly, regardless of whether the stock market exhibits a bear trend or a bull trend, the stock market trend will surpass the effect of an oil price shock.","[Liao, Shu-Yi] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung 40227, Taiwan; [Chen, Sheng-Tung] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Publ Finance, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; [Huang, Mao-Lung] Tainan Univ Technol, Dept Hotel Management, Tainan, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University; Feng Chia University,"Huang, ML (通讯作者)，Tainan Univ Technol, Dept Hotel Management, Tainan, Taiwan.",allen5259@gmail.com,,,,,,,37,5,5,0,23,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Simulation results show how marginal cost pricing (MCP) of travel in the polycentric setting can cause many jobs (16% in this example) to leave the central business district (CBD) and relocate to a relatively dense but suburban ring. To achieve city-wide welfare gains, efficient land use regulations should permit such job decentralization. Simulations also illuminate how simple, distance-based tolls generate lower welfare improvements, but stimulate similar land use effects. A cordon toll imposed in monocentric cities may agglomerate all firms in a smaller CBD or re-agglomerate parts of firms in a sub-center ring of development. Overall, results highlight how an urban economic model enabling endogenous business and household decisions can illuminate various travel, congestion pricing, and land use connections.

This implies that energy intensity has tended to decrease in countries that have become richer but not in others.

Analyses of absolute trip spending by parts (such as transportation) and of trip budget share (for example, the proportion of transportation within the total trip budget) serve different objectives. The first type of analysis refers to how much tourists spend and the second to how they spend. The aims of this article are, first, to provide a new methodological tool to combine the analysis of budget share and absolute expenditure and, second, to analyse the determinants of absolute expenditure on transportation and the relative importance of transportation expenditure compared to other trip budget components. The main findings are that traveller characteristics affecting high absolute transportation expenditure are different from those affecting a high share of transportation in the trip budget.

Our framework is general: it can be applied to model-based forecasts obtained either with recursive or rolling window estimation schemes, as well as to forecasts that are model free. The proposed tests provide more evidence against forecast rationality than previously found in the Federal Reserve's Greenbook forecasts as well as survey-based private forecasts.

It establishes a causal relationship between short-term variations in local income and the electoral support for the coalition of republican parties that represented the newly established regime. The results suggest the republican coalition won the parliamentary elections because most French regions did not suffer from transitory negative income shocks stemming from heavy precipitations. They thus raise questions about the rationality of voters and, ultimately, the actual causes of the consolidation of democracy in France.","[Franck, Raphael] Bar Ilan Univ, IL-52100 Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Franck, R (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, IL-52100 Ramat Gan, Israel.",,,"Franck, Raphael/0000-0003-2068-0958",Adar Foundation of the Economics Department at Bar Ilan University,Adar Foundation of the Economics Department at Bar Ilan University,"I gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Adar Foundation of the Economics Department at Bar Ilan University.

Due to their different social and economic background, immigrant households may not integrate well into the host society, and therefore are more likely to be delinquent on mortgages than otherwise identical native-born households. We test this hypothesis by comparing the mortgage delinquency rate between immigrant and native-born households in the 2009 PSID (Panel Study of Income Dynamics) data, in which all the immigrant households have been in the United States for more than 10 years. We find that, after controlling for observables, those relatively recent immigrants who have been in the United States for 10 to 20 years have a higher mortgage delinquency rate than native-born, while immigrants who have resided in the United States for more than 20 years are no different from native-borns. In addition, there is no evidence that the second generation of immigrants is more likely to be delinquent than the third-or-higher generations. Our results are robust to potential sample-selection bias and functional misspecifications.","[Lin, Zhenguo] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Finance, Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA; [Lin, Zhenguo] Florida Int Univ, Hollo Sch Real Estate, Miami, FL 33131 USA; [Liu, Yingchun] Univ N Texas, Dept Finance Insurance Real Estate & Law, Coll Business Adm, Denton, TX 76203 USA; [Xie, Jia] Bank Canada, Financial Stabil Dept, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada",California State University System; California State University Fullerton; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; Bank of Canada,"Lin, ZG (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Finance, Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA.;Lin, ZG (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Hollo Sch Real Estate, Miami, FL 33131 USA.;Liu, YC (通讯作者)，Univ N Texas, Dept Finance Insurance Real Estate & Law, Coll Business Adm, Denton, TX 76203 USA.;Xie, J (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Financial Stabil Dept, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",zlin@fullerton.edu; yiliu@fullerton.edu; xiej@bankofcanada.ca,,,,,,,31,10,11,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,SPR,2016,44.0,1.0,,,,,198,235,,10.1111/1540-6229.12092,0.0,,,38,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,DJ3ZC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374144200005,0

To ensure quality of life and well-being of inhabitants living in the vicinity of railway paths, it is important to evaluate, understand, control and regulate railway noise and vibration. Much attention has been focused on the impact of noise from railway traffic but the consideration of railway-induced vibration has often been neglected. This paper aims to provide policy guidance based on results obtained from the analyses of relationships estimated from ordinal logit models between human response, railway noise exposure and railway vibration exposure. This was achieved using data from case studies comprised of face-to-face interviews (N=931), internal vibration measurements (N=755), and noise calculations (N=688) collected within the study Human Response to Vibration in Residential Environments by the University of Salford, UK. Firstly, the implications of neglecting vibration in railway noise policies are investigated. The findings suggest that it is important to account for railway induced vibrations in future noise and transport policies, as neglecting vibrations results in an underestimation of people highly annoyed by noise. Secondly, implications of neglecting different types of railway sources are presented. It was found that the impact of noise and vibration form maintenance operations should be better understood and should be taken into account when assessing the environmental impact of railways in residential' environments. Finally, factors that were found to influence railway vibration annoyance are presented and expressed as weightings. The data shows that factors specific to a particular residential area should also be taken into account in future vibration policies as the literature shows that attitudinal, socio-demographic and situational factors have a large influence on vibration annoyance responses. This work will be of interest to researchers and environmental' health practitioners involved in the assessment of vibration complaints, as well as to policy makers, planners and consultants involved in the design of buildings and railways.

We argue that the rationale for this strategy is to be found in the tensions between the rigidity of the domestic dynamics of positive integration in the EU and the increased bindingness of WTO negative integration commitments. Consensual decision-making procedures in the EU both drive the stringency of environmental regulation and make it resistant to change. When such environmental standards are challenged in the WTO, incentives arise for the EU to push for international environmental rules that can grant immunity from WTO legal challenges. When changing WTO rules is not an option, PTAs become a valid alternative. We illustrate the plausibility of our argument through an in-depth case study of the EU's attempt to include provisions defining environmental sustainability criteria for the production of biofuels in the ongoing negotiations for a PTA with Malaysia.","[Poletti, Arlo] LUISS Guido Carli, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Sicurelli, Daniela] Univ Trent, I-38100 Trento, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University; University of Trento,"Poletti, A (通讯作者)，LUISS Guido Carli, Dept Polit Sci, Via Villa Emiliani 13, I-00197 Rome, Italy.;Poletti, A (通讯作者)，LUISS Guido Carli, Sch Govt, Via Villa Emiliani 13, I-00197 Rome, Italy.",apoletti@luiss.it,,,,,,,58,15,15,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The Member States have not delegated powers to the supranational institutions. Yet a number of studies challenge the assumption that policy-making lies exclusively with Member States' governments. The Commission's putative influence within the CFSP, however, remains to be studied systematically from an analytical perspective. Aiming to fill this gap in the literature, this article asks how the Commission de facto influences EU foreign and security policies beyond its delegated powers. Two least likely cases are analysed: the launch of EU naval mission Atalanta and the adoption of an EU Maritime Security Strategy. By adressing this question, the article contributes to a better understanding of the level of EU foreign policy integration. It also adds knowledge on the possible causes of this development, and thus to the EU integration literature more generally.","[Riddervold, Marianne] Ctr European Studies, ARENA, POB 1143, N-0318 Oslo, Norway",,"Riddervold, M (通讯作者)，Ctr European Studies, ARENA, POB 1143, N-0318 Oslo, Norway.",Marianne.riddervold@arena.uio.no,,,Norwegian Ministry of Defence,Norwegian Ministry of Defence,"I want to thank Morten Egeberg, Karolina Pomorska, Guri Rosen, Helene Sjursen, Peter Aagaard, and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and questions.

Although most Europeans endorse the EU as a good thing today, the European Election Study finds no popular majority for an ever closer union, the commitment of EU institutions. Less than one-third endorses further integration and less than one-third thinks integration has gone too far. The largest group favours keeping the EU as it is. Their outlook reflects ambivalence; they see the EU as having both strengths and weaknesses. It does not reflect lack of EU knowledge or of socio-economic resources, as is the case with don't knows'. While eurozone institutions are committed to further integration, most EU citizens are not.

This article extends this argument to the design of international organizations (IOs), where a profound development in recent decades is growing access for transnational actors (TNAs). While earlier research has shown that democracy in IO memberships helps to explain IO openness, we know little about the mechanisms that drive this effect. This article unpacks the relationship between democratic memberships and IO design by theorizing and assessing the impact of three different constellations of democracies on the openness of IOs. Empirically, we conduct a multivariate analysis of TNA access to 50 IOs from 1950 to 2010, combined with a case study of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Our main findings are three-fold. First, democracy's effect on openness is primarily a product of the combined weight of democracies within IOs and their resulting capacity to secure support for their polity preferences. Second, in contrast, we only find limited support for a specific influence of new democracies and democratic major powers on IO openness. Third, decision rules that allow for openness reforms to be adopted by a majority of member states facilitate and strengthen the influence of democracies, by reducing the ability of autocracies to block change. The findings have implications for our understanding of institutional design in global governance and democracy's effects in world politics.","[Tallberg, Jonas; Sommerer, Thomas] Stockholm Univ, Dept Polit Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Squatrito, Theresa] Univ Oslo, Fac Law, Pluricourts, Postboks 6706 St Olavs Plass 5, N-0130 Oslo, Norway",Stockholm University; University of Oslo,"Tallberg, J (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Polit Sci, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",jonas.tallberg@statsvet.su.se; thomas.sommerer@statsvet.su.se; theresa.squatrito@jus.uio.no,,,European Research Council [200971-DII]; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond [M2007-0399:1-PK]; European Research Council (ERC) [200971] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Riksbankens Jubileumsfond(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"Earlier versions of this article were presented at the workshop The Design of International Institutions: Theory Meets Data, Chapel Hill, April 25-27, 2013; the Transaccess/Transdemos Workshop, Stockholm, May 6-7 2013; the annual meeting of the Swedish Political Science Association, Stockholm, October 2-4, 2013; and the workshop Transnational Actors in Global Governance, Lund, June 12-13, 2014.

In order to explore how multiple bilateralism works, a network analysis has been made of the Dutch coalition-building effort during the negotiation on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. It examines the interaction between the various actors involved in this process, such as the ministries in The Hague, the EU institutions in Brussels, the governments of other Member States and the embassies abroad. Specific attention is given to this last type of actor. Contrary to what is often assumed, bilateral embassies' contribution to the negotiation process is relatively modest. Only a few embassies, namely those in the largest EU Member States, were able to play a more important role and direct contact with Member States' capitals was considered to be the predominant channel for success.","[Uilenreef, Arjan] Univ Antwerp, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Uilenreef, A (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Fac Polit & Social Sci, Res Grp Int Polit, Sint Jacobsstr 2, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",arjan.uilenreef@minbuza.nl,,,,,,,28,3,3,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Whereas major accounts of integration depict defence policy as a least likely case, our process-tracing analysis shows that the EU's recent challenge of defence offsets was a case of supranational self-empowerment. We theorize two consecutive strategies of judicial politics, which the Commission employed at different policy stages to overcome opposition from Member States and defence firms against domestic policy change: judicialized law-making and opportunistic enforcement. Both strategies depend on three scope conditions: expansive case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), its fit with policy priorities of the Commission and a credible threat of follow-up litigation.","[Weiss, Moritz] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Geschwister Scholl Inst Polit Sci GSI, Munich, Germany; [Blauberger, Michael] Salzburg Univ, SCEUS, Monchsberg 2, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria",University of Munich; Salzburg University,"Blauberger, M (通讯作者)，Salzburg Univ, SCEUS, Monchsberg 2, A-5020 Salzburg, Austria.",michael.blauberger@sbg.ac.at,,"Blauberger, Michael/0000-0002-3581-400X",Stiftung Deutsch-Amerikanische Wissenschaftsbeziehungen (SDAW),Stiftung Deutsch-Amerikanische Wissenschaftsbeziehungen (SDAW),"We would like to thank our interview partners, three anonymous reviewers as well as Berthold Rittberger, Alexander Spencer and our colleagues in Munich and Salzburg for their great help in preparing this article.

The early post-war years as a consequence saw the introduction of innovative means of social disciplining in all areas of Soviet society. The infamous attack on the post-war intelligentsia, in particular, resulted from Stalin's belief that only through the intelligentsia's correct leadership' of this socio-economic organisation' would the Soviet Union be able to meet its challenges of reconstruction and superpower consolidation. This post-Terror and post-war phase in Stalinism marked a lasting turn, which consolidated the authoritarian socio-political dynamics evident in the later post-Stalin Soviet system.","[Morcom, Shaun] 27 St Day Rd, Redruth TR15 2ET, Cornwall, England",,"Morcom, S (通讯作者)，27 St Day Rd, Redruth TR15 2ET, Cornwall, England.",morcomshaun@gmail.com,,,,,,,51,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,FEB 7,2016,68.0,2.0,,,,,312,344,,10.1080/09668136.2015.1112877,0.0,,,33,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,DI9CW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373800000006,0

We capture trade integration primarily by means of the home bias, rather than by using other indicators such as tariffs and non-tariff barriers. In turn, the home bias is computed for the countries in our sample by a standard gravity model. Our results find a positive and robust correlation between trade integration and FDI activity for the countries in our sample. For the particular case of the EU, it is not possible to strictly discriminate between horizontal or vertical FDI. FDI flows seem to be more consistent with a knowledge-capital hybrid model, where considerations about the market size of the partners and their relative endowment of skilled labour are relevant.","[Martinez-San Roman, Valeriano; Sanchez-Robles, Blanca] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Avda Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [Bengoa, Marta] CUNY City Coll, Colin Powell Sch, 160 Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031 USA",Universidad de Cantabria; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City College of New York (CUNY),"Román, VMS (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Avda Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",martinezv@unican.es; mbengoa@ccny.cuny.edu; sanchezb@unican.es,"Sanchez-Robles, Blanca Rute/K-4224-2017; Martinez-San Roman, Valeriano/I-1257-2015","Sanchez-Robles, Blanca Rute/0000-0001-8528-9189; Martinez-San Roman, Valeriano/0000-0002-0508-9353",,,,,61,20,21,0,38,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Our results highlight the long run nature of aid-financed investments and the importance of channels other than accumulation of physical capital.

The research was conducted in peak of drought season, August, 2015 at Sungai Hitam, Bengkulu, Indonesia. In order to get representative sampling sites, field survey was conducted in May, 2015 in the research location. Primary data was collected from rice field, vegetables, bare land, and oil palm involved incubated CO2 emissions, peat thickness, and level of water tables. The data were analyzed statistically from 10selected samples of the rice fields, 7 selected samples of lowland vegetables fields, 3 selected samples of bare lands, and 8 selected samples of oil palm fields. CO2 emission values under the land on Sungai Hitam peat were as follow; 237.86, 238.57, 259.35, and 265.35 mg m(-2) hr(-1), respectively. Moreover, carbon releases based on peat thickness; < 100, 101 - 150, 151 - 200, 201 - 250, and > 250 cm, respectively were 119.71, 189.35, 229.47, 288.58, and 297.59 mg m(-2) hr(-1). The trend of CO2 emission (y(1)) related to peat thickness (x(1)) fit with a following equation; y(1) - 3.996x(1)(0.778); R-2 - 0.953. Level of carbon emission affected by water tables; < 100, 101 - 150, 151 - 200, and > 200 cm, respectively was 192.80, 245.54, 292.21, and 309.97 mg m(-2) hr(-1). CO2 emission rate (y(2)) related to lowering water tables (x(2)) conformed to a following formula; y(2) - 23.96x(2)(0.48); R-2 - 0.949.

With the growing trend of online sale of tourist package arrangements and other tourist services, the way travellers organise their travel has changed. In the tourist market together with classic in advanced prepared, package-arrangements, travellers are offered untraditional forms (combined package arrangements, linked travel arrangements). As the mentioned forms are not included in the existing regulation of organised travel, the intervention of the European Legislature was necessary, with the aim of their legal regulation and establishing the balance in the interests of protection of the public interests and mutual competition of business subjects by establishing equitable conditions for all operators determining which are the forms of tourist services protected by EU rules on organised travel. The author in particular dedicates special attention to the relation of the new Directive with other EU rules regulating certain aspects of travel services with the conceptual organisation of package travel and linked travel arrangements, with the characteristics related to the law, obligations and subject liability of the business relationship. She concludes that the new Directive as a modern legal instrument also represents the official entry of tourism into the digital age with the introduction of the online system for the sale and untraditional package arrangements with significant legal effects after its transposition into national legislations.","[Barun, Mara] Fac Law Split, Split, Croatia",,"Barun, M (通讯作者)，Fac Law Split, Split, Croatia.",mbarun@pravst.hr,,,,,,,6,0,1,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,308,318,,,,,,11,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400032,0

Based on transactions performed on a daily basis, we present three layers built on the following types of payments, i.e. transactions sent from participant to participant, from participant to third party and from third party to third party. We observe that those layers exhibit dissimilar topology: the participant to participant layer reveals the behaviour of banks settling their own obligations, which proved to be sensitive to the failure of Lehmann Brothers; the participant to third party payments layer presented stable properties; and the third party to third party layer resulted in an increasingly dense network since the system has been adopted for the settlement of low-value obligations between accountholders. In order to identify relevant players in those layers, we compare some well-known centrality measures and also a novel centrality measure specifically designed for payment systems, SinkRank.

We therefore contribute to the literature by extending widely applied multi-factor asset pricing models to a sample of 963 Chinese firms (between 2005-2013) to (i) systematically evaluate their reactions to oil price shocks, and (ii) further include regulated gasoline prices as a more direct measure of the energy-prices faced by firms. 89.2% of firms are susceptible to oil shocks, with positive and negative reactions observed even for firms within the same industry. Gasoline price shocks are more pervasive, affecting 95.7% of firms.

The idea is to outsource the grading task to the students themselves as follows. After the end of an exam, each student is asked to rank - in terms of quality - a bundle of exam papers by fellow students. An aggregation rule will then combine the individual rankings into a global one that contains all students. We define a broad class of simple aggregation rules and present a theoretical framework for assessing their effectiveness. When statistical information about the grading behaviour of students is available, the framework can be used to compute the optimal rule from this class with respect to a series of performance objectives. For example, a natural rule known as Borda is proved to be optimal when students grade correctly. In addition, we present extensive simulations and a field experiment that validate our theory and prove it to be extremely accurate in predicting the performance of aggregation rules even when only rough information about grading behaviour is available.","[Caragiannis, Ioannis] Univ Patras, Comp Technol Inst Diophantus, Rion 26504, Greece; Univ Patras, Dept Comp Engn & Informat, Rion 26504, Greece",University of Patras; University of Patras,"Caragiannis, I (通讯作者)，Univ Patras, Comp Technol Inst Diophantus, Rion 26504, Greece.",,,"Voudouris, Alexandros/0000-0003-1105-3856",,,,,24,7,8,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,323,340,,10.1145/2940716.2940748,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300027,0

We investigate whether the micro-level evidence supports the hypothesis that Vietnamese parents are in fact making a tradeoff between quantity and quality of children. We present private tutoring-a widespread education phenomenon in Vietnam-as a new measure of household investment in children's quality, combining it with traditional measures of household education investments. To assess the quantity-quality tradeoff, we instrument for family size using the commune distance to the nearest family planning center. Our IV estimation results based on data from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Surveys (VHLSSs) and other sources show that rural families do indeed invest less in the education of school-age children who have larger numbers of siblings.

Importantly, we allow arbitrary auction formats involving, potentially, several rounds of signaling from the seller and decisions by the bidders, and seek to find the optimum co-design of signaling and auction (we call this optimum the optimum augmented auction). We characterize exactly the optimum augmented auction for our valuation model by establishing its equivalence with a multi-item Bayesian auction with additive bidders. Surprisingly, in the optimum augmented auction there is no signaling whatsoever, and in fact the seller need not access the available information about the item type until after the bidder chooses his bid. Suboptimal solutions to this problem, which have appeared in the recent literature, are shown to correspond to well-studied ways to approximate multi-item auctions by simpler formats, such as grand-bundling (this corresponds to Myerson's auction without any information revelation), selling items separately (this corresponds to Myerson's auction preceded by full information revelation as in [Fu et al. 2012]), and fractional partitioning (this corresponds to Myerson's auction preceded by optimal signaling). Consequently, all these solutions are separated by large approximation gaps from the optimum revenue.","[Daskalakis, Constantinos; Tzamos, Christos] MIT, CSAIL, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Daskalakis, Constantinos; Tzamos, Christos] MIT, EECS, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Papadimitriou, Christos] Univ Calif Berkeley, EECS, Berkeley, CA USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Daskalakis, C (通讯作者)，MIT, CSAIL, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Daskalakis, C (通讯作者)，MIT, EECS, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,"Tzamos, Christos/0000-0002-7560-5069",,,,,32,17,20,0,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,233,250,,10.1145/2940716.2940789,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300022,0

In fact we compare the quadratic hedging strategies in a martingale setting for a claim when two models for the underlying stock price are considered. The first model is a geometric Levy process in which the small jumps might have infinite activity. The second model is a geometric Levy process where the small jumps are replaced by a Brownian motion which is appropriately scaled. The hedging strategies are related to solutions of backward stochastic differential equations with jumps which are driven by a Brownian motion and a Poisson random measure. We use this relation to prove that the strategies are robust towards the choice of the model for the market prices and to estimate the model risk.,"[Daveloose, Catherine; Vanmaele, Michele] Univ Ghent, Dept Appl Math Comp Sci & Stat, Krijgslaan 281-S9, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Khedher, Asma] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Math Finance, Parkring 11, D-85748 Garching, Germany",Ghent University; Technical University of Munich,"Vanmaele, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Appl Math Comp Sci & Stat, Krijgslaan 281-S9, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Catherine.Daveloose@UGent.be; Asma.Khedher@tum.de; Michele.Vanmaele@UGent.be,,"Vanmaele, Michele/0000-0002-9882-4360","Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT); KPMG Center of Excellence in Risk Management; CAS - Centre of Advanced Study, at the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letter, research program SEFE","Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT)(Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT)); KPMG Center of Excellence in Risk Management; CAS - Centre of Advanced Study, at the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letter, research program SEFE","The financial support from the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT) is gratefully acknowledged by Catherine Daveloose.

When agents have budgets, the maximum social welfare as traditionally defined is not a suitable benchmark since it is overly optimistic. This motivated the liquid welfare of [Dobinski and Paes Leme 20141 as an alternative. Observing that no combinatorial Walrasian equilibrium guarantees a non-zero fraction of the maximum liquid welfare in the absence of randomization, we instead work with randomized allocations and extend the notions of liquid welfare and Combinatorial Walrasian Equilibrium accordingly. Our generalization of the Combinatorial Walrasian Equilibrium prices lotteries over bundles of items rather than bundles, and we term it a lottery pricing equilibrium. Our results are two-fold. First, we exhibit an efficient algorithm which turns a randomized allocation with liquid expected welfare W into a lottery pricing equilibrium with liquid expected welfare 3-root 5/2 Next, given access to a demand oracle and an a-approximate oblivious rounding algorithm for the configuration linear program for the welfare maximization problem, we show how to efficiently compute a randomized allocation which is (a) supported on polynomially-many deterministic allocations and (b) obtains [nearly] an a fraction of the optimal liquid expected welfare. In the case of subadditive valuations, combining both results yields an efficient algorithm which computes a lottery pricing equilibrium obtaining a constant fraction of the optimal liquid expected welfare.","[Dughmi, Shaddin] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Eden, Alon; Feldman, Michal; Fiat, Amos] Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Leonardi, Stefano] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy",University of Southern California; Tel Aviv University; Sapienza University Rome,"Dughmi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",shaddin@usc.edu; alonarden@gmail.com; michal.feldman@cs.tau.ac.il; fiat@tau.ac.il; leonardi@dis.uniroma.it,"Eden, Alon/AAF-2369-2022; Eden, Alon/AFH-2279-2022","Eden, Alon/0000-0002-0907-3914; Eden, Alon/0000-0002-0907-3914",,,,,32,7,7,0,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,401,418,,10.1145/2940716.2940742,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300034,0

This paper compiles the first 'anatomy' of the Cayman offshore financial center (OFC), utilizing all sources of publicly available data about the three main segments: banking, direct investment, and portfolio investment. The analysis is performed both diachronically to see when large inflows occurred and geographically to determine what role certain countries play in different segments. This dissection of the Cayman OFC shows that the United States is the largest counterparty in all segments with Japan playing an important role too. In fact, when excluding long-term Treasuries, Cayman is the largest holder of US securities in the world. Hedge funds are the main factor for this strong Cayman-US link. About 60% of global hedge fund assets are legally domiciled in Cayman - an extraordinary spatial concentration in such a tiny jurisdiction. A novel contribution to the analysis of the Cayman OFC is the introduction of the Anglo-America/Anglosphere approach. This approach provides one plausible explanation for the unparalleled rise of the Cayman OFC by seeing this jurisdiction as one node in an Anglo-American triangle together with the USA and the UK, Cayman's sovereign power.","[Fichtner, Jan] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, CORPNET Project, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Fichtner, J (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, CORPNET Project, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.r.fichtner@uva.nl,"Fichtner, Jan/J-6044-2019","Fichtner, Jan/0000-0001-7675-400X",,,,,79,43,49,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The assessment has been carried out on the basis of the data on insurance market provided both by the financial regulatory authority for Poland, namely Polish Financial Supervision Authority (PFSA) and by the insurance self-regulating business organization, namely Polish Insurance Association, as well as on the basis of author's own research and the analysis of the provisions of the act in insurance and reinsurance activity. On the basis of the analysis it can be stated that the suggested solutions may effectively eliminate new insurance agents from the market. The elimination would be a result of the necessity of staggering the commission for third-party sales of life insurance with unit-linked insurance as none of the agents will be able to stay in business until they build their own client portfolio. The ban on remunerating the people acting for and on behalf of the insured in third party insurance, especially when it comes to corporate insurance, may effectively eliminate from the market agents working for numerous employers, which may in turn result in a smaller number of such insurance on the market.

It examines some of the tensions associated with the attempt to blend Walrasian economics and Soviet planning. The main argument is that the two literatures crossed in the night of the Cold War. Given the two different political-economic and scientific contexts, the aspect of the Walrasian vision most emphasized in the Western literature was exactly the opposite of the aspect most emphasized in the Soviet literature. For Western economists the main concern was how (how possibly) competitive market prices could coordinate the actions of heterogeneous economic agents, while the main concern of Soviet scholars was how (how possibly) the theory of competitive markets could be used to help facilitate the efficient implementation of a central planning mechanism with a single (social) goal. Many features of the mathematics were the same, but the different goals and contexts created various tensions within the mathematical models produced by the two scientific communities. modern economics lends little support to the notion of basic identity of all interests in the society with one another and with the over-all social interest, a fiction on which much of Stalinist theorizing was built.

In order to make the designers more aware of the correct choice of the material of the poster, it can enhance the level of the seemingly single text carrier to art, and endow it with rich connotation. In order to allow readers to appreciate the text at the same time to appreciate the beauty of the material, so that the text in the beauty of the material set off the order of its sublimation. Poster is the ladder of human progress, is an important tool for the heritage of human civilization. In the life of modern people, posters are indispensable. In this era of the pursuit of beauty, the importance of the design of the poster is also naturally highlighted. Posters as the carrier of information, along with the long history of human development process, in the dissemination of knowledge to the readers at the same time, to give them the enjoyment of the United states. Therefore, good posters not only provide static reading, but also should be a static drama that can be used for the flow of appreciation, taste and collection. The poster design, each designer will have its own focus and use some ideas, pay attention to color, with abstract graphics and character color to express the contents of the book, some focus on the complete form of a book to tell the story. From the full significance of poster binding is not binding and there can be no poster posters, this is even the spirit cannot do without the same body, even if the narrow limits of art in the poster design range, no poster binding, will also tend to be humble and lack of beauty, white appearance is not difficult to imagine. However, the information is delicious, need a good environment and good dishes containing will give people to enjoy, using material posters in the layout of a good environment for information expression is as important as the poster.","[He Weiwei] Jiangxi Coll Foreign Studies, Nanchang 330099, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",,"He, WW (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Coll Foreign Studies, Nanchang 330099, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",HeWeiwei@yeah.net,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-263-3,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,85.0,,,,,,322,326,,,,,,5,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BI0YD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000405302500071,0

It is designed to track changes in conditional variance of financial returns by assigning exponentially decreasing weights to the observed past squared measurements. Recently, several on-line (i.e. recursive) estimation techniques suitable for this class of stochastic models have been introduced. These methods undoubtedly represent attractive alternatives to the common identification and calibration procedures (i.e. off-line or batch); they can estimate and control the process behaviour in real time. The aim of the paper is to examine different EWMA model estimators by using financial data. For instance, one might consider the Value at Risk (VaR) backtesting approach since Value at Risk predictions are relevant outputs of the RiskMetrics EWMA modelling framework (especially from the practical point of view). Therefore, various VaR backtests can be used to study the adequacy of different EWMA model estimators.","[Hendrych, Radek; Cipra, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Fac Math & Phys, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Hendrych, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Fac Math & Phys, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic.",hendrych@karlin.mff.cuni.cz; cipra@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,"Hendrych, Radek/HJH-3526-2023; Cipra, Tomáš/P-4882-2017; Hendrych, Radek/O-8266-2017; Cipra, Tomáš/N-8668-2019","Hendrych, Radek/0000-0003-3222-3148; Cipra, Tomáš/0000-0003-0604-324X; Hendrych, Radek/0000-0003-3222-3148; Cipra, Tomáš/0000-0003-0604-324X",,,,,10,2,2,0,2,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,265,270,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500046,0

This paper proposes a space-time distribution information mining method for small watershed soil erosion based on density track clustering. The method firstly use water and soil loss equation to form the model for small watershed soil erosion, calculate rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility factor, slope length factor of small watershed area, on the basis of spatial and temporal information included in small watershed soil erosion trajectory, spatial and time neighborhood density of soil erosion is clustered to dig out the temporal and spatial distribution pattern information of soil erosion. The simulation proved that spatial and time distribution information mining method for small watershed soil erosion based on the density cluster of tracks has a high value in the field of soil erosion.","[Huang, Jing; Li, Li; Hou, Xinxin] Yellow River Inst Hydraul Res, Zhengzhou, Herts, Peoples R China",Yangtze River Water Resources Protection Bureau,"Huang, J (通讯作者)，Yellow River Inst Hydraul Res, Zhengzhou, Herts, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,6,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7914-0,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,58.0,,,,,,449,453,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7QX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391643800085,0

The teaching performance is measured by the number of students and number of graduated in the given period. The research performance is defined according to the national rules by the number of so called RIV points. The overall performance level in the given period is estimated using Data Envelopment Analysis model with constant returns to scale assumption. The input in the period t is partly based on the efficiency or super-efficiency scores from the preceding period. Super-efficiency score given by Andersen and Petersen model is used for discrimination among efficient units. The results of the allocation in the last period are compared to the ones calculated to the standard methodology.

First problem is related to the licence limitation that doesn't allow software to be distributed outside the class so students can't use it on their own computers at home. The second problem is that after finishing the course in most cases students won't actually use such software in practice nor their further studies. In order to enable students to transfer their knowledge from lectures to practice, the appropriate statistical freeware is needed for the introductory course. Among other solutions under consideration, the free open-source GUI (Graphical User Interface) RKWard for R programming language appears to be the most suitable one, because its build in plugin architecture allows teacher to adapt the GUI for the requirements of the specific subject. Plus the rising popularity of R creates an opportunity to introduce students to modern programming language used in a wide range of areas.

This policy is peculiar because it also changes the sheepskin effects (signaling effects) of schooling, through its redefinition of the schooling tiers. The policy is also interesting due to its large spillover effects on post-compulsory schooling as well as its remarkable overall effect; for instance, we find that the completed years of schooling by age 17 increases by 1.5 years for rural women. The policy equalizes the educational attainment of urban and rural children substantially. The urban-rural gap in the completed years of schooling at age 17 falls by 0.5 years for men and by 0.7 to 0.8 years for women. However, there is no evidence of a narrowing gender gap with the policy.

For such aim we use correlation analysis. In deep view into dependence structure is done via dynamic correlation. We use quarterly data over the period 2003-2015. However, an attention is paid to the period during and after the financial crisis where the particular role of shadow bank institutions seems to be important. We conclude that banking institutions of the analysed Euro Area countries originated fewer loans in reaction to tighter lending standards (imposed by banking institutions on their loans). However, the expected positive impact of tighter lending standards, higher interest rates and higher capital requirements on loans provided by shadow banking institutions is confirmed only in some periods and frequency ranges.","[Kucerova, Zuzana] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Natl Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Pomenkova, Jitka] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Elect Engn & Commun, Tech 12, Brno 61600, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Brno University of Technology,"Kucerová, Z (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Natl Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",zuzana.kucerova@vsb.cz; pomenkaj@feec.vutbr.cz,"Kucerova, Zuzana/K-6162-2018","Kucerova, Zuzana/0000-0001-6888-9262",,,,,16,0,0,0,3,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,471,476,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500081,0

As for individual investors, the reasons for making impact investments vary widely, for many, the opportunity to make a difference locally is a strong motivating force. For the other individuals, impact investing is a logical extension of goals they have pursued in other aspects of their lives.

The structure of car ownership costs is analyzed. The focus of the study is the share of transport taxes in the cost of owning a car. Calculations are done for the amount of fixed transport taxes per day of owning a car regardless of the intensity of use, and the amount of variable transport taxes per kilometer of car travel. It is concluded that the share of transport taxes in the cost of owning a car does not exceed 10 to 13 percent regardless of the vehicle class.

Legislative principles in this matter differ: in some states a whistleblowers' protection has been provided by a special law, and in some states the protection of persons reporting corruption and other types of misconduct of employer is provided by labor law. The status of person being a whistleblower differs as well, ranging from protection only in public service, to protection of person being engaged in either current employment, or future or past employment, according to principles of International Labor Organization. The protection of whistleblowers by the European Union, in sense of, inter alia, latest efforts by the European Parliament and Ombudsman shall be analyzed and Council of Europe recommendations and legal views as well, having especially regard to some recent key judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, which dealt with the whistleblowers' protection in scope of their right to freedom of expression, creating thus a valuable case-law in this respect. Finally the legal protection of whistleblowing in Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina is analyzed. Being a key feature of a democratic society, the absence of adequate whistleblowers` protection from retaliation, discourages the reporting of misconduct, fraud and corruption, which is done in good faith and in public interest, and deprives the society of one essential factor of its control. Therefore, effective legal protection of whistleblowers provided for in a special law and effectively implemented in praxis is of utmost importance.","[Mirjanic, Zeljko] Univ Banja Luka, Fac Law, Banja Luka, Bosnia & Herceg; [Cosabic, Jasna] Banja Luka Coll, Banja Luka, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Banja Luka (UNIBL),"Mirjanic, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Banja Luka, Fac Law, Banja Luka, Bosnia & Herceg.",zemirjanic@gmail.com; jasnacosabic@live.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,7,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,97,107,,,,,,11,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400010,0

Using data from the Chinese Household Income Project 1995 and 2002, I first show that the whole saving rate distribution shifts up for both rural and urban households. The shift, however, differs between rural and urban households and is heterogeneous across the distribution: while rural saving increased the most at lower percentiles, urban saving experienced a larger shift at higher percentiles. Moreover, decomposition in the saving distribution shows that most of the increase in the rural saving rate is due to rising income. In contrast, only a small portion of the increase in the urban saving rate can be explained by changes in household characteristics including income. The rising urban saving rates are instead explained by changes in quantile regression coefficients over time, especially at the top of the saving distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To achieve our goals, we choose and estimate a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model specified for a small open economy. The model is characterized by an explicitly defined labor market. The model version of this sector of the economy contains several frictions in form of a search and matching function, wage adjustment costs, hiring costs and wage bargaining processes. We implement a few different Taylor-type equations, which represent the decision making rule of the monetary authority. This approach helps us identify the main relationships, which the monetary policy maker takes into consideration while setting the interest rates.

In Thailand, milk from dairy farms is generally transported to milk collection centre (MCC) and then transferred to milk processing plant. However, some milk from MCC is sold to local milk retailers. The quality of raw milk is very important for people's health. Therefore, the aim of this study was to monitor milk hygiene during transfer from dairy farms to the MCC and from bulk tank milk to milk retailers by counting the microorganisms in raw milk using standard plate count (SPC) method. Raw milk samples of 15 dairy farms in Maha Sarakham province were collected in summer (Mar-Jun), raining (July-Oct) and winter (Nov-Feb) seasons. After milking, raw milk was collected for SPC test. Additionally, the time for milk transportation, environmental and milk temperatures in milk bucket were also recorded. Those parameters were repeatedly recorded at MCC before being poured into the bulk tank. Cooled raw milk in the bulk tank was sampled before packed in 5 kg plastic bag and carried to 9 milk retailers in town. The results found that the average of time for milk transport from dairy farm to MCC was 76.29 min. Milk temperatures decreased from farm to MCC for all seasons. The SPC of milk at farm in summer (5.812 log(10)CFU) was higher than in raining (5.743 log(10) CFU) and winter (5.713 log(10) CFU) (P < 0.05) seasons. The SPC from farm to MCC significantly increased (P < 0.05) in all seasons. The average of time for milk transportation from MCC to milk retailers were 89.44, 178.00 and 156.11 min (P < 0.05) in summer raining and winter, respectively. In conclusion, more attention should be paid to milk hygiene and temperature from milking in the farm through milk retailers, especially in the summer. The microorganism could grow rapidly during milk transportation from farm to MCC in raining season. Thus, cooling down the milk or rapid delivery of milk bucket to MCC should be considered seriously.

Based on the FTSE-NAREIT return indices for the equity REIT (EREIT) and mortgage REIT (MREIT), we found corroborative evidence of the temporal declines in the betas of the two REITs up to 1999. The time-varying beta characteristics of the two REIT betas are fundamentally different in the 2000s. While the MREIT betas continued to decline, the EREIT betas showed a sharp reversal of the downward trend. Coinciding with the low interest regime in the US, EREITs used more external debt to fund new acquisitions and development activities, and as a result, the EREIT betas increased sharply in 2000s. The EREIT betas hit the peak in 2009; and declined thereafter when active deleveraging occurred in the market. Using firm level data, we construct two leverage-sorted EREIT portfolios, and our empirical results do not reject the leverage effects on time-varying EREIT betas.

With the aim of analysing how Croatian companies report on corporate social responsibility and sustainability, authors analysed the non-financial reports of Croatian companies referring to the year 2014, which were available on the official websites of the companies. Authors analysed the content, form and the extent of the reports and gave an overview of the most common used indicators, as well as variations across industry sectors.

We estimated the model using a set of the Czech and Euro area data series and then performed a simulation using the method and tools proposed and developed in Holden (2016). Our aim was to show the impact of a long-term use of asymmetric exchange rate commitment into the economy. To answer this question we analyse the simulated trajectories of an endogenous variables that represent the development of economy.

Its stationary density allows for skewness, different tail shapes and bimodality. There are two stable equilibria in bimodality case and movement from one equilibrium to another is interpreted as a crash. Qualitative properties of the cusp model were employed to model crashes on financial markets, however, practical applications of the model employed the stationary distribution, which does not take into account the serial dependence between observations. Because closed-form solution of the transition density is not known, one has to use approximate technique to estimate transition density. This paper extends approximate maximum likelihood method, which relies on the closed-form expansion of the transition density, to incorporate time-varying parameters of the drift function to be driven by market fundamentals. A measure to predict endogenous crashes of the model is proposed using transition density estimates. Empirical example estimates Iceland Krona depreciation with respect to the British Pound in the year 2001 using differential of interbank interest rates as a market fundamental.","[Vorisek, Jan] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Vodarenskou Vezi 4, CZ-18208 Prague 8, Czech Republic; [Vorisek, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, CZ-18675 Prague 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,"Vorísek, J (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Vodarenskou Vezi 4, CZ-18208 Prague 8, Czech Republic.;Vorísek, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, CZ-18675 Prague 8, Czech Republic.",vorisek@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,892,897,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500153,0

The lognormal distribution is mostly used in modelling the wage distribution, To specify the future wage density function, it is necessary to know the values of its parameters. The estimation of parameters is normally based on past empirical observations. However, if we want to predict the future density function, we do not have any usable data for the process of parameter estimation. In the paper we propose a procedure to solve this problem. Because we know the history of the parameters, we apply a trend analysis to their historical time series. When we obtain a suitable model, we are able to estimate the future values of the parameters. Then we can specify the future wage density function.

Continuous approximations frequently prove useful when equilibria are difficult to compute in underlying discretized models, however the presence of payoff discontinuities in pay-as-bid auctions implies that current equilibrium existence results cannot be directly applied to the natural continuous approximation of the pay-as-bid auction. I establish the existence of pure-strategy Bayesian-Nash equilibria in divisible-good pay-as-bid auctions with private information. Existence in the divisible-good model follows from examining a particular limit of strategies in discretized models, taken as the discretization becomes infinitesimal. The techniques employed in demonstrating that properly-defined limiting strategies are mutual best responses may be useful to establishing the existence of pure-strategy equilibria in other models which do not meet the assumptions of the current equilibrium existence literature. That the proof of existence relies on a semi-constructive argument from equilibria in discretized auctions implies that equilibrium in the divisible-good model can approximate equilibrium in nearby multi-unit auctions, hence the divisible-good model may be a reasonable approximation of real-world multi-unit auctions. I further show that equilibrium strategies must exhibit strategic ironing, a phenomenon in which the bidding incentives for an infinitesimal quantity are linked to the bidding incentives for nearby quantities. Strategic ironing implies that incentives in the discriminatory divisible-good auction differ from those in the classical single-unit first-price auction in ways which have not previously been recognized. While equilibrium first-order conditions give the impression that divisible-good auctions may be solved by a system of differential equations, strategic ironing implies that the optimal bid for any particular quantity may depend on non-local constraints, and has negative implications for the tractability of equilibrium strategies.","[Woodward, Kyle] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA",University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Woodward, K (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA.",kyle.woodward@unc.edu,,,,,,,0,1,1,0,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,121,121,,10.1145/2940716.2940788,0.0,,,1,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300013,0

The response to this mortgage market crisis led to myriad changes in the industry, including tightened underwriting standards and new market regulations. The result is a growing concern that credit standards are now too tight, restricting the recovery of the housing market. Faced with this history, policy analysts, regulators and industry participants have been forced to consider how best to balance the tension inherent in managing mortgage credit risk without unduly restricting access to credit. Our research is unique in providing explicit consideration of this trade-off in the context of mortgage underwriting. Using recent mortgage market data, we explore whether modern automated underwriting systems (AUS) can be used to extend credit to borrowers responsibly, with a particular focus on target populations that include minorities and those with low and moderate incomes. We find that modern AUS do offer a potentially valuable tool for balancing the tensions of extending credit at acceptable risks, either by using scorecards that mix through-the-cycle and stress scorecard approaches or by adjusting the cutpointmore relaxed cutpoints allow for higher levels of default while providing more access, tighter cutpoints accept fewer borrowers while allowing less credit risk.","[Courchane, Marsha J.] Charles River Associates Inc, Boston, MA 02116 USA; [Kiefer, Leonard C.; Zorn, Peter M.] Freddie Mac, New York, NY USA",Charles River Associates,"Courchane, MJ (通讯作者)，Charles River Associates Inc, Boston, MA 02116 USA.",mcourchane@crai.com; leonard_kiefer@freddiemac.com; peter_zorn@freddiemac.com,,,,,,,12,6,8,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2015,43.0,4.0,,,,,993,1034,,10.1111/1540-6229.12105,0.0,,,42,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,CU6ZL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363683900007,0

However, it is by now widely acknowledged that these variables are not able to fully explain exports developments. This paper suggests considering domestic demand pressure as an additional variable, revisiting its economic rationale and assessing its empirical importance. In particular, we consider the Portuguese case and find that domestic demand developments are relevant for the short-run dynamics of exports. Moreover, it is found that this relationship is asymmetric, being stronger and more significant when domestic demand is falling than when it is increasing.","[Esteves, Paulo Soares] Banco Portugal, Off Governor, P-1100150 Lisbon, Portugal; [Rua, Antonio] Banco Portugal, Econ Res Dept, P-1150012 Lisbon, Portugal",Banco de Portugal; Banco de Portugal,"Esteves, P (通讯作者)，Banco Portugal, Off Governor, R Comercio 148, P-1100150 Lisbon, Portugal.",pmesteves@bportugal.pt; antonio.rua@bportugal.pt,,"Rua, Antonio/0000-0003-2494-9758",,,,,60,33,37,1,19,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We first document stylized facts regarding the effect of trade liberalization on export prices. Next, we develop an analytic framework that relates a firm's choice of quality to its access to imported intermediates. In the model, a reduction in import tariffs induces a firm to increase export quality and raise its export price in industries where the scope for quality differentiation is large and lower its export price in industries where the scope is small.

Using monthly data on the unemployment rate, labour force participation rate and employment for Australia for the period from 1978 to 2012, we estimate a Markov-switching SVAR model to examine the relationship between unemployment and labour force participation and the performance of the Australian labour market. Three distinct labour market regimes are identified. We find that the labour market switches between periods of low unemployment and high participation, prolonged periods of relative stability and short, sharp periods of high unemployment and low participation. A key finding is that, due to the behaviour of workers not in the labour force, the long-term effect of an upswing in labour hiring results in a lower unemployment rate and a lower labour force participation rate.","[Gaston, Noel] Flinders Univ S Australia, Natl Inst Labour Studies, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Rajaguru, Gulasekaran] Bond Univ, Sch Business, Gold Coast, Qld 4229, Australia",Flinders University South Australia; Bond University,"Rajaguru, G (通讯作者)，Bond Univ, Sch Business, Gold Coast, Qld 4229, Australia.",rgulasek@bond.edu.au,"Gulasekaran, Rajaguru/AAW-4717-2021","Gulasekaran, Rajaguru/0000-0003-2816-1749",,,,,47,2,2,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Matrix illustrates the interactions among interregional and intersectoral economic activities and is considered a key component in input-output modeling. Using MATHEMATICA as software tool we introduce a method to construct and present matrix both graphically, with static and dynamic images, and analytically. The output produced enables understanding and/or teaching theoretical trade hypotheses. Furthermore, our computational approach produces random, structured matrices of trade coefficients, which makes possible infinite computer experiments with interregional input-output models of any size, without typing in input.

We document the following stylized facts about stock market's reaction to money supply and examine the effect across the entire distribution of stock returns. Using a nonparametric Granger causality in mean test, we find that money supply has no impact on stock prices, which confirms many of the existing results that were based on linear mean regression. By contrast, when a nonparametric causality in distribution (hereafter general Granger causality) test and quantile regression based test were used, the effect of money becomes apparent and statistically very significant. Interestingly, money supply affects the left and right tails of stock return distribution but not its center. This might indicate that the monetary policy measure money supply is effective only during recessions and expansions. We have also investigated the extent to which the impact of money supply on stock returns detected by the nonparametric and quantile regression based tests can be attributed to a time-varying conditional variance of stock returns. After controlling for volatility persistence in stock returns, we continue to find evidence for the reaction of conditional distribution of stock market returns to money supply growth rate.","[Taamouti, Abderrahim] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham DH1 3LB, England",Durham University,"Taamouti, A (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Sch Business, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",abderrahim.taamouti@durham.ac.uk,,"Taamouti, Abderrahim/0000-0002-1360-8803","Spanish Ministry of Education [SEJ 2007-63098, ECO2010-19357]",Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government),We thank the Editor-in-Chief Prof. Bruce Mizrach and an anonymous referee for their very useful comments.

In both states, bilateral treaties were preferred over national legislation in overcoming dual nationality.

In this paper, we explore instead the long-run effects of shadow economy measures-obtained independently from money demand functions-on the velocity of circulation of money. Empirical evidence from a panel covering 43 countries over the period 1981-2005 shows that variations in the relative size of the unrecorded sector have a negative and significant effect on the velocity of circulation of money. This is because, ceteris paribus, the higher the share of the shadow economy, the higher the demand for currency and therefore the lower the velocity of circulation of money. The negative relation between underground economic activity and velocity of circulation of money is robust to the use of different shadow economy estimates, to a sub-sample analysis and to the inclusion of a time trend.","[Onnis, Luisanna] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England; [Tirelli, Patrizio] Univ Milano Bicocca, I-20100 Milan, Italy",Lancaster University; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Onnis, L (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England.",l.onnis@lancaster.ac.uk,"Tirelli, Patrizio/AAM-3422-2020","Onnis, Luisanna/0000-0001-5457-9757; tirelli, patrizio/0000-0002-0171-8861",,,,,65,4,5,0,21,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This paper clarifies the concept of energy congestion and adapts a slacks-based DEA method to examine the energy congestion effect in Chinese industrial sectors over time. Our empirical results show that Chinese industrial sectors showed an increasing trend in energy congestion. The size of energy congestion effect varied across different provinces and regions. The central area had a significantly higher amount of energy congestion than that in west area, while the east area registered for the lowest energy congestion inefficiency. On average, 32 % of the energy consumption in Chinese industry was excessively used. A multiple regression analysis within a panel data analysis framework shows that the total energy consumption and industrial value added per capita have a positive while total-factor energy efficiency has a negative effect on energy congestion.","[Wu, F.; Zhou, P.; Zhou, D.

Using multivariate statistical analysis, it examines whether citizens' engagement in post-communist politics is linked with generic socioeconomic and attitudinal traits or, alternatively, if it is connected with selective mobilisation opportunities provided by social networks and organisations. The findings reveal that while most Romanians are politically inactive two decades after the fall of communism, those who engage in politics do so selectively and their political action repertoires are largely influenced by four mobilising agents: trade unions; political parties; social networks; and civil society organisations.","Univ Oradea, Polit Sci, Dept Polit Sci & Commun Studies, Oradea 410087, Romania",University of Oradea,"Tatar, MI (通讯作者)，Univ Oradea, Polit Sci, Dept Polit Sci & Commun Studies, Str Univ 1, Oradea 410087, Romania.",mtatar@uoradea.ro,"Tatar, Marius Ioan/AAE-6009-2019; Tătar, Marius/C-3008-2012; Tatar, Marius Ioan/AAU-2297-2020","Tatar, Marius Ioan/0000-0001-9321-569X; Tătar, Marius/0000-0001-9321-569X;","Romanian National Council of Scientific Research (CNCSIS) [BD 262]; Robert Bosch Fellowship - Institute for Human Sciences, Vienna; Robert Bosch Stiftung, Berlin","Romanian National Council of Scientific Research (CNCSIS)(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)); Robert Bosch Fellowship - Institute for Human Sciences, Vienna; Robert Bosch Stiftung, Berlin","Work on this article was partially supported by the Romanian National Council of Scientific Research (CNCSIS) grant no.

We use a random effects-random coefficient model to test whether Gibrat's law holds on average in the studied sample as well as at the individual firm level in the Swedish energy market. No study has yet investigated whether Gibrat's law holds for individual firms, previous studies having instead estimated whether the law holds on average in the samples studied. The present results support the claim that Gibrat's law is more likely to be rejected ex ante when an entire firm population is considered, but more likely to be confirmed ex post after market selection has cleaned the original population of firms or when the analysis treats more disaggregated data. From a theoretical perspective, the results are consistent with models based on passive and active learning, indicating a steady state in the firm expansion process and that Gibrat's law is violated in the short term but holds in the long term once firms have reached a steady state. These results indicate that approximately 70 % of firms in the Swedish energy sector are in steady state, with only random fluctuations in size around that level over the 15 studied years.","Dalarna Univ, S-79188 Falun, Sweden",Dalarna University,"Tang, AL (通讯作者)，Dalarna Univ, S-79188 Falun, Sweden.",ata@du.se,,,,,,,57,16,19,1,20,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

There are fewer studies that focus on the role played by the inter-port competitive environment. This role remains difficult to assess. In fact, on the one hand, a port subject to high inter-port competition may record higher efficiency scores due to the pressure from the competitive environment. On the other hand, a port subject to high competition may be forced to over-invest and could therefore records a lower efficiency score. This article investigates this issue and examines how the degree of competition measured at different levels (local, regional and global level) impacts the efficiency score of a given container port. To do so, we implement a truncated regression with a parametric bootstrapping model. The model applied to information gathered for 200 container ports in 2007 and 2010 leads to the following conclusions: port efficiency decreases with competition intensity when measured in a range of 400-800 km (regional level); and the effect from competition is not significant when competition is measured at a local (less than 300 km) or at a global (more than 800 km) level. Estimates also show a tendency for ports who invested from 2007 to 2010 to experience a general decrease in efficiency scores, an element which could be explained by the time lag between the investment and the subsequent potential increase in container throughput.

This article examines whether the asymmetric gains and losses of modified Stableford scoring are associated with more aggressive play. Although the results indicate that modified Stableford scoring is associated with longer tee shots and an increased likelihood of tee shots missing the fairway, modified Stableford scoring is unrelated to golfers' likelihood of going for the green on par-five holes, the likelihood of first putts being made, the likelihood of first putts being hit beyond the cup, and the distribution of scores relative to par.

In recent years, some states have chosen to eliminate the vehicle safety inspection program because of budget constraints and concerns about program effectiveness. Currently, 26 states have a schedule for conducting safety inspections, but Pennsylvania is one of thirteen states that currently require all personal light duty vehicles to be inspected every year. The remaining states have completely eliminated safety inspection programs. However, as automobiles become safer, Pennsylvania legislators are now pushing to phase out the inspection program to reduce the costs of owning a vehicle. This study combines Pennsylvania vehicle registration data with two large samples of results from state safety inspections. We find that the state safety inspection fail rate for light-duty vehicles is 12-18%, well above the often-cited rate of 2%. Vehicles that are older than three years old or have more than about 30,000 miles can have much higher rates. When analyzing new vehicles, less than or equal to one year old, it is found that even these vehicles have a failure rate greater than zero. Furthermore, while the vehicle fleet appears to be getting safer over the past few years by improvements in technology or other external circumstances, the inspection failure rate does not appear to be trending toward zero in the near future. We also show that accurate inspection data is limited and often incorrectly analyzed. Lastly, the importance of vehicle maintenance over a vehicle's lifetime is proven to be evident, since regular usage causes vehicles to deteriorate.

To date, however, transferability of activity-based models has not been frequently assessed. This paper assesses the spatial transferability of an activity-based model, TASHA (Travel Activity Scheduler for Household Agents), which has been developed for the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada. TASHA has been transferred to the context of the Island of Montreal, Canada using the 2003 Origin-Destination (O-D) travel survey and the 2001 Canadian Census. It generates daily schedules of activities (individual and joint) for each individual in this region. The modelled activity attributes (frequency, start time, duration and distance) from TASHA and observed attributes from the 2003 O-D travel survey are compared for five different activities (i.e. work, school, shopping, other, and return to home). At the aggregate level, TASHA provides quite reasonable outcomes (in some cases - better results than for the Toronto Area) for all four attributes for work, school and return to home activities with few exceptions (for instance, school start time). The model outcomes are also promising for shopping frequency and start times; however, TASHA provides larger differences for average shopping durations and distances. Only the forecasts for all four attributes for the 'other' activity type differ greatly with the observed attributes for the Montreal Island. These large differences most likely indicate the differences in behaviour between the Montreal Island and the Toronto Area. In general, we conclude that re-estimation of model parameters and the use of local activity attribute distributions (frequency, start time and duration) is a desirable step in the transfer of the TASHA model from one context to another.

It also has unrivalled access to economic data, high-level connections to financial institutions, and a large staff of professionally trained economists. Why then was it apparently unconcerned by the financial developments that are now widely recognized to have caused the 2008 financial crisis? Using a wide range of Fed documents from the pre-crisis period, particularly the transcripts of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), this paper shows that Fed policymakers and staff were aware of relevant developments in financial markets, but paid infrequent attention to them and disregarded significant systemic threats. Drawing on literatures in economics, political science and sociology, the paper then demonstrates that the Fed's intellectual paradigm in the years before the crisis focused on 'post hoc interventionism' - the institution's ability to limit the fallout should a systemic disturbance arise. Further, the paper argues that institutional routines played a crucial role in maintaining this paradigm and in contributing to the Fed's inadequate attention to the warning signals in the pre-crisis period.","[Golub, Stephen] Swarthmore Coll, Dept Econ, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA; [Kaya, Ayse] Swarthmore Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA; [Reay, Michael] Swarthmore Coll, Dept Sociol, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA",Swarthmore College; Swarthmore College; Swarthmore College,"Golub, S (通讯作者)，Swarthmore Coll, Dept Econ, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA.",,,,Swarthmore College Frank Aydelotte Foundation for the Advancement of the Liberal Arts,Swarthmore College Frank Aydelotte Foundation for the Advancement of the Liberal Arts,"The authors thank Yuan Wang and Caleb Jones for exceptional research assistance, and John Caskey, Ted Crone, Philip Jefferson, Mark Kuperberg, and Ellen Magenheim for comments and the Swarthmore College Frank Aydelotte Foundation for the Advancement of the Liberal Arts for funding.",,84,24,27,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Since 2000, however, the proportion of LNG-traded spot or under short-term contracts has grown substantially, while long-term contracts have become more flexible. While long-term contracts increase the debt capacity of large, long-lived, capital investments by reducing cash flow variability, they also may limit the ability of the contracting parties to take advantage of profitable ephemeral trading opportunities. After developing a model that illustrates these trade-offs, we argue that increased LNG market liquidity resulting from a number of exogenous changes is likely to encourage much greater volume and destination flexibility in contracts and increased reliance on short-term and spot market trades. These changes would, in turn, reinforce the initial increase in market liquidity.","[Hartley, Peter R.] Rice Univ, Econ, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Hartley, Peter R.] Rice Univ, James A Baker III Inst Publ Policy, Energy Studies, Houston, TX 77005 USA; [Hartley, Peter R.] Univ Western Australia, Energy & Resource Econ, Nedlands, WA 6009, Australia",Rice University; Rice University; University of Western Australia,"Hartley, PR (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ, MS22,6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",hartley@rice.edu,,"Hartley, Peter/0000-0003-4967-720X",,,,,12,23,25,0,17,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2015,36.0,3.0,,,,,209,233,,10.5547/01956574.36.3.phar,0.0,,,25,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CK8CN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356466100009,0

The research adopted an exploratory approach, with interviews carried out with representatives of food industries and retailers located in four European countries. The results suggest that food chain actors have a limited interest in ROP consumers and difficulties in the design and production of healthy food for ROP consumers.

Using semiparametric econometric techniques, the output elasticities for 15 OECD countries for the period 1980-2004 are estimated. The results indicate that biases do exist and they are significant. When corrected, the effects of all three types of capital are positive, significant, and they vary across countries and time. Furthermore, there exist interactions between the three capital variables, implying a complimentary relationship between domestic (ICT and non-ICT) and FDI capital. Additionally, the rates of return to FDI are high and heterogeneous, suggesting that in most countries, there is need for more investment.","[Ketteni, Elena] Frederick Univ, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Kottaridi, Constantina] Univ Pireaus, Dept Econ, Piraeus, Greece; [Mamuneas, Theofanis P.] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Piraeus; University of Cyprus,"Ketteni, E (通讯作者)，Frederick Univ, Nicosia, Cyprus.",bus.ke@fit.ac.cy; kottarid@unipi.gr; tmamuneas@ucy.ac.cy,,"Ketteni, Elena/0000-0002-0889-9204; Mamuneas, Theofanis/0000-0002-8426-2141",,,,,42,14,15,0,37,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This paper assesses the impact of both these channels on upper secondary school dropout among Norwegian youth in the period 1994-2006. The effect of local labor market conditions is measured using variation in youth outflow rates from unemployment to employment across regions over time. The results show that local labor market conditions play a substantial role in individual dropout decisions in Norway, with elasticities ranging from 0.1 to 0.3. The opportunity cost of schooling seems to weigh more in the dropout decision for Norwegian youth than the expected returns. However, the results are highly sensitive to the choice of local labor market indicator. When including the unemployment rate, which is the standard indicator used in empirical applications of schooling decisions, instead of the outflow rate, the estimates become smaller and in most cases insignificant. This indicates that previous studies of school dropout may have understated the importance of local labor market conditions.","Inst Social Res, N-0208 Oslo, Norway",,"von Simson, K (通讯作者)，Inst Social Res, Postboks 3233, N-0208 Oslo, Norway.",kvs@samfunnsforskning.no,,,Norwegian Research Council,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"This paper is part of the project The Educational System in Norway, funded by the Norwegian Research Council.

This study was inspired by a client who asked: I have tens of approved road extension projects, but my financial resources are limited. I cannot construct all the projects simultaneously, so can you help me prioritize my projects? To address this question, the benefits and costs of all the possible scenarios must be known. However, the impacts (or benefit) of road extension projects are highly interdependent, and in sizable cases cannot be specified thoroughly. We demonstrate that the problem is analogous to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Dynamic change in travel demand during construction is another aspect of the complexity of the problem. The literature is yet to provide efficient methods for large cases. To this end, we developed a heuristic methodology in which the variation of travel demand during the construction period is considered. We introduce a geometrical objective function for which a solution-finding policy based on gradient maximization is developed. To address the projects' interdependency, a special neural network (NN) model was devised. We developed a search engine hybridized of Ant Colony and Genetic Algorithm to seek a solution to the TSP-like problem on the NN based on gradient maximization. The algorithm was calibrated and applied to real data from the city of Winnipeg, Canada, as well as two cases based on Sioux-Falls. The results were reliable and identification of the optimum solution was achievable within acceptable computational time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This is done using maximum likelihood estimation, taking into account the nested structure of the data. Paris is historically divided into 20 arrondissements, each divided into four quartiers (quarters), which in turn contain between 15 and 169 blocks (ilot, in French) per quartier. This is an unbalanced pseudopanel data containing 156,896 transactions. Despite the richness of the data, many neighborhood characteristics are not observed, and we attempt to capture these neighborhood spillover effects using a spatial lag model. Using likelihood ratio tests, we find significant spatial lag effects as well as significant nested random error effects. The empirical results show that the hedonic housing estimates and the corresponding marginal effects are affected by taking into account the nested aspects of the Paris housing data as well as the spatial neighborhood effects.Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Baltagi, Badi H.] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Baltagi, Badi H.] Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England; [Bresson, Georges] Univ Paris 04, Univ Paris 02, F-75230 Paris 05, France; [Etienne, Jean-Michel] Univ Paris 11, Sceaux, France",Syracuse University; University of Leicester; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Universite Paris Saclay,"Baltagi, BH (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",bbaltagi@maxwell.syr.edu,,"Baltagi, Badi/0000-0003-0469-4479",,,,,32,29,33,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

What influences the magnitude of the tip given? Who is likely to tip more than the norm? A survey among diners was conducted at one of South Africa's largest arts festivals. Using regression analyses, this paper aims to identify the factors that influence tipping behaviour in South Africa. While most previous research has focused on motivational and/or psychological reasons for tipping, this research contributes towards understanding tipping from an economic perspective. The results show that the frequency of tipping and its magnitude are a function of the ability to pay. However, socio-demographics play an important role, especially in the paying of the above-normal tip.","[Saayman, Melville; Saayman, Andrea] North West Univ, Tourism Res Econ Environs & Soc, ZA-2521 Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Saayman, M (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Tourism Res Econ Environs & Soc, Potchefstroom Campus,Private Bag X6001, ZA-2521 Potchefstroom, South Africa.",melville.saayman@nwu.ac.za; andrea.saayman@nwu.ac.za,"Saayman, Andrea/A-1603-2018","Saayman, Andrea/0000-0002-9506-8141; saayman, melville/0000-0001-9991-0140",National Research Foundation of South Africa [85625]; NRF,National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa); NRF,"The authors wish to thank the participants at the 2014 QATEM Workshop as well as the two reviewers for their valuable comments.

Data obtained from the third round of the European Social Survey (2006) indicate a high level of anti-foreigner sentiment in contemporary Russia - more than 60% of Russians claimed that immigrants undermine the cultural life of the country, and almost 60% claimed that immigration is bad for the economy of the country. Our multivariate analysis showed that the two sets of individual-level predictors of anti-foreigner sentiment - the socioeconomic position of individuals (as suggested by the competition model) and conservative views and ideologies (as suggested by the cultural model) - are not meaningful in predicting anti-foreigner sentiment in post-socialist Russia.

First, we characterize all bribe-proof rules as the class of efficient, (preference and endowment) strategy-proof and weakly replacement monotonic rules, extending the result due to Mass and Neme (Games Econ Behav 61: 331-343, 2007) to our broader framework.

To prepare decisions, secretariats gather and analyze information and subsequently provide the member states with an assessment on the alternative courses of action. In this process, secretariats may accumulate an information surplus over the member states. They can use this advantage to suggest options close to their own interests. This article argues that, to counter such agency problem, the member states unilaterally invest in shadow bureaucracies with the aim to reduce informational asymmetries. Shadow bureaucracies are, however, costly. Member states have to weigh agency costs against the costs of domestic administrative capability. Strong states with outlier preferences are most likely to invest in shadow bureaucracies. They have most to gain. The use of shadow bureaucracies not only reduces agency costs. It also allows states more control over policy in international organizations. This article uses insights from peacekeeping in the United Nations to illustrate the argument.","Maastricht Univ, Dept Polit Sci, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Dijkstra, H (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Polit Sci, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",h.dijkstra@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Dijkstra, Hylke/E-9156-2010","Dijkstra, Hylke/0000-0003-3637-5296",,,,,67,29,30,3,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

We expand on two earlier cross-sectional studies on why fuel taxes differ across countries by using OECD panel data and employing heterogeneous panel cointegration and long-run panel Granger-causality techniques. We confirm some of those earlier studies' conclusions. Further, we find that governments that rely on consumption-based taxes for revenues will have higher gasoline tax rates (than governments that rely on income and wealth/property-based taxes). But more significantly, we determine that higher gasoline demand among consumers causes democratic governments to set lower gasoline taxes a finding with important implications for today's climate/energy policy debate.

A French perspective,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Rail freight; Infrastructure manager; Capacity; Timetabling; Shared-use network,,"Operating rail infrastructures that are shared among different uses is complex. In Western Europe, the predominance of passenger traffic over freight has traditionally led to thorough scheduling of capacity use, with an increasing tendency to anticipate through the design of regular-interval timetables. The paper discusses the specific challenges posed by fitting freight into the timetabling process for a mixed-use rail network, based on current French experience. The analysis is carried out from the perspective of the infrastructure manager. It is mainly supported by the results of a series of about 30 interviews, carried out in 2012 and 2013 with the parties involved in the timetabling process. The paper provides a comprehensive understanding of the process in terms of organization, rules and practices, with an emphasis on the characteristics of freight traffic compared with passenger traffic. The author highlights three key management issues for the French infrastructure manager when dealing with freight: (1) the uncertainty surrounding the mid-long term development of the rail freight market at the national level; (2) the heterogeneity resulting from the diversity of commodities, convoys and profiles and behaviors of the capacity applicants; (3) the volatility of some freight traffic resulting in a great amount of activity in the later stages of the timetabling process. If uncertainty about the future appears to be a highly sensitive issue in the French context, heterogeneity and volatility of freight traffic can be perceived as management challenges that may be experienced, to a greater or lesser degree, on other rail networks.

These results suggest that external conditions may have a differentiated impact on the ex ante and ex post inefficiencies created by managerial opportunism.","EM Strasbourg Business Sch, F-67085 Strasbourg, France",,"Thépot, J (通讯作者)，EM Strasbourg Business Sch, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France.",thepot@unistra.fr,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAR,2015,78.0,3.0,,,,,411,428,,10.1007/s11238-014-9427-2,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CB0ON,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349326000005,0

Contrasting these empirical and theoretical approaches opens up new research directions, and highlights the importance of socio-historical and cultural context to professions.

In such appraisals there will often be a need for including both conventional transport impacts as well as criteria of a more strategic and/or sustainable character. The proposed framework is based on the use of cost-benefit analysis featuring feasibility risk assessment in combination with multi-criteria decision analysis and is supported by the concept of decision conferencing. The framework is applied for a transport related case study dealing with the complex decision problem of determining the most attractive alternative for a new fixed link between Denmark and Sweden the so-called HH-connection. Applying the framework to the case study made it possible to address the decision problem from an economic, a strategic, and a sustainable point of view simultaneously. The outcome of the case study demonstrates the decision making framework as a valuable decision support system (DSS), and it is concluded that appraisals of transport projects can be effectively supported by the use of the DSS. Finally, perspectives of the future modelling work are given. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

I observe a shift towards a stronger role for the government and for agencies of industrial policy in the provision of industrial finance, and towards an increasingly discretionary and strategic approach to industrial policy intervention, both of which stand in tension with the neoliberal 'coordinative discourse' that continues to structure macroeconomic policy in the post-2008 context. I suggest that this tension is indicative of the emergence of two competing 'crisis diagnoses' in government after 2008; one reflecting the neoliberal coordinative discourse that structured economic policymaking prior to 2008, the other at odds with this neoliberal crisis diagnosis. I argue that constructivist analytical frameworks on crisis and political-economic change are insufficiently developed to accommodate these findings. I therefore reflect upon some conceptual and empirical implications that the findings raise for a constructivist analysis of economic policy in the post-2008 context in Britain, before concluding that a more contingent, contested and, crucially, incomplete process of re-alignment in the ideas that structure economic policymaking is underway in Britain than is generally acknowledged.","Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Craig, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Northumberland Rd, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England.",martin.craig@shef.ac.uk,,,,,,,70,13,14,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Unlike similar surges in the 1990s and in the five years leading to the global financial crisis in 2008, this time many emerging market and developing countries re-regulated cross-border financial flows. According to the literature such acts are seen as quite difficult, given the pervasiveness of the 'capital mobility hypothesis' which renders that the structural power of global financial markets is too much of a match for states, especially those in emerging markets. The paper traces how Brazil and South Korea were able to countervail the structural power of global capital markets and put in place regulations on cross-border finance in the wake of the crisis. The paper also outlines the contours an inductive theory regarding the conditions under which emerging market and developing nations may deviate from the 'capital mobility hypotheses' and similar literatures.

Design/methodology/approach - We propose an econometric approach based on a Hurdle Count Data Model which allowed us not only to overcome problems related to the count dependent variables often assuming zero values, but also to separate the willingness to patent from actual patenting. Originality/value - This methodology puts in evidence that an internal factor (i.e., human capital) significantly influences SMEs willingness to patent, while an external factor (i.e., collaboration with other firms) impacts on SME portfolio size. Differently from most studies in the area of IP management which adopt a macro level perspective and rely on secondary data (Candelin-Palmqvist et al., 2012), this paper assumes a firm-level approach and bases on primary data, which contributes to make it particularly distinctive. Practical implications - Results of our study highlight that SME innovativeness is positively influenced by human capital and external collaboration with other firms. Thus, human resource management could play an important role both in fostering employees' awareness about IPR and their ability to exploit the knowledge they can acquire from external sources.","[Agostini, Lara; Nosella, Anna; Soranzo, Benedetta] Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy",University of Padua,"Agostini, L (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Management & Engn, Stradella San Nicola 3, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy.",,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,16,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,439,451,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200034,0

There is, indeed, an increasing number of resources that provide content in different formats through programmatic interfaces, while it is still difficult for laypeople, i.e., users without expertise in programming (end users in the following), to access and exploit the content they made available. Our research aims at enabling end users to create their own software applications for exploring and composing data sources, in order to satisfy their situational information needs, also by also exploiting the Linked Open Data as new data source. Design/methodology/approach - Our work aims to combine End-User Development principles with the mashup models and technologies adopting a meta-design approach. We start from a generic mashup platform and we adapt it with respect to the requirements identified within a specific community of users. Besides several inspections of the different prototypes, formative evaluations and user tests in the university laboratory, we performed two field studies in different application domains in order to verify the usefulness of content made available by distributed data sources, as well as the overall validity of our composition approach. Originality/value - Our platform is based on a general-purpose mashup environment [Cappiello et al. 2011a], in which the composition of interactive spaces exploits a lightweight paradigm for the integration of heterogeneous resources, mainly adopting visual mechanisms. Thanks to the adoption of platform-independent modelling abstractions, the structure of the composed applications is specified in automatically-generated schemas that can be deployed on multiple devices. Such a separation of concerns, together with the possibility to extend the platform with ad-hoc visualization templates, and the ease of packaging ad-hoc content resources, facilitate the customization of our meta-design approach to specific application domains. Practical implications - Since the first time mashups were proposed in the Web technology scenario, researchers have been discussing about the potential of mashup platforms as tools to enable user-driven innovation [Daniel et al. 2011]. Our mashup platform can be considered an important tool of an entrepreneurial ecosystem. Such ecosystem is characterized by the presence of multiple actors (academic institutions, business operators and public institutions) who work collaboratively to start the processes of development of entrepreneurial skills, as well as to promote the incubation of innovative ideas and research initiatives with market potential.","[Ardito, Carmelo; Desolda, Giuseppe] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Informat, I-70125 Bari, Italy; [Matera, Maristella] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Elettron Informaz & Bioingn, I-20134 Milan, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Desolda, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Informat, Via Orabona 4, I-70125 Bari, Italy.",,"Ardito, Carmelo/AAJ-9697-2020; Desolda, Giuseppe/U-8319-2019","Ardito, Carmelo/0000-0001-8993-9855; Desolda, Giuseppe/0000-0001-9894-2116",,,,,15,0,0,0,20,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1454,1464,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200112,0

Different micrometeorological techniques (i.e. surface renewal analysis of sensible heat flux, surface energy balance) were used to estimate the evapotranspiration fluxes of the irrigated orange grove in eastern Sicily (Italy). Transpiration was determined by the sap flow method. The results showed satisfactory comparisons between the investigated methods. The findings of this study will allow for the definition of suitable techniques and methodology for the rational management of water resources in the tree crop environment under water scarcity conditions.","[Consoli, Simona; Papa, Rita] Univ Catania, Dipartimento Gest Sistemi Agroalimentari & Ambien, Catania, Italy; [Continella, Alberto] Univ Catania, Dipartimento Sci Prod Agr & Alimentari DiSPA, Catania, Italy; [Motisi, Antonio] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Sci Agr & Forestali, Palermo, Italy; [Pasotti, Luigi] Serv Informat Agrometeorol Siciliano, Catania, Italy",University of Catania; University of Catania; University of Palermo,"Continella, A (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dipartimento Sci Prod Agr & Alimentari DiSPA, Catania, Italy.",acontine@unict.it,"MOTISI, Antonio/AAE-2646-2021; Continella, Alberto/B-5756-2014","Motisi, Antonio/0000-0003-4874-8387; Papa, Rita/0000-0001-5402-3468; Continella, Alberto/0000-0002-7734-9927",,,,,13,0,0,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1725,1730,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600221,0

Subsequently, the oil leaks into the adjacent tissue and causes a darkened depression. The occurrence can be severe, without any specific pre- or postharvest practises to employ to reduce the incidence. Over several seasons the incidence of peteca was investigated to identify factors that influence the incidence of the disorder. The first observation was the highly erratic incidence between seasons as well as within an orchard in a season, with the early fruits being highly susceptible. In experiments to identify postharvest factors which influence the peteca incidence, 3 ppm ethylene and 5% CO2 were applied in a continuous flow-through system (20 degrees C for 3 d). The CO2 treatment resulted in significantly higher incidence compared to the rest. Following on from these results, postharvest Ethephon (2-Chloroethyl phosphonic acid) (200 and 400 mg/L) and AVG (aminoethoxy-vinylglycine) (400 and 800 mg/L) applications to fruit resulted in a significant reduction in peteca. In the subsequent season, the same treatments were applied in an orchard one week before harvest and a similar reduction in peteca was recorded. Ethylene production from these fruits after harvest was measured and showed a transient spike in fruits from the Ethephon treatment. The results collected could indicate a protective action of ethylene in reducing rind sensitivity to peteca. It is hypothesised that if the internal ethylene synthesis is increased prior to harvest in sensitive fruit, i.e. immature fruit, a reduction in peteca can occur.","Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Hort Sci, Citrus Res Int, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Cronjé, PJR (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Hort Sci, Citrus Res Int, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",paulcronje@sun.ac.za,,,,,,,14,3,3,0,0,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1455,1461,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600184,0

These were identified as 3,7,9-trihydroxy-1-methyl-6H-dibenzo [b,d] pyran-6-one, known as alternariol (AOH), and 3,7-dihydroxy-9-methoxy-1-methyl-6H-dibenzo[b, d] pyran-6-one, known as alternariol monomethyl ether (AME). The flavanones hesperidin and isonaringin, and the polymethoxyflavone sinensetin increase the biosynthesis of these micotoxins. Inoculation of fruits with the above-mentioned toxins showed that both molecules caused necrosis in the inoculated citrus tissues, suggesting that the mycotoxins may be involved in the evolution of brown spot caused by A. alternata. The increased expression of the above mycotoxins was associated with: (i) the end of mycelial growth, high sporulation and an increase in hyphal melanisation; (ii) catabolism of the flavonoids present in these fruits.","[Del Rio, Jose A.; Diaz, Licinio; Ortuno, Ana M.] Univ Murcia, Fac Biol, Dept Plant Biol, Murcia, Spain; [Garcia-Lidon, Angel; Porras, Ignacio] Murcian Inst Agr & Food Res & Dev IMIDA, Citriculture, Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Porras, I (通讯作者)，Murcian Inst Agr & Food Res & Dev IMIDA, Citriculture, Murcia, Spain.",ignacio.porras@carm.es,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,16,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1549,1553,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600197,0

For this purpose, knowledge networks are highlighted, which are linkages between different knowledge sources in and outside the firm. They are essential to incorporate the knowledge of strategic customers and business partners into the knowledge base of SMEs and therefore contribute to the commercialization of knowledge-intensive products as well as services. Design/methodology/approach - In general, knowledge marketing supports the commercialization of firm's knowledge. Several factors which are relevant for knowledge marketing have been analysed. Establishing relations and integrating knowledge of stakeholders are crucial for limited knowledge resources of SMEs. Since research and literature in the field of knowledge marketing (especially in SMEs) is still scarce, the authors regard a qualitative research approach as appropriate. The following multiple case study primarily based on semi-structured interviews and document analyses. Subsequently, all qualitative data were compared and interpreted. Originality/value - The knowledge base - internally or externally acquired - which constitutes the basis of a unique competitive advantage of firms in the software, in the numismatics or other knowledge-intensive industries can be expanded and utilized in a better way through knowledge networks. Particularly customers' and business partners' knowledge is relevant to knowledge-intensive firms, because these elements allow firms to acquire additional know-how, which can be utilized for product development, innovations, and other customers. Theoretical implications - This research paper contributes to knowledge marketing as well as SME literature since the empirical data collection was exclusively limited to SMEs. Hence, the necessity of relations to different stakeholders of SMEs in knowledge networks has been identified. These networks are one of the success factors for a holistic knowledge marketing approach of SMEs. The approach further implicates processes of knowledge utilisation and therefore supports to clarify ways of understanding the meaning of knowledge as sustainable, competitive advantage. Practical implications - The outcomes clarify the integration of strategic customer and business partner knowledge as well as the marketing of knowledge in knowledge-intensive industries. Here, establishing relations and utilizing knowledge networks are most encouraging success factors of knowledge marketing. When emphasizing on these particular factors of marketing activities, SMEs might positively influence the success of their own business in comparison to competitors. The consideration of these factors enables top level management to differentiate them by focusing on knowledge marketing.","[Diehr, Gregor; Wilhelm, Stefan; Gueldenberg, Stefan; Klammer, Adrian] Univ Liechtenstein, Inst Entrepreneurship, Vaduz 9490, Principality Of, Liechtenstein",University of Liechtenstein,"Diehr, G (通讯作者)，Univ Liechtenstein, Inst Entrepreneurship, Fuerst Franz Josef Str, Vaduz 9490, Principality Of, Liechtenstein.",,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,11,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,427,438,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200033,0

The objectives of this research are to: describe the type of farms and their management in order to establish the ability to apply production factors; describe the types of factors and their influence on the farms economy; identify the mathematical connection between two variables (one factor and one product); find optimal solution. The research will focus on the analysis and role of a case study in determining best relationship between nitrogen based chemicals and corn production. The link between nitrogen-based chemicals and average corn production will be established, alongside maximum hectare crops and maximum profits in relation to the use of particular chemical doses. An optimal zone where these indicators are related will be identified. Beyond that level, increased doses will lead to diminished production and increased costs. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Despite of the efforts made by public health specialists to control and eradicate it, trichinellosis is considered a re-emerging zoonosis in many areas. Romania is recognized as one of the countries with the highest prevalence of trichinellosis in Europe. With respect to Trichinella-infections in pigs, our country accounted 51.5% of all positive findings in 2012, a similar situation as in 2010 and 2011; with an overwhelming majority, these Trichinella-positive findings originated from pigs raised in backyards. This work aimed to set and implement a mathematical model able to predict the future evolution of Trichinella-infection incidence in pigs. Our analysis was based on the data collected between 1997 and 2013 from pigs raised both in controlled (farms) and non-controlled housing conditions (backyards). The implemented mathematical model showed two main lines of prediction related to the evolution of Trichinella-infection incidence, depending on the origin of pigs. For pigs raised in controlled systems (farms), the mathematical models predict a trend toward zero of the incidence in the next period of time (considering that in the last 4 years included in the study (2009-2013), few positive cases were registered). In the case of pigs raised in extensive systems (uncontrolled conditions), the mathematical models generally predict an ascending trend in Trichinella-infections incidence, this trend reflecting the high incidence of Trichinella-infections in pigs raised in backyards in recent years. In conclusion, statistical processing of the parasitological data may provide a useful modality for understanding the biological processes and the interpretation of epidemiological data.

Releases of C. montrouzieri and L. dactylopii vary from 10 to 20 individuals per tree according to mealybug density level and citrus variety. The main strategy is based on releases of C. montrouzieri and L. dactylopii at an early stage of mealybug population. L. dactylopii can be released without egg masses of mealybug whereas C. montrouzieri should be released once egg masses are present. When both adults and egg masses of mealybug are present at the same time, both beneficials should be released together. Early releases can be impeded when other main pests, such as California Red Scale and Rust mite are present and pesticides are applied at the beginning of season. In this case, the use of harmless pesticides for these natural enemies is recommended to carry out biological control. In the Turkey coming future, the usage of biological control will be increase for two reason; firstly food safety has been important for society especially because of pesticide residues and secondly Turkish Ministry of Agriculture is giving subsidy to the farmers who are using biological control to enhance these practices.","[Erkilic, Lerzan B.; Demirbas, Halil; Guven, Bulent] Biol Agr Consulting & Engn Co BIYOTAR, Adana, Turkey",,"Erkilic, LB (通讯作者)，Biol Agr Consulting & Engn Co BIYOTAR, Adana, Turkey.",lerzane@biyotar.com,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1157,1163,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600147,0

In this study, we examined the basic structure of phloem tissue from HLB-free and HLB-affected trees under light and scanning electron microscopy. To avoid any possible interference with callose induced by injury during sampling, we employed a freeze substitution technique. Sieve elements from HLB-free trees show sizable lateral pores to phloem and ray parenchyma. Early stage HLB-affected phloem cells contain dark electron dense material and jagged appearing cell walls. Eventually, these cells totally collapse into almost a solid cell-wall barrier. The large number of wall perforations, along the cortex, ray and vascular parenchyma with abundant pit fields, could be essential anatomical features necessary to support symplastic transport of photoassimlates in an HLB-compromised phloem system.","[Etxeberria, Ed; Narciso, Cody] Univ Florida, Citrus Res & Educ Ctr, IFAS, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Etxeberria, E (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Citrus Res & Educ Ctr, IFAS, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA.",eetxeber@ufl.edu,,,,,,,14,6,6,0,5,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,891,897,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600110,0

A total of 300-day old chicks (Cobb500) were randomly assigned to five separate floor pens equal experimental groups with three replicates (20 birds /replicate). Birds were fed either on corn-soybean meal basal diets (starter-grower and finisher) without any supplementation (G1) and served as control group, or basal diets to which protease enzyme was added on top at a rate of 200 ppm (G2). Birds in (G3) were fed on the basal diets to which protease was added at the same inclusion level but subtracting the whole matrix value of the enzyme. Birds in (G4) were fed on the fortified basal diets after subtracting only the metabolizable energy matrix value of the enzyme. Birds in (G5) were reared on the fortified basal diets after subtracting only the crude protein as well as amino acids matrix value of the enzyme. The experimental period extended for five weeks. Birds in groups 2 and 4 significantly (P <= 0.05) surpassed all groups in weight gain, feed consumption and FCR, also these groups were significantly (P <= 0.05) better in dressing %. Also G2 (protease on the top) and G4 (Low ME values) showed a significant elevation of CP digestibility and showed a significant (P <= 0.05) reduction of total ileal clostridia species counts. In addition G2 showed an increase in villus height and villus to crypt ratios compared to other experimental groups. In conclusion, broiler chickens respond positively to supplementation of protease enzyme and it can be used safely on the top of their diets. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The value productivity results of the corporate development can be used as basis for decision making process and for further strategy creation. The value of productivity measures is influenced by data used for a calculation. Mostly the data come from the financial accounting which can be based on different accounting standards - for the Czech enterprises the Czech accounting standards or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Used standards would have an impact on the value productivity measures. The aim of this paper is to show a significance of this impact. For this purpose the paper uses case studies of companies whose financial data are available in the both standards.

This dramatic increase was spurred by recent policy initiatives such as the Renewable Fuel Standard and state-level blend mandates and supported by direct subsidies such as the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit. Some proponents of ethanol have argued that ethanol production greatly lowers gasoline prices, with one industry group claiming it reduced gasoline prices by 89 cents in 2010 and $1.09 in 2011. The 2010 figure has been cited in numerous speeches by Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Vilsack. We show that these estimates were generated by implausible economic assumptions and spurious statistical correlations. To support this last point, we use the same statistical models and find that ethanol production decreases natural gas prices, but increases unemployment in both the U.S. and Europe. We even show that ethanol production increases the ages of our children. Overall, we see no compelling reason to believe that the effect of ethanol use on gasoline prices has been more than $0.10 per gallon.","[Knittel, Christopher R.] MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Knittel, Christopher R.] MIT, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Knittel, Christopher R.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Smith, Aaron] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Smith, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",knittel@mit.edu; adsmith@ucdavis.edu,,,Giannini Foundation for Agricultural Economics,Giannini Foundation for Agricultural Economics,"This paper has benefited from conversations with Severin Borenstein, Julian Alston, Daniel Sumner, and participants at the University of California Energy Institute Energy Camp.

Intangible cultural heritage of the Republic of Croatia is endangered and it is becoming extinct due to the influence of a number of factors. Since the formulation of the 1999 Act on the Protection and Preservation of Cultural Objects, intangible cultural heritage has been under special protection as objects of interest to the Republic of Croatia. Today, intangible cultural heritage is the subject of expert and scientific research, but it also concerns economic activities. Therefore, the establishment of the Centre for the conservation of intangible cultural heritage is extremely important for Eastern Croatia. The goal of the Centre is to document as many immaterial objects in one place, and through its marketing activities (for example quality promotion) also increase interest in cultural heritage of this region, which is often not sufficiently recognized. With the high quality promotion of intangible cultural heritage (for example presentation of cultural practices through a variety of performances, games, dances, etc.) the Centre could contribute to the development of tourism in Eastern Croatia, but with the educational content also in education. The the Centre's own revenues (those from donations, fees for the provision of services, sale of souvenirs, etc.) can significantly improve conservation of the intangible cultural heritage of Eastern Croatia and help develop its sustainability. The issue of sustainable development of intangible cultural heritage is complex, and as the major obstacles, we see the dispersion of the collected materials, deficiency of digitization, poor or unsatisfactory organization of the intangible cultural heritage in Eastern Croatia. The Centre would aim to connect the scientific approach with maximum use of modern technology for the digitization, processing and preservation, and economically justified model of permanent preservation of intangible cultural heritage. In order to maintain sufficient redundancy of the collected data database a distributed data storage together with secure local storage in the Centre is envisaged. The Centre would be the starting point of dissemination of the collected intangible items towards users with different interests, demands and needs.","[Kolar, Emina Berbic; Galzina, Vjekoslav] Univ Josip Juraj Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Educ, Cara Hadrijana 10, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Cobovic, Maja Vretenar] Coll Slavonski Brod, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of Slavonski Brod,"Kolar, EB (通讯作者)，Univ Josip Juraj Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Educ, Cara Hadrijana 10, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",eberbic@foozos.hr; Maja.VretenarCobovic@vusb.hr; vgalzina@foozos.hr,"Cobović, Maja Vretenar/AAB-6210-2020","Cobović, Maja Vretenar/0000-0002-7225-147X",,,,,15,1,1,1,16,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,144,152,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100014,0

The study focuses on the Russian volunteers as a social community. Capabilities of public administration of volunteering development is investigated by case-study realized in the Sverdlovsk region. The regional volunteering management system, its basic stakeholders and objective description of regional volunteers' community are described according to a survey of volunteers, expert interviews of regional NGO leaders and public officials. The analysis shows that volunteers can be considered as a resource of the regional management, however, volunteers as a social community have their specific resources. The research methodology is based on the theory of cross-sectoral interaction and the stakeholder theory. We assume that the resources of volunteer social community should be taken into consideration in the process of regional management, also we should focus on the capabilities and interests of the volunteer social community members. The regional executive authority can influence volunteers by stakeholders. The third sector plays the most important part in this process: it should involve and integrate people, business, media, social service agencies, educational institutions and local governments.

We present our methodology and some preliminary results of its application to new movie launches through the analysis of about 2 million downloaded in the US in 72 hours around the events in a 4 months period. Design/methodology/approach - We use a combination of semantic and topological analyses that demonstrated good results identifying conversational patterns to be used not only to assess how people feel about the event but also to develop a better understanding about what people say and how people talk about the event. To obtain the what people say, the methodology and the tools automatically analyze the conversations, with the support of visualization components. The how people talk is addressed detecting patterns in the conversations and evaluating the correlation of those patterns with performance indicators. Structure and contents are analyzed through a set of semantic and topological metrics to assess the content generated in different conversations. Metrics are then collected in a single dataset, which is later used to train and test a data mining model. Originality/value - Several commercial platforms are available to retrieve and assess to some extent this collective judgment through sentiment analysis. Sentiment, however, just measures how the crowd feels about a product, but does not offer insight on the structure and the determinants of the customers' preferences nor provides indications about future behavior. Our challenge is instead to dig deeper into Twitter streams to capture and assess structured contents that are embedded in them through an analytical and quantitative approach. Practical implications - The elicitation of organized content from Twitter streams could support market analysts to achieve a better understanding of consumers' perceptions and to better manage the reach-richness trade off between qualitative and quantitative market analyses. An additional practical use of our study can be to find a way to ascertain the presence of given semantic patterns in Twitter streams that can be predictive of early market success for a new product.","[Lipizzi, Carlo; Iandoli, Luca; Marquez, Jose Emmanuel Ramirez] Stevens Inst Technol, Sch Syst & Enterprises, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA; [Iandoli, Luca] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Ind Engn, Naples, Italy",Stevens Institute of Technology; University of Naples Federico II,"Lipizzi, C (通讯作者)，Stevens Inst Technol, Sch Syst & Enterprises, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.",,"Iandoli, Luca/C-4974-2011",,,,,,23,0,0,0,11,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,955,965,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200072,0

Several cities have already adopted these strategies to support economic development and to provide required post-industrial development. Institutional development is essential for KBUD to gather all of the main actors and sources, to organise and facilitate necessary knowledge-intensive activities and to plan strategically to become KC. Additionally, governing KBUD with institutional leadership make a difference in achieving KC status. Successful urban governance requires understanding of comprehensive planning process. The management of the implementation process is stated to be more important than the preparation of the plan. The success of the implementation is determined by efficiently designed monitoring and evaluation (M/E) systems. To become KC and build the bridge between planning and urban governance, M/E phases need to be incorporated into the planning process. Turkey has been working increasing competitiveness in knowledge economy and developed strategies for increasing knowledge worker capacity, providing an efficient platform for innovation and strengthening institutional leadership. However, the planning system in Turkey includes different governmental bodies with an undefined hierarchy for preparation, implementation and evaluation of the plans. Governing the necessary actions efficiently and institutional leadership seems to be the problematic areas for Turkish cities to become KCs. Case study, Istanbul is a prospect KC. The goal of this paper is to prove that the lack of M/E systems in the planning process prevents a city from becoming a successful KC. Design/methodology/approach - This paper will clarify the planning system in Turkey and hierarchical structure in Istanbul Metropolitan Area. The relation between planning system and urban development management in Turkey will be defined by investigating the current plans and institutions in charge of making and approving plans. The study will analyse Istanbul Metropolitan Area plans' M/E stages. The planning process and M/E existence and applications in the plans are determined by face-to-face interviews with several staff members of governmental entities in Istanbul Metropolitan Area. Originality/value - This paper shows that the lack of M/E processes in the planning system prevents a city to develop effective urban governance and institutional development, and therefore, from becoming a successful KC. Practical implications - This paper aimed to determine the exact stages of Istanbul Metropolitan Area's planning and governance processes that prevent the city from developing as a sustainable KC.","[Metin, Sinem] Univ Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, ITU Architectural Fac, Urban & Reg Planning Dept, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Metin, S (通讯作者)，Univ Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, ITU Architectural Fac, Urban & Reg Planning Dept, Taskisla Campus, Istanbul, Turkey.",,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,7,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,164,176,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200013,0

Banks in Croatia are mainly focused on financing the household population while the proportion of funds that are approved to corporations is significantly smaller. Furthermore, government often indirectly requires banks to buy government debt securities. Croatian non-financial corporations have no significant possibility to finance their business with debt or equity securities but have to mainly rely on financial institutions and in the Republic of Croatia financial institutions are generally banks. A bank, in such a business environment, defines the basic conditions and the amount of financing which will be allocated to non-financial corporations. The aim of this paper was to identify, via multiple regression, among certain variables those variables that have significant influence on the amount of bank loans to non-financial corporations in the Republic of Croatia. The results show that the ratio of the share of loans granted to the central government in total loans, the share of loans granted to households in total loans and the share of purchased long-term central government debt securities in total assets has a statistically significant negative effect on the amount of loans granted by banks to non-financial companies. On the other hand, the increased share of banks' reserves with the Croatian National Bank in total assets ratio has a statistically significant positive effect on the amounts of loans granted by banks to companies. A conclusion can be made based on the obtained results about the impact of certain variables on the amount of loans to non-financial companies. Direct or indirect influence on certain variables can affect the amount of loans granted by banks to non-financial companies in the Republic of Croatia.","[Miletic, Marko; Barbaca, Domagoja Buljan] Univ Split, Univ Ctr Profess Studies, Livanjska 5-3, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Split,"Miletic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Univ Ctr Profess Studies, Livanjska 5-3, Split 21000, Croatia.",mamiletic@oss.unist.hr; dobuljan@oss.unist.hr,"Miletić, Marko/F-9102-2017",,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,741,748,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100073,0

The SPA concept defines that optimal crop cultivation conditions should be based on the physiological status of the plants. The first step of the SPA is to obtain physiological information from a living plant. As a successful example, a chlorophyll fluorescence imaging robot, which can be used to grasp the heterogeneous distribution of photosynthetic activity of tomato plants in a greenhouse, is introduced. The primary feature of this robot is the feasible design, automated simple operation and low-cost, for implementation in commercial tomato production greenhouses. In addition, it is also focusing on the development of postharvest management techniques to improve the fruit quality.

The primary goals of the present study were to establish a Clementine reference map, and to perform comparative mapping with pummelo and sweet orange. Five parental genetic maps were established with SNPs, SSRs and InDels. A medium density reference map (961 markers for 1084.1 cM) of Clementine was established and used by the ICGC to facilitate the chromosome assembly of the haploid genome sequence. Comparative mapping with pummelo and sweet orange revealed that the linear order of markers was highly conserved. Reasonable inferences of most citrus genomes should be obtained by mapping next-generation sequencing data against the haploid reference genome sequence. Skewed segregations were frequent and higher in the male than female Clementine potentially leading to false interpretation of the genetic determinism of phenotypic traits. The mapping data confirmed that Clementine arose from hybridization between 'Mediterranean' mandarin and sweet orange and identified nine recombination break points for the sweet orange gamete that contributed to the Clementine genome. Introgression of pummelo genome fragments were identified in heterozygosity in each chromosome.

We show that even in the presence of endogenous regressors it is still preferable, in most cases, to simply estimate the break dates and test for structural change using the usual ordinary least squares (OLS) framework. Except for some knife-edge cases, it delivers estimates of the break dates with higher precision and tests with higher power compared to those obtained using an instrumental variable (IV) method. Also, the OLS method avoids potential weak identification problems caused by weak instruments. To illustrate the relevance of our theoretical results, we consider the stability of the New Keynesian hybrid Phillips curve. IV-based methods only provide weak evidence of instability. On the other hand, OLS-based ones strongly indicate a change in 1991:Q1 and that after this date the model loses all explanatory power.

This is why a cost and benefit analysis is the most suitable technique to be applied to calculate dynamic cost-effectiveness of such a project. Another specificity of such a project is that the unit of measure used to measure generated savings cannot be unambiguously determined, and that such a price has to be corrected. Such corrected prices are another reason why the financial analysis of this investment project is based on a cost-and-benefit-analysis approach. This paper illustrates a methodological approach of a calculation of costs and benefits of an investment project. This paper proves that in case of constant electricity consumption during 24 hours a day, an investment into a solar power facility in Eastern Slavonia can create economic potential which makes such an investment profitable and cost-effective.","[Pichler, Goran] Moje Sunce Ltd, Franje Krezme 20, Osijek 32000, Croatia; [Grebenar, Vladimir] Periska Ltd, Vinkovci 32100, Croatia",,"Pichler, G (通讯作者)，Moje Sunce Ltd, Franje Krezme 20, Osijek 32000, Croatia.",obnovljivi.izvori.ee@gmail.com; vladimir.grebenar@gmail.com; boris.banovic@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,431,438,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100042,0

Therefore, it is not clear if some nations are more rational (in the traditional economic sense) than others. In addition, Czech researchers have insufficiently used two-sided approach (i.e. combination of neoclassical and behavioral economic theories) to gain insights into individual decision-making. This paper, which is aimed at examining dependence between gross income and socio-demographic characteristics of Czech households on the one hand and different kinds of Czech households' income and consumption on the other hand, is the first step toward narrowing the above research gap. On the basis of EU-SILC data set, we have constructed the distribution of Czech households selecting different economic features, like household type or income level. From the demographic perspective, age and gender belong among the most important characteristics. As Czech population gets older, people live longer, the share of single-person households is increasing. For this reason, development related to one-person households and gross money income is shown in this article. We have also analyzed dynamics of Czech households' income and consumption over the life cycle. As a result, we have found that younger people are prone to overconsumption while the older ones behave more prudently. In addition, ageincome profiles differ for the employed and retired households. The findings of this paper will be used in our subsequent research whose purpose is described above.","[Pivonka, Tomas; Csefalvaiova, Kornelia; Korlyakova, Darya] Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Pivonka, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",tomas.pivonka@vse.cz; kornelia.csefalvaiova@vse.cz; korlyakova.d@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1326,1335,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000126,0

The main goal of this study was to give reference values for GHG emission intensity in meat production systems based on grass (G) and on grass and maize (G-M). A second goal was to analyze emission variability in order to identify potential mitigation options. On average, for every kg live weight the G systems emitted 18.2 CO2 eq. and the G-M systems 19.2 CO2 eq.. The difference reflected differences in feed and mineral fertilizer purchases, in manure emissions and in mineral fertilizer application. There were large variations in GHG emissions both between and within the two systems, particularly the latter. This variability was not due to the division of the farms into G and G-M systems, indeed production system types did not allow explaining the variation. When carbon credits were included in the assessment, there was an emission reduction of 31% and 23% for the G and G-M systems, respectively, indicating an opportunity for the systems using grassland to increase their advantage.

Orange fruit accumulates mainly terpenes in mature peel oil glands with D-limonene accounting for approximately 97% of terpene content. We have generated transgenic orange plants carrying a D-limonene synthase gene in antisense (AS) configuration. Transgenic expression caused a dramatic decrease in the accumulation of D-limonene in fruit peels, being about 80-100 times lower in AS samples than in empty vector (EV) transgenic ones. This affected the interaction of fruits with their biotic environment because they resulted in resistance to different specialized pathogens. When antisense fruits were challenged with the fungus Penicillium digitatum, they showed marked resistance against this pathogen. A gene expression analysis of these fruits linked the decrease of D-limonene to upregulation of genes involved in the innate immunity response. High D-limonene content in mature orange peels may be a signal for attractiveness of microorganisms which might be likely involved in facilitating the access to the pulp of seed dispersal frugivores.","[Rodriguez, Ana; Cervera, Magdalena; Alquezar, Berta; Pena, Leandro] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain; [Shimada, Takehiko] Natl Agr Res Org, Natl Inst Fruit Tree Sci, Okitsu Citrus Res Stn, Okitsu Shimizu Ku, Shizuoka, Japan; [Gadea, Jose] Univ Politecn Valencia, CSIC, Inst Biol Mol & Celular Plantas IBMCP, E-46071 Valencia, Spain; [Gomez-Cadenas, Aurelio; De Ollas, Carlos J.] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Ciencias Agr & Medio Nat, Escuela Super Ciencias Expt & Tecnol, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Rodrigo, Maria J.; Zacarias, Lorenzo] CSIC, Inst Agroquim & Tecnol Alimentos, Dept Ciencia Alimentos, E-46010 Valencia, Spain",Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA); National Agriculture & Food Research Organization - Japan; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; CSIC-UPV - Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular de Plantas (IBMCP); Universitat Jaume I; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Instituto de Agroquimica y Tecnologia de los Alimentos (IATA),"Peña, L (通讯作者)，Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain.",lpenya@ivia.es,"Peña, Leandro/F-9089-2014; Gomez-Cadenas, Aurelio/K-6084-2012; de ollas, carlos J/B-7461-2019; Vacas, José Gadea/S-2446-2019; Rodríguez, Ana/A-7430-2018; Alquezar, Berta/J-4735-2016; Rodrigo, Maria Jesus/H-7720-2012; Zacarias, Lorenzo/W-2510-2018","de ollas, carlos J/0000-0001-8488-623X; Vacas, José Gadea/0000-0002-3612-7914; Rodríguez, Ana/0000-0002-0612-726X; Alquezar, Berta/0000-0002-2702-6927; Rodrigo, Maria Jesus/0000-0003-2668-0684; Zacarias, Lorenzo/0000-0003-3982-8860",,,,,23,0,0,1,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,687,693,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600086,0

Currently, a substantial body of research on KIBS is available, and we need to take stock of what has been done until now. This paper illustrates the findings of a systematic literature review aiming at: a) assessing the interest in the topic; b) analysing what disciplines have used the concept, and what research approaches and methods have been employed; c) identifying what topic areas have been investigated; d) ascertaining what are the main findings achieved so far, the open issues, and the possible future research directions. Design/methodology/approach - This study make use of a systematic review of the literature. Three criteria were followed to select the databases where to look for the papers: they had to cover up a comprehensive range of business and economic-related peer-reviewed journals; their coverage had to extend through the timeframe of the investigated topic; their search function had to provide reliable results. Accordingly, three widely known databases were chosen: Scopus, Business Source Premier and EconLit. The relevant papers were found by searching the terms KIBS and knowledge intensive business service either the title of the paper, in the abstract, and in the keywords. In total 190 papers were examined, published from 1999 to 2013. Originality/value - The paper offers an updated picture of the state of the art of the research about KIBS. Particularly, it classifies the examined articles according to the main discipline they belong to, their research approach and research method, the countries involved and the investigated sub-sectors. They are also categorised in some topic areas, and the main results achieved by the research in each area are discussed. Practical implications - The findings of the review are particularly significant for scholars who can find indications about some open questions as well as suggestions on crucial issues that could be the object of future research.","Univ Padua, DTG Dept Management & Engn, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy",University of Padua,"Scarso, E (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, DTG Dept Management & Engn, Stradella San Nicola 3, I-36100 Vicenza, Italy.",,,,,,,,46,4,4,0,13,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1159,1172,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200089,0

Graft compatibility between Aurantioideae genera has historically been associated with the use of the related taxa as rootstocks for Citrus spp. However, the use of Citrus spp. as rootstocks for related taxa can be useful in maintaining germplasm accessions, in propagating specimen trees or specific commercial taxa, and biological indexing in a sanitation program. One of the largest collections of taxa related to Citrus is maintained by the University of California and the United States Department of Agriculture in Riverside, California. This paper reviews historical observations made in Riverside of graft compatibility between Aurantioideae genera and updates them with current observations.

I employ the matching method together with the difference-in-difference (DID) approach to reveal the quake's effects.

Design/methodology/approach - We propose an approach which allow to make the assessment of the knowledge economy influences on the behaviors of organization in the area of shaping the human capital. The methodology involve the three following research's levels: - The first research level concerns the identification and the assessment of independent variables in human capital area in the context of knowledge-based economy development. The independent variables were described as the key macroeconomic factors that identify the dynamics of the economy's development in the scope of the human capital. - The second research level concerns defining the enterprise features in the area of human capital - dependent variables which have been recognized as the most representative from the human capital behaviour sensitive view point on the knowledge economy influence. The dependent variables were determined as a results of the questionaries' findings. - At the third level there were defined the direct analysis areas that enable the evaluation of the degree of adaptation of the enterprises' human capital to the knowledge-based economy dynamics. Originality/value - This methodology puts in evidence describing both the degree and state of human capital adaptation to the knowledge based-economy by the following issues distinguishing: - Independent variables favouring, block or neutralising the human capital development. - Dependent variables which in the particular way make possible, block or neutralizing the opportunities usage created by the knowledge-based economy. - The analysis and assessment of the adaptation degree of human capital in the enterprises to the knowledge-based economy requirements on the basis on the research concerning the relation occurring in those areas.

Four different cultivars of Clementine were tested in 2006 and 2008: SRA63, SRA85, SRA88, and SRA92; as well as trees on two rootstocks: sour orange and Carrizo citrange. In this paper the effects of triclopyr (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyloxyactetic acid), as an alternative to 2,4-D (dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), have been evaluated to increase fruit size and to the control of the pre-harvest natural drop. Triclopyr treatments were more effective both at controlling fruit drop and protecting the peel of the mature fruit when applied early on fruits showing 18-22 mm of diameter (about middle of July) than treatments made at peel colour break time. This treatment in mid-July, determined the increase in fruit size and sometimes of the total yield per tree. Lower yield was generally observed on trees grafted on sour orange than on trees on Carrizo rootstock.","[Zurru, Roberto; Deidda, Bruno] AGRIS Sardegna, Dept Wood & Fruit Tree Res, Cagliari, Italy; [Dessena, Leonarda; Mulas, Maurizio] Univ Sassari, Dept Nat & Land Sci, I-07100 Sassari, Italy",University of Sassari,"Mulas, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sassari, Dept Nat & Land Sci, I-07100 Sassari, Italy.",mmulas@uniss.it,"Mulas, Maurizio/ABA-3067-2020",,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1223,1229,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600155,0

Amongst its members, it has abolished tariffs and lowered non-tariff barriers. This has led to trade creation within Europe and to trade diversion between EU countries and outsiders. Deep trade integration and the resulting mutual dependence has, in the eyes of many, facilitated political integration. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) will undo some of these effects by means of preference erosion, so that cross-country trade links within Europe may lose relative prominence. However, the presence of a rich fabric of regional value chains in Europe and substantial income effects could counter this development. We provide insights on the empirical importance of these effects based on a New Quantitative Trade Model. We show that TTIP could indeed lower trade integration in Europe since predicted income effects turn out not to be large enough to overcome the effects of preference erosion. However, there is substantial heterogeneity across sectors and countries. One way to minimize preference erosion would be to promote projects and programs to further deepen the EU's single market.","[Felbermayr, Gabriel J.] Univ Munich, Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munich, Ifo Inst, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Aichele, Rahel; Felbermayr, Gabriel J.; Heiland, Inga] CESifo, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Felbermayr, Gabriel J.] Univ Nottingham, GEP, Sir Clive Granger Bldg,Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Aichele, Rahel] Univ Munich, Ifo Inst, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ctr Int Econ, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Heiland, Inga] Univ Munich, Ifo Inst, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Munich; Ifo Institut; University of Nottingham; Ifo Institut; University of Munich; University of Munich; Ifo Institut,"Felbermayr, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munich, Ifo Inst, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.;Felbermayr, GJ (通讯作者)，CESifo, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.;Felbermayr, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, GEP, Sir Clive Granger Bldg,Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",Felbermayr@ifo.de,,"Felbermayr, Gabriel/0000-0003-4984-9745",,,,,34,1,3,1,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

This paper demonstrates that the distribution of cumulative oil and gas recovery in Texas is best described by a power-law distribution, with exponent approximately equal to 1.1 for oil production and 1.6 for gas production. Estimation is carried out using lease and well-level data from a cross section of over 600,000 observations gathered by DrillingInfo. The goodness of fit of the hypothesized power law is verified with regression-based and likelihood ratio tests, as well as nested and composite hypotheses. Results are significant because they show that production data are heavy tailed, that empirical variance estimates do not converge, and that 1 % of oil leases are responsible for 70 % of cumulative recovery. The distribution has consequences for efficient management and implications about peak oil because wells close to the mean account for so little of the cumulative distribution of recovery.","[Balthrop, Andrew] 8317 Freret St, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",,"Balthrop, A (通讯作者)，8317 Freret St, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",andy.balthrop@gmail.com,,,,,,,51,11,12,0,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We find that the off-farm income and being family farm have less impact on farm investments. More technically efficient farms invest less than less efficient farms.. The indebted farms use debts and invest more than non-indebted farms. The results indicate the persistence of financial constraints for farm investments, particularly for family farms. As guidelines for economic policy is suggested more effective financial support through the creation of beneficial lines of credit designed specifically to support viable farm investments, particularly for family farms, which prevails in the country's farm structures. Finally, more effective policy mechanism is needed for the heavy indebted farm households, which is of relevance also for other transition and emerging market economies.","[Bojnec, Stefan] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, SI-6104 Koper Capodistria, Slovenia; [Ferto, Imre] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budaorsi U 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary; [Ferto, Imre] Corvinus Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Ferto, Imre] Kaposvar Univ, Guba S Utca 40, H-7400 Kaposvar, Hungary",University of Primorska; Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Corvinus University Budapest; Kaposvar University; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Bojnec, S (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management, SI-6104 Koper Capodistria, Slovenia.",stefan.bojnec@fin-kp.si; imre.lerto@uni-corvinus.hu,"Fertő, Imre/AAQ-4634-2021; Ferto, Imre/A-7371-2009; Bojnec, Stefan/AFG-8313-2022; Ferto, Imre/GPS-7523-2022","Ferto, Imre/0000-0002-3742-5964; Bojnec, Stefan/0000-0002-1270-6372;",,,,,42,7,7,0,7,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2016,15.0,4.0,,,,,2,9,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EW1DD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402229200001,0

On several critical issues, Patinkin departs from Keynes' original matters of concerns. He leans against an individual criterion for unemployment and implicitly endorses Wicksell's understanding of voluntary unemployment as chosen leisure. His appraisal of involuntary unemployment as a disequilibrium phenomenon ultimately relies on nominal rigidities and assumes the existence of a competitive adjustment process. On all these three critical points, Patinkin departs from Keynes but also initiates the contemporary New Keynesian programme that went even further from Keynes.","[Rivot, Sylvie] Univ Mulhouse, BETA, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France",,"Rivot, S (通讯作者)，Univ Mulhouse, BETA, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France.",rivot@unistra.fr,,,,,,,51,5,5,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

This comprised a series of tasks that required station finding and also planning of routes between pairs of stations, with response time and accuracy as measures of performance. In addition, subjective ratings of map design were collected via questionnaire-based evaluations, and also ranked preferences between designs. A clear best-option was easily identifiable as a result of this research. The existing design was associated with the most journey planning errors, and two of the prototypes were associated with inefficient journey choices. The latter finding suggested that respondents were using unsophisticated planning strategies that were put at a disadvantage by certain route depictions. This has wider implications for suggestions that schematic maps should maintain topographical relationships in order to facilitate appropriate journey choices, with the danger that the inevitable increased complexity of line trajectories for such designs would simultaneously reduce the ability of passengers to identify the most appropriate routes.

The paper argues that there are a number of points that has recently changed Swedish organised politics in rather fundamental ways. These changes entail a new actor constellation in Swedish politics and policy-making, decreased visibility of political processes and the emergence of a strong feedback loop between inequality, participation and public policies. What this amounts to is a very different form of elite-driven policy-making than the old corporatist structures. An amorphous and quite invisible but still highly elite-driven process has emerged, in which inequality has increased dramatically, and the impact of money on politics has become stronger even in Sweden.","[Svallfors, Stefan] Inst Futures Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Svallfors, Stefan] Sodertorn Univ, Sch Social Sci, Huddinge, Sweden",Sodertorn University,"Svallfors, S (通讯作者)，Inst Futures Studies, Stockholm, Sweden.;Svallfors, S (通讯作者)，Sodertorn Univ, Sch Social Sci, Huddinge, Sweden.",stefan.svallfors@sh.se,,,Swedish Research Council [421-2011-1369],Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"This paper builds to some extent on research financed by the Swedish Research Council (421-2011-1369).

The study is based on a dataset covering the 1994-2012 period. We use the propensity score matching method to pair HSR affected routes with routes without HSR services. The difference-in-difference approach is used to estimate the impact of HSR entry. We find that HSR entries may, on average, lead to a more significant drop in airlines' seat capacity in China than in Japan and Korea given similar HSR service speed. In China, HSR services with a maximum speed about 200 km/h can produce strong negative impacts on medium-haul air routes but induce more air seat capacity on long-haul routes. HSR services with a maximum speed of 300 km/h have little extra impact on medium-haul routes but a strong negative impact on long-haul routes. Finally, although HSR has a strong negative impact in Japan's short-haul and medium-haul air markets, little impact is observed in its long haul markets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we test the efficient-market hypothesis with respect to the timing of home purchase. We use data obtained from the privatization of the public housing program in Israel to estimate the weight given to current, as opposed to the first, reduction rate offered to public housing tenants. In line with the relevant psychological literature, results indicate that the first impression generates a very effective and long-lasting imprint: only 40% weight is given to the current reduction rate, compared with 60% weight given to the first reduction rate public housing tenants encounter. When the sample period is stratified by governments in office, this weight rises (drops) to 50% (0%-30%) among tenants who accelerate (defer) the purchase. Research findings thus stress the strong reliance on irrelevant information in tenure choice decision in response to a series of varying reduction conditions offered to tenants.

We utilise data on heights of 16,402 children working in northern textile factories in 1837 to examine whether gender bias was evident. Current interpretations argue against any difference. Here our comparisons with modern height standards reveal greater deprivation for girls than for boys. Discrimination is measured in girls' height-for-age score (HAZ) falling eight standard errors below boys' at ages 11, 11.5 and 12 years of age, capturing the very poor performance of factory girls. But this result cannot be taken at face value. We query whether modern standards require adjustment to account for the later timing of puberty in historical populations and develop an alternative. We also test the validity of the age data, considering whether parents were more prone to lie about the ages of their daughters, and question whether the supply of girls was fundamentally different from that of boys. We conclude that neither proposition is justified. Disadvantage to girls remains, although its absence amongst younger children precludes an indictment of culturally founded gender bias. The height data must remain mute on the source of this discrimination but we utilise additional information to examine some hypotheses: occupational sorting, differential susceptibility to disease, poorer nutrition for girls, disproportionate stunting from the effects of nutritional deprivation, and type and amount of work undertaken. Of these we suggest that girls had to do arduous physical labour in the home alongside their factory work. The only (unsubstantiated) alternative is that girls were more likely than boys to be put into factory work below the legal age limit. Both represent forms of gender bias. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We present in this paper a theory of decision under uncertainty for both incomplete and non-Archimedean preferences. Without continuity assumptions, incomplete preferences on a lottery space reduce to an order-extension problem. It is well known that incomplete preferences can be extended to complete preferences in the full generality, but this result does not necessarily hold for incomplete preferences which satisfy the independence axiom, since it may obviously happen that the extension does not satisfy the independence axiom. We show, for incomplete preferences on a mixture space, that an extension which satisfies the independence axiom exists.

Using a Heckman selection model to correct for selection bias the results show that gender has a stronger effect than occupation on PP membership and that it is female employees' lower rate of PP membership that has the greatest impact on their ability to accumulate PP wealth, rather than their ability to save once a member. The size of the gender gap in PP wealth is also conditioned by occupation.

Moreover, high-volume episodic binge drinking is very prevalent among teenagers and young adults. Given that approximately 90 % of the alcohol consumed by youth under the age of 21 in the USA is in the form of binge drinking (Murphy et al. in Addict Res Theory 20(6):456-465, 2012), understanding the determinants of binge drinking behavior, particularly among youth, is important from the perspective of health and policy. In this paper, we explore the relationship between youth binge drinking and an unanticipated determinate of this behavior, minimum wage laws. Using a fixed effects regression model, we observe a positive relationship between minimum wage increases and binge drinking among teenagers. We find that, after accounting for demographic characteristics, different types of risky behaviors, excise tax, state and time fixed effects, and time-varying state effects, a $1 increase in minimum wage increases binge drinking among teenagers by approximately 9 %. Our results support recent findings that minimum wage increases are positively associated with alcohol-related accidents among teenagers (Adam et al. in Rev Econ Stat 94(3):828-840, 2012). Findings suggest that authorities should consider the unexpected impacts that minimum wage increase may have on alcohol consumption among teens and consider parallel policies to help mitigate potential negative consequences.","[Hoke, Omer; Cotti, Chad] Univ Connecticut, Agr & Resource Econ, 1376 Storrs Rd,WB Young Bldg, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Cotti, Chad] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 800 Algoma Blvd, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA",University of Connecticut; University of Wisconsin System,"Cotti, C (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Agr & Resource Econ, 1376 Storrs Rd,WB Young Bldg, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.;Cotti, C (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 800 Algoma Blvd, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA.",omer.hoke@uconn.edu; cottic@uwosh.edu,,,,,,,24,8,12,0,30,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Their analysis has raised a variety of problematic issues such as size/power trade-offs resulting from weak or many instruments. We show that information reduction methods provide a useful and practical solution to this and related problems. Formally, we propose factor-based modifications to three popular weak-instrument-robust statistics, and illustrate their validity asymptotically and in finite samples. Results are derived using asymptotic settings that are commonly used in both the factor and weak-instrument literature. For the Anderson-Rubin statistic, we also provide analytical finite-sample results that do not require any underlying factor structure. An illustrative Monte Carlo study reveals the following. Factor-based tests control size regardless of instruments and factor quality. All factor-based tests are systematically more powerful than standard counterparts. With informative instruments and in contrast to standard tests: (i) power of factor-based tests is not affected by k even when large; and (ii) weak factor structure does not cost power. An empirical study on a New Keynesian macroeconomic model suggests that our factor-based methods can bridge a number of gaps between structural and statistical modeling.

I argue against this presumption. I assert that mass public opinion significantly affects US trade policy by shaping the way the two parties compete over that trade policy. When public opinion is unbalanced, the competition between the parties is likely to resemble a bidding war. When public opinion is balanced but split in a partisan manner the competition is likely to descend into Manichean conflict. When public opinion is balanced but split in a non-partisan manner, the competition is likely to be characterised by political actors seeking to maintain the support of their core constituencies. To examine this relationship, I investigate three cases: the push to punish China over Tiananmen Square in 1989-90, the ratification of NAFTA in 1992-93 and the process through which President Bush was granted trade promotion authority in 2001-02.","[Winslett, Gary] Boston Coll, Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Boston College,"Winslett, G (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Polit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,62,2,2,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2016,39.0,8.0,,,,,1128,1145,,10.1111/twec.12409,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DS7BY,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380938700004,0

Policy inertia with respect to sustainable travel may be driven by the assumptions that, firstly, most households have access to the use of a car and are keen to preserve the mobility advantages the current system offers them, and secondly that environmental and health considerations should be subjugated to economic priorities. Thus, in spite of warm words about cycling, pro-car policies tend to dominate. Set against this policy backdrop, and taking the stance that public opinion can influence policy change, this paper reports the results of two large scale surveys of opinions regarding the practice of cycling and its role within society, carried out amongst samples of adults representative of Great Britain, in 2010 and 2013. Results indicated broadly positive opinions relating to cycling as part of society, albeit with these measures dropping slightly between 2010 and 2013. Opinions of cycling were found to be significantly linked to voting intention with, broadly speaking, a gradient of decreasing positivity when moving from the political left to right. These results imply a possible link of 'surface' opinions of cycling being influenced by underlying 'deep-seated' beliefs and values. These results are discussed in terms of policy options for pro-cycling groups wishing to influence the debate. Options include decoupling cycling from underlying belief systems and presenting simply as a form of everyday transport; promoting cycling as a solution to multi-social issues across health, the environment and economic considerations such as lower congestion; the pros and cons of de-marketing car usage; and finally, changing underlying belief systems. It is concluded that pro-cycling advocates may be pleased with the broad support of cycling's contribution to society, but they may need to seek alliances with other environmental or health groups in order to turn these good intentions into genuine policy change.

This research attempts to model online hotel bookings in the real market using discrete choice modelling. The methodology is based on the estimates of nested logit models, and the results show that tourists choose a hotel by going through a number of staged decision structures, which is in line with Associative Network Theory and the Cybernetic decision-making model.","[Masiero, Lorenzo] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Nicolau, Juan L.] Univ Alicante, Alicante, Spain",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Universitat d'Alacant,"Masiero, L (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Sch Hotel & Tourism Management, TST East, 17 Sci Museum Rd, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",lorenzo.masiero@polyu.edu.hk,"Nicolau, Juan Luis/I-4982-2016; Nicolau, Juan Luis/AAZ-6589-2021; Masiero, Lorenzo/O-8734-2014","Masiero, Lorenzo/0000-0002-6933-1700",,,,,10,8,9,1,33,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The existing literature has focused on how IPRs in the destination country affect exports from a source country. In this paper, we add an additional dimension: the level of technology of the exporting country (LT). This is quite important for distinguishing the impact of IPRs on the exports of developed and developing countries, since the technology levels vary across countries at different stages of development and intellectual property rights better protect exports that are technologically advanced than exports that are imitative and potentially infringing. By factoring in the level of technology (LT), our empirical analysis makes the case that IPRs can act as a barrier to the exports from the South, especially the rapidly catching-up economies, and thus be a source for the middle-income trap phenomenon.","[Shin, Wonkyu] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Ctr Int Commerce & Strategy, Seoul, South Korea; [Shin, Wonkyu] Kyung Hee Univ, Ctr Int Dev Cooperat, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Keun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Walter G.] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Seoul National University (SNU); Kyung Hee University; Seoul National University (SNU); American University,"Shin, W (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Ctr Int Commerce & Strategy, Seoul, South Korea.;Shin, W (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Ctr Int Dev Cooperat, Seoul, South Korea.",,"Lee, Keun/AAU-8046-2020","Lee, Keun/0000-0002-0403-6348","Korean Government through National Research Foundation [NRF2014S1A3A2043505, NRF-2013S1A3A2053312]",Korean Government through National Research Foundation(National Research Foundation of Korea),"The first and second authors acknowledge the financial support of the Korean Government through the National Research Foundation, NRF2014S1A3A2043505 and NRF-2013S1A3A2053312, respectively.",,39,29,31,1,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2016,39.0,6.0,,,,,772,802,,10.1111/twec.12338,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DP6TW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378632800003,0

This prompted Germany to take the initiative in formulating EU sanctions against Russia. However, Germany has attempted to reconcile the sanctions policy with a diplomatic approach to resolving the Ukraine crisis by seeking ways of engaging Moscow on broader security and economic issues, as Russia is considered an essential factor in European and global security and a key energy supplier. Thus, Ostpolitik has not been abandoned altogether; it continues to play a role and shapes the long-term objectives of Germany's Russia policy.","[Siddi, Marco] Finnish Inst Int Affairs, Kruunuvuorenkatu 4,POB 400, FI-00161 Helsinki, Finland",Finnish Institute of International Affairs,"Siddi, M (通讯作者)，Finnish Inst Int Affairs, Kruunuvuorenkatu 4,POB 400, FI-00161 Helsinki, Finland.",marco.siddi@fiia.fi,"Siddi, Marco/M-2360-2019","Siddi, Marco/0000-0002-5881-5574",,,,,36,30,34,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,JUN,2016,68.0,4.0,,,SI,,665,677,,10.1080/09668136.2016.1173879,0.0,,,13,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,DO4UG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000377779300007,0

We interpret these findings as evidence suggesting a greater appetite for risk among self-selecting immigrants relative to native-born Canadians.

The existing studies under-emphasize the societal dimension of the EU's impact and the normative context in which the EU's leverage is applied. Taking a societal perspective, this article examines societal empowerment as an alternative to elite empowerment and proposes four mechanisms of EU influence on democratization through societies taking into account the EU's structural power and actorness, and considering their effects on the societal sphere and societal actions. Applying the mechanisms to a tough case for societal mobilization for democracy - Bulgaria - the article shows how the EU, through representing a legitimate model of democratic governance, has created a strong pro-reform societal constituency that can sustain the democratic dynamic. The article also demonstrates the relevance of cross-national diffusion processes for pro-democracy societal mobilization.","[Noutcheva, Gergana] Maastricht Univ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Noutcheva, G (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Polit Sci, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",g.noutcheva@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Noutcheva, Gergana/J-1552-2019","Noutcheva, Gergana/0000-0001-9368-1578",,,,,65,20,22,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Taking advantage of cross-country heterogeneities, I find that a domestic brand bias, per capita income, and income inequalities lead to significantly different prices across borders. The role of income inequalities is supported by a theoretical model of indirect price discrimination at the national level. We therefore conclude that not only direct international price discrimination, but also indirect national price discrimination is responsible for the observed price differentials across international borders, which are not likely to fully converge as long as the exclusive dealership system is in place, and significant demand-side differences still remain.","[Radoias, Vlad] Towson Univ, Dept Econ, 8000 York Rd,Stephens Hall 103, Towson, MD 21252 USA",University System of Maryland; Towson University,"Radoias, V (通讯作者)，Towson Univ, Dept Econ, 8000 York Rd,Stephens Hall 103, Towson, MD 21252 USA.",vradoias@towson.edu,,,,,,,16,1,1,1,15,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Our empirical results, however, show that CBLs can be systematically higher than DR participants' estimated load, especially for those experienced in DR activities, likely due to manipulation behaviors. Thus, the integrity of CBL may degrade over time. With an inflated CBL, the impact of DR programs may therefore be highly exaggerated, and consumers can be paid money when they are not actually reducing their demand. In particular, we design a manipulation-indicating variable seemingly unattractive free-money opportunity (SUFO) and discover system-wide manipulative behaviors that increase with time and are widely adopted by experienced DR participants. We suggest that policy makers in FERC, RTOs, and states regulatory agencies consider the threat of manipulation when modifying DR market rules following the Supreme Court's recent upholding of FERC Order 745.","[Chen, Xu] Monitoring Analyt, 2621 Van Buren Ave,Suite 160, Eagleville, PA 19403 USA; [Kleit, Andrew N.] Penn State Univ, Dept Energy & Mineral Engn, 213 Hosler Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Chen, X (通讯作者)，Monitoring Analyt, 2621 Van Buren Ave,Suite 160, Eagleville, PA 19403 USA.",xch.psu@gmail.com; ank1@psu.edu,"Chen, Xu/C-6394-2018",,Department of Energy's Efficient Buildings Hub; Penn State Energy Markets Initiative,Department of Energy's Efficient Buildings Hub; Penn State Energy Markets Initiative,This research was funded by grants from the Department of Energy's Efficient Buildings Hub and the Penn State Energy Markets Initiative.

Our results indicate limited substitutability between electricity and natural gas, but strong substitutability between light fuel oil and each of electricity and natural gas in most cases.","[Jadidzadeh, Ali; Serletis, Apostolos] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Calgary,"Serletis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",Serletis@ucalgary.ca,,"Jadidzadeh, Ali/0000-0002-2889-5868",,,,,25,5,6,0,11,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,APR,2016,37.0,2.0,,,,,181,199,,10.5547/01956574.37.2.ajad,0.0,,,19,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DH3EO,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372670500008,0

This paper examines whether the United States' first immigration quota, established under the Emergency Immigration Act of 1921, affected migrant selection. The Emergency Immigration Act of 1921 severely capped the number of admittable migrants by nationality. Canadian migrants, or any migrants who resided in Canada for five consecutive years, were unrestricted by the quota and could freely migrate to the U.S. Using transcribed ship records from states bordering Canada (specifically New York, Alaska, and Washington), I compare the skills of restricted migrants to the skills of unrestricted Canadian migrants, before and after establishment of the 1921 quota. Difference-in-differences estimates indicate that the quota resulted in migrants of higher skill.

Production forecasts from the IMPACT model applied in this research result in meat and milk self-sufficiency, and in a 44%, 59% and 82% rate of dependence on imports for grain, sugar and oilseed, respectively. Without any rational approach, GMP puts forward dependence rates on imports lower than those in the model, i.e.40% for grain, 38% for sugar and 81% for oilseed.

Ordered Logistic Regression technique has been used to identify the socio-demographic and economic determinants of meat quality. Empirical findings based on MAS scores indicate that the main quality attributes are: colour and controlled product specifications for the expected quality; taste and smell after cooking for the experienced quality; cholesterol-rich and protein-rich for credence quality. The estimated ordered logistic regression model shows that the level of education and the household income positively explain the meat quality index.

Partial identification of treatment effects maps into a partial welfare ranking of treatment assignment policies. We characterize the identified ranking and show how the identifiability of the ranking depends on identifying assumptions, the feasible policy set, and distributional preferences.

Many are demolished, but in some cases considerable investments are made to preserve the cultural aspects of industrial sites. The renewal plans are usually designed to stimulate urban renewal in the vicinity of these sites. Little seems to be known about the effectiveness of these policies. In this paper, we study whether the redevelopment of 36 industrial heritage sites in The Netherlands caused positive external effects by investigating the development of house prices in nearby residential areas. We use a difference-in-difference design by comparing quality-adjusted house prices in a predefined target and control area before the start, between the start and the completion and after the completion of the redevelopment. We also model the spatial and temporal dimensions of these external effects. We find that these dimensions matter substantially. We find that negative externalities on house prices before the start completely disappear after the start of the redevelopment of industrial heritage sites. We also find evidence for positive and local effects on house prices after the completion, but this result disappears when we remove the projects located in the largest cities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

When a Partial Reform Equilibrium Turns Bad,EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"During the Great Recession, Slovenia recorded one of the worst economic performances within the EU. Such a decline is surprising as the country was the most stable among the post-socialist states. The article individuates the root cause for the downfall in protracted reform gradualism, which resulted in an inefficient privatisation process. This locked the country into a partial reform equilibrium' where economic elites extracted rents. Following accession to the EU, the unsustainable lending practices of state-owned banks to corporate organisations and the gridlock in policymaking pushed the country into an economic and political bad equilibrium'. Even though the Slovenian export sector proved to be surprisingly resilient, a massive debt overhang and a huge reform backlog are still weighing down on a healthy recovery.","[Guardiancich, Igor] Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Welf State Res, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Management, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Guardiancich, I (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Welf State Res, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Management, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark.",igu@sam.sdu.dk,,"Guardiancich, Igor/0000-0002-9255-0725",,,,,70,12,12,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,FEB 7,2016,68.0,2.0,,,,,205,231,,10.1080/09668136.2015.1126805,0.0,,,27,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,DI9CW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373800000001,0

Based on a large qualitative study of retiring managers in big Canadian firms, this article explores the relationships between managers' work during their careers, their retirement transitions and their retirement activities. Three distinctive patterns of managerial work and careers are found: those of expert managers, organization managers and strategic managers. They are strongly related to how managers end their full commitment' careers and then build retirement lives by combining leisure activities, family commitments, civic involvement and paid work. Variations in retirement pathways are not well predicted by either individualization theory or theories based on generational or class habitus. Managers appear to develop distinctive orientations to acting with agency that arise from the way managerial work is organized; and these frame managers' retirement pathways. These findings may indicate why individualization does not necessarily lead to life course destandardization.","[Martin, Bill] Univ Queensland, Social Sci Res Inst, Sociol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Martin, Bill] Univ Queensland, Social Sci Res Inst, Employment & Educ Program, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Lee, Mary Dean] McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, Org Behav & Human Resource Management, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada",University of Queensland; University of Queensland; McGill University,"Martin, B (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Social Sci Res Inst, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",w.martin@uq.edu.au,,,Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council [864-2007-0047],Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This research was supported by a grant from the Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (grant number 864-2007-0047).,,33,2,2,1,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The empirical analysis is performed within the context of Graph Theory where we apply a rolling window approach in order to dynamically analyze the evolution of the network that corresponds to the GDP growth rate cross-correlations of 22 European economies. The main innovation of our study is that the analysis is performed by introducing what we call the threshold-minimum dominating set (T-MDS). We provide evidence at the network level and analyze its structure and evolution by the metrics of total network edges, network density, isolated nodes and the cardinality of the T-MDS set. Next, focusing on the country level, we analyze each individual country's neighborhood set (economies with similar growth patterns) in the pre- and post-euro era in order to assess the degree of convergence to the rest of the economies in the network. Our empirical results indicate that despite a few economies' idiosyncratic behavior, the business cycles of the European countries display an overall increased degree of synchronization and thus convergence in the single currency era.","[Papadimitriou, Theophilos; Gogas, Periklis; Sarantitis, Georgios Antonios] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Econ, Komotini 69100, Greece",Democritus University of Thrace,"Sarantitis, GA (通讯作者)，Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Econ, Komotini 69100, Greece.",gsaranti@ierd.duth.gr,"Gogas, Periklis/N-8162-2014; Papadimitriou, Theophilos/AAD-7737-2020; Papadimitriou, Theophilos/GVU-6967-2022","Gogas, Periklis/0000-0002-5134-3869; Papadimitriou, Theophilos/0000-0001-9035-183X",European Union (European Social Fund (ESF)); Greek national funds through the Operational Program 'Education and Lifelong Learning' of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Program: THALES [MIS 380292],European Union (European Social Fund (ESF))(European Union (EU)European Social Fund (ESF)); Greek national funds through the Operational Program 'Education and Lifelong Learning' of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Program: THALES,This research has been co-financed by the European Union (European Social Fund (ESF)) and Greek national funds through the Operational Program 'Education and Lifelong Learning' of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF)-Research Funding Program: THALES (MIS 380292).

The present paper adds to this research by examining how and why foreign and domestic summer vacation trips incur cross-sectional differences in total trip expenditure for Norwegian households in the period 2009 to 2012. The paper also highlights how a number of other regressors explain variation in such expenditure. The main finding is that, in gross or unadjusted terms, Norwegian households spend more than three times as much on foreign summer trips as they do on domestic trips (that is, 225% more). In net or ceteris paribus terms, the analogue difference is 48%. Two important, but only partial explanations for the gross difference in total trip expenditure between foreign and domestic trips are choice of type of lodging and choice of transportation mode. Length of stay, purpose of trip, advance booking, frequency of vacation trips, age, income and gender all affect total trip expenditure. Whether the trip is foreign or domestic moderates the effects of some of the other regressors on total trip expenditure. Implications for future research are offered.","[Thrane, Christer] Lillehammer Univ Coll, Fac Econ & Org Sci, Box 952, N-2604 Lillehammer, Norway",Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences,"Thrane, C (通讯作者)，Lillehammer Univ Coll, Fac Econ & Org Sci, Box 952, N-2604 Lillehammer, Norway.",christer.thrane@hil.no,,,,,,,41,17,17,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

More specifically, first we show that the statistical distribution of wavelet decompositions of distinct index returns is best fitted using members of the alpha-stable distributions family. Then, an efficient maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator is applied on pairs of wavelet coefficients at adjacent levels to suppress the noise effect, prior to performing RQA. Quantitative and qualitative results on 22 future indices indicate an improved interpretation capability of RQA when applied on denoised data using our proposed approach, as opposed to previous methods based solely on a Gaussian assumption for the underlying statistics, in terms of extracting the underlying dynamical structure of index returns generating processes. Furthermore, our results reveal an increased accuracy of the proposed method in detecting switching volatility regimes, which is important for estimating the risk associated with a financial instrument.","[Tzagkarakis, George] EONOS Investment Technol, Paris, France; [Dionysopoulos, Thomas] Avenir Finance Investment Managers, Paris, France; [Dionysopoulos, Thomas] AXIANTA Res, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Achim, Alin] Univ Bristol, Visual Informat Lab, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Tzagkarakis, G (通讯作者)，EONOS Investment Technol, Paris, France.",gtzag@eonos.com,"Achim, Alin/A-3358-2009","Achim, Alin/0000-0002-0982-7798",,,,,51,0,0,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

This index, proposed by Bayoumi and Eichengreen [2], is based on the optimum currency area theory and its criteria. The paper utilise the traditional approaches of the optimum currency area theory. The OCA index includes variables that are important in deciding the country's entry into the monetary union and it is estimated by using a panel regression method. First, the original equation of Bayoumi and Eichengreen [2], who estimated the OCA index first, is used. Then, the modified equation of Horvath and Komarek [7] is estimated. The sample covers the period from 2000 to 2014. According to the results, there are countries which are more appropriate for the membership in the Eurozone because they reach satisfactory values of OCA index.

By exploiting the primal-dual method [Bile, Proceedings of the 10th Workshop on Approximation and Online Algorithms, 2012], we obtain interesting upper bounds with respect to a variety of different solution concepts ranging from approximate pure Nash equilibria up to approximate coarse correlated equilibria, and including also approximate one round walks starting from the empty state. Our findings show a high beneficial effect of taxation which increases more than linearly with the degree of the latency functions. In some cases, a tight relationship with some well-studied polynomials in Combinatorics and Number Theory, such as the Touchard and the Geometric polynomials, arises. In these cases we can also show matching lower bounds, albeit under mild assumptions; interestingly, our upper bounds are derived by exploiting the combinatorial definition of these polynomials, while our lower bounds are constructed by relying on their analytical characterization.","[Bilo, Vittorio] Univ Salento, Dept Math & Phys Ennio De Giorgi, POB 193, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Vinci, Cosimo] Gran Sasso Sci Inst, Laquila, Italy",University of Salento; Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI),"Bilò, V (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Math & Phys Ennio De Giorgi, POB 193, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",vittorio.bilo@unisalento.it; cosimo.vinci@gssi.infn.it,"Bilò, Vittorio/P-1913-2014; Vinci, Cosimo/HPH-9179-2023","Vinci, Cosimo/0000-0001-7741-9342; BILO', Vittorio/0000-0001-7848-4904",,,,,41,13,13,0,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,839,856,,10.1145/2940716.2940750,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300082,0

The research instruments developed on the basis of the European integration are often not suitable for the measurement of effects in the post-Soviet space. The starting point for the Eurasian RIAs was the collapse of the USSR, the entity the researched countries were members of and not the integration of sovereign states as it was in the case of the EU. So the processes occurring at the researched area are both integrative and disintegrative. The new economic dimensions of the EAEU are: the position of the researched countries in the international division of labor, their participation in global value chains and the ability to create a common advantage in international relations. The latter criterion is researched from the perspective of land threads of the New Silk Road (One Road One Belt) between China and the European Union. The main research hypothesis regarding to the investigated effects of the EAEU is that the common international economic strategy adopted by the EAEU (in relation to the New Silk Road, the EU, China and not only) can be an actual measure of their economic impact strength. The article points out that although the cause of the institutionalization and creation of the EAEU are mainly politically motivated, the effects of their functioning strongly impact on the economy of the participating countries in a positive and negative way. In addition, the article shows that the strength and character of this impact are different for the particular EAEU countries. In this article, the trade of the particular Member States within and outside the EAEU was selected as a research instrument.","[Czerewacz-Filipowicz, Katarzyna] Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Czerewacz-Filipowicz, K (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland.",k.czerewacz@pb.edu.pl,"Czerewacz-Filipowicz, Katarzyna/J-7424-2015","Czerewacz-Filipowicz, Katarzyna/0000-0002-5987-2896",,,,,18,1,1,1,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,567,576,,,,,,10,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400058,0

The paper is thus original by proposing that it is the economic status that determines the survival and development of a minority language and by calling for attention to the importance of integrating text and context when researching translation.","[Dai, Lei] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Foreign Languages, Dept Translat & Interpretat, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,"Dai, L (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Foreign Languages, Dept Translat & Interpretat, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-273-2,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,75.0,,,,,,504,506,,,,,,3,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7SD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391653700129,0

Devanur et al. [2015] introduced the single-bid auction, and showed that it has a price of anarchy (PoA) of O (log m) for complement-free (i.e., subadditive) valuations. Prior to our work, no non-trivial upper bound on the PoA of single bid auctions was known for valuations exhibiting complements. We introduce a hierarchy over valuations, where levels of the hierarchy correspond to the degree of complementarity, and the PoA of the single bid auction degrades gracefully with the level of the hierarchy. This hierarchy is a refinement of the Maximum over Positive Hypergraphs (MPH) hierarchy [Feige et al. 2015], where the degree of complementarity d is captured by the maximum number of neighbors of a node in the positive hypergraph representation. We show that the price of anarchy of the single bid auction for valuations of level d of the hierarchy is O (d(2) log (m = d)), where m is the number of items. We also establish an improved upper bound of O (d log m) for a subclass where every hyperedge in the positive hypergraph representation is of size at most 2 (but the degree is still d). Finally, we show that randomizing between the single bid auction and the grand bundle auction has a price of anarchy of at most O (root m) for general valuations. All of our results are derived via the smoothness framework, thus extend to coarse-correlated equilibria and to Bayes Nash equilibria.","[Feldman, Michal; Friedler, Ophir; Reiner, Guy] Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Morgenstern, Jamie] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Tel Aviv University; University of Pennsylvania,"Feldman, M (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",,,,,,,,33,5,7,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,251,267,,10.1145/2940716.2940735,0.0,,,17,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300023,0

In terms of the situations that the accident rate of the training of the students in the initial operation of the CNC machine tools is high, with the great damage to the machine tools and equipment, and the low efficiency of the teaching and training, we should construct the CNC experimental platform based on the simulation technology for the NC teaching and training. This paper introduces the application principles of the numerical control simulation system, the construction elements and the dynamic graphic simulation technology of the NC machining process. With the combination of the machining examples of the parts, the author elaborates the operational processes of the numerical control simulation experimental platform. Examples show that the application of the numerical control simulation technology can improve the students' ability of the NC programming, the operational abilities of the CNC machine tools, and the maintenance abilities of the CNC system. Based on the control theory, the system theory and the information technologies, the simulation technology can be used to carry out the dynamic experiments on the actual or the envisaged systems by the computer programming and the system models. The simulation in the 50s to the 60s of last century was mainly used in the aerospace, the power, the chemical industry and other industrial process control and other engineering fields. For example, using the simulation technology, we can shorten the design and development cycles of the large aircrafts. With the use of the flight simulators, we can train the pilots on the ground, which can not only save a lot of fuels and funds, but can also be not subject to the meteorological conditions and the restrictions of the sites. In recent years, with the rapid development of the science and technologies, the simulation technology has penetrated into all fields of the teaching and the researches, with the more and more extensive application in the teaching of the electronic circuits, the experiments of the mechanical principles, the experiments of the automatic control systems, and the simulation of the principles of the chemical engineering, and so on.

Under some suitable conditions on the Levy measure of (J(t), t >= 0), we derive a lower bound for the transition densities of the JCIR process. We also find some sufficient conditions under which the function V(x) = x, x >= 0, is a Forster-Lyapunov function for the JCIR process.

Since young people do not posses necessary financial resources, the bank sector offers them a mortgage. Of course, the aim of any bank is to profit from such a transaction. Therefore, according to their possibilities, the banks employ excellent experts to analyze the financial situation of potential clients. Consequently, the banks know what could be a maximal size of the loan (in dependence on the debtor's position, salary and age) and what is a reasonable size of the installments. The aim of this contribution is to analyze the situation from the second side. In particular, the aim is to investigate the possibilities of the debtors not only in dependence on their present-day situation, but also on their future private and subjective decisions and on possible unpleasant events. Moreover, consequently according to these indexes, the aim of this contribution is to suggest a method for a recognition of a safe loan and simultaneously to offer tactics to state a suitable environment for future time.

The novel feature of this study is that the network structure and the size distribution of banks are derived from empirical data. We find that the ability of a defaulted institution to start a cascade depends on an interplay of shock size and connectivity. Further results indicate that the interbank loan network is structurally less stable after the financial crisis than it was before. To evaluate the influence of the network structure on market stability, we compare simulated cascades from the empirical network with results from different network models. The results show that the empirical network has non-random features, which cannot be captured by randomized networks. The analysis also reveals that simulations that assume homogeneity for banks and loan size tend to overestimate the fragility of the interbank market.","[Karimi, Fariba] Umea Univ, Dept Phys, Icelab, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Raddant, Matthias] Kiel Inst IfW, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Raddant, Matthias] CAU Kiel, Dept Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",Umea University; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel,"Raddant, M (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst IfW, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",fariba.karimi@physics.umu.se; raddant@economics.uni-kiel.de,"Raddant, Matthias/JZT-3513-2024","Raddant, Matthias/0000-0001-6157-7733; Karimi, Fariba/0000-0002-0037-2475",Swedish Research Council; Leibniz Association,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Leibniz Association,"The authors thank Petter Holme, Martin Rosvall, and Thomas Lux for helpful discussions.

If the relevance of the latter assumption is determined, it is particularly important to distinguish the two legal instruments. Already at first glance it is quite clear that the demarcation of the two instruments is going to be based on the border between the contracting lease of things for the use and characteristics of precarious holding of the things.

The doctrine of << laissez faire >>, and the argument that leaving people insofar as possible to their own devices would lead to a socially desirable state was based on the conviction that an Invisible Hand would lead society to such a state. As economic theory developed it was never able to give a formal justification for this assertion. It was claimed that this would happen but the discipline was confined to study the welfare properties of equilibrium states without explaining how they were attained. Thus crises were said to be generated by exogenous shocks and did not come from within the system. Changing our two hundred year old paradigm to thinking of the economy as a complex adaptive system allows us to consider economies out of equilibrium and the fact that they may self organise into states which are far from optimal. Such systems with their feedbacks are unpredictable and policy measures can generate unexpected consequences. Accepting this may lead to more realistic and more modest economic theory.","[Kirman, Alan] Aix Marseille Univ, Marseille, France; [Kirman, Alan] Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Paris, France",Aix-Marseille Universite,"Kirman, A (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Marseille, France.;Kirman, A (通讯作者)，Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Paris, France.",alan.kirman@ehess.fr,,,,,,,84,0,0,1,1,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

After that a global comparison of whole distributions as well as their selected quantiles are performed to assess how accurately they can approximate returns distribution as the whole and in segments.","[Malek, Jiri] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Banking & Insurance, W Churchilla 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic; [Quang Van Tran] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchilla 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Málek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Banking & Insurance, W Churchilla 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic.",GMalek@post.cz; tran@vse.cz,"Tran, Quang Van/GRJ-1138-2022",,,,,,8,2,2,0,1,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,528,533,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500091,0

Our findings indicate self-centered education concept firmly practiced by Amir's father-Baba posed a great restraint to Amir's personality development and induced distorted moral values, which consequently made Amir end up in sin. On the contrary, man-oriented home education concept followed by Rahim Khan, both a mentor and a moral guide was conducive to Amir's personality development and helped Amir accomplish self-redemption eventually.

The purpose and significance of this study is to improve the accuracy of the GPS positioning and the accuracy of the fitting precision of the high and then the GPS leveling height with the high precision, with the true realization of the GPS three-dimensional superiority, and the research situations at home and abroad of the GPS height fitting. Then the author introduces the relevant problems in the GPS height measurement, including the concepts of the geoidal surface and the orthometric height, the qusi-geoid and the normal height, the surface of reference ellipsoid and the geodetic height, the principle of the GPS height measurement, the factors affecting the accuracy of the GPS height measurement and the indexes for the evaluation of the precision of the GPS height. The author also studies the elevation fitting method, the contour graphic method, the polynomial curve fitting method, the cubic spline curve fitting method, the polynomial curve fitting method, the multi-surface function surface quasi legitimate, and the earth gravity field model fitting method and so on which are widely used in the applications. Finally, using two mathematical models of the polynomial surface fitting method, parts of the GPS data of Liaoning nuclear power plant are fitted, and the fitting results are analyzed and compared to draw the following conclusion. First of all, the height anomaly is regional, so the elevation fitting model should be chosen according to the characteristics of the study areas. Secondly, with the same fitting method, the larger the number of the starting points is, the more unified the distribution will be, and the more reasonable the positions distributed in the network will be, and the higher the fitting precision will be. Finally, in the application of the height fitting, we can also improve the accuracy of the GPS fitting by improving the precision of the GPS observation and the precision of the level measurement. The global positioning system (GPS), as the satellite navigation and positioning system of the new generation, has been widely used in the field of the measurement with the obvious characteristics of its globalism, all-weather, high precision, and high efficiency, and has produced a huge impact on the modem conventional measurement techniques. At present, the GPS Plane Control Survey has been widely used. The irregular geoidal surface results in the GPS height measurement being restricted. We can use the GPS height measurement to replace the traditional height measurement, to reduce the operational processes, and improve the operational efficiency, which is always one of the important topics. With the wide application of the GPS positioning technology, a large number of the practical data show that the accuracy of the GPS measurement is reliable, and it can reach the requirement of the accuracy of the engineering measurement. However, the GPS control measurement can quickly provide the geodetic latitude and longitude and the ellipsoidal height of the control point. In the small number of the known elevation points, with the method of the elevation fitting analysis, by calculating the height anomaly, we can meet the requirements of the accuracy of the fourth grade leveling.","[Peng, Yu; Li, Jihong; Ma, Nan] Fifth Inst Geol & Mineral Explorat Qinghai, Xining 810099, Qinghai, Peoples R China",,"Peng, Y (通讯作者)，Fifth Inst Geol & Mineral Explorat Qinghai, Xining 810099, Qinghai, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7914-0,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,58.0,,,,,,527,531,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7QX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391643800100,0

It is widely accepted that post-Soviet citizens are prone to believe CTs, but there has been little research about the conditions under which politicians endorse conspiracy narratives and why those narratives sometimes become hegemonic. I argue that in times of high uncertainty, CTs have properties that are useful in providing political elites with a focal point for coordination in the absence of other bases for coalition formation. I demonstrate this logic by analyzing the politics surrounding the construction and spread of a conspiracy narrative following violence in Kyrgyzstan in 2010. Politicians with different interpretations of the event coalesced around a contrived conspiratorial narrative, and used it to paper over differences as they formed a ruling coalition. This argument has implications for how to understand the appearance and durability of conspiracy claims in states where political formations are fluid.","[Radnitz, Scott] Univ Washington, Henry M Jackson Sch Int Studies, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Radnitz, S (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Henry M Jackson Sch Int Studies, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",srad@uw.edu,,,,,,,61,5,5,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Usually, the teacher sets these points before the test according to his meaning about a difficulty of particular example and also according to a mutual comparison of all the examples. A disadvantage of this approach could be the individual experience of the teacher who does not have to estimate the difficulties for a given group of students fittingly. Then easy examples are appraised by high number of points and vice versa. The presented method calculates the weights (i.e. the points) according to the results achieved by the students and then the total score. The score of a particular example is calculated only in percent and then its average. The reciprocal value of the average is the weight.

The samples were young farmers aged between 20 and 40 years old, and they had been involved in business coffee (as farmers, farming labor, labor in coffee processing, traders, and agricultural supply shops). Samples were collected randomly from 108 respondents. The results of the research showed that there was already equality in access and control carried out by young coffee farmers and their parents.

Unemployment as one of the key indicators of the economy, contributes to creating the picture about the level of development and living standards in the country. Since regional disparities in Slovakia are large, this issue is highly topical. In recent years, it is necessary to address not only the total number of unemployed in Slovakia, but to look particularly at the situation in the regions. The highest rates of the long-term unemployment are in the districts of central and eastern Slovakia. Despite the fact, that the reduction of unemployment rate belongs to basic economic policy framework, it is difficult to ensure minimization of this negative phenomenon.

In these prediction models different sets of predictors, mainly financial ratios of the company or some other predictors, are used for building a strongly predictive model. Previous works have shown that these models are then less effective in application in another country or in another time. In our paper we test a significance of several predictors in different regions of Slovak republic.

When respondents disguise the truth, non-sampling errors are created that cannot be corrected by these elaborate survey modifications. To reduce this type of non-sampling error, Park and MacLachlan (2008) suggested the exaggeration bias-corrected (EBC) CVM, which assumes a functional mechanism between real and spurious willingness to pay (WTP). The authors verify the effectiveness of the EBC-CVM in non-sampling error reduction, which in turn derives more error-corrected economic value.

Our measure of efficiency is derived from estimated stochastic multiproduct, output-oriented distance function. The model is applied to a sample of 1892 Italian commercial farms producing maize. Results show that the distribution of efficiency scores is more concentrated in non-diversified rather than in diversified farms and that, at a low efficiency level, diversified farms present a negative gap compared to non-diversified farms. In addition, results exclude that the efficiency differential observed at a different education level is ascribable to differences in composition of the two groups of farms rather than to differences in the response associated with the characteristics observed. It is recommended that policies be formulated to assist farmers in coping with the increased complexity of their diversified farm business and, especially, in taking on new experience and knowledge outside the agricultural markets and products.","[Salvioni, Cristina] Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Econ, Pescara, Italy; [Agovino, Massimiliano] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Business & Econ Studies, Naples, Italy",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara; Parthenope University Naples,"Salvioni, C (通讯作者)，Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Econ, Pescara, Italy.",salvioni@unich.it,"Salvioni, Cristina/K-3473-2019","Salvioni, Cristina/0000-0002-8065-9248",,,,,26,2,2,1,8,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2015,14.0,4.0,,,,,28,35,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,DG0KE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371752900004,0

Evidence from Russia: a research note,POST-SOVIET AFFAIRS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Russia; election fraud; elections; regions,ELECTORAL FRAUD; AUTHORITARIANISM; REGIMES,"The December 2011 legislative election was among the most fraudulent national elections in Russia since the communist period. The fraud, however, was not evenly spread across the country. Precinct-level election returns from the 83 regions of the Russian Federation suggest that the level of fraud ranged from minimal or small in some regions to extreme in some others, with moderate to high fraud levels in many regions in between. We argue that in an electoral authoritarian context like Russia, regional variation in fraud can be explained by differences in (a) the perceived need by regional authorities to signal loyalty to the center by delivering desired election results; (b) the capacity of regional authorities to organize fraud; and (c) the vulnerability of citizens to political pressure and manipulation. We test the effect of signaling, capacity, and vulnerability on electoral fraud in the 2011 legislative elections with data on the 83 regions of the Russian Federation. We find evidence for all three mechanisms, finding that the tenure of governors in office, United Russia's dominance in regional legislatures, and the ethnic composition of regions are most important for explaining regional variation in electoral fraud.","[Bader, Max] Leiden Univ, Hist Inst, Leiden, Netherlands; [van Ham, Carolien] Univ Twente, Ctr Study Democracy, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; University of Twente,"Bader, M (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Hist Inst, Leiden, Netherlands.",m.bader@hum.leidenuniv.nl,,"van Ham, Carolien/0000-0002-9844-9097",,,,,41,30,35,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The ambiguity arises because paying for protection worsens the outcome in the event the adverse event occurs, which influences the expected marginal utility of wealth. Using the concept of downside risk aversion or prudence, we characterize the marginal WTP to reduce the probability of the adverse event as the product of WTP in the case of risk neutrality and an adjustment factor. For the univariate case (e.g., risk of financial loss), the adjustment factor depends on risk aversion and prudence with respect to wealth. For the bivariate case (e.g., risk of death or illness), the adjustment factor depends on risk aversion and cross-prudence in wealth.","[Crainich, David] Inst Pasteur, Ctr Immunol & Biol Parasitaire, CNRS, LEM,UMR 8179, F-59019 Lille, France; [Crainich, David] IESEG Sch Management, Lille, France; [Eeckhoudt, Louis R.] Catholic Univ Lille, IESEG Sch Management LEM, Lille, France; [Eeckhoudt, Louis R.] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium; [Hammitt, James K.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Risk Anal, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hammitt, James K.] LERNA INRA, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Lille; Le Reseau International des Instituts Pasteur (RIIP); Institut Pasteur Lille; IESEG School of Management; IESEG School of Management; Universite Catholique Louvain; Harvard University; INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Hammitt, JK (通讯作者)，718 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",jkh@harvard.edu,,"Crainich, David/0000-0001-6387-888X",INRA; European Research Council under the European Community [230589],INRA; European Research Council under the European Community(European Research Council (ERC)),JKH acknowledges financial support from INRA and the European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) Grant Agreement No. 230589.,,27,3,4,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,NOV,2015,79.0,3.0,,,,,403,413,,10.1007/s11238-014-9475-7,0.0,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CU1DC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363258700002,0

Evidence from Italy,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fare evasion; Fare evader determinants; Proof-of-payment; Logistic regression models; Empirical evidence,FARE EVASION; INCENTIVES; DECEPTION; MODEL,"Nowadays, in proof-of-payment transit systems, fare evasion is provoking strong interest in public transport companies (PTCs) due to the relevant economic losses, social inequity and increased levels of violence affecting personal security. Therefore, there is the need to recognize possible fare evaders. By using 2177 on-board personal interviews, gathered from an Italian PTC, and logistic regression models, we isolate determinants of possible free-rider passengers and, hence, those whom it might be advisable to target in order to capitalize on the effect of the application of countermeasures on fare evasion put forward by the local PTC. We show that males, younger than 26 years, with a low education level, unemployed and/or students and without an alternative mode of transport other than the bus are more probably fare evaders. Moreover, people who make trips of shorter than 15 min, who are systematic users and are not satisfied with the service are possible fare evaders. Finally, we found that a low level of inspection, knowledge of fines and previous ticket violations are determinants which make people more prone to evade fares. These outcomes are very useful, because, to the best of our knowledge, they represent the first empirical contribution showing the determinants which help evaluate the propensity to be a fare evader, in probabilistic terms. Moreover, they could help PTCs understand who might be a fare evader, in order to anticipate suitable countermeasures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the analysis of the characteristics of bi-direction pedestrian flows at the subject signalized crosswalk, a crossing time (CT) estimation model is proposed and developed by taking the time lag of pedestrian platoons as well as bi-direction effects into consideration. Subsequently, two important indicators (proportion of delay in the crossing time, i.e. PDC, and local density level, i.e. LDL) are introduced into the evaluation of pedestrian crossing efficiency and comfort level respectively. It is shown in our work that CT, PDC, and LDL can be successfully obtained with the implementation of cellular automaton into the pedestrian simulation model by incorporating social forces (SFCA). Moreover, the relationships among CT, PDC, and LDL as well as the crosswalk width and pedestrian demand are modeled and illustrated. By synthesizing all indicators, a method is introduced to determine the recommended maximum and minimum widths for signalized crosswalks under different pedestrian demand volumes. Our methodologies demonstrate that they may help traffic engineers and specialists make a sensible choice of the crosswalk width. The outcome of our work will further give traffic engineers and practitioners new insights for the design and planning of signalized pedestrian crosswalks and constitute an important contribution to the understanding and evaluation of pedestrian movements in this aspect.

Yet, rather than highlight sources and instances of activity that might result in emancipatory outcomes, much of the CPE literature focuses on relations of domination and the way in which these are sustained and (re)produced. In contrast, and drawing on autonomist Marxism, we argue that an emancipation-oriented approach needs to focus upon the ways in which processes of domination are contested, disrupted and as a result remain incomplete. In doing so, we present an analysis of the European political and economic crisis that contrasts starkly with prevailing accounts. Whilst many observers have considered the European crisis in terms that signal the death knell of labour's prolonged post-1970s defeat, the paper instead renders visible the ongoing disruptive effects of the European populace's obstinate, subversive and creative capacity to escape those attempts to achieve domination and subjugation which existing accounts tend to identify.","[Huke, Nikolai] Univ Marburg, Dept Polit Sci, Marburg, Germany; [Clua-Losada, Monica] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Barcelona, Spain; [Bailey, David J.] Univ Birmingham, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",Philipps University Marburg; Pompeu Fabra University; University of Birmingham,"Huke, N (通讯作者)，Univ Marburg, Dept Polit Sci, Marburg, Germany.",huke.nikolai@gmail.com; monica.clua@upf.edu; d.j.bailey@bham.ac.uk,"Clua-Losada, Monica/W-8763-2019","Clua-Losada, Monica/0000-0002-3198-1097",ESRC [ES/M002209/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M002209/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,96,54,54,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In equilibrium, long-term and short-term pricers can allocate themselves to garages and curbside parking in various ways. The equilibrium is generally inefficient because garage operators exercise market power, and drivers have to search for curbside parking which creates a search cost externality. A city planner can achieve the social optimum without regulating garage prices if it can charge differentiated curbside parking fees. Many cities still have parking meters that can only levy uniform fees, and it is very costly to replace them. However, numerical results show that the efficiency loss due to uniform pricing is modest in most cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The TPRM 2014 demonstrates that the Mongolian economy is relatively open and it has very low formal trade barriers although there remain significant behind-the-borders barriers, including poor governance and infrastructure. Being a landlocked country, any major cross-border-price differences quickly results in informal trade with neighbouring China, limiting Mongolia's ability to pursue independent commercial policy. Mongolia's growth is not broad based and largely driven by the mining boom, making its economy highly vulnerable to external shocks. While this is not unique to Mongolia, and has been seen in many natural resource-abundant countries, experience suggests that countries with sound institutions and macroeconomic policies have overcome the so-called resource curse.","[Sharma, Kishor] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia; [Davaakhuu, Oyunbadam] Open Soc Forum, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",Charles Sturt University,"Sharma, K (通讯作者)，Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia.",,,"Sharma, Kishor/0000-0002-7967-0562",,,,,27,4,4,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2015,38.0,9.0,,,SI,,1350,1367,,10.1111/twec.12271,0.0,,,18,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CR2GL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361144400002,0

By using a dataset of 44 countries over 1970-2007, we explore the channels under which FDI fosters productivity by disentangling the impact of this factor on the production process and its components: impact on the attainable production set (input-output space) and the impact on the distribution of efficiencies. We extend existing methodological tools-conditional nonparametric efficiency measures-to examine these interrelationships. We emphasize the usefulness of smoothing over time to better analyze the potential dynamic influence of FDI on efficiency. We find that both FDI and time play an important role as influencing efficiency distribution and affecting, to a smaller extend, the production set. This effect of FDI does not seem to vary much over time. By the second-stage nonparametric regression of the conditional efficiencies over FDI and time we identify clearly the effect of time and FDI on conditional efficiency and we determine idiosyncratic efficiency, which represents the 'Solow residual', measured by looking to the unexplained part of the conditional efficiencies.

This territory saw an early development of a large, but spatially dispersed industrial sector and an agrarian reform in 1832. We establish, first, that food demand from the labor force of the non-agricultural sectors promoted agricultural development in the absence of urbanization as well; nevertheless, the spatial dispersion of demand limited the pace of growth. Second, agrarian reform had no effect on output and productivity growth. This is because, on the one hand, the reform consisted mainly in a redistribution of income from land in the long run and did not affect incentive structures. On the other hand, property rights during the pre-reform period were both sufficiently secure and negotiable to reallocate land to more intensive patterns of arable farming under a traditional property rights regime.","[Pfister, Ulrich] Univ Munster, Inst Econ & Social Hist, Munster, Germany; [Kopsidis, Michael] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Halle, Germany",University of Munster; Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Pfister, U (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Inst Econ & Social Hist, Munster, Germany.",pfister@uni-muenster.de; kopsidis@iamo.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012",,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [KO 1823/3-1, PF 351/7-1]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Research support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (grants KO 1823/3-1 and PF 351/7-1) is gratefully acknowledged.,,54,8,8,1,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

Using the prism of the sociological imagination, it explains the learning to be gained from teaching HRM that is sensitive to context, power and inequality. The context of crisis provides ideal circumstances for critical reflexivity and for integrating wider societal issues into the HRM curriculum. It argues for Critical Human Resource Management Education or CHRME, which, if adopted, would be an antidote to prescriptive practitioner-oriented approaches. It proceeds to set out five principles for CHRME: using the sociological imagination' prism; emphasizing the social nature of the employment relationship; investigating paradox within HRM; designing learning outcomes that encourage students to appraise HRM outcomes critically; and reflexive critique. Crucially, CHRME offers a teaching strategy that does not neglect or marginalize the reality of structural power, inequality and employee work experiences.","[Bratton, John] Athabasca Univ, Labour Relat, Athabasca, AB, Canada; [Gold, Jeff] Leeds Metropolitan Univ, Org Learning, Leeds LS1 3HE, W Yorkshire, England",Athabasca University; Leeds Beckett University,"Gold, J (通讯作者)，Leeds Metropolitan Univ, Leeds LS1 3HE, W Yorkshire, England.",j.gold@leedsmet.ac.uk,,,,,,,56,18,20,1,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The first flextime measure is the ability to easily take time off for personal and family matters, which correlates with a statistically and economically significant reduction in workplace stress. Subsequently, we find that this same flexibility is associated with 6-10% reduction in the likelihood of self-reported sleep difficulties for the full sample, and as high as an 11-25% reduction in a subgroup analysis concerning unmarried females with children. The second flextime measure is the option of a compressed workweek, which also correlates with a statistically reduction in workplace stress, though the estimate is considerably smaller than for the first flexibility; a subsequent analysis finds no statistically significant relationship between this flexibility and sleep difficulties. Our findings suggest that the more flexible flexibility (i.e., more short-notice schedule flexibility) appears to be associated with larger reductions in the probability of being stressed, enough, in fact, to carry through to noticeable improvements in concomitant sleep difficulties. Thus, the first form of flextime may function, based on this observational analysis, as a tangible non-medical way to meet worker flextime desires and firm aspirations for increased safety and less absenteeism, all while potentially offering a positive public health externality. The size and significance of the flextime results prevail through bias assessments and sensitivity analyses.","[Haley, M.

Through a focus on craft as experience and repetitive practice, Sennett reveals how craft is a key facet of several contemporary professions. Using the example of hairdressing, this article moves beyond Sennett's conclusions, illuminating how craft is at work within female-dominated service professions. The article adds to the growing body of literature on hairdressing, recognizing that while this literature involves body and emotion work, such growth has been at the exclusion of the craft components of the work. More broadly, the article argues that the craft of service work is obscured by the intangibility of the materials produced and the practices performed, thus limiting the value of such work.","Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S3 7RH, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Holmes, H (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Room E49,Hicks Bldg, Sheffield S3 7RH, S Yorkshire, England.",H.Holmes@shef.ac.uk,,"Holmes, Helen/0000-0002-4918-2007",ESRC Postgraduate Studentship Award [PTA-031-2006-00255],ESRC Postgraduate Studentship Award,This research was funded by an ESRC Postgraduate Studentship Award (PTA-031-2006-00255).,,69,36,38,0,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

It is reported in many studies that Z-score is sensitive to changes in accounting figures. Researchers have proposed different variations to conventional Z-score that can improve the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we develop a new multivariate nonlinear model for computing the Z-score. In addition, we develop a new credit risk index by fitting a Pearson type 3 distribution to the transformed financial ratios. The results of our study have shown that the new Z-score can predict the bankruptcy with an accuracy of 98.6 % as compared to 93.5 % by Altman's Z-score. Also, the discriminate analysis revealed that the new transformed financial ratios could predict the bankruptcy probability with an accuracy of 93.0 % as compared to 87.4 % using the weights of Altman's Z-score.","[Kumar, M.

Controlling for the effects of common macroeconomic shocks, we apply cross-sectional and fixed effect panel regressions linking such density characteristics and density forecast performance. Our empirical results suggest that many macroeconomic experts could systematically improve their density performance by correcting a downward bias in their variances. Aside from this shortcoming in the second moment characteristics of the individual densities, other higher moment features, such as skewness or variation in the degree of probability mass given to the tails of the predictive distributions, tend-as a rule-not to contribute significantly to enhancing individual density forecast performance.","[Kenny, Geoff; Kostka, Thomas] European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany; [Masera, Federico] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Madrid 28903, Spain",European Central Bank; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Kenny, G (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Kaiserstr 29, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",Geoff.kenny@ecb.europa.eu,,"Masera, Federico/0000-0002-5907-8342",,,,,45,10,11,0,4,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In contrast with theory, we observe that on average bidders are slightly but significantly more aggressive under the ROFR when their costs are such that they are predicted to behave identically under both auction procedures. For the sub-sample of subjects for whom we can estimate a CRRA parameter, we confirm the theoretical prediction that the buyer's expected cost is larger in the ROFR if the newcomer is not sufficiently risk-averse.","[Brisset, Karine; Cochard, Francois; Marechal, Francois] Univ Franche Comte, CRESE, F-25030 Besancon, France",Universite de Franche-Comte,"Cochard, F (通讯作者)，Univ Franche Comte, CRESE, 45D Ave Observ, F-25030 Besancon, France.",fcochard@univ-fcomte.fr,,"MARECHAL, FRANCOIS/0000-0001-9905-1753",University of Franche-Comte,University of Franche-Comte,"We thank all participants at ASFEE's conference (May 2012), in particular R.

In sum, financial constraints to international migration are binding for poor Mexicans, some of whom would like to migrate but cannot afford to.

We develop a multicommunity model with overlapping generations. When young, an individual chooses a certain level of educational effort. The crucial feature is that the decision is influenced by peers living in the area who favor a social norm either valuing education or discrediting it. As an adult, an individual who cares about both her offspring's expected income and the social norm, chooses the family's location. Endogenous location leads to different patterns of social norms in the city. We identify two types of urban equilibrium: a culturally-balanced city where social norms are distributed evenly among urban areas and where the rate of education is the same in each urban area and a culturally-divided city where urban areas oppose on their prevailing social norm and exhibit different rates of education. We then study the dynamics of social norms. We show that there are multiple long-run patterns of social norms. A particular steady state is achieved depending on the initial distribution support for sodal norms in the population. Finally, we show that a public policy promoting social integration can lead, in the long run, to a population unanimously discrediting education. Enforcing social integration can obtain less education than allowing the culturally-divided city to arise. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We first derive precise conditions under which Bresnahan and Reiss's entry threshold ratios (ETRs) can be used to measure competition effects. We then augment the traditional entry model with a revenue equation. This serves to adjust the ETRs by the extent of market expansion from entry, giving unbiased estimates of the competition effects. We apply our approach to seven local service sectors.

Based on a selection-mutation Moran process, this paper makes an attempt to construct and analyze a stochastic evolutionary game dynamic in two heterogeneous populations. Precisely speaking, one population is clever in the sense that its every individual mutates according to a pairwise comparison rule while the other is simple since each of its individuals mutates completely randomly. As a criterion of equilibrium selection, related stationary distributions of strategies are then analytically derived under weak selection. Besides, some novel findings can be obtained due to the explicit consideration of rational behavior. For example, it turns out that for coordination games the introduction of the rationality may inhibit the clever population from selecting the risk-dominant strategy, which is inconsistent with our common sense.","[Zhang, Yanfang] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Gao, Xing] Southeast Univ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Finance & Economics; Southeast University - China,"Zhang, YF (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zyfangsd@126.com,"Shi, Yaolin/JXN-8322-2024",,,,,,40,4,4,2,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Here, we argue that the strength of international business network connections of a host location influences the potential accessibility of international knowledge and hence tends to widen the domain of new knowledge search that can be successfully undertaken by an MNC subunit. This in turn increases the likelihood of an MNC subunit building new areas of competencies, that is, in fields of competencies which are relatively new to the MNC. Specifically, we suggest that the relevant international business network connections are those involving local actors in the MNC subunit's relevant industry. Moreover, geographical proximity between MNC subunits and their parent company has an inverse U-shaped relationship with new competence creation by subunits. Using a balanced panel data set on innovative activities conducted abroad by 194 of the world's largest industrial firms from 1975 to 1995, we find support for our expectations.","[Cantwell, John] Rutgers Business Sch, Newark, NJ 08854 USA; [Piscitello, Lucia] DIG Politecn Milano, Milan, Italy",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University Newark; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Cantwell, J (通讯作者)，Rutgers Business Sch, Newark, NJ 08854 USA.",,,"piscitello, lucia/0000-0002-4817-315X",,,,,78,29,33,0,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2015,38.0,2.0,,,,,231,254,,10.1111/twec.12175,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CB4SQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349618800001,0

In-depth interviews reveal collectivism rooted in the labour process and highlight the key agency of BASSA in effectively articulating worker interests. This data emphasizes crews' relative autonomy, sustained by unionate on-board Cabin Service Directors who have defended the frontier of control against managerial incursions. Periodic attempts to re-configure the labour process, driven by cost cutting imperatives in an increasingly competitive airline industry, eroded crews' organizational loyalties. When BA imposed radical changes to contracts and working arrangements, BASSA successfully mobilized its membership.

We employ a standard DSGE model with heterogeneous agents and Cobb-Douglas production technology that matches the observed wealth distribution in the United States. Then, we change the values of the parameter that governs the capital share in the model and study its impact on the inequalities measured by the Gini coefficients and the wealth/income shares of the top 1%. The results show that the increase of one percentage point in the capital share raises the Gini coefficient of the income distribution of about 0.008, on average.

The cases reported are irrespective of being committed by for-profit organisations or non-profit organizations (NPOs). This proves that fraud has become a disease that is spreading and increasing worldwide, and Malaysia is not an exception. As NPOs are formed to further charity and noble purposes, it comes as a surprise that NPOs have become conduits for fraudulent acts such as the embezzlement of funds by fraudsters and the misuse of the collection of charitable funds for personal benefit. In line with this, the objective of this paper is to provide review of warning signals from both financial and non-financial indicators influencing the occurrence of fraud and abuse. The overall review contributes to the literature on warning signals of fraud and abuse in NPOs. It will also provide useful insight for the relevant regulators and NPOs, in establishing and implementing effective risk management, using a risk-based approach and board effectiveness perspectives in protecting the NPOs from being a victim of fraud and abuse.

Macroeconomic and structural characteristics of the economy were analysed on the basis of the selected development indicators. Results of the analysis indicate continuous deterioration of economic conditions in all the respective counties after 2008, as well as the increase in regional disparities in this area comapred to the Republic of Croatia. The authors identified extremely negative demographic trends as one of the key factors of negative economic trends and increase in development divergence.

The study covered six seasons (2003/04 and 2005/06 to 2009/10) with measurements made every week or fortnight. The results point to greater correlation between the colour coordinate 'a' in peel and low temperatures than medium temperatures. The correlation between the colour coordinate and low temperatures is the greatest for the mean value recorded during the previous 21 days. The correlation for the loss of greenness in lemon peel increases when the average of the minimum temperatures, rather than the average of the means, is considered. The negative values of the colour coordinate 'a' decrease below 15-17 degrees C, increasing as the minimum temperatures fall until they reach zero. The colour coordinate 'a' and the average minimum temperature for the 21 days preceding the measurement provide excellent adjustments. The good values of R-2 for the cultivars 'Eureka', 'Fino' and 'Lisbon' show that the synthesis of the many carotenoids in the peel varies as a function of temperature.

The study employed a qualitative approach involving four Australian vertically integrated value-adding enterprises in south east Queensland and northern New South Wales. Two firms with annual incomes of $AUD 30-40m and two with less than $AUD 2m were selected as the case study firms. Senior managers from each organisation were interviewed three times resulting in a total of 52 semi-structured interviews.

Based on observations and data collected through interviews, all four organisations were less than fully market oriented. The results indicate that a limited understanding of contemporary marketing principles, a mistrust of marketing as an organisational discipline and resistance by founders and owners to allow others to make important management decisions were the principle reasons why higher levels of market orientation were not achieved.","[Currey, P.

It is thus a key driver of strategic renewal and business performance for organizations, which need to valorize the creativity of individuals and teams (the internal crowd). This article introduces the concept of crowd- venturing as an application of collective intelligence principles in the corporate context. A set of individual and organizational factors supporting the entrepreneurial potential of human resources is defined and used to build a tool for assessing the maturity of crowd-venturing within companies. A classification of organizational archetypes is also proposed. Design/methodology/approach - The study starts from a review of corporate entrepreneurship and organizational creativity literature, with a cross-domain investigation of related areas such as human resource management and collective intelligence. The work of theory review is a basis to define an integrated assessment tool that has been applied in preliminary studies conducted in three big ICT companies. Originality/value - The research proposes a systemic model for the exploration of drivers of corporate creativity and entrepreneurial dynamics. The concept of crowd-venturing is defined, along with an assessment tool useful to evaluate the maturity level of both individual and organizational factors respect to the internal entrepreneurial process. The study can be conceived as a new application of collective intelligence principles in organization-related issues. Practical implications - The article provides managers with a method and an operating tool for assessing the internal entrepreneurship environment and the corporate venturing process. The in-company application of the tool can open new avenues for developing methodologies addressed to activate entrepreneurial dynamics within organizations.","[Elia, Gianluca; Margherita, Alessandro; Petti, Claudio] Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, Lecce, Italy",University of Salento,"Margherita, A (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, IBIL Campus Ecotekne,Via Monteroni Sn, Lecce, Italy.",,"Petti, Claudio/L-8735-2015; ELIA, Gianluca/N-5942-2015; Margherita, Alessandro/AAI-8018-2020","Petti, Claudio/0000-0002-0628-5145; Margherita, Alessandro/0000-0002-7091-1024",,,,,38,0,0,2,18,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2480,2490,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200194,0

Most of the important commercial species of Citrus are believed to be of interspecific origin. By studying SNP and indel polymorphisms of 27 nuclear genes on 32 genotypes of Citrus and relatives of Citrus, the phylogenetic relationship between 'true citrus fruit trees' was clarified. Additionally, four mitochondrial (mtDNA) and five chloroplastic (cpDNA) SSRs markers were analysed for the citrus species to specify the maternal phylogeny of Citrus secondary species. A total of 16238 kb of DNA was sequenced for each genotype, and 1156 SNPs and 58 indels were identified. Nuclear phylogenetic analysis revealed that C. reticulata, Poncirus, and Fortunella form a clade that is clearly differentiated from the clade that includes three other basic taxa of cultivated citrus (C. maxima, C. medica and C. micrantha). Clymenia is included in a third strong clade with Eremocitrus and Microcitrus. The nuclear phylogeny of Citrus and its sexually compatible relatives was consistent with the geographic origins of these genera. The origin of Citrus secondary species was analysed both at nuclear and cytoplasmic level and the conclusions mostly agree with previous hypotheses. The SNPs and indels identified at the nuclear level from a relatively large discovery panel will be useful for systematic characterisation of citrus germplasm, both at intra-and inter-specific level.","[Garcia-Lor, Andres; Curk, Franck; Ancillo, Gema; Navarro, Luis; Ollitrault, Patrick] IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain; [Curk, Franck; Luro, Francois] INRA, Genet & Ecophysiol Qualite Agrumes UR1103, San Giuliano, France; [Snoussi-Trifa, Hager] Tunisian Natl Agron Res Inst INRAT, Hort Lab, Ariana, Tunisia; [Morillon, Raphael; Ollitrault, Patrick] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, UMR AGAP, Montpellier, France",INRAE; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier,"Navarro, L (通讯作者)，IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain.",lnavarro@ivia.es; patrick.ollitrault@cirad.fr,"Ancillo, Gema/ABF-8990-2020; Navarro, Luis/D-1001-2012; Lor, Andres García/B-1246-2016; Ollitrault, Patrick/HLQ-0557-2023","Navarro, Luis/0000-0001-5163-5960; Lor, Andres García/0000-0002-5625-5470; Morillon, Raphael/0000-0001-6762-1715; Ollitrault, Patrick/0000-0002-9456-5517",,,,,34,0,0,0,13,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,85,95,,,,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600008,0

The growing importance of non financial information is confirmed by the recent approval of European Directive 2014/95/UE and by the new model of business reporting: Integrated Reporting, (IIRC, 2013). The objectives of the paper are: OB1: analysis of the recent requirements/frameworks for disclosure of non-financial information; OB2: recognition of the previous studies on the Value Relevance of non-financial information; OB3: empirical analysis of a sample of European listed companies belonging to the beverage industry. Design/methodology/approach -. The methodological approach is based on two different fields: 1) the content analysis to evaluate the quantity and quality of NFI in companies' reports and 2) established valuation models The 1995 Ohlson's model and its subsequent refinements has been employed in order to investigate the relationship between equity market values and NFI disclosure. The research will carry out a VR analysis on a sample of the European listed companies belonging to the beverage industry. Originality/value - The expected findings may provide an interesting insight into the current state of reporting of NFI and about the value relevance of NFI in the beverage industry. This research may contribute to the existing literature in regard to two different fields: 1) the recent studies on the field of non-financial disclosure, recently on Integrated Reporting (IIRC, December 2013) or on issues related to sustainability reporting 2) the previous studies on VR and NFI information. It is important to highlight that there are few studies on a VR analysis of NFI on the food and beverage industry. Practical implications -. The research in the field of VR and NFI, in particular focused on the social and environmental information, can be useful in particular to the management and especially to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practitioners as they offer a valuable tool to appreciate the usefulness and relevance of a transparent non-financial disclosures. Limitations of the research carried out: 1) the size of the sample analyzed; 2) the analysis can be extended to other countries outside the European Union.","[Gasperini, Andrea] Italian Assoc Financial Analysts AIAF Mission Int, Board Network Italian Business Reporting NIBR, Responsible Working Grp, Ferrara, Italy; [Doni, Federica] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Business Adm Management Finance & Law, I-20126 Milan, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Gasperini, A (通讯作者)，Italian Assoc Financial Analysts AIAF Mission Int, Board Network Italian Business Reporting NIBR, Responsible Working Grp, Ferrara, Italy.",,"Doni, Federica/L-1047-2017","DONI, FEDERICA/0000-0002-6581-9530",,,,,63,0,0,2,22,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,551,566,,,,,,16,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200043,0

In economic geography the traditional view has been that physical proximity within city-regions and being part of an industrial cluster are keys for the innovative capacity of firms. This view is echoed in the management literature which holds a strong belief in the concept of regional clusters. Clusters have been defined as geographical concentrations of interconnected companies and institutions in a particular field (Porter 1998). According to Porter, being localized in a cluster improves competitiveness by allowing firms easier access to specialized suppliers and employees; and by increasing firms' capacity for innovation and productivity growth. However, in a globalizing world the superiority of local clusters should be questioned. Firms that successfully develop global pipelines to knowledge sources in distant locations often sidestep the risk of lockin, associated with relying solely on local sources of information (Malecki 2010; Fitjar and Rodriguez-Pose 2011). Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses a specifically tailored survey carried out in 2013 of the geographical distance and scope of collaboration for innovation of 2002 firms located in the four largest Norwegian city-regions with the rest of the country as a separate category. Originality/value - We find that a majority of firms are located in regional clusters. However, locating in regional clusters is not the optimal strategy for firms to innovate. Belonging to a national cluster enhances the capability to market new products, and being part of an international business environment improves the capacity to launch radical or substantially new products. The contribution is threefold: Firstly, the comparison of the innovation performance of firms located inside regionally concentrated clusters with those located outside. Secondly, most prior studies, often case studies, have been limited to certain sectors or spatial agglomerations. Using a survey yields greater opportunities than case studies to generalize the findings. And finally, other studies often use patents as a measure of innovation, whereas the present study captures a much broader array of innovations Practical implications - Cluster policies to advance the capabilities to innovate in firms and regions may need to be revised. The policy of initiating and supporting predominantly regional clusters should be substituted, or at least complemented, by a more open and broader spatial approach. Managers may rethink the way their innovation processes are organized, and broaden their search for ideas and knowledge beyond the region they are located.","[Gjelsvik, Martin] Stavanger Innovat Ctr, Int Res Inst Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway; [Haus-Reve, Silje] Int Res Inst Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway",,"Gjelsvik, M (通讯作者)，Stavanger Innovat Ctr, Int Res Inst Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway.",,"Haus-Reve, Silje/AAC-4213-2019","Haus-Reve, Silje/0000-0002-1801-4596",,,,,19,0,0,0,14,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,464,475,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200036,0

A structured questionnaire contended questions related to measures taken to overcome the impacts of the world economic crisis and was completed by 100 hotels in Slovakia. The agglomerate non-hierarchical cluster analysis was used to set the strategies taken and Spearman's correlation coefficient to assess their influence on hotels' revenues, costs, profits, competitiveness, number of guests and occupancy rate. As the most effective we identified the progressive strategy, which combines cost-cutting measures not effecting employees, measures aimed at market development and investments.

If competences are used in combating money laundering and terrorism financing, question becomes even more complex and delicate. Bank operators are at forefront in combating financial crimes, so training activity to them addressed could be a strategic tool if designed - but especially evaluated - promoting knowledge retention and preventing or limiting knowledge leakage. This paper aims to review some training evaluation models to figure out which would be most effective, considering training programs on anti-money laundering and combating terrorism financing in banks. Design/methodology/approach - Reviewing training evaluation models will allow to making comments on their potentialities in promoting knowledge retention and limitation of knowledge leakage in bank operators. To achieve this goal, we will apply a deductive approach to obtaining information from extant literature over the years engaged in study and criticism of training evaluation models. These information will be organized in order to rank reviewed models according to criteria based on the features that should have an effective training evaluation model in theme of anti-money laundering and combating terrorism financing in banks. Originality/value - In this work, a different point of view on training evaluation is proposed, considering the field of anti-money laundering and combating terrorism financing in a particular type of organisation such as banks. Practical implications - This paper calls for an increased use of the evaluation of training programs in organizations, in the hope that it becomes an established practice, especially in banking sector and with reference to issues such as combating money laundering and terrorism financing, which go beyond mere business borders involving security and stability of entire economic system.","Univ LUM Jean Monnet, Bari, Italy",Lum Jean Monnet University,"La Torre, M (通讯作者)，Univ LUM Jean Monnet, SS 100 Km 18, Bari, Italy.",,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,6,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,606,618,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200047,0

Based on studies of phenotype, the citron group (Citrus medica) is supposedly low in genetic diversity compared to mandarins and pummelos. To assess the diversity of the citron group we analyzed the molecular polymorphism of nuclear and cytoplasmic genetic markers and the variation in composition of essential oils from leaves and peels of 24 varieties of citron or apparent hybrids of citron. Our results demonstrate that the citron group has a relatively high allelic diversity, probably due to multiple introductions of different varieties. Self-fertilization was the mode of reproduction which most frequently led to the development of commercial varieties with specific aromas and flavors, such as the cultivar 'Corsican', a putative 'Common Poncire' self-crossed hybrid. However, some varieties appeared to be interspecific hybrids related to citron but only by the male parent. This varietal diversity was probably favored by spreading seeds to extend the cultivation of citron in Mediterranean countries. The chemical diversity does not always correspond to genetic diversity but nevertheless reveals specific profiles associated with some genotypes.","[Luro, Francois; Costantino, Gilles; Tur, Isabelle] Inst Natl Rech Agron INRA, Unite Rech 1103, GEQA Genet & Ecophysiol Qualite Agrumes Stn, San Giuliano, France; [Venturini, Nicolas; Paolini, Julien; Costa, Jean] Univ Corse, Lab Chim Prod Nat, Ctr Natl Rech Sci CNRS, UMR 6134, Corte, France; [Ollitrault, Patrick] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, UMR AGAP, Montpellier, France",INRAE; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Engineering & Systems Sciences (INSIS); Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD,"Luro, F (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Rech Agron INRA, Unite Rech 1103, GEQA Genet & Ecophysiol Qualite Agrumes Stn, San Giuliano, France.",luro@corse.inra.fr,"Ollitrault, Patrick/HLQ-0557-2023","Ollitrault, Patrick/0000-0002-9456-5517",,,,,18,0,0,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,125,133,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600012,0

The monitoring of the sites included on the UNESCO World Heritage List can be performed based on Earth Observation (EO) data. Nowadays, remote sensing is an excellent monitoring tool due to the recently launched satellite missions that enable the acquisition of very high resolution optical data (with an information content similar to aerial imagery) together with a wider offer of spectral bands. Not only the development of remote sensing sensors is impressive, but also the creation of new synthetic aperture radar interferometric (InSAR) techniques that enable the ground deformation/displacement monitoring up to a few millimeters, based on multi-temporal series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. In 2003, UNESCO and the European Space Agency (ESA) signed the Open Initiative on the Use of Space Technologies to Support the World Heritage Convention that has the goal to protect, monitor, document, present and share the World Heritage sites. In this context, the term space technologies refers mainly to Earth Observation and secondly to other technologies such as navigation, positioning, communication, etc. In accordance with the Open Initiative, the study aimed at monitoring the Historic Centre of Sighisoara, a cultural heritage site inscribed on the World Heritage List in 1999 due to its architectural and urban monuments that were built starting with the 13th century. The results provide the Romanian National Commission for UNESCO and the assisting responsible authorities a support for informed decisions and may represent the foundation of a pilot monitoring service for the Romanian natural and cultural heritage sites inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Previous studies have shown that, when grafted with a variety citrus doubled diploid (4x) 'Rangpur' lime rootstock is more tolerant to drought stress than the respective diploid (2x). In the present study, we characterized the water deficit tolerance in 2x and 4x 'Rangpur' lime seedlings. Water deficit was applied respectively for 21 days, followed by recovery irrigation. Physiological and biochemical parameters were measured periodically during the experiment and samples were collected for biochemical analysis. Doubled diploid seedlings were showed to be more water deficit tolerant than 2x. Water deficit caused a greater reduction in stomatal conductance in 2x compared to 4x.

Analyses of the activity of enzymes involved in detoxification process suggest that the better tolerance of 4x genotypes may be related to better scavenging of reactive oxygen species.","[Oliveira, Tahise M.; Micheli, Fabienne] Univ Estadual Santa Cruz, Ilheus, Bahia, Brazil; [Maserti, Elena B.] CNR, Ist Protez Piante, Dipartimento Sci Bioagroalimentari, Florence, Italy; [Navarro, Luis; Ollitrault, Patrick] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Moncada, Spain; [Talon, Manuel; Morillon, Raphael] IVIA, Ctr Genom, Moncada, Spain; [Oliveira, Tahise M.; Micheli, Fabienne; Ollitrault, Patrick; Morillon, Raphael] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agronom Dev CIRAD, UMR AGAP, Montpellier, France; [Oliveira, Tahise M.; Gesteira, Abelmon da S.] Embrapa Mandioca & Fruticultura, Cruz Das Almas, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA); CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA),"Oliveira, TM (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Santa Cruz, Campus Soane Nazare, Ilheus, Bahia, Brazil.",tmaga21b@gmail.com,"Talon, Manuel/C-8540-2014; Ollitrault, Patrick/HLQ-0557-2023; Micheli, Fabienne/AAL-9895-2021; da Silva Gesteira, Abelmon/I-2136-2013","Talon, Manuel/0000-0003-4291-9333; da Silva Gesteira, Abelmon/0000-0002-7590-0455; Micheli, Fabienne/0000-0002-9031-362X; Ollitrault, Patrick/0000-0002-9456-5517; Maserti, Biancaelena/0000-0003-2872-2235; Morillon, Raphael/0000-0001-6762-1715",,,,,14,1,1,1,7,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1393,1397,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600176,0

The minimum wage is, however, associated with divergent views. The Visegrad countries, which together joined the EU in 2004, have introduced statutory minimum wages at the national level, but they differ in some of their conditions. The article discusses the development of the minimum wage during the period 2004 - 2015, a period in which the countries were hit by the classical economic cycle. Since one of the goals of the minimum wage is to ensure a decent life for its recipients, governments take into account the consumer price level in modifying the minimum wage. With the exception of Poland, a decline in the real minimum wage occurred, at least in some years, in the remaining countries. The longest running and also the largest decline in real minimum wage can be observed in the Czech Republic, in which nominal minimum wage has stagnated in the years 2009 - 2013. Due to the stagnation of the minimum wage, the Czech Republic also dropped in the rankings of the minimum wage in terms of purchasing standards from pole position in 2004 to last place in 2015.","[Pavelka, Tomas] Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Pavelka, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",pavelkat@vse.cz,,,,,,,9,1,1,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1255,1261,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000119,0

The in vitro tissue culture techniques can overcome some of these limitations. In the present work, this methodology was applied to the study of salt and osmotic stress conditions on 'Carrizo' citrange. The stress conditions were generated by adding either NaCl or polyethylene glycol, to the culture medium. Micropropagated shoots, growing under salt-or osmotic-stress, shown symptoms of leaf damage very similar to those found in intact plants, which confirmed the incidence of the imposed stress on plant physiology. In whole plants, it has been reported that physiological responses to water and salt stress are essentially identical; in the opposite, in shoots cultured in vitro, levels of stress markers such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline increased only under water deficiency but not under elevated salt conditions. Differences were also observed in the hormonal regulation of the shoots subjected to each abiotic stress. Abscisic acid concentration increased in shoots grown under osmotic stress conditions whereas no differences with the controls were observed in salt-stressed ones. It can be concluded that, at least when culture in vitro, citrus roots are necessary for the perception and signaling of the salt stress conditions. On the contrary, the presence of this organ is not necessary to modulate the response of shoots to osmotic stress.","[Perez Clemente, Rosa M.; Montoliu, Almudena; Vives-Peris, Vicente; Munoz Espinoza, Valeria; Zandalinas, Sara I.; Gomez-Cadenas, Aurelio] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Ciencies Agr & Medi Nat, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Gómez-Cadenas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Ciencies Agr & Medi Nat, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",aurelio.gomez@uji.es,"Vives-Peris, Vicente/L-5342-2019; Zandalinas, Sara I/AAH-1075-2019; Gomez-Cadenas, Aurelio/K-6084-2012; Perez-Clemente, Rosa M/A-2291-2015","Vives-Peris, Vicente/0000-0002-9882-7297; Zandalinas, Sara I/0000-0002-1256-9371;",,,,,16,0,0,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1371,1377,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600173,0

The transfer via pollen of transgenes to cross-compatible cultivars is deemed to be the greatest source for environmental exposure. In this work, three different citrus genotypes carrying the uidA (GUS) tracer marker gene (pollen donors) and a non-GM self-incompatible contiguous citrus genotype (recipient) were used in conditions allowing natural entomophilous pollination to occur. The examination of 603 to 2990 seeds per year showed unexpectedly low frequencies (0.17-2.86%) of transgene flow. Paternity analyses of the progeny of subsets of recipient plants using 10 microsatellite (SSR) loci demonstrated a higher mating competence of trees from another non-GM pollen source population that greatly limited the mating chance of the contiguous cross-compatible and flowering-synchronized transgenic pollen source. This mating superiority could be explained by much higher pollen competition capacity of the non-GM genotypes, as was confirmed through mixed-hand pollinations, indicating that pollen competition strongly contributed to transgene confinement. This is the first study on transgene flow in citrus. It provides crucial information on the safety and field performance of GM citrus that can serve as a basis for further field trials and as a guide for (case-by-case) regulatory policies.","[Pons, Elsa; Navarro, Antonio; Ollitrault, Patrick; Pena, Leandro] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain; [Ollitrault, Patrick] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, UPR Ameliorat Genet Especes Multiplicat Vegetat, Montpellier, France",Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA); CIRAD,"Peña, L (通讯作者)，Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain.",lpenya@ibmcp.csic.es,"Peña, Leandro/F-9089-2014; Ollitrault, Patrick/HLQ-0557-2023; Pons Bayarri, Elsa/J-5403-2016","Ollitrault, Patrick/0000-0002-9456-5517; Pons Bayarri, Elsa/0000-0002-2736-9276",,,,,21,0,0,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,711,718,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600089,0

Analysing ten investment projects revealed patterns in types, location, behaviour, interrelations of stakeholder groups and various effects caused by the project, which can be used to develop a versatile methodology. The methodology allows us to calculate the impact of a project on various ranges and sections of its stakeholders and environment. We distinguished not only the most commonly analysed effects associated with the project objectives but also displacement effects, which relate to the movement of the stakeholders in and out of the project area. We also took into account the substitution effect, in which one group of stakeholders replaces another, and multiplier effects, which involve changes in income, supply volume, land value and synergy. Notably, some effects, like pull or leakage, are detrimental to the stakeholders, but the impact depends on the study's area and scope.","[Pylak, Korneliusz] Lublin Univ Technol, Nadbystrzycka 38d St, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland",Lublin University of Technology,"Pylak, K (通讯作者)，Lublin Univ Technol, Nadbystrzycka 38d St, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland.",korneliusz.pylak@pollub.pl,"Pylak, Korneliusz/A-7270-2013","Pylak, Korneliusz/0000-0001-7812-1281",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1365,1374,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000130,0

We elaborate the construct of optional capital, viewed as the expected outcome of a successful mobilization of the other intangibles. Optional capital measures the (i) sustainability and (ii) potential benefits of the latent capabilities, i.e. the further primary capabilities that the organization has the opportunity to develop and that, although possibly useless at present, may become crucial in the future. We argue that the organizations with a better optional capital portfolio are likely to display higher levels of organizational resilience and long-term competitive excellence in turbulent business environments. Design/methodology/approach - We develop the Optional Capital View (OCV) on the basis of a qualitative research exploring the Italian community of the Contratti di Rete (business network contracts). This community addresses today's turbulent economic scenario through innovative business networking. Thanks to the collaboration of this community, we selected and investigated 8 exemplary networks, involving 134 firms. Originality/value - Our findings suggest that optional capital can be continuously generated and regenerated only through the mobilization of the primary level of the intangibles, including knowledge capital, social capital, institutional capital, and primary capabilities. The healthy co-mobilization and interplay of these intangibles, thanks to the pivotal role of dynamic capabilities, allows the generation of a portfolio of options on the organization's future capabilities. Our model may have relevant implications for the sister disciplines of strategic management, organization studies and business evaluation. Practical implications - Our analysis on the interviews and texts collected during our research allowed us to achieve an operationalizable definition of the construct of optional capital and its likely antecedents. This may contribute to the development of tools, such as guidelines, questionnaires and indicators, aimed to better understand and evaluate the role of intangible resources and capabilities in today's scenario. Such tools would be useful both for firm leaders (entrepreneurs and managers) and business evaluation professionals (banks, venture capitalist, etc.)","[Ricciardi, Francesca; Rossignoli, Cecilia; Campedelli, Bettina] Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, I-37100 Verona, Italy",University of Verona,"Ricciardi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, Via Artigliere 19, I-37100 Verona, Italy.",,"Ricciardi, Francesca/P-6330-2014; rossignoli, cecilia/K-1196-2015","Ricciardi, Francesca/0000-0002-0645-7031; rossignoli, cecilia/0000-0002-4476-4112",,,,,30,0,0,0,19,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,363,374,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200028,0

The standard of services represents the extent of quality of satisfying the needs of domestic as well as foreign visitors in a certain time-limited period. This whole process is measured by certain indexes in tourism. The obtained findings are subsequently implemented into statistical surveys of tourism industry by individual interested authorities of tourism sector. This enables consequently to evaluate total contribution of collective tourist accommodation establishments to the country's economy. The paper deals with the efficiency of domestic tourism. The assessment criterion in this case is the index of the number of tourists (domestic and foreign) and the length of stay in collective tourist accommodation establishments in selected EU countries with the accent on Slovakia. Secondary data taken from Eurostat database have been analyzed by the method of research-desk. Furthermore, the data have been verified by the methods of higher statistics.

Project team performed a quantitative research among Czech Top 100 companies to examine current status of implementation of innovation measurement system. Based on this research methodology for both innovation measurement and company innovation potential was set up. Key output of this research was determination of complex company innovation index. Methodology in question was qualified by Ministry of industry experts to be adopted as an unbiased testing method for the measurement of innovation status of Czech companies.

It enables to choose among 11 similarity measures, three linkage methods of hierarchical clustering, and uses six evaluation criteria based on the mutability and the entropy. Some of the criteria were constructed for comparison of different cluster approaches and some for determining the optimal number of clusters. The package contains both the main function, which covers the whole clustering process, and a set of subsidiary functions, which allow computing only a part of clustering process, e.g. a proximity matrix, or evaluation of given cluster solution.

Abscission enables both vegetative and reproductive organs to be shed in response to developmental, hormonal and environmental cues. From an evolutionary point of view, abscission is a highly favorable process that has several advantages such as fruit and seed dispersal as well as the shedding of no longer needed, infected, damaged or senescent organs. In an agricultural context, however, abscission is a major limiting factor for crop productivity. In this regard, understanding the regulation of abscission is an important phenomenon for the citrus fruit industry. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying abscission would help to regulate crop production and improve current cultural and management practices such as mechanical harvesting of fruit or removal of undesirable excess fruit production. In addition, further molecular research on abscission could help to elucidate new molecular markers to improve genetic breeding. This review highlights the current status of research on genes specifically associated with organ abscission that have been uncovered so far in citrus.","[Tadeo, Francisco R.; Agusti, Javier; Merelo, Paz; Estornell, Leandro H.; Cercos, Manuel; Terol, Javier; Domingo, Concha; Talon, Manuel] IVIA, Ctr Genom, Valencia, Spain; [Agusti, Javier] Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, Oxford, England; [Merelo, Paz] European Mol Biol Lab, Dev Biol Unit, D-69012 Heidelberg, Germany",University of Oxford; European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL),"Tadeo, FR (通讯作者)，IVIA, Ctr Genom, Valencia, Spain.",tadeo_fra@gva.es,"Terol, Javier/H-6401-2013; Talon, Manuel/C-8540-2014; Agusti, Javier/AAZ-1272-2020; Cremades, Paz Merelo/B-8001-2019; Tadeo, Francisco/C-8977-2014; Domingo, Concha/D-3372-2012","Terol, Javier/0000-0003-3345-0078; Talon, Manuel/0000-0003-4291-9333; Agusti, Javier/0000-0002-6459-2928; Cremades, Paz Merelo/0000-0002-1301-7835; Tadeo, Francisco/0000-0002-5839-4255; Hueso Estornell, Leandro/0009-0003-6266-3846; Domingo, Concha/0000-0002-7204-7591",,,,,58,3,3,1,10,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1189,1195,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.151,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600151,0

Three traditions interact in UKIP's thinking: the Eurosceptic tradition, the conservative tradition and the populist tradition. This article examines how the party is positioned in relation to each of these traditions and how they have been incorporated and modified into a distinctive narrative and as responses to dilemmas. It appears that UKIP's populist form of Euroscepticism stands in contrast to the elite-based form of Euroscepticism embodied by the Conservative Party - to which UKIP is considered as a threat. The article also addresses the implications of the rise of UKIP for the Conservative Party.

Management studies usually assume that business processes change primarily as a consequence of top management teams' decisions. By integrating both micro- and macro-level evolution and incorporating multiple level of analysis, this paper aims at shedding lights on new empirical methods in business processes' exploitation and knowledge transfer. In order to open business processes' black box a shift from the conventional routine-as-entity view to the practice view of routines is required. The latter theoretical approach focuses on routines' enactment and dynamics on a day-to-day basis providing an explanation on how processes are produced and reproduced over time. The practice view also implies that knowledge is not a static entity given the continuous interrelationship between and within the different levels of the organization. In particular the habit-individual represents our micro- level of analysis while the routine-group and routine-organization constitute our higher levels of investigation. Design/methodology/approach - To answer the research question the paper has been designed as a narrative case study. Assuming both the practice-based view and the multi-level co-evolution lenses, we applied an agent-based model to a real company operating in the service industry adopting a longitudinal analysis approach consisting exclusively of primary data. Originality/value - The methodological approach followed allows us to validate with a real case study the hypotheses and conjectures embedded in the computational model defined. Indeed while a number of scholars have developed conceptual models of business processes' evolution, few of these attempted to validate their results using actual data from organizations. The difficulty relies to the choice of the variable used to depict organizational change and knowledge transfer. Routines' variation while consistent with the entity view of firm evolution, provides only a partial interpretation of the underlying phenomenon. The longitudinal approach followed in this work, on the other hand, gives the opportunity to unpack the complexity behind emergence, development and extinction of business processes over time. Practical implications - Main results suggest that the degree of managerial control exerted, the feedback scheme applied and group interactions' mechanisms are the main determinants behind business processes' exploitation and knowledge reproduction.","Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Studies Business Govt Philosophy, I-00133 Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Uli, V (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Studies Business Govt Philosophy, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",,,,,,,,43,1,1,0,6,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1642,1653,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200126,0

Furthermore, this paper shows how corporate criminal liability may not incentivize a Too Big to Jail firm to invest in internal controls and may even attempt to subsidize an employees' criminal activity. In the presence of Too Big to Jail firms, prosecutors should shift resources toward prosecutions of individual managers, so they bear a substantial personal risk from dealing dishonestly.

Amsterdam, North-Holland, 1985) alternative approach to welfare economics can be used to shed light on the wellbeing of very young children. More specifically, we estimate versions of the three key relations from his framework using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) Survey. Our primary models provide evidence that skills are related to involvement in cognate activities with a parent, indicating a behavioural relationship between capabilities and activities which is not explicit in Sen's original set-up, but is key to the development and happiness of young children. A second set of models indicates that the daily activities of very young children are related to household income but that in some cases the association with parenting inputs is stronger. Thirdly, we report happiness regressions for the children which seem to suggest that shopping and reading are valued but that their distribution is limited in some cases-probably either by household income or parental education. Across the piece, we find that the number of siblings is negatively related to activity involvement with parents, as hypothesised by Becker, but positively related to everyday, motor and social skills. Combined with evidence from other studies, we conclude that the capability approach provides a useful framework for understanding the economics of wellbeing across the entire life course.","[Anand, Paul] Open Univ, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England; [Anand, Paul; Roope, Laurence] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Anand, Paul] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Anand, Paul] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Open University - UK; University of Oxford; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Columbia University,"Anand, P (通讯作者)，Open Univ, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England.;Anand, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.;Anand, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.;Anand, P (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",pa2486@columbia.edu; laurence.roope@dph.ox.ac.uk,,"Roope, Laurence/0000-0001-9098-9331; Anand, Paul/0000-0002-7701-6903",Leverhulme Trust,Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"The authors wish to thank Conal Smith, Ron Smith, Peter Hammond, Vasiliki Totsika, Sarah Cattan, Mariacristina De Nardi as well as participants of Royal Economic Society and OECD-universities research conferences and university seminars in Oxford, York, Sheffield and Turin.

Analyses of publically available statistical data, extracted from the Eurostat service at a European level will allow for a comparison of various indicators which influence the performance of the railway systems from an infrastructure and operational perspectives. The analyses will also allow identifying key performance indicators for the accurate assessment of the rail systems. The paper will highlight case studies for various parameters which are important to stakeholders of the railways, including infrastructure managers, rail operators, policy makers and the end users.

This work explores transportation benefits from the consumer's perspective to accessibility as a key benefit generated by any transportation project. To assess the full benefits of transportation project implementation for various consumers and calculate the improvement in accessibility, it is best to use Activity-Based Models (ABM). ABMs have two important advantages for equity analysis, which have not been utilized in the literature so far: first, ability to analyze results by various groups of the population; second, these models can utilize the Activity Based Accessibility (ABA) measure to estimate the overall benefits from transport investments and policies. The ABA measure allows one person to have different accessibilities for different choice situations, depending on his/her characteristics. We suggest including social and spatial factors in social welfare assessment by introducing the concept of accessibility gains to key social activities. Specifically, it is suggested to incorporate subjective well-being consideration into a new evaluation framework Equity Benefit Analysis (EBA). we use an alternative measure, Subjective Value of Accessibility gains (SVOA), which is based on the ABM accessibility measure as well as on Subjective Well Being (SWB) measure, as the key benefit taken into account in the evaluation process. The SVOA is not intended to replace the current practice of analyzing equity by comparing various impacts on different groups of the population, but can aid by providing policymakers with a single measure advancing both equity and efficiency considerations and facilitating comparison among alternatives. Initial case study results indicate the SVOA can show higher benefits to policies focusing on the needs of vulnerable social groups that compared traditional measures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The finding of near-unit-root effects in the inflation and inflation expectations series motivates the use of a local-to-unity specification of the inflation process that enables us to test whether the data are generated by locally non-stationary or stationary processes. Thus, we test, rather than assume, stationarity of near-unit-root processes. The paper combines the concept of localities in the underlying time series, such as those that may exist in the sample but not in the population, with cointegration analysis which permits the distinction between short-run and long-run structures. Thus, we examine possible in-sample departures from rationality both in the short run and the long run. Our empirical results indicate that the rational expectations hypothesis holds in the long run, while forecasters adjust their expectations slowly in the short run. This finding lends support to the hypothesis that the persistence of inflation comes from the dynamics of expectations.","[Brissimis, Sophocles N.] Univ Piraeus, Dept Econ, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou St, Piraeus 18534, Greece; [Migiakis, Petros M.] Bank Greece, Econ Anal & Res Dept, 21 El Venizelou Ave, Athens 10250, Greece",University of Piraeus; European Central Bank; Bank of Greece,"Migiakis, PM (通讯作者)，Bank Greece, Econ Anal & Res Dept, 21 El Venizelou Ave, Athens 10250, Greece.",sofbris@unipi.gr; pmigiakis@bankofgreece.gr,"Migiakis, Petros/AAZ-6611-2020","Migiakis, Petros/0000-0002-6038-876X; Brissimis, Sophocles/0000-0002-4740-4016",,,,,40,4,5,0,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Utilizing a unique data set from producers in New York, the authors examine the extent of differential purchasing and sales patterns for small-scale direct agriculture (SDA) producers. The supplemental data are integrated into a regional input-output model to assess the total effects and distributional implications of equivalent policies targeted to agriculture sectors. The authors demonstrate that SDA producers have different expenditure patterns than other agricultural producers and, for equivalent policy shocks targeted toward agriculture industry expansion, have lower total employment and output impacts but higher effects on labor income and total value added than non-SDA producers. The results underscore the importance of collecting appropriate data for analysis and outline the local economic benefits of small-scale local food system participants.","[Schmit, Todd M.] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY USA; [Mansury, Yuri] Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, Ithaca, NY USA; [Jablonski, Becca B.

The subsidy takes the form of a fixed premium on top of the electricity price, and, therefore, investment is subject to electricity price uncertainty. We show that the risk of a permanent retraction (provision) of a subsidy increases (decreases) the incentive to invest, yet lowers (raises) the amount of installed capacity, and that this result is more pronounced as the size of the subsidy increases. Additionally, we show that increasing the number of policy interventions lowers the expected value of a subsidy and the size of the project. Furthermore, we illustrate that, although an increase in the size of a subsidy lowers the relative value of the stepwise investment strategy, the expected value of a lumpy investment strategy is still lower than that of stepwise investment.","[Chronopoulos, Michail] Univ Brighton, Sch Comp Engn & Math, Brighton BN2 4AT, E Sussex, England; [Hagspiel, Verena; Fleten, Stein-Erik] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway",University of Brighton; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Chronopoulos, M (通讯作者)，Sch Comp Engn & Math, Cockcroft Bldg,Lewes Rd, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, England.;Chronopoulos, M (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business & Management Sci, Bergen, Norway.",M.Chronopoulos@brighton.ac.uk,"Fleten, Stein-Erik/AAE-2093-2020","Fleten, Stein-Erik/0000-0001-6462-0266; chronopoulos, michail/0000-0002-3858-2021",Research Council of Norway [228811],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"The authors would like to thank Svein-Arne Persson as well as Lars Hegnes Sendstad for their valuable comments that helped improve the paper.

They stress how changing coalitions of interest groups within particular states and changing functional needs of states give rise to new international agreements. While these approaches remain valuable, they only imperfectly encompass a new set of important causal relations. We now live in the world that trade built - a world where greater interdependence has major consequences both for actors' interests and their ability to pursue those interests. A new body of work, which we have called the 'new interdependence' explains how these transformations are playing out. The new interdependence stresses a structural vision of international politics based on rule overlap between different national jurisdictions, which leads to clashes over whose rules should apply when. This not only generates tensions, but also opportunity structures that may help actors to better shape potential solutions to these clashes. However, some actors will have greater access to these opportunity structures, and hence greater influence and bargaining strength - than others. These three factors - rule overlap, opportunity structures and power asymmetries - provide the basis for a compelling understanding of international politics.","[Farrell, Henry] George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Farrell, Henry] George Washington Univ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Newman, Abraham] Georgetown Univ, Edmund A Walsh Sch Foreign Serv, BMW Ctr German & European Studies, Washington, DC USA",George Washington University; George Washington University; Georgetown University,"Farrell, H (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA.;Farrell, H (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",,,,,,,,100,76,81,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Using the findings of the empirical analysis, the paper shows that EU institutions' repositioning cannot easily be ascribed to the mechanisms that are typically at play in international negotiations, namely exogenous pressures and internalization of new beliefs through persuasion. Instead, the paper argues that a more nuanced and complete explanation of the relaxation of opposition to the change in the program strategy requires taking into account the institutional and temporal dimensions of the Troika negotiations. Specifically, the paper shows that the evolution of European actors' preferences was shaped by the layering of new crisis management rules into the machinery of the monetary union. Layering allowed political actors in favor of the status quo achieving their preferences under changed external circumstances.","[Moschella, Manuela] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Int Polit Econ, Pisa, Italy; [Moschella, Manuela] Ctr Int Governance Innovat, Waterloo, ON, Canada",Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa,"Moschella, M (通讯作者)，Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Int Polit Econ, Pisa, Italy.;Moschella, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Int Governance Innovat, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",manuela.moschella@sns.it,,,,,,,70,30,31,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Lack of landfill capacity and a growing scarcity of natural resources have lead to severe ELV reuse and recovery targets in the European Union (EU). This paper examines the main influencing parameters affecting the amount and composition of ELV waste originating from passenger cars to be treated in Authorized Treatment Facilities (ATF5). Moreover the effect of a changing number, composition and life span of passenger cars on the ability to meet the ambitious EU ELV Directive 2000/53/EC targets in 2015 is examined for Belgium. Using system dynamics, the aforementioned changing parameters are studied from 1990 and projected to 2030. The model results show that the total annual weight of ELV waste to be reused and recycled in Belgium is expected to grow over the coming years despite the economic downturn of 2008 and its effect on GDP growth. Moreover it shows that Belgium can sustainably achieve the ambitious EU ELV Directive 2000/53/EC targets in 2015 and thereafter if it continues to invest in waste treatment of ELV plastics. The availability of higher amounts of ELV plastics proves to be favourable to trigger investments in their reusing and recycling. We demonstrate that this can be realized by reducing export of discarded passenger cars, shortening the life span of passenger cars or shortening the time for investing in additional plastic recovery.

The study relies on Danish and Swedish data (N = 1808). I test both the direct impact of personality on EU attitudes and personality's moderating impact on framing effects. I find that extraversion and openness positively correlate with positive EU attitudes, while people scoring high on neuroticism tend to support the EU less. Furthermore, I find that personality moderates different EU frames. Individuals with certain personality traits are more influenced by framing effects than others, while positive and negative frames also are perceived differently according to personal predispositions.

To address this gap, the current study uses spatial metrics, a set of methods traditionally used for studying changes in the spatial structure of landscapes, which are translated into the domain of transport planning. It examines how spatial metrics can be integrated into Land Use Transport strategy-making, and how useful they are according to the practitioners' perceptions. A Light Rail Transit corridor in Granada (Spain) provides the empirical focus of this research. Land use characteristics such as: land use mixing, land use diversity and green areas connectivity were successfully studied using spatial metrics, and they were used to map three Land Use Transport strategies: (i) proximity dynamics and non-motorised modes; (ii) modal shift from cars to Light Rail Transit system; (iii) shared spaces between motorised and non-motorised modes. Practitioners perceived that spatial metrics could improve the Land Use Transport strategy-making process in comparison with traditional methods used in practice. However, certain shortcomings related to the usability of spatial metrics are also highlighted and discussed. This study concludes with a reflection on research challenges for adapting spatial metrics to transport practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet only few studies have reported the impact of transit access on commercial property value. This paper presents empirical evidence from Wuhan, China, to enrich the knowledge in the subject area. Spatial autoregressive models were employed to estimate the commercial value capture, based on 676 observations along Wuhan's metro rail line through the main business districts. Value appreciation was discovered within the 400 m radius of road network distance from Metro stations. The transit access premiums present as two tiers: 16.7% for the 0-100 m core area and approximately 8.0% within the 100-400 m radius. The result demonstrates the potential benefit of adopting value capture and optimising TOD planning to support sustainable urban rail transit investment. Amid rapid urbanisation in China, the evidence reported here could help better inform cities, across the developing world and beyond, of the benefits of adopting rail transit-based policy.

However, the standard method of estimating the shape parameter (the Pareto tail index) of this distribution-the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), also known as the Hill estimator-is non-robust, in the sense that it is very sensitive to extreme observations, data contamination or model deviation. In recent years, a number of robust estimators for the Pareto tail index have been proposed, which correct the deficiency of the MLE. However, little is known about the performance of these estimators in small-sample setting, which often occurs in practice. This paper investigates the small-sample properties of the most popular robust estimators for the Pareto tail index, including the optimal B-robust estimator (Victoria-Feser and Ronchetti in Can J Stat 22:247-258, 1994), the weighted maximum likelihood estimator (Dupuis and Victoria-Feser in Can J Stat 34:639-658, 2006), the generalized median estimator (Brazauskas and Serfling in Extremes 3:231-249, 2001), the partial density component estimator (Vandewalle et al. in Comput Stat Data Anal 51:6252-6268, 2007), and the probability integral transform statistic estimator (PITSE) (Finkelstein et al. in N Am Actuar J 10:1-10, 2006). Monte Carlo simulations show that the PITSE offers the desired compromise between ease of use and power to protect against outliers in the small-sample setting.","[Brzezinski, Michal] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Brzezinski, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland.",mbrzezinski@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Brzezinski, Michal/N-3365-2013","Brzezinski, Michal/0000-0002-7704-3805",Polish National Science Centre [2011/01/B/HS4/02809],Polish National Science Centre,I would like to thank two anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions.

The average size of the portfolios is small by international standards, and their concentration by firm has been growing after the 2008 crisis. The average duration of investments is rather short (about 3.7 years), and less than 10 % of them target firms that are both young and innovative. PE investments by Italian fund managers are still underdeveloped, relative to traditional bank credit. We find that being participated by a PE fund increases the amount of credit obtained by the target firm and the number of bank relationships, whereas it leaves the cost of credit unaffected. The effect of the PE fund participation is exclusively related to the entry of the fund in the firm's capital, as it fades away as soon as the fund exits from the capital, thus suggesting a weak signalling role of PE towards banks.","[Coin, Daniele] Bank Italy, Econ Res Div, Torino Branch, Via Arsenale 8, I-10121 Turin, Italy; [Vacca, Valerio] Bank Italy, Bari Branch, Econ Res Div, Corso Cavour 4, I-70121 Bari, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Coin, D (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Econ Res Div, Torino Branch, Via Arsenale 8, I-10121 Turin, Italy.",daniele.coin@bancaditalia.it; valerio.vacca@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We find that there are at least three shifts in the core inflation series. The findings help detect the exact dates of the shifts between different inflation regimes and the duration of each regime, which should be important information in evaluating the success of past economic policies in fighting inflation.

Using a combined stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and two-stage dynamic panel data approach, we explore these two issues of magnitude and model for 55 countries over the period 1980 to 2010. Our central estimates indicate that in the short-run, 100% energy efficiency improvement is followed by 90% rebound in energy consumption, but in the long-run it leads to a 136% decrease in energy consumption. Overall, our estimated cross-country RE magnitudes indicate the need to consider or account for RE when energy forecasts and policy measures are derived from potential energy efficiency savings.","[Adetutu, Morakinyo O.; Glass, Anthony J.; Weyman-Jones, Thomas G.] Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Adetutu, MO (通讯作者)，Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England.",M.O.Adetutu@lboro.ac.uk,,"Adetutu, Morakinyo/0000-0002-0402-7847; Glass, Anthony/0000-0002-5984-7666","School of Business and Economics, Loughborough University","School of Business and Economics, Loughborough University","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the School of Business and Economics, Loughborough University.

The study employs a cointegration framework by using export and import data over the period of 2003:Q1-2014:Q2. Results show that gross domestic product is the key determinant of bilateral freight flows, indicating that real income of a trading partner is a driving force of the bilateral freight flows between the US and China. In examining the sensitivities of the bilateral trade flows, air freight flows are found to be more responsive to a real income change than ocean freight flows. The bilateral exchange rate is a significant factor affecting the freight flows from China to the US, suggesting that a US dollar appreciation against the Chinese yuan increases the inflows of Chinese commodities to the US. The impacts of the bilateral exchange rate and transport cost are found to vary at industry and commodity levels. These findings support the importance of employing disaggregate data in the bilateral freight flow analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It argues that a process-oriented interpretation of the actorness concept can be used to compare the EU to both nation-states and international organizations at the same time. This makes it possible to examine the 'nature of the beast' in specific foreign policy contexts on empirical grounds. The case study analyses EU, US and ASEAN actorness in the IMF reform negotiations within the G20 framework.

To test this stipulation, I combine European Social Survey ( ESS) data on individual perceptions of immigrants for more than 25,000 individuals with macro-level data on the actual percentage of foreign-born citizens across 200 European regions.

In the context of transport networks, most studies have focused on vulnerability, the reduction in performance indicators given that a disruption occurs. This study presents and applies a method to explicitly account for exposure in identifying and evaluating link criticality in public transport networks. The proposed method is compared with conventional measures that lack exposure information. A criticality assessment is performed by accounting for the probability of a certain event occurring and the corresponding welfare loss. The methodology was applied for a multi-modal public transport network in the Netherlands where data concerning disruptions was available. The results expose the role of exposure in determining link criticality and overall network vulnerability. The findings demonstrate that disregarding exposure risks prioritizing links with high passenger volumes over links with a higher failure probability that are significantly more critical to network performance. The inclusion of exposure allows performing a risk analysis and has consequences on assessing mitigation measures and investment priorities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As such, the understanding on driver behavior and their travel choice is crucial to ensure the successful implementation of ADM strategies in alleviating traffic congestion, especially in city centres. This study aims to investigate the impact of traffic information dissemination via traffic images on driver travel choice and decision. A relationship of driver travel choice with respect to their perceived congestion level is developed by an integrated framework of genetic algorithm-fuzzy logic, being a new attempt in driver behavior modeling. Results show that drivers consider changing their travel choice when the perceived congestion level is medium, in which changing departure time and diverting to alternative roads are two popular choices. If traffic congestion escalates further, drivers are likely to cancel their trip. Shifting to public transport system is the least likely choice for drivers in an auto dependent city. These findings are important and useful to engineers as they are required to fully understand driver (user) sensitivity to traffic conditions so that relevant active travel demand management strategies could be implemented successfully. In addition, engineers could use the relationships established in this study to predict drivers' response under various traffic conditions when carrying out modeling and impact studies.

The parties form expectations based on possibly different beliefs about the profile of the ideal policies for voters. The model has a Nash equilibrium only under the knife-edge condition that the two parties' beliefs about the ideal policy for a random voter (i.e., a voter who is picked uniformly at random from the electorate) have equal medians; at the equilibrium they choose this median policy as their platforms. Approximate equilibria, defined as pairs of platforms that are almost best responses to each other, may exist even in the absence of a Nash equilibrium. We show that at the approximate equilibria, the parties adopt close platforms, and have opposite estimates about the random voter's ideal policy. We also show that if the policy space has several dimensions, and if the parties' beliefs are close enough, then typically approximate equilibria do not exist.","[Kikuchi, Kazuya] Tokyo Univ Sci, Fac Sci & Technol, 2641 Yamazaki, Noda, Chiba 2788510, Japan",Tokyo University of Science,"Kikuchi, K (通讯作者)，Tokyo Univ Sci, Fac Sci & Technol, 2641 Yamazaki, Noda, Chiba 2788510, Japan.",kazuya.kikuchi68@gmail.com,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan through the Global Center of Excellence (Global COE) Program","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan through the Global Center of Excellence (Global COE) Program","An earlier version of this paper is part of my PhD dissertation for Hitotsubashi University.

More than one quarter of the sample is interested in purchasing organic wine and willing to pay more for it. In this respect, organic production combined with a good communication strategy in order to increase the knowledge about its benefits can be a good marketing diversification strategy. Therefore, organic production seems to be a necessary (for at least 27% of people) but not sufficient condition in characterizing wine quality: it should be supported by an appropriate promotion of the product characteristics.","[Troiano, Stefania; Marangon, Francesco] Univ Udine, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Stat, I-33100 Udine, Italy; [Tempesta, Tiziano; Vecchiato, Daniel] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Terr & Sistemi Agroforestali, I-35100 Padua, Italy",University of Udine; University of Padua,"Vecchiato, D (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dipartimento Terr & Sistemi Agroforestali, I-35100 Padua, Italy.",daniel.vecchiato@unipd.it,"Vecchiato, Daniel/K-7766-2019; Tempesta, Tiziano/B-2507-2015; Vecchiato, Daniel/H-5592-2012; Marangon, Francesco/P-5554-2015","Vecchiato, Daniel/0000-0002-4652-3961; Vecchiato, Daniel/0000-0002-4652-3961; Marangon, Francesco/0000-0001-7519-2922; troiano, stefania/0000-0001-6198-5542",,,,,39,28,33,1,39,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2016,15.0,2.0,,,,,14,21,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,DS1TQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380384000002,0

We construct and simulate a dynamic model of a duopolistic industry in which firms' investments in capacity are constrained by the availability of credit. In such an industry, the dynamic interaction of credit limits and the competitive responses of firms turn out to be a powerful transmission mechanism by which the effects of shocks persist and are amplified. We show that a small, temporary shock to one firm's capacity can lead to its market exit, even if it is equally productive as the remaining incumbent. Consequently, if a recession is accompanied by a credit crunch, its cleansing effect might lead to monopolization of markets and welfare losses.","[Watzinger, Martin] Univ Munich, Akad Str 1, D-80799 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Watzinger, M (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Akad Str 1, D-80799 Munich, Germany.",martin.watzinger@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,"Watzinger, Martin/0000-0002-5192-0558",DFG [SFB TR 15]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB TR 15],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I am indebted to Ulrich Doraszelski for sharing his code and thank Matthias Doepke, Anna Gumpert, Iris Kesternich, Monika Piazessi, Martin Schneider, Monika Schnitzer, and Michele Tertilt for helpful suggestions.

One option is to separate cyclists from motorists through exclusive bicycle priority lanes. This practice is easily implemented in uncongested traffic. Enforcing bicycle lanes on congested roads may degenerate the network, making the idea very hard to sell both to the public and the traffic authorities. Inspired by Braess Paradox, we take an unorthodox approach to seeking latent misutilized capacity in the congested networks to be dedicated to exclusive bicycle lanes. The aim of this study is to tailor an efficient and practical method to large size urban networks. Hence, this paper appeals to policy makers in their quest to scientifically convince stakeholder that bicycle is not a secondary mode, rather, it can be greatly accommodated along with other modes even in the heart of the congested cities. In conjunction with the bicycle lane priority, other policy measures such as shared bicycle scheme, electric-bike, integration of public transport and bicycle are also discussed in this article. As for the mathematical methodology, we articulated it as a discrete bilevel mathematical programing. In order to handle the real networks, we developed a phased methodology based on Branch-and-Bound (as a solution algorithm), structured in a less intensive RAM manner. The methodology was tested on real size network of city of Winnipeg, Canada, for which the total of 30 road segments - equivalent to 2.77 km bicycle lanes - in the CBD were found.

The non-negative player axiom requires to assign a non-negative payoff to a player that belongs to coalitions with non-negative worth only. The axiom of addition invariance on bi-partitions requires that the payoff vector recommended by a value should not be affected by an identical change in worth of both a coalition and the complementary coalition. The nullified solidarity axiom requires that if a player who becomes null weakly loses (gains) from such a change, then every other player should weakly lose (gain) too. We study the consequence of imposing some of these axioms in addition to some classical axioms. It turns out that the resulting values or set of values have all in common to split efficiently the worth achieved by the grand coalition according to an exogenously given weight vector. As a result, we also obtain new characterizations of the equal division value.","[Beal, Sylvain] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRESE EA3190, F-25000 Besancon, France; [Casajus, Andre; Huettner, Frank] LSI Leipziger Spieltheoret Inst, Leipzig, Germany; [Casajus, Andre; Huettner, Frank] HHL Leipzig Grad Sch Management, Jahnallee 59, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Remila, Eric; Solal, Philippe] Univ St Etienne, CNRS, UMR 5824, GATE, Lyon St Etienne, France",Universite de Franche-Comte; HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Béal, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRESE EA3190, F-25000 Besancon, France.",sylvain.beal@univ-fcomte.fr; mail@casajus.de; mail@frankhuettner.de; eric.remila@univ-st-etienne.fr; philippe.solal@univ-st-etienne.fr,,"Huettner, Frank/0000-0002-5489-1334","National Agency for Research (ANR) [ANR-13-BSHS1-0010]; Mathematiques de la decision pour l'ingenierie physique et sociale (MODMAD) project; German Research Foundation (DFG) [CA 266/4-1, HU 2205/1-1]",National Agency for Research (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Mathematiques de la decision pour l'ingenierie physique et sociale (MODMAD) project; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors are grateful to an anonymous reviewer and participants and SING 9 conference for valuable comments.

The aim of this paper is to propose a new approach to measuring market power in the Italian Power Exchange (IPEX), explicitly considering transmission line congestion. We construct a new measure of the residual demand curve to disentangle unilateral market power from congestion rent for the main Italian generators during the period April 2004 to December 2007. In Italy, this period was one of stable transmission network structure. Following the approach of Wolak (2003, 2009), we measure the unilateral market power with the Lerner index (LI), computed as the inverse of the residual demand elasticity. In conclusion, the correct modeling of the residual demand curve including transmission congestions enables us to compute the zonal LI and therefore more accurately measure the market power when congestion occurs. Our results show that various generators exercise market power only in specific zones. These findings provide deeper understanding of market outcomes in the presence of congestion, suggesting appropriate policy directions for market surveillance and competition regulation.","[Bigerna, Simona; Bollino, Carlo Andrea; Polinori, Paolo] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Polinori, P (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.",paolo.polinori@unipg.it,"Polinori, Paolo/K-1281-2019","Polinori, Paolo/0000-0003-3477-965X; Bollino, Carlo Andrea/0000-0002-7751-7089; Bigerna, Simona/0000-0003-4880-6305",,,,,24,24,24,1,8,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,APR,2016,37.0,2.0,,,,,133,154,,10.5547/01956574.37.2.sbig,0.0,,,22,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DH3EO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372670500006,0

In this paper, we analyze the effect of a spell in public housing on age at first-time homeownership using the French Housing Survey. We use a pseudo-panel approach that takes into account the specificities of the local housing market, to derive individual tenure transitions from multiple cross-sections data, for the period 1979-2006. Using an IV strategy to control for a potential selection into public housing, we jointly estimate public housing tenancy and duration before first-time homeownership, and take into account unobserved heterogeneity. Our results indicate that a spell in public housing increases the hazard to homeownership, supporting the idea that, in France in the study period, the public housing policy provided an important pathway to homeownership.

Apart from static input-output (IO) models, environmentally extended IO analysis has resulted in dynamic IO models as well. Dynamic models are built of differential equations and, in the case of discrete models with the help of difference equations. The dynamic approach requires advanced mathematical skills especially in cases where the stability of the system under study is considered. In this paper we state some applied environmental models in discrete time based on dynamic IO analysis and we propose a computational approach in computer algebra system environments that investigates the extent and the nature of their stability.

Based on the basic CTM, four typical freeway control strategies consisting of non control, local ramp metering, coordinated ramp metering and global control are first formulated. Then the method of adjusting model parameters to the changed free-flow speeds is presented. Among the adjustments, an experimental function based on Fan and Seibold (2014) is proposed to change the jam density. Several useful measures are defined to estimate and compare the performances of different freeways. The following three main observations are obtained from numerical experiments. (a) With the gradually increasing FFS, the throughput of freeway will increase at the beginning and then change to decrease. (b) With the increasing FFS, the average delay of vehicles will decrease at the beginning and then change to increase. (c) A series of free-flow speeds associate with the best performance of freeway. These observations are theoretically analyzed through investigating the location and capacity of bottleneck. Study shows that in general the actual bottleneck capacity will increase at the beginning and then change to decrease with the continually increasing FFS. In view of the positive correlation between traffic delay and bottleneck capacity, the theoretical analysis confirms the numerical observations. The findings of this study can deepen the understanding of freeway systems and help management agents adopt proper measures to improve the performance of the whole system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Transport interchanges play a key role as urban transport network nodes, and the quality of the service provided in an urban transport interchange therefore has a direct influence on travellers' daily experience. This study proposes a useful methodological framework to identify the potential strengths and weaknesses of urban transport interchanges and to manage resources more efficiently. It is based on a two-step analytical procedure combining the classification and regression tree model and importance-performance analysis. A travellers' attitudinal survey was carried out in the Mondoa transport interchange (Madrid, Spain) and the methodological framework was applied to the data collected. The greatest strengths of the interchange from the users' point of view are the information provision through signposting, the features of the internal design of the interchange which have a direct influence on aspects related to safety performance, and security conditions, particularly during day-time.

Then the free boundary is removed by adding a small and continuous penalty term to the BS model that cause American put option problem to be solvable on a fixed domain. In continuation we construct the method of lines (MOL) in space and reach a non-linear problem and we show that the proposed MOL is more stable than the other kinds. To deal with the non-linear problem, an algorithm is used based on the predictor-corrector method which corresponds to two parameters, theta and phi. These parameters are chosen optimally using a rational approximation to determine the order of time convergence.

The radial-backbone (or X-tree) structure is composed of two types of lines: the primary lines that travel exclusively on the common backbone (main corridor) and radial lines which, starting from the common backbone, branch out to individual locations. We define possible line configurations as binary strings and propose operators on them for their analysis, yielding an effective algorithm for generating an optimal design and train frequencies. We test our algorithm on real data for the high speed line Madrid-Seville.

However, some consideration must be point on its interaction with bacterial host and influence of bacterial host virulence. Therefor, information of characteristic of prospective bacteriophage must be determined prior to use as biological control agent. This research aimed to obtain some information about general characteristics of bacteriophage that infects P. syringae pv. glycinea such as the ability in propagation in bacterial host, type of nucleic acid, and total protein profile. The results showed that about four bacteriophages have been isolated from soybean soil in Sukorambi and Mangli area named phi SK2a, phi SK2b, phi SK2c (from Sukorambi), and phi MGX1 (from Mangli). All phages had different ability in propagation in bacterial host, P. syringae pv. glycinea strain H3 about 10(10)-10(12) PFU/mL. Nucleic acid analysis using digestion enzymes (DNase, RNase, and Restriction endonuclease) showed that all bacteriophage isolates had double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA). Moreover, protein profile of bacteriophage through sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed that all phages had similar pattern of the protein suggested the same type of bacteriophage. However, morphological characteristic is still needed to accurate determination of bacteriophage taxonomy. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The study is based on an annually conducted survey of the population RLMS-HSE and data from the Russian Federal state statistics service. The research methods are descriptive analysis, regression and cluster analysis. The main results of the study are the following. Firstly, it is recorded an increase of working hours of pedagogical workers on both the primary and secondary jobs. The increase in the workload in most cases is due to the implementation of the teaching and administrative, but not research activities. Secondly, the increase in teachers salaries in recent years is due to the increase in the return on academic degrees, work experience in the educational organization and the number of working hours. Thirdly, there is revealed a growth of satisfaction of teachers with different aspects of work, especially the satisfaction with salary. Evaluation of teachers' job satisfaction is higher than the average for the Russian economy. Fourthly, the reforms have not solved the problem of substantial improvement of staffing in Russian universities and colleges. The share of older workers in the universities is increasing. There is an inadequate level of teachers' knowledge of foreign languages and informational technologies.","[Burtseva, Olga; Stuken, Tatiana; Lapina, Tatiana] Dostoevsky Omsk State Univ, 55a Prospekt Mira, Omsk 644077, Russia",Dostoevsky Omsk State University,"Burtseva, O (通讯作者)，Dostoevsky Omsk State Univ, 55a Prospekt Mira, Omsk 644077, Russia.",olishb@yandex.ru; stuken@mail.ru; lapinaomgu@gmail.com,"Korzhova, Olga/G-2441-2017; Stuken, Tatiana/H-6777-2016; Lapina, Tatyana A./G-6635-2013",,,,,,11,1,1,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,266,275,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100026,0

To gain better insight into the long-standing exposure puzzle concerning the divergence between theoretical and empirical investigation and the critical issue regarding the determinants of exposure, the time variation and asymmetry property associated with foreign exchange exposure are further taking into account. We also broaden the scope of analysis to investigate unexpected risk exposure at 10 economic sectors in compliance with Global Industry Classification Standard. Unlike those from the static analysis or dynamic ones with the ordinary least squares model, the empirical findings provide additional concrete evidence that unexpected exchange rate exposure varies substantially across time and market circumstances when using the quantile regression with a rolling method. Furthermore, our dynamic analysis not only supports the existence of industrial effects across different economic sectors, but also provides strong evidence that financial factors, such as size, debt ratio and book to market ratio, have a significant impact on exposure.","[Chen, Pei-Fen] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Int Business Studies, Nantou 54561, Taiwan; [Lee, Chien-Chiang; Huang, Jing-Xuan] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Lee, Chi-Chuan] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Management, Zhuhai, Peoples R China",National Chi Nan University; National Sun Yat Sen University; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University Zhuhai,"Chen, PF (通讯作者)，Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Int Business Studies, Nantou 54561, Taiwan.",,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020; Lee, Chi-Chuan/AAD-2211-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347; Lee, Chi-Chuan/0000-0003-0644-1168; Chen, Pei-Fen/0000-0001-6472-9579",,,,,43,6,6,0,28,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2016,39.0,1.0,,,,,132,157,,10.1111/twec.12365,0.0,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DC1UK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000369002300006,0

The relevant question is the extent to which output has recovered from the current crisis as well as to quantify the amount of the permanent loss in output. These issues will be approached using a bivariate unobserved components model of output and unemployment which enables decomposition of variables into transitory and permanent component. The significant finding is that a transitory component of output has already recovered after the initial shock in the beginning of the crisis. However, the opposite is true for the permanent component. The paper presents evidence of a persistently decreased growth of the trend component of output due to which there is a significant permanent loss in the level of output. The paper estimates this loss to equal approximately to 20 % of the quarterly real GDP.","[Cizek, Ondrej] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Cízek, O (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",cizeko@vse.cz,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,2,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,143,148,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500025,0

The approach, which excludes certain triples of rankings over triples of alternatives, contributes to the literature in three ways. First, I generalize majority rule to classes of social preference relations defined by their decisiveness properties. Second, I consider not only transitivity of weak and strict social preference, but I provide conditions for acyclic strict preference as well. Third, the well-known conditions of value restriction, single peakedness, and order restriction are shown to satisfy corresponding exclusion conditions, so transitivity results on these domains follow from the more general analysis; in particular, the results are applied to weakly single-peaked preference profiles, and a result on acyclicity due to Austen-Smith and Banks (Positive political theory I. University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, 1999) is obtained as a special case. In contrast to the latter authors, the approach fixes a single preference profile and does not rely on the properties of social preferences as individual preferences are varied.","[Duggan, John] Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY USA; [Duggan, John] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester; University of Rochester,"Duggan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY USA.;Duggan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",dugg@ur.rochester.edu,,"Duggan, John/0000-0001-8554-2594",,,,,15,2,2,2,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2016,46.0,1.0,,,,,93,118,,10.1007/s00355-015-0906-3,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DH8CG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373020500005,0

Moreover, we find CBDT provides a better fit to the dynamics of cooperation than does the existing Probit model, which is the first time such a result has been found. We also find that humans aspire to a payoff above the mutual defection outcome but below the mutual cooperation outcome, which suggests they hope, but are not confident, that cooperation can be achieved. Finally, our best-fitting parameters suggest that circumstances with more details are easier to recall. We make a prediction for future experiments: if the repeated PD were run for more periods, then we would be begin to see an increase in cooperation, most dramatically in the second treatment, where history is observed but identities are not. This is the first application of Case-based decision theory to a strategic context and the first empirical test of CBDT in such a context. It is also the first application of bootstrapped standard errors to an agent-based model.","[Guilfoos, Todd] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, Coastal Inst 219, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Pape, Andreas Duus] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, POB 6000, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA",University of Rhode Island; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Pape, AD (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, POB 6000, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",guilfoos@mail.uri.edu; apape@binghamton.edu,,,"USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project [1005053]; NIFA [811931, 1005053] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","This work is supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project 1005053.",,60,9,13,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JAN,2016,80.0,1.0,,,,,1,32,,10.1007/s11238-015-9495-y,0.0,,,32,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DC1ZS,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000369017600001,0

Evidence from Brazil,WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GEOGRAPHY; EDUCATION; GRAVITY; TRADE,"This paper investigates how internal migration is affected by Brazil's increased integration into the world economy. We analyze the impact of regional differences in access to foreign demand on sector-specific bilateral migration rates between the Brazilian states for the years 1995 to 2003. Using international trade data, we compute a foreign market access measure at the sectoral level, which is exogenous to domestic migration. A higher foreign market access is associated with a higher local labor demand and attracts workers via two potential channels: higher wages and new job opportunities. Our results show that both channels play a significant role in internal migration. Further, we find a heterogeneous impact across industries, according to their comparative advantage on the world market. However, the observed impact is driven by the strong reaction of low-educated workers to changes in market access. This finding is consistent with the fact that Brazil is exporting mainly goods that are intensive in unskilled labor.","[Hering, Laura] Erasmus Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Paillacar, Rodrigo] Univ Cergy Pontoise, Lab THEMA, Cergy Pontois, France",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Hering, L (通讯作者)，Erasmus Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",laura.hering@gmail.com; rodrigo.paillacar@gmail.com,,"Hering, Laura/0000-0001-6020-5903",project Labex MME-DII [ANR11-LBX-0023-01],project Labex MME-DII,"This research has been conducted as part of the project Labex MME-DII (ANR11-LBX-0023-01).

This paper focuses on familiarity bias in the Czech dairy market and on the indirect and direct effects of the perception of information through information behavior and the use of the model ordered. It is proposed that consumer levels of product familiarity of attributes affects behavior. Consumer attitudes towards agri-food products and behaviour were analyzed through a questionnaire in 2010-2011. The model is estimated using probit analysis to predict relationship between producer and consumer in decision-making when buying a new type of cheese and to examine consumer attitudes toward food origins and nutrient food security. It can be concluded that the indirect effect (e.g. is the product grown locally, fresher, environmental issues, safety, etc.) on consumer attitudes toward products exists.

Overall, the growth models are often continuous. In our paper we formulate a discrete version of Romer's model with endogenous technological change based on expanding variety of intermediates, both in the final good sector and in the research-development sector, where the target is to maximize present value of the returns from discovering of intermediate goods which should prevail introducing costs. These discrete version then will be calibrated by a numerical example.

The online environment in which the newest forms of CF emerge facilitates its unprecedented ability to cross borders and attract persons from various countries. This having been said, the same environment complicates legal assessment. The issues that inevitably arise in cross-border dealing are particularly intricate: which court decides and which law applies? At the outset, one must differentiate between various types of CF models. Furthermore, the tripartite structure of the CF model involving the specialised internet platforms adds another layer of complexity because the conflict of laws analysis demands the preliminary identification of legal relationships and their legal characterisation. Finally, there is a constant debate about whether investors may be legally characterised as consumers or not, which may significantly affect conclusions on jurisdiction and applicable law. In answering these questions, the author considers national and supranational legal instruments containing provisions on international jurisdiction and applicable law, with the focus on the EU ones. In the course of legal analysis, the interpretational principles set by the Court of Justice of the European Union will be taken into account. Since no such principle is directly related to the internet-based CF, they need to be assessed in terms of their relevancy and potential to be used as starting points in analogical reasoning. Besides drawing a clearer image about the conflict of laws issues for participants in CF, the aim of this article is also to assess the validity of some of the legal terms under which these participants join the CF process.","[Kunda, Ivana] Univ Rijeka, Fac Law, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Kunda, I (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Law, Rijeka, Croatia.",ikunda@pravri.hr,"Kunda, Ivana/R-9012-2018",,,,,,13,2,2,0,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,253,263,,,,,,11,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400026,0

The primary aim of this study is to understand whether VET at the high school level contributes to human capital development in one of those countries-China. To fulfill this aim, we draw on longitudinal data on more than 10,000 students in vocational high school (in the most popular major, computing) and academic high school from two provinces of China. First, estimates from instrumental variables and matching analyses show that attending vocational high school (relative to academic high school) substantially reduces math skills and does not improve computing skills. Second, heterogeneous effect estimates also show that attending vocational high school increases dropout, especially among disadvantaged (low-income or low-ability) students. Third, we use vertically scaled (equated) baseline and follow-up test scores to measure gains in math and computing skills among the students. We find that students who attend vocational high school experience absolute reductions in math skills. Taken together, our findings suggest that the rapid expansion of vocational schooling as a substitute for academic schooling can have detrimental consequences for building human capital in developing countries such as China.","[Loyalka, Prashant] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Huang, Xiaoting; Wei, Jianguo; Song, Yingquan] Peking Univ, CIEFR, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu; Yi, Hongmei] Chinese Acad Sci, IGSNRR, CCAP, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yaojiang] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Peoples R China; [Chu, James] Stanford Univ, REAP, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shaanxi Normal University; Stanford University,"Yi, HM (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, IGSNRR, CCAP, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China.",loyalka@stanford.edu; xthuang@ciefr.pku.edu.cn; lxzhang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn; jgwei@ciefr.pku.edu.cn; yihm.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn; yqsong@ciefr.pku.edu.cn; jchu1225@stanford.com,"Wei, Jianguo/KBA-3200-2024; Loyalka, Prashant/Y-6174-2018; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023; ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022","Wei, Jianguo/0000-0002-8964-9759; Song, Yingquan/0000-0002-9524-6569; Yi, Hongmei/0000-0002-6934-0498; Chu, James Y./0000-0003-2702-470X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71110107028, 71573246]; 3ie; Ford Foundation",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 3ie; Ford Foundation,"Yaojiang Shi is professor and director of Center for Experimental Economics of Education, Shaanxi Normal University, China.

Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (SEM-EDX) together with Inductively Couple Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) were used. It was found that rice husks contained a large amount of Si in the form of silicon dioxide at an average level of 23,104.28 +/- 2021.27 mu g Si/g husk. Rice could grow well and accumulated Si in whole body tissues from 170.00 +/- 126.48 mu g Si/g tissue at the start of germination to 1,380.00 +/- 667.16 mu g Si/g tissue when the rice grew to 10 cm long.

At the same time, the Regulation 1206/2001, as well as other EU instruments containing measures relating to judicial cooperation in civil matters, should be observed and understood in the broader context than that set out by its aim. Thus, the paper presents a judgment of the German Constitutional court from 14 September 2015 concerning violation of the right to effective judicial protection due to the Municipal court's failure to use possibilities available through the application of the Regulation 1206/2001 in order to investigate and establish the facts of the case that have good prospects of success. Namely, the decision of the German Constitutional court raises a number of questions relating to the application of specific institutionalised facilities and measures of assistance of complementary character to the Regulation 1206/2001 which should be taken into account by a judge when deciding in a cross-border case. Also, it suggests that a reference for preliminary ruling to the CJEU should have been made by the German Municipal court. The paper questions to what extent the new regime of taking evidence presents not only an instrument with an aim to make easier taking evidence in another Member State but another sophisticated EU instrument with an objective to contribute to harmonization of standards of procedural guarantees in Member States.","[Poretti, Paula] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, S Radica 13, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Poretti, P (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, S Radica 13, Osijek, Croatia.",pporetti@pravos.hr,,,,,,,2,1,1,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,219,226,,,,,,8,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400022,0

We hypothesized that specific factors support growth in regions, but these factors differ according to the level of regional development. The results indicate that less-developed regions with high growth rates are characterised by very positive changes in the intensity of high-tech industries, the level of education of the society as a whole and the level of employment in science and technology as well as by fixed assets in manufacturing industries that may indicate increases in technology transfer. Relatively higher increases in employment in medium-high-tech and low-tech industries and knowledge-intensive services characterise more-developed regions with high growth rates. In both less and more-developed regions with high growth rates, an increase in the share of research and development in GDP was observed, as was an increase in the rate of the employment of women. Therefore, we confirmed that factors inducing growth in various regions differ.","[Pylak, Korneliusz] Lublin Univ Technol, Nadbystrzycka 38D St, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland; [Wojnicka-Sycz, Elzbieta] Univ Gdansk, Bazynskiego 8 St, PL-80309 Gdansk, Poland; [Wojnicka-Sycz, Elzbieta] Gdansk Univ Technol, Bazynskiego 8 St, PL-80309 Gdansk, Poland",Lublin University of Technology; Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk; Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Pylak, K (通讯作者)，Lublin Univ Technol, Nadbystrzycka 38D St, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland.",korneliusz.pylak@pollub.pl; elzbieta.wojnicka-sycz@ug.edu.pl,"Wojnicka-Sycz, Elżbieta/AAN-6215-2021; Pylak, Korneliusz/A-7270-2013; Wojnicka-Sycz, Elżbieta/HKP-0051-2023","Wojnicka-Sycz, Elżbieta/0000-0002-0016-5580; Pylak, Korneliusz/0000-0001-7812-1281;",,,,,13,1,1,0,7,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1534,1545,,,,,,12,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100152,0

To determine main inflation drivers in each country, multiple regression models are estimated. To describe the common factors causing inflation among all member countries we use panel data models. We found out that the most significant inflationary factors have been changed after 2008 but these factors do not differ significantly in observed countries. The results prove the influence of the domestic factors in the pre-crisis period. The impact of the external factors, especially commodity prices, is significant in the period during crisis. In conclusion, supply side factors have major influence on inflation and the inflationary factors have been changed over time.","[Roubalova, Lenka; Hampel, David] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Roubalová, L (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Stat & Operat Anal, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xkravack@mendelu.cz; qqhampel@mendelu.cz,"Hampel, David/B-6765-2013","Hampel, David/0000-0002-3865-5948",,,,,17,3,3,0,2,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,741,746,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500127,0

Business operations get international dimensions and require the use of English and other foreign languages from Slovak university graduates if they want to establish themselves successfully on the international labour market. Studying foreign languages is part of the curriculum at most non philological faculties. Foreign languages are connected with the content of the subject study (foreign languages for specific purposes) to allow communication in the given specific field. For students the study of a specific language may present some difficulties because the language courses are usually set in the first semesters of their university studies, i. e. before students gain the basic economic content knowledge in their native language. The aims of foreign language competence are projected for the future professional needs of graduates, who may not yet be aware of the necessity and importance of these concepts in a foreign language and may therefore lack the motivation. Our paper focuses on the study of English for specific purposes (ESP) in economics and law studies. It explores the awareness of students of the present and future utilization of their foreign language knowledge and hence the motivation to study the specific, work-oriented and profession focused English. The research done by a method of questionnaire and interviews has been carried out on a group of economics and law students. The data collected show that students are motivated to study more than one foreign language at the university and are aware of their practical use on the labour market. The results should have implications for the curriculum and foreign language policy at universities in accordance with the policy of multilingualism of the European Union.","[Schneiderova, Anna] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Law, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Zelenkova, Anna] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University; Matej Bel University,"Schneiderová, A (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Law, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",anna.schneiderova@umb.sk; anna.zelenkova@umb.sk,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,3,BELIANUM-VYDAVATESTVO UNIV MATEJA BELA V BANSKEJ BYSTRICI,BANSKA BYSTRICA,"TAJOVSKEHO 51, BANSKA BYSTRICA, 974 00, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-557-1089-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,Economics; Industrial Relations & Labor; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BM2DC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000460873800003,0

Using goal programming for timetabling enables including soft constraints in the mathematical model. There are two main approaches for solving the timetabling problem. The first one is to split the problem into several interrelated stages. The other one is solving the problem with one complex model. In this paper there are compared three integer goal programming models for timetabling that were presented at previous MME conferences. The compared models are a three-stage, a four-stage, and a complex integer goal programming model.

Whether the measuring instruments are accurate or not is related to the economic interests of the country and the people, which is the ultimate embodiment of the productivity process. This paper introduces the causes of the errors caused by the electromechanical electric energy meters, and puts forward some suggestions for the error adjustment. Along with the favor of the national policies, the development of the electric power in our country is faster and faster, and the requirements on the controlling of the errors of the electric energy meters are higher and higher. But the power crews in the statistics of the total sum of the measurement of the electric energy of the electromechanical electric energy meters will often have errors. Generally, the existence of the errors is caused by the errors in the process of the operation of the electromechanical electric energy meters, such as the overlapping errors in line connection process, and the short circuit of the lines and so on. In addition, some deep-seated problems that exist within the meters are the important causes of the errors, which are difficult to control. Therefore, in the analysis of the errors of the electric energy meters, we should have the overall consideration and carry out the scientific researches.","[Sun, Xiaoyun] Wuhan Railway Vocat Coll Technol, Wuhan 430205, Peoples R China",,"Sun, XY (通讯作者)，Wuhan Railway Vocat Coll Technol, Wuhan 430205, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,1,SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE",2251-3051,,978-981-09-7914-0,LECT N MANAG SCI,,,2016,58.0,,,,,,547,551,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7QX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391643800104,0

The results of primary research point to that citizens are key players of local municipalities in SR. However, local governments have used mostly only statutory form of building relationships with citizens. There is a lack of systematic support of citizen involvement in the public affairs as well as in the implementation of common interest issues. More conscious local municipalities are becoming the larger municipalities, especially cities, because of the stronger pressure of organized groups of citizens in order to stimulate debate and resolve problem areas of life of local community.

On the other hand, an increase in the demand for transport by rail, of both passengers and cargo, is taking place after decades of its continuous decline, which requires immediate additional investments in rail infrastructure and accompanying rolling stock, under pressure to simultaneously reduce operating costs.","[Vasilj, Aleksandra] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Vasilj, A (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",avasilj@pravos.hr,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,354,362,,,,,,9,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400037,0

Nowadays formation of such an attitude is largely influenced by parenting image spread by mass media and especially through social networks. For studying parenting image in the network we have chosen the most popular social network within Russia and the CIS countries - VKontakte. Using snowball sampling technique we selected the largest communities dedicated to parenting and carried out content analysis for 2015 by means of the NVivo program. As a result, we have found out that social network parenting image almost corresponds motherhood image. The image of a mother is close to the stereotyped image of a modern woman a sexy girl having 1-2 babies though. The modern parenting image combines both parenting features of Soviet period and new ones. The woman's leading role in parenting as well as baby care are traditional features. The emphasis on psychological, emotional interaction between family members becomes a modern trend. Thus, content analysis of social network communities has shown that, generally, positive image of a family and parenting contradicts the image of a successful young man because of social and economic risks faced by parents.","[Voroshilova, Anzhelika] Ural Fed Univ, Inst Publ Adm & Entrepreneurship, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Voroshilova, A (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Inst Publ Adm & Entrepreneurship, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",a.i.voroshilova@urfu.ru,"Voroshilova, Anzhelika/E-4184-2019","Voroshilova, Anzhelika/0000-0003-4022-9742",,,,,12,1,1,0,6,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,2007,2014,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100196,0

In this thesis, GAP model will be adopted to analyze the sources of quality problems which exist in endowment institutions' long-term care service from the perspective of five sources of service quality gap, and the preliminary countermeasures will also be proposed. According to the Statistical Bulletin of Social Service Development in 2013  issued by Ministry of Civil Affairs, by the end of 2013, all over the country, the number of elderly population over 60 years old was 202.43 million, accounting for 14.9% of the total number of population. Among them, the number of elderly population over 65 years old is 131.61 million, which accounts for 9.7% of the total number.

Ell Compared with other endowment patterns, endowment institutions possess the features of specialization and standardization. In the endowment institutions, the long-term endowment care service system, whose starting points are the demands of elderly people and whose duration time is longer than six months, is formed by comprehensive long-term care service-oriented architectures, including basic long-term endowment care service (such as care for catering and daily life, health care service, psychosocial service, etc.), long-term endowment care human resources, long-term endowment care service system, and long-term endowment care policy support.

What effect does such a large and heterogeneous group of states have on the complexity of climate change negotiations? Would a smaller, more homogenous, assortment of countries produce a more efficient negotiation space? To begin to answer these questions, I apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation to a corpus of High-level climate change conference speeches, covering the formal statements made by country-representatives at the 16th-to-19th COPs. This exercise yields a very large and coherent set of latent topics and many, but not all, of these topics correspond to the negotiating positions presumed by extant research. Analysis of the resultant topics reveals that the dominant dimensions of climate change negotiation favor developing country concerns over cooperation, though reducing negotiations to a smaller core group of countries may lessen this disparity. Together these findings indicate that unsupervised topic models can substantially expand our understandings of climate change negotiations, and international cooperation more generally.","Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Bagozzi, BE (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",bbagozzi@umn.edu,,"Bagozzi, Benjamin/0000-0002-6233-6453",,,,,58,15,17,1,68,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The standard correction in prior research regresses actual measures on reported values using an external validation dataset, and then uses the estimated coefficients to predict actual measures in the primary dataset This approach requires the strong assumption that the expectations of measured weight and height conditional on the reported values are the same in both datasets. In contrast, we use percentile ranks rather than levels of reported weight and height. Our approach requires the weaker assumption that the conditional expectations of actual measures are increasing in reported values in both samples. This makes our correction more robust to differences in measurement error across surveys as long as both surveys represent the same population. We examine three nationally representative datasets and find that misreporting appears to be sensitive to differences in survey context. When we compare predicted BMI distributions using the two validation approaches, we find that the standard correction is affected by differences in misreporting while our correction is not. Finally, we present several examples that demonstrate the potential importance of our correction for future econometric analyses and estimates of obesity rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The general assumption is that exports from a given region will rise with increased accessibility, thus benefiting economic activities. However, the specification of the market potential model is typically very simple and ignores both the impact of competing rivals and the role of international borders, which leads to unrealistic results. Spatial interaction models on bilateral trade have already proved that international trade is affected by multilateral resistance, borders, adjacency, language or currency. Nevertheless, apart from some recent analyses that simply calibrate the distance decay parameter from trade datasets, these variables have hardly been integrated into research on market potential. This paper sets out to demonstrate that more realistic results are obtained by calibrating the distance-decay parameter and introducing the impact of competing rivals and border effects into the market potential formulation. The proposed model is then applied to the assessment of the accessibility impacts of new road transport infrastructure in the European Union between 2001 and 2012, which shows that the greatest improvements in accessibility were experienced by peripheral countries with high road infrastructure investment.

Because of geographical proximity and close economic ties, this paper reviews some of the potential impacts the Ciudad Juarez homicides may have on the El Paso regional economy. A time series data approach is employed to quantify links between organized crime homicides in Ciudad Juarez and economic conditions in El Paso as measured by the metropolitan business cycle index and total nonagricultural employment. Findings indicate that fluctuations in the number of Ciudad Juarez homicides impact both variables in statistically significant manners at multiple time lags.","[Nino, Pedro, Jr.] CBRE Grp Inc, El Paso, TX 79901 USA; [Coronado, Roberto A.] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, El Paso, TX 79901 USA; [Fullerton, Thomas M., Jr.; Walke, Adam G.] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Econ & Finance, El Paso, TX 79901 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso,"Coronado, RA (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, 301 East Main St, El Paso, TX 79901 USA.",pedro.nino@cbre.com; roberto.coronado@dal.frb.org; tomf@utep.edu,"Fullerton, Thomas/AAF-9255-2020; Fullerton, Thomas M./R-4946-2019","Fullerton, Thomas/0000-0002-5820-0713; Walke, Adam/0000-0001-6782-8425",El Paso Water Utilities; Hunt Communities; Texas Department of Transportation; UTEP Center for the Study of Western Hemispheric Trade; City of El Paso Office of Management Budget; UTEP College of Business Administration Faculty Research Grant,El Paso Water Utilities; Hunt Communities; Texas Department of Transportation; UTEP Center for the Study of Western Hemispheric Trade; City of El Paso Office of Management Budget; UTEP College of Business Administration Faculty Research Grant,"Financial support for this research was provided by El Paso Water Utilities, Hunt Communities, Texas Department of Transportation, the UTEP Center for the Study of Western Hemispheric Trade, the City of El Paso Office of Management & Budget and a UTEP College of Business Administration Faculty Research Grant.

We argue that the contemporary economic recovery has been characterised by a dynamic of 'regressive redistribution': a socially regressive dynamic of state-led economic restructuring that has worked through two axes at the centre of the recovery. The first axis, a monetary policy framework centred upon Quantitative Easing, has driven asset-price inflation to the benefit of the wealthiest asset holders. The second axis centres upon the politics of regressive labour market restructuring which has provoked widespread wage deflation. In combination, these two axes have been central to defining the contours of the Britain's post-crisis political economy paradigm: characterised by rising asset wealth for the few, and falling living standards alongside increasing economic insecurity for wage earners. The opportunity to change path from the trends of deepening inequality that defined the pre-crisis era has not been taken. Instead, the prevailing policy paradigm of the post-crisis period - discursively unified and sustained by David Cameron's government - has intensified the regressively redistributive dynamics at the core of the neo-liberal project. Ultimately, this is likely to further entrench structural weaknesses in Britain's economy in the years ahead.","[Green, Jeremy] Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England; [Lavery, Scott] Univ Sheffield, SPERI, Interdisciplinary Ctr Social Sci ICOSS, Sheffield S1 4DP, S Yorkshire, England",University of Bristol; University of Sheffield,"Green, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Sociol Polit & Int Studies, 11 Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 1TU, Avon, England.",jeremy.green@bristol.ac.uk; scott.lavery@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,80,10,11,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

If individuals lack integrated preferences, as behavioural economics suggests they often do, consumers' surplus cannot be defined. However, Dupuit - the earliest theorist of consumers' surplus - did not assume integrated preferences. His concept of consumers' surplus can be interpreted in terms of the maximum yield of discriminatory prices. In principle, this can be measured without making assumptions about preferences, but (contrary to what Dupuit apparently thought) is not, in general, equal to the area under the observed demand curve.","[Sugden, Robert] Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Sugden, R (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",r.sugden@uea.ac.uk,"Sugden, Robert/B-1153-2012","Sugden, Robert/0000-0002-3401-3139",ESRC [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,27,1,1,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

The latter also allows examination of price spillover effects, given that pharmaceutical product reimbursement regulation commonly benchmarks from prices in other countries. We empirically focus on the relative delays imposed by regulation on the adoption of a global set of molecules, which have diffused across more than 10 markets in the OECD over the period 1999-2008, controlling for various confounding effects. Through examining time to launch across a number of markets, and controlling for a number of confounding influences, we find that price and reimbursement regulations appear to delay the adoption of new pharmaceutical products. We also find that the existence of interdependencies in pricing may have a further indirect effect of such regulation on launch times. Firm economies of scale, the therapeutic importance of specific product innovations and market size are found to counter the delaying impact of price and reimbursement regulation on new medicines adoption.","[Costa-Font, Joan; McGuire, Alistair; Varol, Nebibe] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Costa-Font, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",j.costa-font@lse.ac.uk,"Costa-i-Font, Joan/C-9609-2013","Costa-i-Font, Joan/0000-0001-7174-7919",Merck Foundation Trust; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Merck Foundation Trust; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful for the financial support provided by Merck Foundation Trust, and to Tim Williams and Elizabeth Finch from Merck Sharp Dome, UK for their help during the data collection process.",,40,7,7,0,21,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

A shift-share analysis first compares the regional competitiveness of EZ and non-EZ areas in 1990 and 2000, and suggests that most industries in EZ areas have been gaining strength. Five regression equations are estimated to quantify the effects of the EZ program on different industries. An instrumental variable approach is developed to deal with the possible issue of endogeneity during the EZ designation process.

However, longstanding policies that stimulate energy demand in these states are diverting an ever-larger share of resource production into domestic markets, threatening the region's chief export and biggest contributor to GDP. Five of these six sheikhdoms must soon choose between maintaining energy subsidies and sustaining exports. Rising domestic demand for natural gas, once considered nearly free, has already forced some states to shift to higher-cost resources, including imports. For now, governments have absorbed these costs and insulated consumers from higher prices. This practice only intensifies the pressure on exportable resources. As hydrocarbon production reaches a plateau, domestic consumption will gradually displace exports. Politically difficult reforms that moderate consumption can therefore extend the longevity of exports, and perhaps, the regimes themselves.","Rice Univ, James A Baker III Inst Publ Policy, Energy Studies, Houston, TX 77005 USA",Rice University,"Krane, J (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, James A Baker III Inst Publ Policy, Energy Studies, 6100 Main St, Houston, TX 77005 USA.",jkrane@rice.edu,,"Krane, Jim/0000-0002-2132-6769",GDF Suez; NPRP program of the Qatar National Research Fund,GDF Suez; NPRP program of the Qatar National Research Fund(Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)),"For their helpful comments, the author would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers, as well as Mary Ann Tetreault, Pete W.

Both flexible working and work-life balance are important contemporary agendas within midwifery and can have both positive and negative consequences for midwives. Full-time midwives and those without caring commitments feel disadvantaged by flexible working and work-life balance policies as they have to fit when they work around part-time midwives and are increasingly expected to cover extra work. They feel their work-life balance is marginalized and this is fuelling discontent and resentment among midwives and leading to divisions between full- and part-time staff that reinforce flexibility stigma. Although flexible working and work-life balance are important for recruiting and retaining midwives they are part of the ongoing tensions and challenges for midwives and the midwifery profession.,"[Prowse, Julie] Univ Bradford, Sch Serv Dev & Improvement, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England; [Prowse, Peter] Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Human Resource Management & Employee Relat, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England",University of Bradford; University of Bradford,"Prowse, J (通讯作者)，Univ Bradford, Fac Hlth Studies, Sch Serv Dev & Improvement, Horton A Bldg, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England.",J.Prowse@Bradford.ac.uk,,,,,,,69,21,29,10,137,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

In so doing, we empirically analyse the dynamics of market discipline for all 27 EU member states between 1992 and 2007. The existing literature tends to assert that markets discipline governments, without measuring whether the interest punishment markets impose actually has the purported effect on government policy. To better grasp the dynamics of market discipline it is essential to consider both sides. Market discipline is thus understood as a two-sided phenomenon. On the one hand, financial investors react to policy developments. On the other hand, policy-makers react to market signals. We find strong evidence that although the impact of fiscal policy developments on market punishment slightly decreases with monetary integration, government responsiveness to market punishment increases. This runs counter to the conventional narrative of policy-makers banking on bailout from fellow EMU members.","Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh EH8 9LL, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Rommerskirchen, C (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Chrystal Macmillan Bldg,15a George Sq, Edinburgh EH8 9LL, Midlothian, Scotland.",charlotte.rommerskirchen@ed.ac.uk,,"Rommerskirchen, Charlotte/0000-0001-7054-5629",German National Merit Foundation (Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes); European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)/ERC [291733],German National Merit Foundation (Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes); European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)/ERC(European Research Council (ERC)),Special thanks are due to Iain Hardie.

To overcome this problem, we study the effects of financial development on growth from 1960 to 2010 in one country-Italy. Thus, we have the same political, legal and regulatory framework but also sharply differing development conditions between regions. After World War II, Italy achieved an economic miracle similar to what China and India are now experiencing, followed by a lengthy phase of decline. Accordingly, we can distinguish the effect of financial development on growth from other potential causal factors while also considering regions with sharply different economic conditions. Our results show that from 1960 to 1980, when the Italian economic miracle was still under way, finance played no significant role in favouring the surge in economic growth, which most likely depended on internal consumption. Between 1980 and 2010, by contrast, the great expansion of Italian financial markets and institutions did have a positive effect on regional economic performance, but overall growth rates were nevertheless low. Although our empirical evidence supports the view that finance is more important for growth in less highly developed regions, it also shows that financial development has not helped to overcome the Italian economic divide.","[Coccorese, Paolo] Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy; [Silipo, Damiano Bruno] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy",University of Salerno; University of Calabria,"Coccorese, P (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Giovanni Paolo 2 132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy.",coccorese@unisa.it; silipo@unical.it,"COCCORESE, Paolo/Y-8810-2019; COCCORESE, Paolo/L-5660-2015","COCCORESE, Paolo/0000-0003-1701-4858; COCCORESE, Paolo/0000-0003-1701-4858",,,,,51,7,8,0,28,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Although fixed-term contracts may provide a 'stepping-stone' to permanent positions, temporary agency work is hardly better than unemployment in this regard. The Great Recession of 2008 has changed the dynamics on the labor market and amplified the difference between fixed-term contracts and temporary agency work.

This reveals that yields in the 1690s were depressed by unusually poor weather; and those in the late 1850s were inflated by unusually good weather. This has led researchers to overestimate the underlying growth of yields over the period by perhaps 50%. Correcting for this effect would largely reconcile the conflicting primal and dual estimates of productivity growth over the period. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This paper examines the effectiveness of LEZs for reducing PM10 levels in urban areas in Germany and quantifies the associated health impacts from reduced air pollution within the zones. We employ a fixed effects panel data model for daily observations of PM10 concentrations from 2000 to 2009 and control, inter alia, for local meteorological conditions and traffic volume. We apply the regression outputs to a concentration response function derived from the epidemiological literature to calculate associated health impacts of the introduction of LEZs in 25 German cities with 3.96 million inhabitants. Associated uncertainties are accounted for in Monte-Carlo simulations. It is found that the introduction of LEZs has significantly reduced inner city PM10 levels. We estimate the total mean health impact from reduced air pollution in 2010 due to the introduction of stage 1 zones to be similar to 760 million EUR in the 25 LEZ cities in the sample, whereas total mean health benefits are similar to 2.4 billion EUR for the more stringent stage 2 zones when applied in the same cities.

We develop new econometric tools for panel data with random effects and discrete covariates, such as a nonparametric kernel estimator of the distribution function of the response variable conditional on a set of covariates and a consistent test of first order stochastic dominance. Our empirical results, based on these tests, shed light on the survivorship bias in the e-Mid market, and reveal the existence of a risk premium on small banks, banks with currencies different from the Euro, and banks based on countries under sovereign debt distress in the periphery of the European Union.

This paper contributes to this research by analysing factors that led to weakening in the structural power of financial interests in the City of London in the aftermath of the 2007/2008 crisis. We focus on under-researched mediators of structural power dynamics, especially the context of action and the agency and ideas of state leaders. Prior to the crisis, closed regulatory policy and a prevailing discourse premised upon the notion of market efficiency, helped to reinforce the structural power of the UK banking and financial sector. After the crisis heightened politicisation, more assertive state leadership, and especially ideational revision, has increasingly challenged the power of the City. We illustrate this through an examination of the Independent Commission on Banking's proposals in relation to the 'ring fencing' of investment and retail banks.","[Bell, Stephen] Univ Queensland, Sch Polit Sci & Int Studies, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Hindmoor, Andrew] Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Queensland; University of Sheffield,"Bell, S (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Polit Sci & Int Studies, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",stephen.bell@uq.edu.au; a.hindmoor@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Bell, Stephen Ross/0000-0001-8409-4419; Hindmoor, Andrew/0000-0002-0335-2509",,,,,55,39,41,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Although it is typically evaluated from the point of view of bus operators, it must also account for users, as required in recent service quality norms. Therefore, evaluating punctuality at bus stops is highly important, but may also be a complex task, because data on both bus arrivals (or departures) and users must be taken into account and processed. Data on buses can be collected by Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems, but several challenges must be addressed in order to use them effectively. Passengers data at bus stops cannot be derived from AVL, but they can be used to derive passenger patterns and need to be integrated into processed AVL data. This paper proposes a new punctuality measure defined as the fraction of passengers who will be served within an acceptably short interval after they arrive. A method is proposed to determine this measure: it provides (i) several rules to handle AVL collected data, (ii) a procedure integrating processed AVL data and potential passengers' patterns and (iii) a hierarchical process to perform the punctuality measure on each bus route direction of a transit network, as well as for every bus stop and time period. The paper illustrates the experimentation of this method on more than 4,000,000 data of a real bus operator and represents outcomes by easy-to-read control dashboards. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using disaggregated exporter-level customs data covering the universe of export transactions for Turkey during the period 2002-11, we characterise firm-level dynamics in the export sector and we decompose export growth at the aggregate, sectoral and destination market levels to identify the role of firm turnover, destination turnover and product turnover. We show that year-to-year aggregate export growth is dominated by growth in continuous exporters, and for these, growth is dominated by exports to their continued destinations and of their continued products. However, the observed high degree of churning across firms, destinations and products accounts for a substantial part of Turkey's export growth over longer periods. The patterns of microdynamics of export growth are verified across sectors and across groups of destination markets with some exceptions regarding exports to new emerging markets where net exporter entry plays a more critical role for export growth over longer periods.","[Cebeci, Tolga; Fernandes, Ana M.] World Bank, Trade & Int Integrat Unit, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Cebeci, T (通讯作者)，World Bank, Trade & Int Integrat Unit, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",,,,World Bank; Knowledge for Change Programme (KCP),World Bank(The World Bank India); Knowledge for Change Programme (KCP),"We acknowledge the generous financial support from the World Bank research support budget and the Knowledge for Change Programme (KCP), a trust funded partnership in support of research and data collection on poverty reduction and sustainable development housed in the office of the Chief Economist of the World Bank (www.worldbank.org/kcp).

However, such usefulness is predicated on the question of whether certain modeling strategies are able to yield more of the information found in futures prices. Applying a forecast-based approach, we study the extent to which alternative ways of modeling futures prices can reveal the extent of the information present in futures prices. Using weekly and monthly data, and futures of maturities of one to four months, we notably examine the out-of-sample predictability of futures prices over various forecast horizons, and in real-time, whereby parameters are updated prior to each sequential forecast. Our results with weekly data are particularly interesting. We find that models allowing for a time-varying convenience yield often produce considerably more precise forecasts over the three forecast horizons considered. Thus, more of the informational content of futures prices is attainable when both the price level and the distance of the latter from spot price are jointly considered, rather than when only the price level is considered. We also document that forecast performances improve with longer date-to-maturity futures, suggesting that the role of the convenience yield is greater when physical oil inventories are held for longer durations. Finally, we show that forecast accuracy is highest at the one year horizon, though the time-varying convenience models have a much higher accuracy than unit-root-based models even over the three and five-year horizons.","[Bernard, Jean-Thomas; Kichian, Maral] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Khalaf, Lynda] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, CIREQ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Kichian, Maral] Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [McMahon, Sebastien] Ind Alliance, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",University of Ottawa; Carleton University; University of Ottawa,"Bernard, JT (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, 120 Univ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",jbernar3@uOttawa.ca; Lynda_Khalaf@carleton.ca; mkichian@uottawa.ca; sebastien.mcmahon@inalco.com,,,Institut de Finance Mathematique de Montreal; Canadian Network of Centres of Excellence; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Fonds FQRSC (Government of Quebec); Chair on the Economics of Electrical Energy; Canada Research Chair in Environment,Institut de Finance Mathematique de Montreal; Canadian Network of Centres of Excellence; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Fonds FQRSC (Government of Quebec); Chair on the Economics of Electrical Energy; Canada Research Chair in Environment,"The authors would like to thank the editor, the associate editor and the referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

This study investigates the relationship between obesity and health care expenditure in Australia, where the rate of obesity has tripled in the last three decades. Now one in four Australians is considered obese, defined as having a body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) of 30 or over. The analysis is based on a random sample survey of over 240,000 adults aged 45 and over that is linked at the individual-level to comprehensive administrative health care claims for the period 2006-2009. This sub-population group has an obesity rate that is nearly 30% and is a major consumer of health services. Relative to the average annual health expenditures of those with normal weight, we find that the health expenditures of those with a BMI between 30 and 35 (obese type I) are 19% higher and expenditures of those with BMI greater than 35 (obese type II/III) are 51% higher. We find large and significant differences in all types of care: inpatient, emergency department, outpatient and prescription drugs. The obesity-related health expenditures are higher for obese type I women than men, but in the obese type II/III state, obesity-related expenditures are higher for men. When we stratify further by age groups, we find that obesity has the largest impact among men over age 75 and women aged 60-74 years old. In addition, we find that obesity impacts health expenditures not only through its link to chronic diseases, but also because it increases the cost of recovery from acute health shocks.

Since population health is a latent variable, studies which measure and rank the health of different geographies must aggregate observable health attributes into one summary measure. We show that the methods used in nearly all the literature to date implicitly assume that all attributes are infinitely substitutable. Our method, based on the measurement of multidimensional welfare and inequality, minimizes the entropic distance between the summary measure of population health and the distribution of the underlying attributes. This summary function coincides with the constant elasticity of substitution and Cobb-Douglas production functions and naturally allows different assumptions regarding attribute substitutability or complementarity. To compare methodologies, we examine a well-known ranking of the population health of U.S. states, America's Health Rankings. We find that states' rankings are somewhat sensitive to changes in the weight given to each attribute, but very sensitive to changes in aggregation methodology. Our results have broad implications for well-known health rankings such as the 2000 World Health Report, as well as other measurements of population and individual health levels and the measurement and decomposition of health inequality.

RE capacity exhibits a U-shaped relationship with per capita income, similar to other metrics for environmental quality (EQ). To explain this phenomenon, I consider several of the environmental Kuznets curve theories that describe the relationship between income and environmental quality (Y-EQ), including evolving property rights, increased demand for improved EQ, and changing economic composition; The results fail to provide support for the Y-EQ theories. I further consider the alternative hypothesis that increases in unemployment lead to increases in relative RE capacity, suggesting that promoting RE projects as a potential job creator is one of the main drivers of RE projects. The results imply that lagged unemployment is a significant predictor of relative RE capacity, particularly for states with a large manufacturing share of GDP.","Illinois State Univ, Normal, IL 61790 USA",Illinois State University,"Ohler, AM (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Campus Box 4200, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",aohler@ilstu.edu,,"Ohler, Adrienne/0000-0001-9179-4325",Illinois State University's New Faculty Initiative Grant,Illinois State University's New Faculty Initiative Grant,"Funding for this research was provided by Illinois State University's New Faculty Initiative Grant.

From a policy perspective, it is of interest to know if dropouts benefit from the time they spend in training since these programs require considerable resources. We shed light on this issue by estimating the average employment effects of different lengths of exposure by dropouts in a Korean job training program, and contrasting it to the ones by program completers. To do this, we employ methods to estimate effects from continuous treatments using the generalized propensity score, under the assumption that selection into different lengths of exposure is based on a rich set of observed covariates. We find that dropouts with longer exposures exhibit higher employment probabilities one year after receiving training, but only after surpassing a threshold of exposure of about 12-15 weeks. In contrast, program completers exhibit higher returns from their time of exposure to the program than dropouts, but these tend to decline for longer program durations.","[Choe, Chung] Korea Informat Soc Dev Inst, Gwacheon Si 427710, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Flores-Lagunes, Alfonso] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Flores-Lagunes, Alfonso] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Lee, Sang-Jun] Korea Res Inst Vocat Educ & Training, Seoul 135949, South Korea",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Flores-Lagunes, A (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, POB 6000, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",choechung@kisdi.re.kr; aflores@binghamton.edu; sJlee@krivet.re.kr,"Lee, Sang-Jun/A-3892-2015; Choe, Chung/L-6921-2013","Choe, Chung/0000-0002-5173-9644",,,,,54,5,9,0,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Returns are carefully adjusted for differences between public and private markets in financial leverage, property type focus and management fees. Unconditionally, we find that passive portfolios of unlevered core real estate investment trusts (REITs) outperformed their private market benchmark by 49 basis points (annualized) over the 1994-2012 sample period. Our baseline vector autoregression results suggest that REIT returns do not embed additional commercial real-estate-specific information useful in predicting private market returns. These results strongly suggest that equity REIT returns react to fundamental (latent) asset pricing information more quickly than private market returns given their greater liquidity and price revelation. REITs therefore serve as a fundamental information transmission channel to private market returns when asset pricing variables are omitted.","[Ling, David C.; Naranjo, Andy] Univ Florida, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Hough Grad Sch Business, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Ling, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Hough Grad Sch Business, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",ling@ufl.edu; andy.naranjo@warrington.ufl.edu,,,National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts,National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts,"We thank Brad Case, the special issue editor, Michael Grupe, Michael Hudgins, Colin Lizieri, Andrew McCulloch, Calvin Schnure and three anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

However, empirical evidence of fiscal dominance, understood as fiscal policy driving monetary policy, has been mixed, especially for low inflation countries. The literature hypothesizes that institutional constraints are the reason for the failure to connect deficits to money and prices in these countries. This paper, focusing on Spain 1874-1998, illustrates their constraining role in two steps. First, a recursive estimation of the link from budget to money shows how the degree of fiscal dominance varied over time. Second, we are able to establish a connection between these changes in the intensity of fiscal dominance and changes in the intensity of the institutional (exchange rate and central bank independence) constraints.","[Sabate, Marcela; Escario, Regina; Dolores Gadea, Maria] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Appl Econ, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Sabaté, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Dept Appl Econ, Zaragoza, Spain.",msabate@unizar.es,"Sabate Sort, Marcela/H-2206-2015; Gadea Rivas, Maria Dolores/K-1547-2014","Sabate Sort, Marcela/0000-0002-9047-4853; Gadea Rivas, Maria Dolores/0000-0001-6609-4247","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2012-08204, ECO2011-30260-C03-02]; Diputacion General de Aragon (SEIM) [SEC 269166]",Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Diputacion General de Aragon (SEIM),"We have received financial support from the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (ECO2012-08204 and ECO2011-30260-C03-02 projects) and the Diputacion General de Aragon (SEIM research group, SEC 269166 project).",,60,5,5,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

Moreover, these IMFs and residue are reconstructed into a high frequency component, a low frequency component and a trend component using hierarchical clustering method. The economic meanings of these three components are identified as short term market fluctuations, effects of significant trend breaks, and a long-term trend, respectively. Finally, some strategies are proposed for carbon price forecasting.","[Zhu, Bangzhu; Wang, Ping] Wuyi Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Jiangmen 529020, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Bangzhu; Wei, Yiming] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Chevallier, Julien] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, F-75006 Paris, France",Wuyi University; Beijing Institute of Technology; IPAG Business School,"Chevallier, J (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France.",julien.chevallier04@univ-paris8.fr,"Chevallier, Julien/AAY-9567-2020; Wang, Ping/GPP-2471-2022","Chevallier, Julien/0000-0002-4423-9502; Chevallier, Julien/0000-0001-9109-0205","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71201010, 71303174]; Ministry of Education of China [11YJC630304]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong [S2012010009991]","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province)","We wish to thank the Editor-in-Chief, Hans Amman, as well as the input from anonymous reviewers for insightful comments which have led to a greatly improved version of our manuscript.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the response to CTV of 10 sour orange (Citrus aurantium) transgenic lines carrying CTV-derived sequences. They were obtained in the laboratories of IVIA, Spain and planted at INTA Experiment Station in Concordia, Argentina, where CTV is endemic and efficiently transmitted by the brown citrus aphid (Toxoptera citricida). Trees were obtained by budding rooted cuttings of transgenic sour orange lines with non-transgenic and virus-free Valencia late sweet orange (C. sinensis). Valencia trees budded on tolerant rootstocks as well as non-transgenic sour orange were planted as controls. Trees were planted in a complete randomized design with two trees per plot and 5 replications. Every six months imprints were taken to determine the progress of CTV infection in each tree.

Our analysis uses new station-level price data from local markets in Ontario, Canada, and a unique market-level measure of consumer responsiveness based on web traffic from gasoline price reporting websites. We first document how stations use coordinated pricing strategies that give rise to large daily changes in price levels and dispersion in cycling gasoline markets.

In urban systems, the complexity of thermodynamic processes and the agents' behaviours generate remarkable impacts on the environment. The phenomenon of Urban Heat Islands (UHI) is pronounced in urbanized areas, where interactions between humans and local environments are not linear. A Multiple Agents System (MAS) approach attentive to agents' behaviours represents an interesting research field. A wide range of ecological or environmental issues may take advantage from models built on the cognitive involvement of stakeholders. This paper aims to explore the system architectures building up to support knowledge-based decision-making processes in managing urban microclimate policies Design/methodology/approach - In order to deal with the multifarious and multiple source knowledge embedded in complex urban systems, we propose a MAS approach to handle climate features and behaviours of human, natural and artificial agents, within a knowledge-based sustainable perspective of urban microclimate comfort. The paper methodology starts from a knowledge base collected through focus-group experimental sessions. Then we applied the Fuzzy Cognitive Mapper (FCM) tool to stakeholders' belief system representation. A FCM methodology allows the use of stakeholders local knowledge or ecological modelling and management in a bottom-up decision-making process. This approach leads to evaluate the complexity of hierarchies and non-formal relations for the constitution of social and environmental management models Originality/value - The paper is the result of investigation on a knowledge interaction arena, focused on the perceptions and behaviours of agents concerning climatic and thermal comfort. The context of interest is the study of impacts among events or trends generated from the elements variation in the urban ecosystem through sensitivity analysis. The attempt carried out is to envision and evaluate possible changes of policies and decisions, so as to envisage possible impacting areas and modify or fine-tune planned policies to attain more effective results Practical implications - The paper works on analyses carried out in a public multifamily building in Bari, toward the attempt to formalizing the energy consumption perception and the users' behaviours concerning UHI phenomena.

Digital age is accelerating written communication is introducing a large number of new signs (monkey, emotions etc.). Although Glagolitic script is not in official use any more its comeback through projects which popularize cultural heritage (project Fabula Croatica for example) has resulted in designing glagolitic fonts (Epistula Croatica and Misal DPG) available for public use. The existance of glagolitic fonts has led to their use in digital medias what brought about the need for introducing new signs to existing Glagolitic script system. The criteria for introducing new signs into the fund of existing glagolitic fonts was the insurance of transcripting given forms to English language. In accordance with the stated criteria it is decided to add signs representing letters Q, X, Y, W and punctuation marks like monkey, ampersand, question mark, exclamation mark and similar to the existing glagolitic font. The authors of this article have proposed their graphic forms with functionality being their main criteria. Designed signs have kept the simplicity in their form and as such contribute previously constructed glagolitic fonts as a unique graphical unit with a clear visual rytham, but also insures the visibility and recognizability of new signs in comparison to the exisiting ones.

The system offers a content-rich environment and a platform for dynamic communication and meaningful interaction between the negotiating parties. Practicing negotiation skills with a system, like Inspire, that supports negotiation decisions at every stage of the process enhances traditional delivery of the language courses and prepares the students both linguistically and intellectually for future challenges in the workplace, including business and entrepreneurship. Methodology - The instructional model adopted for the course is the sustained content instruction. A sustained content language course is similar to other university courses in that it focuses on one theme or topic. Exploration of one theme over a longer period of time lends itself to analysis, evaluation and the development of critical thinking and creates a natural learning environment for language acquisition. Through input from texts, group discussions, problem solving activities and completion of assignments typical for university courses, students build knowledge of the topic as well as cognitive and linguistic skills. Originality - The theme of the course discussed in this paper is Decision-making and conflict resolution through negotiations. There are three main components of the course: the course-pack with readings from the theory of decision-making and negotiations, an individual research assignment where students further hone their knowledge of the topic and on-line business negotiations project for which the Inspire system was used. The adoption of the system was motivated by: (1) its relevance to the theme; (2) the relative novelty of the technology which lent itself to a new learning experience for the students; (3) its potential for immersing the students in the language of negotiations provided by the system; (4) the opportunity for the students to be involved in authentic communication; and (5) its capacity to motivate the students to engage cognitively and emotionally in the process. Practical implications - The adoption of the Inspire system created a unique opportunity for the students to engage in meaningful communication with counterparts from different cultures. The students' feedback indicates that they gained knowledge and skills that prepare them for success in university courses and in professional careers.","Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Carleton University,"Kersten, M (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, 1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,10,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1756,1763,,,,,,8,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200135,0

Contigs from small RNAs were assembled and used to screen sequence homologies against the virus database in GenBank. DNA fragments from CCDD-affected plants were used to re-construct a circular single-stranded DNA viral genome with homologies to geminiviruses. The genome size and organization of the provisionally named Citrus chlorotic dwarf-associated virus (CCDaV) was shown to be a highly divergent member of the family Geminiviridae. Similarly, the whole genome sequence of a putative filamentous virus associated with CYVCD-affected lemon plants was reconstructed. The genome structure was found to be typical of flexiviruses and sequence data suggested that CYVCV is a new species in the genus Mandarivirus. PCR-based assays for CCDaV and CYVCV were developed that will be an important diagnostic tool for citrus disease management programs in Turkey and other citrus-producing regions.","[Loconsole, Giuliana] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Sci Suolo Pianta & Alimenti, Bari, Italy; [Giampetruzzi, Annalisa; Saldarelli, Pasquale; Saponari, Maria] UOS Bari, CNR, Ist Virol Vegetale, Bari, Italy; [Onelge, Nuket] Cukurova Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Plant Protect, Adana, Turkey; [Yokomi, Raymond K.] USDA ARS, Parlier, CA USA",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Cukurova University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Saponari, M (通讯作者)，UOS Bari, CNR, Ist Virol Vegetale, Bari, Italy.",m.saponari@ba.ivv.cnr.it,"Yokomi, Raymond/JNE-8680-2023; Onelge, Nuket/G-1671-2018","LOCONSOLE, Giuliana/0000-0002-5154-7829; Saponari, Maria/0000-0002-4563-8089; GIAMPETRUZZI, Annalisa/0000-0002-0946-0105; Saldarelli, Pasquale/0000-0002-8633-7813",,,,,18,0,1,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,817,824,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600102,0

Fifteen trifoliate types and hybrids, three mandarins and three other citrus species were used as interstocks and compared to the control 'Mexican' lime/Mac. Canopy volume, perimeter of trunk, surface area covered by canopy and yield and yield efficiency were recorded starting at the second year of the plantation. Some interstocks improved the performance of 'Mexican' lime trees in comparison to the control. 'Shekwasha' mandarin, 'C-35' and 'Benton' citrange interstocks developed vigorous trees and were similar or more productive than control trees. 'Morton', 'Benecke' and 'Pomeroy' trifoliate oranges, and Severinia buxifolia showed a moderated effect on tree growth. 'Flying Dragon' and 'Hiryu' trifoliate oranges performed as dwarfing interstocks and consistently produced up to 80 kg/tree during the first period of three years (2 to 4 years) and 130 kg/tree from the fifth to seventh year. Both 'Flying Dragon' and 'Hiryu' interstocks developed the smaller tree size. Dwarfing trees were appropriated to establish higher planting densities up to 600 trees/ha. Many interstocks surpassed the assigned area to growth (24 m(2)) after the 7th year. Tree canopies of 'Flying Dragon' and 'Hiryu' began to overlap after 10 years. Considering the endemic problem of HLB affecting lime orchards, this study provides results that may be useful to coexist productively with this disease in 'Mexican' lime orchards. Dwarfing trees resulted in an estimated production of 70 t/ha/year in HLB-free conditions during the period from second to seventh year. Assuming that HLB may cause an annual loss of 20% of trees since the third year, dwarfing interstocks trees at high density plantations is expected to produce yields up to 30 or 40 t ha(-1) during nine years.","[Medina-Urrutia, Victor M.; Reyes-Hernandez, Jaime E.] Univ Guadalajara, CUCBA, Zapopan Jalisco, Mexico; [Robles-Gonzalez, Marciano M.; Manzanilla-Ramirez, Miguel A.; Velazquez-Monreal, Jose J.] INIFAP Colima, Tecoman, Colima, Mexico",Universidad de Guadalajara,"Medina-Urrutia, VM (通讯作者)，Univ Guadalajara, CUCBA, Zapopan Jalisco, Mexico.",vmmedinau@gmail.com,"Reyes-Hernández, Jaime/AAA-6933-2021","Reyes-Hernández, Jaime/0000-0002-9494-7857; Miguel, Manzanilla/0000-0003-1236-2271",,,,,17,1,1,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,335,343,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600040,0

The major selection traits targeted at that time included yield and fruit quality, compatibility with clementine varieties and tolerance to Phytophthora gummosis, salt and limestone soils. In spite of the outstanding results of some rootstocks revealed by these trials, sour orange continues to be the main rootstock of choice of citrus farmers. Since the year 2000, after a long and intense debate among citrus industry stockholders, a vivid action was initiated to diversify citrus rootstocks in new plantings. While sour orange remained in use, trifoliate hybrids (Carrizo, Troyer, and C-35 citranges), C. volkameriana, and C. macrophylla started to increase in percentage, especially in large scale nurseries. In 2007, during a sanitary survey in the Loukous region Northwest of Morocco, Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) was detected at high incidence in many orchards. An intense effort is actually being devoted to promote the use of CTV tolerant rootstocks. Figures of how each one of these rootstocks has developed during the last 8 years are presented. A preliminary assessment of the impact of the rootstock shift on yield, quality and market reaction is discussed.","[Mohammed, El Guilli] Inst Natl Rech Agron INRA, Kenitra, Morocco; [Zemzami, Mustapha] UCP Domaine Maamora, Domaines Agr DA, Rabat, Morocco",,"Mohammed, E (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Rech Agron INRA, Kenitra, Morocco.",mguilli@yahoo.com,,,,,,,6,4,4,0,1,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,313,317,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600037,0

Forty-five days after inoculation onwards, half of the +AM and -AM plants were irrigated for three months with a nutrient solution containing 50 mM NaCl. Due to the high sensitivity of C. macrophylla to salinity, AM inoculation only partly compensated the growth limitations imposed by salinity. The high intercellular CO2 levels and oxidative stress suffered by -AM plants decreased with AM inoculation. Although salinity strongly decreased photosynthesis in -AM plants, AM colonization alleviated this decrease by increasing total chlorophyll levels. However, the chlorophyll and photosynthesis levels found in +AM plants exposed to salinity were still lower than in control plants, meaning that AM did not completely compensate for the negative effect of salinity on the photosynthetic response. Although AM significantly increased the water percentage in leaves, it did not modify the water potential in plants. Mycorrhizal inoculation increased the osmotic potential and, consequently, decreased turgor, although this decrease did not affect the physiological processes that depend on leaf turgor, such as photosynthesis, which even increased in +AM plants. Given that +AM plants had higher leaf Cl levels than -AM plants but showed better growth and a better physiological response, leaf Cl concentration was not related with salt tolerance in the saline conditions used in this experiment.","[Navarro, Josefa M.; Rodriguez-Moran, Manuel; Perez-Tornero, Olaya] Inst Murciano Invest & Desarrollo Agr & Alimentar, Dept Citricultura, Murcia, Spain; [Morte, Asuncion] Univ Murcia, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Vegetal, Area Bot, Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Navarro, JM (通讯作者)，Inst Murciano Invest & Desarrollo Agr & Alimentar, Dept Citricultura, Murcia, Spain.",josefam.navarro2@carm.es,"Pérez-Tornero, Olaya/Z-4815-2019; Navarro, Josefa M./S-1831-2019; Navarro, Josefa M/Q-6256-2016; Morte, Asuncion/L-4536-2014","Pérez-Tornero, Olaya/0000-0002-2123-1428; Navarro, Josefa M./0000-0002-8811-4576; Navarro, Josefa M/0000-0002-8811-4576; Morte, Asuncion/0000-0002-6426-0202",,,,,36,0,0,0,7,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1351,1358,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600171,0

Three new selections of lemon have been evaluated in a citrus breeding program at IMIDA: 'Finolate', 'Fino Callosa', and 'Garpo', that were compared with 'Fino 49', the most widespread lemon variety in this region. These varieties were originated by spontaneous mutation. The agronomic evaluation indicated that 'Fino Callosa' entered into production earlier than 'Fino 49' and had the highest accumulated yield. In addition, all new lemon selections produced bigger and heavier fruits, allowing earlier harvest than 'Fino 49'. In addition, these new lemon cultivars had less juice content, but the quality of the juice was better than 'Fino 49'. 'Garpo' produced fruits more yellow than 'Fino 49'.

It usually affects fruit at or soon after colour break and is often referred to as 'on-tree' oleocellosis. It is normally associated with extreme wet, cold weather events and with gusty winds. In the Gisborne region in July 2011, some exposed, wet orchards of mainly navel oranges, were adversely affected with up to 50% fruit marking and 60% fruit drop in the worst cases. This prompted a more detailed examination of the condition, a review of the local meteorological and other factors that may have caused the rind breakdown, and some recommendations for growers. These are described, together with a brief comparison of similar pre-harvest rind defects and their management obtained from international literature and correspondence.

Attempts to produce model estimates that are truer to real market behaviours are especially important for transportation, where many important policy decisions rely on such experiments. A recent approach that has emerged makes use of a certainty index whereby respondents report how certain they are about each choice they make. Additional literature also posits that when making decisions, people first identify an acceptable set of alternatives (alternative acceptability) such that a consideration set if formed and it is from this reduced set that the ultimate choice is made. This paper presents two models that jointly estimates choice and choice certainty and choice and alternative acceptability. This joint estimation allows the modeller to overcome potential endogeneity that may exist between these responses. In comparing choices of differing certainty, surprisingly little difference in marginal sensitivities are found. This is not the case in the alternative acceptability models however. An important finding of this research is that what could be interpreted as preference heterogeneity may in fact be more closely linked to scale. The ramifications of these results on future research are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In other terms it is appropriate to ponder and approach the situations in an unconventional way using innovative thinking. The paper analyses the use of projective techniques as tool for stimulating innovative thinking in organization. These techniques are generally used in the field of psychotherapy, forensic and market research. However they can be advantageously used in business and can pave the way to bring more innovation into organization. Design/methodology/approach - This research is based on a case study carried out at a research marketing company which uses projective techniques as a tool to support, lead and develop innovative thinking. The research was conducted in two main phases. In the first phase we analyzed literature on projective techniques, putting particular attention on their use in practice. Then, attending a series of focus groups and interviews we examined the employ of the techniques in the investigated company. Finally, combining the gained theoretical and practical insights we designed a matrix tool for helping users of projective techniques in various phases of the business life cycle. Originality/value - This paper represents one of the first attempts to investigate at practical level, the application of projective techniques in a business landscape. Specifically, it shows how the projective techniques can be applied at various stages of the company's life cycle: from initial idea generation up to the change management stage. Practical implications - In today's business landscape, organizations need to identify new approaches for developing creativity and innovation. Projective techniques can be deployed as effective tools to develop the innovative thinking of management and employees and as an approach to capture insights from customers. The paper suggests insights on the practice use of projective techniques and provides a matrix to guide the application of the techniques in company's life cycle.","[Santarsiero, Francesco] Univ Basilicata, Econ, I-85100 Potenza, Italy; [Carlucci, Daniela] Univ Basilicata, Dept European & Mediterranean Cultures Environm &, I-75100 Matera, Italy; [Schiuma, Giovanni] Univ Basilicata, Dept Math Comp Sci & Econ DIMIE, I-85100 Potenza, Italy",University of Basilicata; University of Basilicata; University of Basilicata,"Santarsiero, F (通讯作者)，Univ Basilicata, Econ, Via Ateneo Lucano 10, I-85100 Potenza, Italy.",,"Santarsiero, Francesco/AFQ-9659-2022; Schiuma, Giovanni/AAO-9916-2020","Santarsiero, Francesco/0000-0001-9947-4238; Schiuma, Giovanni/0000-0003-4990-9330",,,,,9,0,0,0,7,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2410,2419,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200189,0

Its role in economic development can be seen through partnerships and cooperation by engaging in business investments in opening new plants and facilities, the introduction of modern technology, to create new employment opportunities and stop the emigration of young people, who are increasingly looking to other countries in terms of quality of life and dignity for themselves and their families. There are various models that are recommended for use in economic development, in order to be a successful business, and use more favorable funds from domestic sources, as well as EU funds and donor funds of international monetary institutions. In the 1990s usage of the Triple Helix model was recommended for economic development, which is supposed to include the three important factors for starting businesses, namely: government, through incentives and stimulation of entrepreneurship, companies and the inclusion of the scientific sector and universities. Soon, due to the need for more competitive development of companies and export to world markets, the application of Quad Helix model was recommended for the development and prosperity of a company. That means in addition to the public sector, businesses and research institution, non-governmental organizations were introduced in stimulation of development. The fourth participant proved to be necessary to include the civil sector in the preparation of analyses of the current situation in the society, making the overall development programs, as strategic documents for development, development of business plans, investment studies, feasibility studies, cost-benefit analyses (CBA) and programs in accordance to propositions of the Project Cycle Management (PCM) methodology for development, in order to use funds of the European Union (EU) and resources of other international monetary institutions. With regard to the process of globalization, competition and access to the world unknown markets, the role of the diaspora is becoming increasingly important in the business world. Diaspora involvement in the economic development in the Penta Helix model assumes partnerships with existing companies, investment in new plants and existing companies with modern equipment in order to be competitive in an increasingly demanding global market. In addition diaspora is well organized around the world. Successful Croatian entrepreneurs recognized in the business world are members of the Croatian Fraternal Union (Hrvatska Bratska Zajednica)(1), and members of a scientific organization in the Alma Matris Croatiae Alumni (AMCA)(2). Through its already beaten track and achievements, their involvement through the model Penta Helix will add to faster recovery from the recession and boost Croatia's economic development. This model is called Penta Helix which means in addition to the existing impact of the previous four components of Quad helix model, it adds a fifth component, the diaspora, as an essential element in investing and opening foreign markets to entrepreneurs, with regard to competition and the globalization process. The aim of this work is to highlight the need to involve the diaspora, with the support and stimulation of the Government, involve entrepreneurs, universities and civil society, in launching the accelerated development of the Eastern Croatia region and the whole Republic of Croatia.","[Veckie, Edward; Veckie, Vlado Walter] Unified Engn Com Corp, Hamilton, ON L8L 6A8, Canada",,,masek.efos@gmail.com; eveckie@unifiedengineering.com; walterv@unifiedengineering.com,,,,,,,2,1,1,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,385,393,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100037,0

In this paper we want to show the impact of climate changes, because they exist and can be felt on a daily basis. We chose the region of Oltenia as our study zone, because the climate changes from here can be felt both in the atmospheric and in the soil characteristics, especially in its texture. Because of the changes in climatic conditions, the soil is also constantly changing compared to the climatic conditions to which it was initially adapted to. We take into consideration the following agrometeorological parameters: rainfall, average temperature, moisture reserve, heat intensity, factors that lead to the degradation of the soil, respectively to the downfall in crop production of the winter wheat and corn crops.

Since the nineteenth century, British Conservatism had represented a comfortable synthesis of a soft Burkean traditionalism and class-based paternalism with an effort to expand the party's appeal to the working class. Thatcher's aggressive neoliberal challenge to this tradition never truly displaced the older paternalistic sense of noblesse oblige or the preference for societal consensus and incremental change. Instead, the two elements came into an uneasy coexistence that has informed Tory ambivalence about the EU. This article argues that Cameron's gradual distancing of Britain from the EU has paralleled his championing of economic austerity at home. It argues further that Cameron's policy-making response to the post-2007 economic downturn and European debt crisis can best be understood as a reflection of unresolved tensions within British Conservative thought.

Graft-inoculation of sweet orange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb.) seedlings in the greenhouse with non-scaled bark pieces from an infected tree incites the psorosis A syndrome (PsA), including a shock reaction of the first flush and transient chlorotic flecking in young leaves of the following flushes, whereas inoculation with scaled bark pieces incites the psorosis B syndrome (PsB), that in addition to PsA symptoms includes gummy pustules in old leaves and branches. Psorosis disease is presumably caused by Citrus psorosis virus (CPsV), an ophiovirus with three negative-stranded genomic RNAs. While comparison of RNA1 or RNA3 fragments by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis did not show any difference between plants affected by the PsA or the PsB syndromes, a fragment of RNA2 enabled discriminating both syndromes by their SSCP profile. A plant inoculated with scaled bark did not show PsB at 6 months post-inoculation (mpi) and its RNA2 gave a PsA-type SSCP profile. At 12 mpi this plant showed pustules in the trunk but not in the leaves. SSCP analysis of RNA2 showed only PsA-type variants in the leaves, whereas the pustuled trunk areas contained both PsA and PsB variants, the latter being predominant. These results suggest that psorosis-affected trees contain the two sequence variants and that the PsB variant is associated with pustules and tends to accumulate in the trunk bark.","[Velazquez, Karelia; Alba, Lorena; Pina, Jose A.; Navarro, Luis; Moreno, Pedro; Guerri, Jose] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain",Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA),"Velázquez, K (通讯作者)，Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain.",velazquez_kar@gva.es,"VELAZQUEZ, KARELIA/ABG-7582-2020","VELAZQUEZ, KARELIA/0000-0002-8108-9937; Alba-Castellon, Lorena/0000-0003-3449-7820",,,,,23,1,1,0,1,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,837,845,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600105,0

Out of the 61 accessions tested 54 showed symptoms and reacted by ELISA with a CPsV-specific antibody, 2 (M. inodora and F. hindsii) were symptomless but gave high ELISA values, suggesting tolerance to CPsV, 5 (C. depresa, Cleopatra mandarin, C. excavata, Carrizo citrange and CPB 4475 citrumelo) showed symptoms in the first flush but gave a negative ELISA reaction, and 1 (Poncirus trifoliata) was ELISA negative and symptomless. We then examined CPsV infection by ELISA and RT-PCR in Cleopatra mandarin, P. trifoliata and Citrumelo seedlings inoculated with CPsV isolates P 121, PB 108 and PB 143. While P 121 was detected in all Cleopatra and citrumelo plants, the other isolates were detected in only 50% of the inoculated plants, with all plants indexed as CPsV positive displaying symptoms. All P. trifoliata plants inoculated with either isolate indexed negative for CPsV and remained symptomless.

The analysis is performed using data from the first wave of the Growing Up in Ireland survey, a nationally representative survey of 8568 nine-year-old children conducted in 2007 and 2008. We estimate concentration indices to quantify the extent of the socioeconomic gradient in childhood obesity and undertake a subsequent decomposition analysis to pinpoint the key factors underpinning the observed inequalities. Overall the results confirm a strong socioeconomic gradient in childhood obesity in the Republic of Ireland. Concentration indices of obesity (CI = -0.168) and overweight/obese (CI = -0.057) show that the gradient is more pronounced in obese children, while results from the decomposition analysis suggest that the majority of the inequality in childhood obesity is explained by parental level variables. Our findings suggest that addressing childhood obesity inequalities requires coordinated policy responses at both the child and parental level. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We identify from the correlation matrix six clusters of time series exhibiting evident geographical traits, which supports Weiner's (Energy J 12:95-107.1991) regionalization hypothesis of the global oil market. We find that intra-cluster pairs of time series are highly correlated, while inter-cluster pairs have relatively low correlations. Principal component analysis shows that most eigenvalues of the correlation matrix locate outside the prediction of the random matrix theory and these deviating eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors contain rich economic information. Specifically, the largest eigenvalue reflects a collective effect of the global market, the other four largest eigenvalues possess a partitioning function to distinguish the six clusters, and the smallest eigenvalues highlight the pairs of time series with the largest correlation coefficients. We construct an index of the global oil market based on the eigenportfolio of the largest eigenvalue, which evolves similarly as the average price time series and has better performance than the benchmark 1 / N portfolio under the buy-and-hold strategy.","[Dai, Yue-Hua; Xie, Wen-Jie; Jiang, Zhi-Qiang; Zhou, Wei-Xing] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Jiang, George J.] Washington State Univ, Dept Finance & Management Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Zhou, Wei-Xing] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China",East China University of Science & Technology; Washington State University; East China University of Science & Technology,"Zhou, WX (通讯作者)，East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.;Zhou, WX (通讯作者)，East China Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.",george.jiang@wsu.edu; wxzhou@ecust.edu.cn,"XIE, Wen-Jie/ABC-4603-2021; Zhou, Wei-Xing/B-1250-2008; XIE, Wen-Jie/H-5534-2016; Jiang, Zhi-Qiang/B-5746-2008","XIE, Wen-Jie/0000-0001-6602-5057; Zhou, Wei-Xing/0000-0002-8952-8228;",National Natural Science Foundation of China [11075054]; Shanghai (Follow-up) Rising Star Program [11QH1400800]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai (Follow-up) Rising Star Program; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 11075054), the Shanghai (Follow-up) Rising Star Program (Grant No. 11QH1400800), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.",,38,37,38,5,36,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The difficulties encountered in the various attempts to define the marginal product either of capital or of a capital good are recalled and the conclusion is drawn that neither concept appears theoretically sound. This historical reconstruction is combined with critical discussion of the recent attempt by Paul Samuelson to determine income distribution by means of the Master Function, a device previously developed and presented by Samuelson himself with Erkko Etula, and its non-neoclassical marginal products. Rather than the existence of a continuum of alternative technical possibilities, this construction assumes the simultaneous use of a discrete number of methods of production for the same commodity. Even though each technique employs the inputs in fixed proportions, the coexistence of various techniques permits the full employment of an arbitrarily given vector of input endowments. As is shown here, however, the coexistence of methods required for the differentiability of the Master Function can take place, if heterogenous capital goods are used in production, neither in the case with stationary relative prices nor in the non-stationary Arrow-Debreu framework.","[Fratini, Saverio M.] Roma Tre Univ, Dipartimento Econ, Via Silvio DAmico 77, I-00145 Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Fratini, SM (通讯作者)，Roma Tre Univ, Dipartimento Econ, Via Silvio DAmico 77, I-00145 Rome, Italy.",saveriomaria.fratini@uniroma3.it,"FRATINI, Saverio Maria/B-6417-2013","FRATINI, Saverio Maria/0000-0003-0766-0741; Dvoskin, Ariel/0000-0001-6603-6012",,,,,32,4,4,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

What is more, Brazil's new role as a major agricultural trader has provided an important foundation for its enhanced status and influence in global economic governance, as an emerging power and one of the BRICS'. This paper analyses how such a remarkable transformation was brought about. I argue that Brazil's emergence as an agricultural powerhouse was the result not of its natural factor endowments, but extensive intervention on the part of the Brazilian state that had the effect of constructing a new comparative advantage. This transformation was propelled by state-driven innovation and related policies that opened up massive new areas of the country to agriculture, enabled it to shift to producing goods in direct competition with the world's dominant agricultural exporters, and generated significant gains in productivity and competitiveness. The irony is that the intention of these policies, initiated in the 1970s, was to foster industrial development in Brazil as part of its import-substitution industrialisation programme, yet they wound up having precisely the opposite effect - transforming Brazil into one of the world's dominant agricultural powers.","[Hopewell, Kristen] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Hopewell, K (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",kristen.hopewell@ed.ac.uk,,,"US National Science Foundation [0927598]; Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada [75220060755]; Fulbright Fellowship; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0927598] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0927598] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Fulbright Fellowship; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This research was supported by the US National Science Foundation [grant no. 0927598], the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (grant no. 75220060755), and a Fulbright Fellowship.",,97,18,21,3,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In the proposed model, this paper also considers the situations in which undesirable outputs are jointly produced with desirable outputs, the reduction of undesirable outputs is associated with the reduction of energy inputs, and some inputs are dedicated to the specific sub-unit while some inputs are shared among sub-units. To comprehensively investigate this issue, two cases are discussed. One case explores the situation in which common inputs are shared among the first process of sub-units, while the other case explores the situation in which common inputs are also shared among two processes of sub-units. The proposed model is illustrated in an empirical example of 14 Asian shipping routes operated by a Taiwanese container shipping company. In order to avoid organizational resistance, minor and major adjustment policies are demonstrated. The minor adjustment policy transfers inputs among routes but maintains the original levels of input resources, whereas the major adjustment policy reduces the total amount of input resources. The results provide valuable information for the centralized decision-maker on how to reallocate resources among the sub-units. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a unique individual-level, longitudinal data set, this study examines mobility rates and residential destinations of residents in gentrifying neighborhoods during the recent housing boom and bust in Philadelphia for various strata of residents and different types of gentrification. We find that vulnerable residents, those with low credit scores and without mortgages, are generally no more likely to move from gentrifying neighborhoods compared with their counterparts in nongentrifying neighborhoods. When they do move, however, they are more likely to move to lower-income neighborhoods. Residents in gentrifying neighborhoods at the aggregate level have slightly higher mobility rates, but these rates are largely driven by more advantaged residents. These findings shed new light on the heterogeneity in mobility patterns across residents in gentrifying neighborhoods and suggest that researchers should focus more attention on the quality of residential moves and nonmoves for less advantaged residents, rather than mobility rates alone.","[Ding, Lei; Divringi, Eileen] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Ten Independence Mall, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA; [Hwang, Jackelyn] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia; Princeton University,"Ding, L (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Ten Independence Mall, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA.",lei.ding@phil.frb.org,,,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development of the National Institutes of Health [T32HD007163],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development of the National Institutes of Health,"The authors would like to thank Jeffrey Lin, Ingrid G.

In doing so, we focus on how remittances affect the sustainability rather than the size of current account balances. We find that the presence of remittances makes it more likely that exports and imports are cointegrated, thereby lending support to current account sustainability. Furthermore, quantile regression analysis suggests that increased remittances are associated with a faster speed of current account adjustment towards long-run equilibrium, particularly for those countries characterised by already highly persistent current account balances. In contrast to a literature that emphasises an adverse Dutch disease impact of workers' remittances on the real exchange rate in terms of reduced external competitiveness, our findings suggest that remittances are actually beneficial to the current account balance.","[Hassan, Gazi M.; Holmes, Mark J.] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand",University of Waikato,"Hassan, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand.",,"Holmes, Mark J./A-4117-2010; Hassan, Gazi/AAI-3282-2020",,,,,,49,10,11,1,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2016,39.0,11.0,,,,,1834,1853,,10.1111/twec.12361,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,EB7FW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387552900007,0

Working paper no. 48-80 of the Foerder Institute for Economic Research, Faculty of Social Sciences, Tel Aviv University, 1980). A decision-maker is supposed to possess a preference relation on acts and another preference relation on state-prize lotteries, both of which are assumed to satisfy the von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms. In addition, the two preference relations restricted to a state of nature are assumed to agree. We show that these axioms are necessary and sufficient for the existence of subjective expected utility over acts with state-dependent utility functions and a subjective probability measure. This subjective probability measure is unique when conditioned on the set of states of nature in which not all the prizes are equally desirable.","[Karni, Edi] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Karni, Edi] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Schmeidler, David] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel",Johns Hopkins University; University of Warwick; Tel Aviv University,"Karni, E (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.;Karni, E (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",karni@jhu.edu,,,Israeli Science Foundation under ISF [204/13],Israeli Science Foundation under ISF(Israel Science Foundation),Very useful comments and suggestions by an anonymous referee and Jean Baccelli are gratefully acknowledged.

Precisely, the employment status affects the probability to get a mortgage. In turn, the granting or not of the mortgage affects the housing tenure choice (tenancy or owner occupancy). Finally, the housing tenure choice affects the unemployment rate. It will show that tenants generate a greater effort in searching for a job than homeowners, since employed workers have a greater chance of getting a mortgage to buy a home. As a result, the positive correlation between the homeownership and unemployment rates emerges as quite consistent with the evidence that homeowners tend to be unemployed less often than tenants.","[Lisi, Gaetano] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, Via S Angelo, I-03043 Cassino, FR, Italy",University of Cassino,"Lisi, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, Via S Angelo, I-03043 Cassino, FR, Italy.",gaetano.lisi@unicas.it,,,,,,,27,3,3,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

We employ the DDF as a tool for analyzing a joint production function with both desirable and undesirable outputs (i.e., the number of accidents). A comparison between the results with and without accidents shows that several SRTUs have experienced significant changes in their efficiency scores as well as in their rankings after accounting for the undesirable output. This indicates the importance of including the number of accidents - a safety standard - as representative of the undesirable output in computing the efficiency scores of SRTUs. The results of the Tobit model indicate that SRTUs with greater vehicle productivity are more efficient under both conventional DEA and DDF approaches. We also employed zero-truncated negative binomial model to assess the factors influencing the number of road accident experienced by the Indian SRTUs and found that the accident count was significantly influenced by fleet utilization and vehicle productivity.

(Empir Econ 37:153-184, 2009), which models the profit-maximizing dynamic oil production from a large oil field in Saudi Arabia by using an engineering model of oil extraction. Although it gives an important insight about the dynamics of oil production by examining and comparing different scenarios for exogenous variables, it assumes perfect knowledge and foresight about the future. However, the production decision might not be based on different scenarios, but rather on different expectations about the future. Therefore, we propose to extend the model by incorporating uncertainty arising from a random arrival date of a new backstop technology that will enable the production of a perfect substitute for oil. We find that the optimal production path has a different dynamic under this new specification that may explain the less aggressive extraction behavior of the producer before 2000, which was concluded to be economically irrational by Gao et al.

As both the electricity and the natural gas market rely on networks, congestion in one market may lead to changes in the other. In addition, investment in one market impacts investment in the other market to the extent that these investments may even become substitutes for each another. The objective of this paper is to develop a dynamic model representation of coupled natural gas and electricity network markets to test the potential interaction with respect to investments. The model is tested under simplified conditions as well as for a stylized European network setting.

However, the demand forecasts, cost estimates, benefit valuations and effect assessments that are conducted as part of CBAs are all subject to various degrees of uncertainty. The question is to what extent CBAs, given such uncertainties, are still useful as a way to prioritize between infrastructure investments, or put differently, how robust the policy conclusions of CBA are with respect to uncertainties. Using simulations based on real data on national infrastructure plans in Sweden and Norway, we study how investment selection and total realized benefits change when decisions are based on CBA assessments subject to several different types of uncertainty. Our results indicate that realized benefits and investment selection are surprisingly insensitive to all studied types of uncertainty, even for high levels of uncertainty. The two types of uncertainty that affect results the most are uncertainties about investment cost and transport demand. Provided that decisions are based on CBA outcomes, reducing uncertainty is still worthwhile, however, because of the huge sums at stake. Even moderate reductions of uncertainties about unit values, investment costs, future demand and project effects may increase the realized benefits infrastructure investment plans by tens or hundreds of million euros. We conclude that, despite the many types of uncertainties, CBA is able to fairly consistently separate the wheat from the chaff and hence contribute to substantially improved infrastructure decisions.

Candidates vary only by quality. Campaign choices determine the subject of public deliberation: If a candidate runs a positive campaign and his rival a negative campaign, the voters learn the quality of the focal candidate. Thus, negative campaigns may be used either to expose the rival candidate (informative role) or to turn attention away from oneself (non-informative role). The effect of negative campaigns depends on whether it is faced with another negative campaign (cross talk) or a positive campaign (fruitful debate). We suggest that in order to ascertain the effect of negative advertising, studies should take into account the campaigns employed by both candidates. Voter beliefs about candidate quality plays a major role in campaign selection: while the incidence of negative campaigning goes down as the prior probability of a candidate being good increases, the probability of selection of the correct candidate is non-monotonic in the said prior.","[Bhattacharya, Sourav] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Econ, Egham, Surrey, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Bhattacharya, S (通讯作者)，Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Econ, Egham, Surrey, England.",sourav.bhattacharya@rhul.ac.uk,,,"Wallis Institute of Political Economy, University of Rochester","Wallis Institute of Political Economy, University of Rochester","I thank David Austen-Smith, Allen Brierly, Steve Callander, Joyee Deb, Alexandre Debs, Tim Feddersen, Yuk-Fai Fong, Sean Gailmard, Bard Harstad, Jaehoon Kim, George Krause, Tapas Kundu, Marciano Siniscalchi, seminar participants at MPSA conference (2006), Michigan State University and CIDE, Mexico for comments and suggestions.

We hypothesize that this powerful current of internal migrants is changing the nature of traditional institutions such as informal risk sharing. Mass internal migration has created geographically disperse networks, on which we collected detailed panel data. By quantifying how shocks and consumption covary across linked households, we show that, while both migrants and stayers insure negative shocks to stayers, there is no one in the network who insures the migrants' negative shocks. While migrants do share some of their positive shocks, they ultimately end up nearly twice as rich as those at home by 2010, despite practically identical baseline positions in the early nineties before migration. Taken together, these findings point to migration as a risky but profitable endeavor, for which the migrant will bear the risk and also reap most of the benefit. We interpret these results within the existing literature on risk sharing and on the disincentive effects of redistributive norms.","[De Weerdt, Joachim] Univ Antwerp, IOB, Antwerp, Belgium; [De Weerdt, Joachim] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS, Leuven, Belgium; [Hirvonen, Kalle] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of Antwerp; KU Leuven; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"De Weerdt, J (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, IOB, Antwerp, Belgium.;De Weerdt, J (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS, Leuven, Belgium.",joachim.deweerdt@uantwerpen.be; k.hirvonen@cgiar.org,,"Hirvonen, Kalle/0000-0003-2057-1612; De Weerdt, Joachim/0000-0002-5572-3332",Rockwool Foundation; World Bank; AFD; IRD; AIRD through the Health Risks and Migration grant of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I900934/1]; Finnish Cultural Foundation; Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; ESRC [ES/I900934/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Rockwool Foundation; World Bank(The World Bank India); AFD; IRD; AIRD through the Health Risks and Migration grant of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Finnish Cultural Foundation(Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish IT center for science); Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The fieldwork was primarily funded by the Rockwool Foundation and the World Bank, with additional funds provided by AFD, IRD, and AIRD through the Health Risks and Migration grant of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.

In this article, the authors apply a cluster analysis for the segmentation of rural tourism in La Palma, Canary Islands. They consider the level of environmental attitudes of tourists as a variable explaining market segmentation. The results show that there is a large heterogeneity of market segments and that the traditional activity of agro-tourism represents a small share of the total market. The segments with a greater economic impact and producing greater tourist satisfaction are those in which tourists also exhibit higher levels of environmental behaviour. Thus, rural tourist destinations can improve their economic performance by focusing on those segments attracting tourists with higher environmental concern and by adopting policies that enhance the environmental profile of the segments.","[Fernandez-Hernandez, Carlos; Diaz-Pere, Flora] Univ La Laguna, E-38207 San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain; [Leon, Carmelo J.; Arana, Jorge E.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"León, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Fac Econ, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",cleon@daea.ulpgc.es,"Araña, Jorge E./D-1139-2011","Araña, Jorge E./0000-0003-0878-9934; FERNANDEZ HERNANDEZ, CARLOS/0000-0001-9460-8073","European FEDER Fund from Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain [ECO2014-60058-P]; Agencia Canaria de Investigacion, Innovacion y Sociedad de la Informacion [PI2007/040]; Institutions Asociacion de Turismo Rural Isla Bonita (by LEADER+); Asociacion para el Desarrollo Rural de la Isla de La Palma (ADER-La Palma); Patronato de Turismo del Excmo","European FEDER Fund from Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain; Agencia Canaria de Investigacion, Innovacion y Sociedad de la Informacion; Institutions Asociacion de Turismo Rural Isla Bonita (by LEADER+); Asociacion para el Desarrollo Rural de la Isla de La Palma (ADER-La Palma); Patronato de Turismo del Excmo","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: The authors fully acknowledge financial support for this work by the European FEDER Fund through scientific Projects ECO2014-60058-P from Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain and PI2007/040 from the Agencia Canaria de Investigacion, Innovacion y Sociedad de la Informacion, and from Institutions Asociacion de Turismo Rural Isla Bonita (by LEADER+), Asociacion para el Desarrollo Rural de la Isla de La Palma (ADER-La Palma) and Patronato de Turismo del Excmo.

We examine in this article whether a non-governmental actor, the distinctively neutral and independent International Committee of the Red Cross, whose mission includes the promotion of humanitarian law and the protection of the civilian population, has such a restraining effect on the conflict parties. Our results suggest that the more time has passed since the ratification of the relevant Geneva Conventions and Protocols, the larger is the risk of civilian victimization. We cannot find evidence that the ICRC's presence in conflict zones and the seminars it conducts to spread humanitarian law make a crucial difference. Case studies of Bosnia and Darfur indicate that shaming strategies and thus a relatively unusual instrument for the traditionally neutral actor did not abate the killings; the statistical evidence in the form of Granger causality tests rather show that the killing and harming precedes the naming and shaming.","[Bussmann, Margit] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Dept Polit Sci & Commun, Baderstr 6-7, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Schneider, Gerald] Univ Konstanz, Dept Polit & Publ Adm, Box 86, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Schneider, Gerald] Univ Konstanz, Grad Sch Decis Sci, Box 86, D-78457 Constance, Germany",Universitat Greifswald; University of Konstanz; University of Konstanz,"Schneider, G (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Polit & Publ Adm, Box 86, D-78457 Constance, Germany.;Schneider, G (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Grad Sch Decis Sci, Box 86, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",Margit.Bussmann@uni-greifswald.de; Gerald.Schneider@uni-konstanz.de,"Schneider, Gerald/A-1903-2012","Schneider, Gerald/0000-0002-0091-6217",Deutsche Stiftung Friedensforschung [DSF 004/07],Deutsche Stiftung Friedensforschung,"The article has profited from comments by the audiences at several conferences and seminars.

Spatial subcenters and complex spatial association structures may, therefore, exist or, stated differently, horizontal market segmentation might be prevalent. Moreover, it is not unlikely for the housing price generating market mechanisms to vary across different parts of the conditional price distribution. This can ultimately cause disparate price segments to exhibit varying functional relationships through different subsets of characteristics and lead to vertical market segmentation. In order to take nonlinearity, horizontal and vertical market segmentation into account within the scope of housing price regressions, we propose incorporating a semiparametric approach into the quantile regression framework. In our empirical application, we investigate rental data from the German city of Regensburg, which contains an Old Town on the World Heritage List. Focusing on location effects exerted by the World Heritage Site, we illustrate how statements about horizontal and vertical market segmentation can be derived from a semiparametric quantile regression model based on empirical evidence and economic reasoning.

This raises fundamental questions on the role of private actors in public policy-making apart from their roles as lobbyists and contractors. From a democratic perspective, the involuntary public policy-making by European lawyers is particularly problematic as it involves guardians of the rule of law who, we argue, are simultaneously forced to act as agents of the state. In the case of AML/CTF, lawyers are within the political system rather than outside it. We show that expectations concerning how lawyers are to work closely with the state in the United Kingdom and Sweden differ, and that the policy-making styles lawyers apply in practice were either 'pragmatic' (UK) or 'evasive' (Sweden). Our findings provide a first step in understanding the new role of for-profit professionals as involuntary public policy-makers, and its possible effects.","[Helgesson, Karin Svedberg] Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Morth, Ulrika] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm School of Economics; Stockholm University,"Mörth, U (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stockholm, Sweden.",Ulrika.morth@statsvet.su.se,"Helgesson, Karin Svedberg/Q-6338-2019","Helgesson, Karin Svedberg/0000-0002-6382-8302",Ragnar Soderberg Foundation [EF3/12/10]; Swedish Research Council [HS 2014-648],Ragnar Soderberg Foundation; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"The authors are very grateful for the financial support from the Ragnar Soderberg Foundation (Grant EF3/12/10), and from the Swedish Research Council (Grant HS 2014-648).

Using stochastic search variable selection priors, the paper deals with the issue of model uncertainty in a flexible and computationally efficient way. The paper uses Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo to simultaneously account for threshold effects, model uncertainty, and spatial dependence in regional growth regression models.

As society becomes more tolerant, gay and lesbian populations are an increasingly visible social group, yet they have received scant attention by transportation scholars. This paper builds on this nascent literature by documenting and attempting to explain these dramatic differences by controlling for factors known to influence mode choice. We perform two separate analyses employing two distinct datasets. The first analysis examines journey-to-work data from the American Community Survey. The second analysis focuses in specifically on non-motorized (walking, biking) travel using use self-reported walk and bike frequency from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey. In both, we find that characteristics of the neighborhoods in which gays and lesbians live, as well characteristics of the individuals themselves, only explain part of the increased propensity to use alternative modes of transportation; a strong residual effect remains.

Based on this insight, this article develops an ideal-typology of possible localization' outcomes. Apart from a literal adoption of an international norm, we show that the domestic implementation may change its emphasis (accentuation), amend it by supplementary purposes (addition), or imply a deviation which nevertheless sticks to the letter of the international wording (subversion). We argue that the specific form of localization depends on the interaction between international pressure politics and its congruence with the prevailing domestic public and private preferences. International power constellations explain why an international norm is implemented, but the specific character of its localization is mainly determined by domestic actor constellations. To substantiate our claims, we analyze the implementation of two interconnected international agreements in India and Brazil. While both the Convention on Biodiversity and the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights introduce the norm of property rights for intellectual knowledge in previously (at least internationally) unregulated fields, the particular characteristics of their respective implementation in both countries display the interaction between international pressure and domestic preferences in our four case studies.","[Eimer, Thomas R.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Luetz, Susanne] Free Univ Berlin, Otto Suhr Inst Polit Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Schueren, Verena] INTERVAL GmbH, Berlin, Germany",Radboud University Nijmegen; Free University of Berlin,"Eimer, TR (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Nijmegen, Netherlands.",,,,German Research Foundation [SFB 700-TP D7],German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The article summarizes some findings from a research project funded by the German Research Foundation (Project SFB 700-TP D7).,,84,13,14,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

An examination of the seasonally differenced tourism time series reveals that the fractional differencing parameter, d, with allowance for an autocorrelated error process, is strictly below 1, implying that shocks are transitory and disappear relatively quickly.","[Gil-Alana, Luis A.] Univ Navarra, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain; [Mervar, Andrea] Inst Econ, Zagreb, Croatia; [Payne, James E.] Georgia Coll & State Univ, Milledgeville, GA USA",University of Navarra; University of Zagreb; Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); University System of Georgia; Georgia College & State University,"Payne, JE (通讯作者)，Georgia Coll & State Univ, J Whitney Bunting Coll Business, Milledgeville, GA 31061 USA.",james.payne@gcsu.edu,"Mervar, Andrea/Q-1521-2019; Payne, James/IZQ-1848-2023; Payne, James/Q-9569-2019","Mervar, Andrea/0000-0003-4288-9533;",,,,,20,13,13,0,4,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Second, geographic spillovers have not been adequately incorporated into tests of the PHH. We overcome these issues utilizing two novel identification strategies within a model incorporating spillovers.

The approach is useful when the underlying time and/or money budgets driving a choice situation are unobserved, but the expenditures on the choice alternatives of interest are observed. Several MDCEV applications hitherto used the observed total expenditure on the choice alternatives as the budget to model expenditure allocation among choice alternatives. This does not allow for increases or decreases in the total expenditure due to changes in choice alternative specific attributes, but only allows a reallocation of the observed total expenditure among different alternatives. The stochastic frontier approach helps address this issue by invoking the notion that consumers operate under latent budgets that can be conceived (and modeled) as the maximum possible expenditure they are willing to incur. The proposed method is applied to analyze the daily out-of-home activity participation and time-use patterns in a survey sample of non-working adults in Florida. First, a stochastic frontier regression is performed on the observed out-of-home activity time expenditure (OH-ATE) to estimate the unobserved out-of-home activity time frontier (OH-ATF). The estimated frontier is interpreted as a subjective limit or maximum possible time individuals can allocate to out-of-home activities and used as the time budget governing out-of-home time-use choices in an MDCEV model. The efficacy of this approach is compared with other approaches for estimating time budgets for the MDCEV model, including: (a) a log-linear regression on the total observed expenditure for out-of-home activities and (b) arbitrarily assumed, constant time budgets for all individuals in the sample. A comparison of predictive accuracy in time-use patterns suggests that the stochastic frontier and log-linear regression approaches perform better than arbitrary assumptions on time budgets. Between the stochastic frontier and log-linear regression approaches, the former results in slightly better predictions of activity participation rates while the latter results in slightly better predictions of activity durations. A comparison of policy simulations demonstrates that the stochastic frontier approach allows for the total out-of-home activity time expenditure to either expand or shrink due to changes in alternative-specific attributes. The log-linear regression approach allows for changes in total time expenditure due to changes in decision-maker attributes, but not due to changes in alternative-specific attributes.

A search and matching model with sticky nominal wages but flexible prices can match all three facts. In contrast, a model with flexible nominal wages and flexible prices does not match the first two facts, and a model with flexible nominal wages but sticky prices does not match the second fact.

Drawing on the party competition literature, we demonstrate that variations in both supply (parties) and demand (voters) produce considerable dissimilarity between regional and state results, with lower levels of consolidation and greater fractionalization at the regional level. We show that political cleavages operate differently across levels, that regional distinctiveness rather than regional authority better predicts first order-ness in regional elections, and that voters display varying tolerance for polarization at the regional and state level.","[Henderson, Ailsa] Univ Edinburgh, Polit & Int Relat, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Romanova, Valentyna] Natl Inst Strateg Studies, Kiev, Ukraine",University of Edinburgh,"Henderson, A (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Polit & Int Relat, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",ailsa.henderson@ed.ac.uk,"Romanova, Valentyna/AAQ-7200-2021; Romanova, Valentyna/AAF-8445-2020","Romanova, Valentyna/0000-0002-0889-2328; Romanova, Valentyna/0000-0002-0889-2328",,,,,137,4,4,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

It shows that building height limits lead to urban sprawl and higher emissions from commuting. On the other hand, aggregate housing consumption may decrease, which reduces emissions from residential energy use. A numerical model is used to evaluate whether total GHG emissions may be lower under building height restrictions. Welfare is not concave in the strictness of building height limits, so either no limit or a very strict one (depending on the strength of the externality) might maximize welfare.

In this paper, we derive a new representation of the transformation of the data that is implied by the HP filter. This representation highlights that the HP filter is a symmetric weighted average plus a number of adjustments that are important near the beginning and end of the sample. The representation allows us to carry out a rigorous analysis of properties of the HP filter without using the ARMA-based approximation that has been used previously in the literature. Using this new representation, we characterize the large T behavior of the HP filter and find conditions under which it is asymptotically equivalent to a symmetric weighted average with weights independent of sample size. We also find that the cyclical component of the HP filter possesses weak dependence properties when the HP filter is applied to a stationary mixing process, a linear deterministic trend process, or a process with a unit root. This provides the first formal justification of the use of the HP filter as a tool to achieve weak dependence in a time series. In addition, a large smoothing parameter approximation to the HP filter is derived, and using this approximation, we find an alternative justification for the procedure given in Ravn and Uhlig (2002) for adjusting the smoothing parameter for the data frequency.","[de Jong, Robert M.; Sakarya, Neslihan] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"de Jong, RM (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",,,"Sakarya, Neslihan/0000-0001-7909-6161",,,,,25,52,55,1,18,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",0034-6535,1530-9142,,REV ECON STAT,Rev.

We allow for spatial dependence in emissions across countries to consider the possibility that country's emissions are affected by emissions in neighboring countries. We utilize the spatial Durbin model (SDM) and spatial lag model (SAM) estimation for the Green Solow model and also employ distribution dynamics using the nonparametric method with three different emission samples: per capita , relative , and intensities. We found that emissions are significantly influenced by the emissions of neighboring countries. These test results on SDM for per capita and SAM for intensities do not support the convergence hypothesis. However, when we control for both the individual and time-period fixed effects, for relative and intensities, SAM supports the convergence hypothesis. With the distributional dynamics approach adapting spatial-filtering and HP-filtering techniques before proceeding with the estimate of the stochastic kernel, we find that per capita and intensities indicate a strong tendency toward convergence in Asian countries over the entire period, yet relative shows dynamics with a switch toward divergence. In conclusion, the emission intensities among Asian countries strongly support the convergence to the long-run steady state of emissions as Asian economies develop. However, relative emissions in Asian countries do not converge with the long-run steady-state level of developed countries as sustainable growth paths are predicted from the theoretical Solow model.","[Evans, Paul] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, 410 Arps Hall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Kim, Ji Uk] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 156756, South Korea",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Chung Ang University,"Kim, JU (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 156756, South Korea.",jiukim@cau.ac.kr,,,,,,,42,11,11,2,36,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Several experimental studies have documented behavior that is consistent with agents exhibiting guilt averse motivations in social interactions. However, there are strategic implications of guilt aversion, which can impact economic outcomes in important ways, that have yet to be explored. I introduce a game that admits the possibility for agents to induce guilt upon others in a manner consistent with the method posited by Baumeister et al. (Psychol Bull 115:243-267, 1994). This game enables me to experimentally test whether agents attempt to exploit the guilt aversion of others by inducing guilt upon them, and whether agents are actually susceptible to this exploitation. Additionally, the design enables me to test whether agents exhibit higher degrees of trust when they are given such an opportunity to exploit the guilt aversion of others. The data suggest that agents do not attempt to fully exploit the guilt aversion of other agents by inducing guilt upon them; however, the data suggest that agents would have been susceptible to guilt induction.","[Cardella, Eric] Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Dept Energy Econ & Law, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Cardella, E (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Dept Energy Econ & Law, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",eric.cardella@ttu.edu,,,Economic Science Laboratory (ESL); National Science Foundation (NSF) [SES-0819780],Economic Science Laboratory (ESL); National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"E.

The proposed trading system takes the advantage of GA's capability to select an optimal combination of technical indicators, fundamental indicators and volatility indicators for improving out-of-sample trading performance. In our experiment, we use the daily data of 180 S&P stocks (from the period January 2009 to April 2014) to examine the profitability and the stability of the proposed GA-RRL trading system. We find that, after feeding the indicators selected by the GA into the RRL trading system, the out-of-sample trading performance improves as the number of companies with a significantly positive Sharpe ratio increases.","[Zhang, Jin; Maringer, Dietmar] Univ Basel, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Peter Merian Weg 6, Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Peter Merian Weg 6, Basel, Switzerland.",jin.zhang@unibas.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF),Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"The authors acknowledge the support provided by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) grant program.

We argue that this is not an appealing principle for collective decision making, and that bygones have necessary and substantive roles. We consider an explicitly dynamic process of social welfare orderings, and propose a dynamic constraint which is acceptable even after rejecting the principle that one should be forward-looking. It is a conjunction of two assertions: (i) the process must be dynamically consistent, which means an ex ante welfare judgment must be respected by the ex post ones and there should be no contradiction between them; (ii) the structure of a welfare judgment should be recurrent under consistent updating, in the sense that if a postulate is satisfied by an ex ante welfare judgment, then it is also satisfied by any of the ex post ones that follow this ex ante judgment. Based on this standpoint, we present a set of axioms for social welfare orderings which are recurrent under consistent updating, and characterize a set of social welfare functions which are closed under updating. With such a class of social welfare functions, we characterize the roles that can be played in the updating stage by the past and things known not to have occurred.","[Hayashi, Takashi] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Hayashi, T (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",th925@eco.utexas.edu,,,,,,,21,6,6,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2016,46.0,3.0,,,,,569,608,,10.1007/s00355-015-0929-9,0.0,,,40,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DH8CK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373020900006,0

In addition, breed, intrinsically linked to beef mountain systems, is also studied. An Error Components mixed logit model is estimated and attribute non-attendance is analytically derived. Results suggest that the mountain labelling may have a limited impact on consumption, as it is highly non-attended and its Willingness to Pay is, low even after control for non-attendance. Nevertheless, preference heterogeneity suggests a feasible niche market in Spain. In contrast, the use of breed as a differentiation claim, not currently used in Spain, could have a more immediate impact on consumers' choices. The paper finds synergies between mountain labelling and other quality schemes.","[Sanjuan, Ana I.] Govt Aragon, Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon CITA, Avda Montanana, Zaragoza 50059, Spain; [Sanjuan, Ana I.] European Commiss, IPTS JRC, C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain; [Khliji, Saqussan] IRTA Monells, Monells 17121, Spain",European Commission Joint Research Centre; IRTA,"Sanjuán, AI (通讯作者)，Govt Aragon, Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon CITA, Avda Montanana, Zaragoza 50059, Spain.;Sanjuán, AI (通讯作者)，European Commiss, IPTS JRC, C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain.",anaisabel.sanjuan@gmail.com,,,"EU-FEDER Operative Programme of Territorial Cooperation Spain France Andorra (POCTEFA), Project OTRAC","EU-FEDER Operative Programme of Territorial Cooperation Spain France Andorra (POCTEFA), Project OTRAC","This study was funded by EU-FEDER Operative Programme of Territorial Cooperation Spain France Andorra, 2007-2012 (POCTEFA), Project OTRAC.

It utilizes a random coefficient model and analyzes a cross-sectional sample of bilateral trade data for 96 countries in 2005. We expect the elasticity of trade to vary particularly with bilateral distance and bilateral tariffs due to measurement error about these factors. Indeed, the variability of coefficients is significant for these trade cost measures. The results indicate that the elasticity of trade with respect to tariffs in different countries varies relatively more than that with respect to distance. This is consistent with there being a host of sources of measurement error about bilateral tariffs (due to strategic or non-strategic mis-reporting; the potential inappropriateness of the weighting of disaggregated tariffs; etc.).","[Egger, Peter] ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, WEH E6,Weinbergstr 35, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Egger, Peter] CEPR, 77 Bastwick St, London EC1V 3PZ, England; [Egger, Peter] CESifo Grp, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Egger, Peter] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Ctr Res Globalisat & Econ Policy GEP, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Egger, Peter] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Arsenal, Object 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Prusa, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000, Czech Republic",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Ifo Institut; University of Nottingham; Charles University Prague,"Prusa, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Opletalova 26, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.",jan.prusa@ies-prague.org,,"Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",Czech Science Foundation [P402/12/0982],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"The authors acknowledge financial support from the Czech Science Foundation, Grant Number P402/12/0982.",,14,4,6,0,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We develop the concept computer control' to illustrate one dimension of change. Key features include unobtrusive, micro-level task control and an individualized experience of the labour process. We ask how social interaction occurs in a workplace characterized by computer control. Using participant observation, we examine interaction in Big Box, a computer-controlled grocery distribution facility. While a central computer orchestrates thousands of daily tasks, workers barely talk to execute the labour process. Interactions can occur within a digital arena', developed by management. Work becomes a game - engrossing workers in its outcomes - but simultaneously allowing management greater control over labour. We argue that management can construct virtual social spaces in the computer-controlled workplace. Information technology fully individualizes a repetitive task, while also offering a platform for reconstituting shared experiences of work.

Using the INKAR dataset and the GSOEP from the years 1998 to 2009, dynamic GMM panel estimations are applied to consider dynamics as well as the simultaneity between migration and regional labor market circumstances. To begin with, the influence of migration on relative wage levels is analyzed. The results show a small positive wage effect due to the overall regional migration balance. However, only domestic migration is relevant for analyzing the influence of migration on regional wage disparities. The wage effect due to domestic migration turns out to be smaller and negative. Regions seem to benefit primary from a combination of internal and foreign migration, however effects are small. Assuming that individuals usually move to high-wage regions, the negative wage effect of German migration would trigger an adjustment mechanism of wage disparities. Therefore, a second dynamic GMM panel estimation tests whether an influence of the regional wage levels on migration exists. Results show no statistically significant effects. An adjustment of existing wage disparities due to migration is not likely to occur in Germany in the next few years.","[Fendel, Tanja] IAB, Regensburgerstr 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany",,"Fendel, T (通讯作者)，IAB, Regensburgerstr 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",Tanja.Fendel@iab.de,,,,,,,54,4,4,1,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Against the tide of neoliberalism, a binding, precautionary agreement over trade in genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has emerged through the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. This Protocol exemplifies what Polanyi termed the 'self-protection of society,' the second phase of his double movement. The Protocol's final form was a product of European governments' responses to public concerns over the potential environmental and health impacts of GMOs in an unregulated global economy. This 'self-protective' turn has been manifest at regional and national scales, including in Australia. Drawing on Gramsci, I argue that this unlikely turn emerged in the context of shifting public opinion, effective anti-GMO activism, and alternative discursive framings. It took hold with European publics and governments, generating the relations of force needed to become the hegemonic framing of GMOs globally. The objectives of this paper are thus to demonstrate how a double movement has occurred in the regulation of GMOs and to use Gramsci's relations of force to explain how this double movement has nonetheless failed to challenge the underlying neoliberal basis of GMO agriculture as it exists today.","[Carroll, Myles] York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada",York University - Canada,"Carroll, M (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada.",mcarroll@yorku.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [766-2013-0649],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [grant no. 766-2013-0649].,,74,9,11,1,57,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This springs from political and socio-economic concerns about fulfilling desired fertility rates, maintaining high levels of human capital, and supporting fiscal and pension systems. This article investigates professionals addressing declining fertility through assisted reproductive technologies (ART), including doctors, demographers and economists. These professional groups have their own bodies of knowledge on how they view fertility, fecundity and the role of women in social reproduction. They can also cooperate to create issue linkages' on ART across their professional ecologies.

Rational use of time allows to convert it into other elements of human capital. Time is transforming into educational, intellectual, creative capital, students' health. The essence of the problem is the lack of understanding of students' time's role to develop their human capital. Another aspect of the problem is lack of development of conditions and practices of temporal behavior strategies' forming in higher education. The purpose of the article is empirical research's results' of students' temporal behavioral strategies' justification and interpretation. Goal achievement allows to: 1. determine the qualitative characteristics of students' temporal capital; 2. understand the reasons of inefficient use of students' time; 3. identify the educational resources to develop students' temporal capital. An empirical study is implemented by the methods of questioning of students, observation of educational practices in the Russian universities, analysis of documents. The main results of the study are evaluation the temporal resources of Russian students, finding of the dominant type of their temporal behavior strategies, discovery of link between the temporal characteristics of students and their educational, intellectual and cultural capital.","[Ambarova, Polina; Zborovsky, Garold] Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Ambarova, P (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",p.a.ambarova@urfu.ru; g.e.zborovsky@urfu.ru,"Ambarova, Polina A./R-6839-2016; Zborovsky, Garold/E-6142-2014",,Russian Science Foundation [16-18-10046] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),,,12,1,1,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,10,18,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100002,0

It is evident that the importance of remittances for the receiving economy is given not only by the relative amount of emigrants, but also by its economic level. However, the most important factor is the share of remittances on the aggregate income of the receiving country. The aim of this study is to analyze the growth of the aggregate consumption in terms of remittance flows. To achieve this objective, there is primarily used panel data regression. To avoid great differences in economic conditions across the countries with high share of remittances on their national income, the regression was driven on chosen Asian economies only. The results confirm the statistical significance of the growth of remittances on the aggregate consumption growth in panel regression, the same result was obtained from the simple regression with robust estimations. These findings concurrently support the idea that remittance flows should be more considered.","[Badura, Ondrej] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic; [Zavacka, Jana] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Syst Engn, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Technical University of Ostrava,"Badura, O (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",ondrej.badura@vsb.cz; jana.zavacka1@vsb.cz,"Závacká, Jana/L-2475-2015",,,,,,10,1,1,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,13,18,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500003,0

We find that the actual hourly market design is inadequate to achieve an efficient solution in the presence of a large and increasing share of RES. It is not conducive to catalyzing the correct price signal for future investments and does not take into account welfare considerations. Our proposal for a new market design is based on three main pillars. We state pro-competitive incentives to CTS participation in the market. We take into full account the opportunity cost of RES for society and propose correct price signals on the demand side through an optimal Ramsey pricing scheme. We show an empirical application to the Italian electricity market, using empirical measures of LCOE for RES and empirical estimation of heterogeneous buyers' behavior. The results show improvement in efficiency and welfare in the Italian electricity market with respect to the existing zonal market prices for suppliers and uniform price for buyers.","[Bigerna, Simona; Bollino, Carlo Andrea] Imperial Coll Business Sch, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London,"Bollino, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.",carloandrea.bollino@unipg.it,,"Bollino, Carlo Andrea/0000-0002-7751-7089",,,,,23,8,8,1,10,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2016,37.0,,,,2,,51,68,,10.5547/01956574.37.SI2.sbig,0.0,,,18,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EY5JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000404014600006,0

One of the most important areas which affects the daily operations of a company includes effects that capital structure can have on tax liability of a company. It is because of the differences in the tax treatment of fundamental capital structure categories as well as the creditor's perception of a company which is the groundwork for making a decision whether to approve funds allocation necessary to finance business activities. That is the reason why it is important to determine the appropriate ratio of own and borrowed funds, which is often characterised by tendency of finding optimal value that is not always easy to identify because it can be done in different ways. As the basis for determining the optimal value, dichotomous business continuity variable is used because profitability is not necessarily a reliable indicator of real value and stability of a company. Furthermore, the next question that arises is - what distinguishes companies which do not have an optimal capital structure from those companies that have an optimal capital structure? The aim of this research is to, by applying statistical methodology, determine which financial ratios represent key distinctive characteristics of the two groups of companies. Sample is comprised of small and medium enterprises based in Republic of Croatia. They are divided in two subsamples first subsample includes companies which have had optimal capital structure and second subsample includes companies which haven't had optimal capital structure.

The analysis is focused on the influence of selected factors for demand in transport services. Increase or decrease of transport volume in rail passenger transport depends on those factors. Price elasticity of demand for transport services is calculated as ratio of the changes of transport volume and the change of ticket price in the specified period. Income elasticity for demand of transport services in rail passenger transport expresses the percentage change of demand to percentage change of income. By the income elasticity we will analyze the dependence of transport performance in rail passenger transport from population income in Slovakia in the specified period.

We extend this model by introducing interest rates (prices on lines of credit), both as a means to incentivize credit issuance and to provide a framework for modeling networks of financial relationships. Including interest rates poses a new constraint on transactions, as intermediaries will route payments only if the interest received covers any interest paid. We account for these constraints in an efficient algorithm for finding the maximum transaction flow between two agents in a financial network. There are generally many feasible payment paths serving a given transaction, and we show that the policy for selecting among such paths can have a substantial effect on liquidity, as measured by steady-state probability of transaction success. Finally, we consider the situation where the transaction source can choose among heuristic path selection mechanisms, in order to maximize their payoff. Through empirical game-theoretic analysis, we find that routing is inefficient due to the positive externality of choices promoting network liquidity. However, agent choices do reflect some consideration of overall network liquidity, in addition to their own interest payments.","[Cheng, Frank; Liu, Junming; Amin, Kareem; Wellman, Michael P.] Univ Michigan, Comp Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Cheng, F (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Comp Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",frcheng@umich.edu; liujm@umich.edu; amkareem@umich.edu; wellman@umich.edu,"Wellman, Michael/AAQ-7063-2020; Wang, Yiping/IZQ-2052-2023","Wellman, Michael/0000-0002-1691-6844;",,,,,16,7,9,0,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,721,738,,10.1145/2940716.2940738,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300063,0

These assumptions are related to the probabilistic structure of the marriage insurance model and the rate of interest, which for the second-order-basis are 'realistic' and for the first-order-basis are deliberately chosen.

Determining an optimal set of exchanges is theoretically and empirically hard. Traditionally, exchanges took place in cycles, with each participating patient-donor pair both giving and receiving a kidney. The recent introduction of chains, where a donor without a paired patient triggers a sequence of donations without requiring a kidney in return, increased the efficacy of fielded kidney exchanges-while also dramatically raising the empirical computational hardness of clearing the market in practice. While chains can be quite long, unbounded-length chains are not desirable: planned donations can fail before transplant for a variety of reasons, and the failure of a single donation causes the rest of that chain to fail, so parallel shorter chains are better in practice. In this paper, we address the tractable clearing of kidney exchanges with short cycles and chains that are long but bounded. This corresponds to the practice at most modern fielded kidney exchanges. We introduce three new integer programming formulations, two of which are compact. Furthermore, one of these models has a linear programming relaxation that is exactly as tight as the previous tightest formulation (which was not compact) for instances in which each donor has a paired patient. On real data from the UNOS nationwide exchange in the United States and the NLDKSS nationwide exchange in the United Kingdom, as well as on generated realistic large-scale data, we show that our new models are competitive with all existing solvers-in many cases outperforming all other solvers by orders of magnitude. Finally, we note that our position-indexed chain-edge formulation can be modified in a straightforward way to take post-match edge failure into account, under the restriction that edges have equal probabilities of failure. Post-match edge failure is a primary source of inefficiency in presently-fielded kidney exchanges. We show how to implement such failure-aware matching in our model, and also extend the state-of-the-art general branch-and-price-based non-compact formulation for the failure-aware problem to run its pricing problem in polynomial time.","[Dickerson, John P.; Plaut, Benjamin; Sandholm, Tuomas] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Manlove, David F.; Trimble, James] Univ Glasgow, Sch Comp Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",Carnegie Mellon University; University of Glasgow,"Dickerson, JP (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",dickerson@cs.cmu.edu; david.manlove@glasgow.ac.uk; bplaut@stanford.edu; sandholm@cs.cmu.edu; james.trimble@yahoo.co.uk,"Plaut, Benjamin/JUU-2164-2023","Manlove, David/0000-0001-6754-7308",EPSRC [EP/K010042/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,40,43,51,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,25,42,,10.1145/2940716.2940759,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,"Bronze, Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300005,0

Using the Pharma retailer-stockist (b2b) relationship in the unorganized sector of the Indian pharmaceutical market as the empirical setting, the findings from a qualitative analysis show that despite the absence of proactive brand building activities by stockists, they created strong brand equity. The findings show that in the absence of any brand building activities, stockists' sales representatives play an important role in creating stockist brand awareness. Rational and emotional brand associations are created 1) directly by the services provided by stockists which includes product availability, deliverability, accuracy in billing and batch numbers, credit facilities and discounts, handling issues such as product expiry, etc., and, 2) indirectly by the services provided by stockists' sales representatives which includes their frequency of visits, proactive customer orientation than sales orientation, fulfilling commitments, relationship with the retailers, etc.","[Divakaran, Pradeep Kumar Ponnamma] ESC Rennes Sch Business, Dept Mkt, 2 Rue Robert dArbrissel CS 76522, F-35065 Rennes, France",ESC Rennes School of Business; Universite de Rennes,"Divakaran, PKP (通讯作者)，ESC Rennes Sch Business, Dept Mkt, 2 Rue Robert dArbrissel CS 76522, F-35065 Rennes, France.",pradeep.divakaran@esc-rennes.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1512,1521,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100150,0

This politico-economic order was established to serve the interests of ruling groups and establish the major features of states, political regimes, and market economies. It provided numerous negative incentives for governing the economy and the state due to the unconstrained rent-seeking behavior of major actors. Policy reform programs revealed these institutions to be incompatible with the priorities of modernization, and efforts to resolve these contradictions through a number of partial and compromise solutions often worsened the situation vis-a-vis preservation of the status quo. The ruling groups lack incentives for institutional changes, which could undermine their political and economic dominance, and are caught in a vicious circle: reforms often result in minor returns or cause unintended and undesired consequences.

Selected economic-actuarial relations among given insurance variables are described by means of the dynamic linear system of simultaneous equations. In particular, the provision for outstanding claims, the provision for unearned premium, the other (marginal) technical provisions, the acquisition and administrative expenses, the benefit expenses, and their mutual interactions are studied in greater detail. The suggested econometric model is estimated, statistically verified, and interpreted with special regard to the actuarial point of view. The proposed modelling scheme can be further employed for prognosing the considered non-life technical provisions. Particularly, these forecasts can be taken into account by non-life insurance companies in their internal calculations (e.g. for financial planning purposes, for verifying the sufficiency of non-life technical provisions, or for liability adequacy tests LAT) or by an insurance regulator (e.g. for performing stress tests). Alternatively, this approach might motivate development of an internal model applicable in the Solvency II framework. Both deterministic and randomly generated scenarios are analysed; they are capable of delivering relevant outputs for formulating various recommendations and conclusions.","[Hendrych, Radek; Cipra, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Hendrych, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic.",hendrych@karlin.mff.cuni.cz; cipra@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,"Cipra, Tomáš/N-8668-2019; Hendrych, Radek/O-8266-2017; Hendrych, Radek/HJH-3526-2023; Cipra, Tomáš/P-4882-2017","Cipra, Tomáš/0000-0003-0604-324X; Hendrych, Radek/0000-0003-3222-3148; Hendrych, Radek/0000-0003-3222-3148; Cipra, Tomáš/0000-0003-0604-324X",,,,,11,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,554,563,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100055,0

In this the area the statistics provides important tools for time series analysis in empirical level. However it is certainly useful to deal with the mathematical background of basic notions. It turns out that the functional analysis brings the efficient access to study structures, spaces and operators that are extensively used in Box Jenkins methodology. The general linear process is defined by the help of the linear filter. This filter is an operator defined by a power series in the variable B (it denotes the lag operator). It is important to explain the convergence of this series and to define corresponded spaces in which these objects exist. The main goal is to describe the invertibility of the general linear process in general level, not only, as is usual, for polynomial or geometrical lag structures. It is done by the help of so called holomorphic functional calculus applied on the lag operator. The structure in background of this is a certain Banach algebra and its representation is given as well.","[Horsky, Richard] Univ Econ, Dept Math, Ekon 957, Prague 4, Czech Republic",,"Horsky, R (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Math, Ekon 957, Prague 4, Czech Republic.",rhorsky@vse.cz,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,301,306,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500052,0

We place the emphasis primarily on their growth and innovation potential, which significantly impacts on increasing of competitiveness of different sectors. Start-ups and emerging businesses are an integral component of a dynamic and complex business environment in each country. Many of them contribute to the development of the sector in which they operate high added value and development of competitiveness primarily at regional and global levels. In the paper we point out the examination of production and economic preconditions that contribute to the growth of competitiveness of enterprises in the sector in which they operate and in which they are exposed, during their existence, to a constantly changing business environment. The object of this research is also to highlight the impact of factors from external but also internal environments.
